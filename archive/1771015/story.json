Her eyes fluttered open, Molly chuckled and sat up, stretching her large frame, looking around at the flatland plains in which she was allowed to sleep on. Being 800ft. tall was quite inconvenient if she were to ever try and reside within the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly changed from her pajama's into her normal clothing, doing it fast as not to give the perverts watching satisfaction. As she made sure her clothing was in proper place, she couldn't help but feel a little guilty. It must've cost millions of dollars and a vast amount of resources to give her the necessities such as food and clothing. Even though she couldn't help it, being born with, as the doctors called it, a 'defect'. She was born normal sized, but rapidly through her youth, she reached heights no normal person could ever achieve. Scientists guessed it was a combination of isolated mutation and just shitty luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Molly looked down, her family resting in a small home beside her. She was always first to get up, and sh made sure to never bother them if they were asleep. That was qute hard, as she walked away, the orange goth cringed as with each footstep, she generated a quake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Molly need to do today?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While she didn't really participate much. (No one could see her raising her hand.) She was able to do the work via a custom made tablet just for her. As she arrived she kept quiet and to herself, the anti social girl felt somewhat saddened. She was greeted by both guys and girls alike, some who wanted to be friends others who wanted to see her breasts, the perverts that they were. Others just being polite. \"Hi...\" was all she could say back and it was really soft, even for her size, her wave was really all that indicated she was returning the greeting. She sat down outside and got out her tablet, the day was going by smoothly and 'normal' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAuthor's note: I would like to apologize to AwesomeX18 if I have done his OC wrong.

It wasn't really anyone's fault, her voice was just quite loud.  She came to her friend's home closest to where she sleeps.  This happened to be her closest male friend, Jack.  He was a bit quirky, but always has a joke (for better or worse) in store for his friends.  Add that to his strange voices and faces, you have a clown that doesn't wear make-up.  She tapped lightly on the roof above his room, which was connected to the deck by a sliding door.  He came put onto the deck, looking up into the air.  \"Oh, good.  I thought it was the other 800 foot girl that wears bright orange all the time.  I don't think she likes me so much.\" Molly smiled and held out her hand to the deck.  \"Get on, or do you want me to stop liking you so much?\" He jumped the railing and landed on her palm.  She brought him up to her face.  The first time he met Molly, he was scared stiff by how huge she was.  In comparison, he could basically stretch out and possibly touch both sides of her fingernail.  She looked at him.  Discovering he looked the same as usual with his black hair that went where it pleased, untamed by comb or brush and normal sweatshirt and jeans he wears besides summer and the hotter part of spring.  She smiled and moved on to Vanessa, her friend who she would relate most to.  She tapped on her roof, and she came out into her backyard.  Luckily, the two she had picked up lived just outside of town.  Vanessa was basically Jack's opposite.  She took great care in her appearance.  Taking a while to perfect her hair, make-up and clothes.  She was serious, with her long blond hair and blue eyes.  She and Jack argue frequently, usually causing  Molly to laugh about why they even argue.  Her third friend, Harriet, lived in the middle of the town, so Vanessa sent her a text to get outside of town.  They wait and.....</span></div></div>",

Her very being itself was a danger if she accidentally stepped on someone or something, which she never did on purpose. She felt a surge in her mind upon this very thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took you long enough little one.\" Molly noticed the world turn a bright blue around her, like one of those anime's where the world freezes in time. But...this was real. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you, where are you, what are-?\" She took a step back then froze in fear. \"NO!!\" She had just stepped on the small home her family lived in, then she looked down to her surprise (And relief) no one was harmed nothing was destroyed, her shoe phased right through the house turning transparent. \"What the-?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry child, you couldn't hurt anyone or destroy anything even if you wanted to, watch.\" A massive explosion like a nuke being set off could be seen in the distance, yet nothing was destroyed, nothing harmed the explosion was there, Molly felt it, she felt the impact it had like a shockwave yet...no consequences outside of the natural impact. \"May have over done it for a mere demonstration there.\" The voice said calmly. \"Well as you can see nothing is harmed. So please walk as much as you'd like.\" Molly did so, slowly at first but then broke into a run, then a sprint, then a jump, he had been so long since she could move freely she had forgotten what a joy it was. A soft giggle or chuckle could be heard now and then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Molly stopped. \"I'm so sorry I didn't mean to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please play all you wish.\" The voice echoed inside her head. \"I am very patent and this 'spell' of mine won't wear off till I want it to. Everything is frozen, time itself has stopped. You could be here for years and not even a second would pass in your world. Now for some answers although vauge, who am I? I have no name, where am I...you wouldn't be able to see me child I'm far too big for you to see and if I wasn't as powerful as I am....well lets just say microscopic is an understatement for our comparison to how small you are.

Her yawn echoed across the planet, as did the following booms generated by the slightest of movements. Most people could see only an unfathomable wall of orange outlined with soft skin. This was the visage of Molly, a teenage girl who stood at a towering 1000 miles tall. She slowly stood up to her full height, casting a shadow halfway around the world. She only wore a set of tight, matching orange bra and panties, her pale yet fully-figured form filling the sky. As she looked around, a few things crossed her mind, her morning checklist, something she had come to do ever since she became a towering teen.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n1. Don\u2019t step on anything...<br>\r\n2. I need a bath...<br>\r\n3. Visit Boyfriend. Haven\u2019t seen him in a while.<br>\r\n4. Give that government man a piece of my mind, cutting off my supply rations like that...<br>\r\n5. Do daily world-walk around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmmm...Might as well take that bath first, that way I\u2019ll be set for the rest of the day.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive \u2018anti-goth\u2019 goth girl, known to the rest of the world as Mega Molly, slowly moved towards the Atlantic Ocean, a step\u2019s distance away to the teen. With a gentle step, the girl had reached the seemingly endless plain of water, her footfall causing small quakes to resound throughout the surrounding area. Upon reaching the cool waters, Molly slowly sat down, submerging as much of her enormous frame as possible into the ocean, still wearing her trademark bright orange underwear that matched the color of her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh, this never gets old,\u201d she sighed contently. \u201cSorry about this, fish, but a girl\u2019s gotta bathe somehow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly dipped her hands into the ocean and lifted them, picking up millions of gallons of salt water and even chunks of the sandbed at the bottom. She poured it across her body, the dirt that had been captured by her titanic frame washing off with the waves. She repeated this a few more times then stood back, allowing herself to drip-dry. A few more minutes later, she was ready for her day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, I could visit Allen now...or go to that mean old government man....or, my walk around the planet. Yep, I think I\u2019ll go with that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClad in her form-fitting underwear, The massive Molly began walking, her footsteps creating quakes around the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay everyone...\u201dShe whispered, her voice timid, yet thunderous to the small people far below. \u201cI\u2019m...gonna start walking now. Y\u2019know, my daily tour of the planet. Prepare yourselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people of Earth began to make their daily preparations, mainly activating the various shock-absorbing technologies to lessen the effects of Molly\u2019s daily stroll. Luckily for the inhabitants of the world, Molly had made sure to always follow a certain path in her walks, making sure to step in the imprints she had made in the planet during her first worldwide tour, making only certain areas of the globe actually vulnerable to the aftershocks produced by her footfalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool, so, here I go...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick movement, Molly stepped onto the nearest imprint of her foot, now bringing her near the European coast. The next imprint was on the southern half of the continent, which she quickly matched her sole with as well. However, Molly\u2019s ocean romp would come to an end on her next step as she took her body onto land once again, moving onto northern Italy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly crossed the small country, going over England, France, and through Europe with minimal damage. She went around the coast of Asia in a few minutes, and rounded around Africa next. With each step, powerful shockwaves shook the planet, but everyone was prepared. Mostly, they were in awe. Her entire foot could devastate the world if she so desired, but Molly was too kindhearted to let such a thing happen. Ever since she was young, the girl was the most gentle giantess ever. When she was five and over a hundred feet tall, she\u2019d let the children use her as a playground when she accidentally crushed the first one. When she was thirteen and peaking in puberty, at 1000ft. high, she still went to school, and was as gentle as ever. But nearing the age of 18, her growth had exponentiated, spiraling her higher and higher. Scientists claimed that she\u2019d be going giga by the time she was 21. However, these were only estimates, and being only now 17, Molly\u2019s body was rearing itself to prove these scientists wrong, her form already in the \u201cGiga\u201d range now that she was an astounding 1000 miles tall. Luckily for her, Molly was given a pair of underwear when she first entered high school, the current bright orange bra and panties she wore to this day. These clothes were not supposed to enlarge along with her body, but for some reason that even the world\u2019s top scientists couldn\u2019t comprehend, they grew perfectly along with her body, both to accommodate her height and her blooming features, mainly her impressive chest and curvy form. Some believed Molly\u2019s love of the underwear and the fact that they complimented her goth-like nature perfectly may be the reason why they continue to grow, but nothing has been proven in terms of her possessing the ability of \u201cmacrokinesis\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, Molly eventually arrived back in the United States a few minutes later, feeling accomplished at her latest world tour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay...check that off the list.\u201dShe mumbled to herself, gently tapping her foot against the planet as she began thinking. No signs of trouble across the globe, the countries seemed to be in perfect order. That was the thing with Molly\u2019s presence, it had lessened the threat of war across the globe. Warring countries were now allies, as if seeing her made everything calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think I\u2019ll talk to that government man next...<br>\r\nShe approached the coast of America, her bare feet playfully drumming along the edges of beaches, her toes towering walls of flesh, and her feet emitting a bit of stench onto land, but the small people didn\u2019t mind.\u201dErm...Mr. Cross?\u201dShe called out for the government official that she had to meet on a daily basis.\u201dI...I would like to speak with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course she would get no reply. She was simply too big. Instead, she sat down and held out her open palm in wait for a tiny jet that would bear the man. After a few minutes of waiting, a small plane landed on the edge of her hand, a few tiny mites walking onto her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, well, well, if it isn\u2019t miss \u2018Mega Molly\u2019 herself,\u201d the government official laughed. \u201cI gotta say, my kids really love that nickname of yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it wasn\u2019t my idea, but it does have a nice ring to it,\u201d the titaness whispered. \u201cAnyways, I really have to talk to you about...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me guess, about your rations, right?\u201d Mr. Cross interrupted. \u201cSorry kid, I hate to break it to ya, but you\u2019re getting too big to feed. We regular people gotta eat too, ya know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could\u2019ve at least told me this earlier!\u201d Molly retorted. \u201cNow what am I going to do for food?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeats me kid, all I know is that you\u2019re on your own now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re...going to let me starve?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, of course not. That\u2019s why I brought these science guys with me,\u201d he explained as he motioned for his companions to draw nearer. \u201cTell \u2018em guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMolly,\u201d one of them began, \u201cdo you remember the incident from many years ago? You know what we mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you mean THAT incident? I sorta do, but I haven\u2019t seen my older brother in years. Why he ran after that giant jogging girl is beyond me...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it sort of concerns that incident...\u201dOne said.\u201dEver since you grew, your entire body chemistry has changed. You eat, yet you require not to. How long has it been since you\u2019ve actually felt your stomach empty or growl with hunger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pondered it.\u201dUm...never, actually.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly. Look at you! You don\u2019t even need to breathe! You\u2019ve evolved beyond human needs. And I think it\u2019s for the better of our food sources if you stop eating...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...but I\u2019ll miss the taste of oranges, I guess...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll get used to it.\u201dThe scientists condoned her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so...\u201dHer massive head drooped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Molly, don\u2019t be so glum.\u201dMr. Cross chuckled as he and the scientists began boarding the jet.\u201dHow about I bring my kids tomorrow? They haven\u2019t seen you in forever!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like that very much, Mr. Cross.\u201dShe allowed a smile to play at her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWonderful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, they took off, leaving Molly only one task left on her to-do list. Her eyes turned to a small town on the edge of the country...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey cutie-kins!\u201d the orange-haired girl waved as she took a step towards her hometown. \u201cI\u2019m coming to see you!\u201d In just another few seconds, Molly had happily stomped her away across the continent, bringing her feet in a familiar position on both sides of the small village. \u201cSpiral-cutie, where are you?\u201d she sweetly asked. \u201cI can barely see people these days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother few seconds passed before an orange flare exploded near her right big toe, a familiar signal that the two had decided on long ago.</span></div></div>",

Alright, don\u2019t move now...\u201d Slowly, Molly bent downwards as carefully as possible, trying to make sure high winds wouldn\u2019t be stirred up by her massive frame. Next, as the rest of the country received an amazing view of her cleavage, she gently picked up a small speck with her index finger and thumb, depositing the mite on her palm before standing up once more. \u201cHey there, hottie,\u201d the orange goddess smiled down at her normal-sized boyfriend. \u201cEither you\u2019ve gotten smaller or I\u2019ve gotten bigger since I last saw you...and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve grown an inch since then...\u201d she teased, knowing full well her body had been packing on the size recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe speck smirked, even though she wouldn\u2019t be able to see it, the playfulness in his voice made her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve always been big, a trait of yours that I just love.\u201dAlan Spiral replied by cupping his hands around his mouth and shouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, stop it...\u201dShe blushed a tad. They had been steady for two or three years down, back when Molly was much closer to the ground at only a hundred miles tall. Molly liked that he cared more than her body, but her quiet personality. She did the same, as she could not properly see him, she had to judge people by their words. For the next several hours they spoke as they always did until the sun began to settle across the world. Molly lowered him back down and waved a kiss goodbye before heading back out to see for sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay...to-do list for tomorrow...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>1. Don\u2019t step on anything...<br>\r\n2. Gotta keep in shape, maybe exercise.<br>\r\n3. Try to reach my brother again. I know I won\u2019t, but I still gotta try. Last time I did it was a few months ago. He\u2019d probably freak if he knew how big I was now, but then again, he and Spiral were best friends, so...<br>\r\n4. Remember to visit Mr. Cross and his family.<br>\r\n5. Do daily world-walk around.<br>\r\n6. Make sure to stay in water as much as possible. I\u2019m due for a big one any day now.<br>\r\n7. Do 1-5 before 6 possibly happens. Well, maybe just 1-4.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorks for me,\u201d Molly smiled as she laid down on her makeshift bed in the world\u2019s seas. \u201cLater guys, catch you tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she rested, her snores gently lulled the remainder of the waking world to sleep, echoing across the solar system in their calmness. Within eight hours time, the sun peeked itself over the curvature of the world, it\u2019s light awakening the goddess of a teen to a new day. She yawned and stood up, stretching to her full height to work out any kinks or sore muscles that had built up in her body overnight.\u201dAlright...\u201dShe mused, remembering the list she had created last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I should do some morning exercises. Can\u2019t keep myself this pretty without doing anything...\u201dShe blushed to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laid down on her back, holding her hands behind her head. Slowly she began lifting her torso upper, performing crunches and toning her already slim stomach. Just the slightest movement from her created tremors, and her gasping breath as she reached the higher number in crunches generated heat that changed the temperature across the world that day, leaving some places sweltering. Once she was done with that, Molly moved onto push-ups, lowering herself down then pushing right back up with her arms. But she wasn\u2019t actually moving herself away from the earth, in fact she was pushing the earth down from herself, her strength and size alone enough to move the planet out of it\u2019s orbit momentarily as she continued her work out. She stood back up and took in a deep breath to fill her lungs, when in reality she wasn\u2019t tired at all. Even after performing over a hundred reps for the previous two exercises, her muscles didn\u2019t even burn. She truly was beyond mundane things such as keeping up ones own body, but she liked to do it, helped her remember what it was like when she was small and human. Now, she was onto her last exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her back facing the United States, Molly slowly bent at her knees, putting her full weight into her legs as she did squats, slowly moving down, then moving back up, repeating it. As she performed this task, many people gazed up in awe at one thing: Her butt. Every time she bent down, each cheek, easily 200 miles in size, would fill the sky with orange fabric stretching taunt across her behind, then to rise up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay...done.\u201dMolly said after another hundred squats, not even out of breath. She turned around to her home country, smile on her lips, and hands on her hips.\u201dMr. Cross! I bet your little kids are ready for a visit from the Mega Molly Monster!\u201dShe chuckled as she stepped onto land, making sure her massive bare feet collided with empty countryside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn only a few steps, Molly had reached the same spot she was in the day before, extending her hand to await the arrival of the government agent. A few minutes later, the same jet made its descent on her palm, several small dust mites exiting the aircraft soon afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright kids, just remember to be careful,\u201d Mr. Cross told his two children, a boy and a girl, as they stepped on to the seemingly endless skin landscape before them. \u201cDon\u2019t want you two to get lost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I could lose them on myself,\u201d the goth girl laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMega Molly!\u201d the two called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi guys! How\u2019ve you been?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoooooooood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s great. Haven\u2019t seen you guys in a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got bigger!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, just a couple miles, but yes, I did. The Mega Molly Monster is still growing!\u201d she added with a playful roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids laughed as they smiled up at the towering girl, all three of them enjoying the visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright guys, that\u2019s enough. C\u2019mon, we don\u2019t wanna bother her,\u201d Mr. Cross alerted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww, but we just got here!\u201d they pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now, it\u2019s fine. You can always see me on TV,\u201d Molly reminded them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not the same...Well, bye Mega Molly!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBye guys! Have a safe trip back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey cheered to her as they re-boarded the jet, their short visit ended as it took off. Molly turned to the rest of the country as she prepared for the next item on her list.\u201dHey bro! I\u2019m looking for ya!\u201dShe started walking, only a single footstep taking her to the location of where her small sibling might be. It had been years since she saw him last, and he\u2019d probably be amazed at how she\u2019s grown, but he always did enjoy having a giantess as a sister. Molly knelt down slowly, her eyes scanning the ground, roving over mountains that weren\u2019t even comparable to her toes, over cities that could fit into the palm of her hand with plenty of room to spare, and fields and fields of green grass. Eventually she stopped at her hometown.\u201dBro...you down there?\u201dShe whispered, tapping the ground gently with her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the signature orange flare replied right where the finger was. She moved it forward, allowing the heat and oil glands of her skin to stick her brother to the pad of her forefinger. She brought it slowly up to her face, eying a mite of living dirt on the landscape of skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, AX.\u201dShe whispered his nickname.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou only found me because I wanted to be found,\u201d he replied back. \u201cOtherwise, you would\u2019ve never found me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I haven\u2019t found you for years!\u201d she pouted. \u201cJust where have you been all these years?! Last time I saw you was with...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUpupupupupupup! Don\u2019t you say it!\u201d he quickly hushed her. \u201cYou know you\u2019re not supposed to discuss it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, stupid government secrecy...\u201d Molly sighed. \u201cWell, what can you tell me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say that 1) We\u2019re still together...technically, 2) She\u2019s still growing, and 3) She\u2019s still wearing what you last saw her in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo if she\u2019s still growing...then how did you get back here?\u201d his sister wanted to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, when you get larger, let\u2019s just say you develop certain powers...Wait, why am I telling you this again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re a blabbermouth!\u201d the titaness chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa ha, very funny Mol,\u201d her older brother sighed. \u201cAnyways, you\u2019ve certainly gotten bigger since last I saw you. You were, what, only a couple hundred feet then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, and now I\u2019m a solid 1000 miles of me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I see...So that means now that you\u2019re a literally bigger idiot,\u201d he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I might just accidentally squeeze my finger...\u201d Molly teased.</span></div></div>",

Very funny,\u201d AX said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep it up bro, and I\u2019ll tell the whole world your actual name...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...That...won\u2019t be necessary...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKidding!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew that...Anyways, I\u2019m actually impressed with how huge you are.

You\u2019ll still get to interact with everyone, and you\u2019ll have tons and tons of room to be you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled her eyes.\u201dInteract with everyone? I\u2019d just end up crushing the planet. And I haven\u2019t been able to be me since....forever.\u201dShe sighed. She always had to be careful, always to be under watch and scrutiny, or somebody would get hurt from her massive size. This was one of the factors that had lead to her timid demeanor, yet also for her kindness as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, don\u2019t get all depressed on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou so are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre not!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTotally are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will crush you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou love me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly let out a little laugh, a thunderous boom that shook the world a little.\u201dYeah, you\u2019re right, I do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some more chatting, Molly finally settled AX back on solid ground, walking away with his words in mind:\u201dLet loose a little! The world can take it...I think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed as she stepped back into the ocean.\u201dBut...how? Maybe a walk\u2019ll help me think straight...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly looked out at the world, eyeing the nearest imprint for her daily walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, hey, everyone...\u201d she said timidly, her thunderous voice carrying across the globe. \u201cI\u2019m gonna start walking now, so prepare yourselves. Daily stroll across the planet and all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goth girl then began to stride towards her nearest footprint, making sure to align her foot perfectly with it before stepping down on the coast of the United States. Slowly, the orange-clad goddess began to walk once again, her every footfall causing the land to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust let loose a bit... Molly told herself. Just...let myself go...Just...let loose...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs these thoughts resounded throughout her mind, Molly suddenly felt a familiar pulsing sensation echo throughout her body. Unfortunately, the anti-goth goth was still lost in thought, not realizing she was about to start growing in the middle of her next step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her eyes closed and her mind wandering, the orange giantess shot up in height, quickly leaving a thousand miles behind, her much larger foot landing in what once was her footprint, creating a even bigger print and destroying a good portion of the US\u2019s east coast. Still she continued walking, she had mentally memorized the location of her footsteps, but as she grew, destruction would only follow. She came across Canada and devastated the center of it as she neared 2000 miles tall, and yet her size upgrade persisted. This continued on until she had finished her walk around the world, leaving even larger craters, destroyed landscapes, and Molly at an even bigger 5000 miles tall, her size powerful enough to rival the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly she opened her eyes, still thinking of ways to let loose and simply be a normal teen, but that wouldn\u2019t happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I...get bigger?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly looked out at the planet before her, viewing that her vantage point of the world was now radically different, seeing the curvature of the planet now. As she stared out at the globe, she saw massive footprints all across the planet, each of them had devastated a large area of former human life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I do all this?!\u201d she whispered, her voice now a godlike boom even in a soft voice. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry everyone! I didn\u2019t mean to do anything. I didn\u2019t even realize I was growing! I promise to stay in the ocean from now on! I\u2019m sorry once more, and I\u2019ll leave the Earth when I\u2019m bigger...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orange giga lifted her mighty foot from the ground, taking her first aware step as a 5000 mile titaness, the impact of her foot shaking the planet to its core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate to say this, but for once, I can\u2019t wait to get even bigger...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly sat down, her all-encompassing butt rattling the planet once it made contact with the ground. She had found the large ocean a tad smaller, leaving her maneuverability lessened even further. With a sigh she leaned down with her hand supporting her chin, utterly downcast and almost on the verge of crying. But she held them back, knowing that they would probably cause a flooding along the coast of some countries, adding to the destruction she\u2019s already caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just wanna be normal...and do something fun that won\u2019t hurt people...\u201dShe sadly whispered to herself, but her magnified voice carried it to ears all over the world. People did feel genuinely sorry for the orange goddess.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWhy am I the one who always has to suffer like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her daily checklist complete and still down over all the chaos she had caused with her latest unexpected spurt, Molly gently stretched her massive frame across the oceans, making sure her body would not crash into any landmasses as she rested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to bed everyone,\u201d she whispered, her voice easily carrying across the globe. \u201cGoodnight, and I\u2019m once again sorry for all I did. No more walks around the globe for me starting tomorrow; I don\u2019t want anyone else getting hurt because of my size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a heavy sigh, the orange goth slowly fell asleep, her gentle snoring still soothing the masses of the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Molly slept on, the rest of the world worried for what could be the fate of the orange giantess. Would she still be as kind as ever, or would her newest size lead to a change in personality? Instantly videos sprang up across the globe of her growing and destroying continents, some people criticizing her and creating anti-Molly groups, others doing the exact opposite; A Molly support group, giving funding for the giant goth to help her. Either way, most of it came down to a draw, half hated her, half loved her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly awoke with a content yawn, her sleep incredibly peaceful despite her actions the previous night. But when she had rubbed the remnants of dreams from her eyes, guilt had overcome the pit of her stomach once more. Her mood was downed almost immediately the moment she awoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cOkay...\u201dShe whispered half-heartedly to herself.\u201dLet\u2019s see what my to do list for today is...\u201dShe went over it in her head.<br>\r\n1. Don\u2019t step on anything...<br>\r\n2. Avoid doing anything...no walking around the world!<br>\r\n3. Maybe talk to Mr. Cross? See the damage I\u2019ve done...<br>\r\n4. Oh....class field trip!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt instantly came to her. Despite her gargantuan and intimidating size, Molly still needed some form of education. So, the school district that she attended when she was smaller would send a teacher to speak with her on various subjects from day to day. It had been planned almost a month ago, but the teacher, Mrs. Wight, would be bringing her class with her, some kids Molly hadn\u2019t seen in some time, and let them have a little....field trip. It was a discussion of the human anatomy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, I totally forgot!\u201d Molly said aloud. \u201cWe have that field trip today to...me! I gotta get over there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure to move as slowly and gently as possible, Molly slowly picked herself off of the ground and proceeded to take one monumental step towards her hometown. Despite her cautionary tactics, her foot still caused tremendous shockwaves to echo throughout the continental United States, though not as bad as if she had took a normal step. Placing her toes at the edge of the coast, Molly\u2019s beautiful form towered impressively over the country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey everyone, I remembered!\u201d she smiled. \u201cUmm, I guess we start with my toes and work our way up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with her superior vision, all Molly could see was a group of thirty or so microscopic mites clustered around the edge of her pinky toe. She could only fathom how massive it was to them, a wall of flesh taller than the tallest mountain, and beyond that, a titaness stretching beyond the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright class,\u201dMrs. Wight tapped Molly\u2019s toe, her hand patting the soft flesh.\u201dWe\u2019ll be starting right here. Now, can anyone tell me the scientific term for toes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMrs. Wight?\u201dOne student asked, raising her hand, the other pinching her nose.\u201dDo we have to? I mean...her feet utterly reek.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Susan, we can\u2019t expect Molly to keep herself utterly 100% clean, with her being 5000 miles tall and all. Plus, you would think you, along with the rest of the planet, would have grown accustomed to her scents by now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl rolled her eyes at her teacher\u2019s lecture. She was never a fan of Molly, always picked on her back when Molly was smaller and could communicate properly with them without blowing their eardrums with her booming voice. The girl in question, Susan Sims, Called her \u2018The Fat Country\u2019 or \u2018Titan Tits\u2019 or even \u2018Mountain Ass\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes everybody have their safety gear equipped?\u201dMrs. Wight continued. Every student had a parachute pack, in case they fell off, a buzzer to warn others, and a speakerphone to speak with Molly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, thirty pairs of hands went to Molly\u2019s pinky toe, their small touches tickling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, careful guys!\u201d she giggled. \u201cI\u2019m ticklish, so be careful!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I see,\u201d Mrs. Wight nodded. \u201cClass, be extra careful!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they climbed up her toe, Molly slowly lowered her body to the ground, her butt eventually making contact with the ocean floor after about a minute of motion, causing the entire planet to quake lightly as she did so. \u201cSorry guys! It\u2019s really hard being big sometimes...\u201d</span></div></div>",

It\u2019d take us an eternity to climb up your toes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a problem,\u201d the goth nodded. \u201cThighs OK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that\u2019ll be fine. We\u2019re ready whenever you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly reached down, lowering her finger down to her toe as slow as possible to keep the wind generated from her movements from blowing her tiny classmates away. Once the massive wall of skin landed beside them, the massive girl gently inched her finger towards them, heat and skin oil making sure the thirty minute specks were safely adhered to her fingertip.\u201dAlright everyone, hold on...\u201dMolly whispered as she brought her finger up and gently deposited them onto the soft flesh of her right thigh, the rest of her body stretching out farther than the eye could see.\u201dOkay Mrs. Wight, carry on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright class, now, feel free to explore! Molly\u2019s landscape of a body is a versatile playground of knowledge! Meet me back here in thirty minutes, then we can move onto the rest of the trip.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah guys, just be careful!\u201d Molly concurred as she watched her classmates explore her curvy thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow entering \u2018Fat Country\u2019,\u201d Susan chided as she began to explore the tan landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Molly was always a very kind girl, she thought she would have a little bit of fun this time. With a minute movement of her leg, she managed to send the mean girl tumbling into one of her pores, knowing it would take her a few minutes to easily escape the sweaty prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that\u2019s what you get for calling me names all these years, Molly chuckled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class gathered data as they searched across the titaness\u2019s skin, viewing the human body up close like no one had before. After the time had elapsed - and Susan had escaped from her pore prison - it was time for the class to move on to the next segment of the trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMolly, it\u2019s time for another relocation,\u201d Mrs. Wight signaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Mrs. Wight...\u201dMolly replied, tapping her chin thoughtfully.\u201dErm...what...where would you like to go next?\u201dShe questioned.\u201dIt is a...anatomy field trip so uh...are you planning on visiting my more...private parts?\u201dShe blushed at the end of the sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly if you\u2019re comfortable with it, Molly.\u201dThe teacher replied warm-heartedly.\u201dIf not, we can always get our data from textbooks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no! A firsthand experience is good...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Molly dear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo uh...next spot?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, your womanhood is an option,\u201dMrs. Wight stopped to hear some snickers and giggles behind her. When she turned around, the class fell silent at her gaze.\u201dWe\u2019re working our way up, but we can skip that if you like. We still need information on the crotch, stomach, breasts, face, hair, backside and buttocks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...Well, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d, um, rather not...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s perfectly understandable dear,\u201d her teacher nodded. \u201cThen where to instead?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, my tummy is next up...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Molly gathered up the small micros onto her finger and deposited them onto her flat, muscled stomach just below her naval.\u201dAlright everybody...you can go explore now...but be careful around Molly\u2019s belly button!\u201dMrs. Wight warned.\u201dIt\u2019s easily a hundred miles wide and deep, and if you fall in, there\u2019s no telling how we\u2019d get you out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I could get you out, but it\u2019d be really difficult,\u201d Molly concurred. \u201cJust really make sure to be careful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class began to scour the smooth surface that was the goth\u2019s stomach, making sure to avoid \u201cNaval Canyon\u201d at all costs. Some of them dropped onto her skin and placed their ears against her stomach, able to hear the digestive process occur quite loudly and thus adding such detailed findings to their notes. Many of them wondered how Molly\u2019s body was in amazing shape despite her massive size, especially considering she rarely exercised, though they ultimately attributed it to whatever forces caused her to become so huge in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and guys, just make sure not to move around too much in one place at the same time,\u201d the titaness added. \u201cI\u2019m a bit ticklish on my stomach too, so I wouldn\u2019t want anything to happen while you\u2019re down there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the class agreed to her with a quick nod and a \u201cOkay\u201d or \u201cYup\u201d, but Susan, a tad pissed about falling into her pore, simply ignored her. She huddled her friends around her, all tapping their feet or moving in a group quickly, tickling her soft skin. Molly chuckled a little, her laughter creating a small, rumbling quake for the small people on her lower stomach, every person falling off their feet at her laughter. Her stomach retracted ever so slightly inward, creating a small slope, but to Molly\u2019s tiny classmates, it was a deep cliff to fall down. All thirty of them slid down, scrambling to find safety, only to be swallowed up inside her belly button, falling into the darkness but to land on soft skin countless miles below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her giggling, Molly looked down to her stomach, only to find that the small mites were missing. \u201c...Where did everyone go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, Molly dear, we managed to fall in your belly button from that burst of laughter just now,\u201d her teacher called out from within her naval. \u201cMind trying to get us out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! I\u2019m so sorry! Someone tickled me, so that\u2019s what happened,\u201d Molly apologized. \u201cI\u2019ll get you out and move you somewhere else too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust take your time. We might have to cut down on this tour if it takes too long getting us out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly placed her right palm over her belly button, making a tight seal before proceeding to shift her body. The tiny students felt their entire world shake as Molly maneuvered herself onto her knees before dropping her left hand to the ground, facing her  stomach downwards and causing the trapped people to fall directly on her soft palm. Once the giant goth felt them land safely on her hand, she slowly moved the class to her butt, which was now proudly sticking up in the air, still mostly covered by her tight, bright orange underwear. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The entire view of the students was overcome by an entire landscape of orange as Molly gently settled them down onto her right cheek, the ground soft and warm. As they gazed out at the soft mass that could easily decimate an entire county and some surrounding areas, the students felt a mix of different views. Mrs. Wight was in awe of such a young lady, she was beautiful, she was powerful, yet she was kind and gentle. Some of the young men could not hide what was coiling in their pants, while others simply looked around in embarrassment. Susan sighed.\u201dMountain Ass...\u201dShe whispered maliciously to herself, even though Molly\u2019s butt was far larger than any mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, so...Yeah, sorry about that, but now you\u2019re free to explore again,\u201d Molly apologized as she placed her other hand back on the ocean floor. \u201cI think we\u2019ll just do one more stop  after this since I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re all getting tired of exploring me. Oh, and to all the guys, no funny business while you\u2019re on my butt!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA combined sigh emanated from all the males of the group as their giant subject simply giggled in reply; Molly knew her rear was her most prominent feature even before she was mega-sized, and simply enjoyed teasing her classmates for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Molly lowered herself to the ground until she was comfortably lying on her stomach, sending a thunderous echo across the planet and a jiggle across her prominent posterior, causing her classmates to fall face flat onto the orange surface of her panties, threatening to send some of the kids plummeting through the thick fabric threads and onto the soft flesh below. Cautiously they all stood back up and began taking notes, though they didn\u2019t know what for exactly. Some simply regarded Molly as a landmass all her own and considered this like a geography trip, others for science, and some just ogled her curvaceous form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTcht.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan simply wandered about, straying far from the main group. Walking across Molly was like exploring the desert itself, vast, expansive, but this one had a timid personality and was the biggest living thing in existence. In reality, Susan was jealous. Everyone always talked about Molly. How pretty she was, how big she was and how much bigger she was going to get. Susan simply couldn\u2019t get away from her. There she was, towering off in the distance. There was even a fucking television show about her that monitored her day to day. Merchandise didn\u2019t escape her as well Susan couldn\u2019t go anywhere in the mall without some vendor shoving a Molly doll in her face or an autobiography about her life. Susan didn\u2019t even need to know about the anti-goth, she was there from the very beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey used to be good friends, she remembered once. Susan sighed in contempt at the earliest thought of a ten-foot tall two-year old playing with her, accidentally knocking her over and making her cry. She knew it was an accident, but she was glad some people scolded the giantess, and she liked taking the spotlight from her for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Fucking fat country...\u201dShe mumbled as she gazed out at Molly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another half hour of exploration on the continental shelf of firm, soft flesh known as Molly\u2019s callipygous butt, Mrs. Wight gathered her students together for their final transfer on their field trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright now, since this is the final portion of our trip, we\u2019ll let Molly choose what she\u2019s most comfortable with for us to end on,\u201d the teacher explained. \u201cGo ahead whenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, well, let\u2019s see...You\u2019d probably get lost in my hair, so that\u2019s out,\u201d the goth said as she began to eliminate her options. \u201cMy mouth? Naw...I wouldn\u2019t want to accidentally eat anyone, so that\u2019s a \u2018No\u2019 too. Hmmm...Well, I\u2019m gonna have to get up later anyways, so I might as well do so now. So, um, chest work for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the males\u2019 jaws dropped at the orange titaness\u2019s suggestion to be moved to her country-sized breasts, their excitement further increased by hearing their teacher agree to the move. \u201cThat sounds fine. Take your time moving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching around, Molly slowly worked her massive fingers over her classmates, making sure their tiny bodies were secured to her index finger by skin oil. She brought it back around and stood back up, only to lay down once again on her back, gently dropping the tinies into various places across her buxom chest, some landed in the cleavage, others on the right breast cup, others the left, but soon all thirty of them were somewhere on the soft landscape.\u201dAlright guys...\u201dShe whispered, blushing a bit.\u201dHave fun. I\u2019ll be careful not to move too much...my chest does tend to jiggle a bit. Plus err...could you stay away from my nipples? They\u2019re...sensitive...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Mrs. Wight nodded from atop her left breast. \u201cYou heard her: Make sure to stay only on the top, inner portions and to not explore inside her bra. You may explore her cleavage though, so enjoy our last stop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, we will!\u201d was the combined male response, causing every female, including Molly, to sigh in shame. The class continued to explore the soft, pudding-like surface that was Molly\u2019s chest, another endless plane of tan complemented by the bright hue of her neon orange bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as the eye could comprehend, the students could only see a wasteland of varying skin, soft to the touch and surrounding them all. To those within Molly\u2019s cleavage, they would look up and only see a sky of flesh. If they squinted and looked a bit farther, they could make out her blurry face in the distance looking down at them. To those atop of her bra cup, they found the terrain much more easy to maneuver upon than the squishy breast flesh some others found themselves upon, though they had a much better view of their surroundings atop the mountain that made any other mountain a pebble compared to it\u2019s grandness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan, of course, was still in one of her moods as she walked across one of the bra cup fabric threads, feeling so insignificant compared to the vast teen. And of course, she was. She looked down at her own chest in shame, nothing that any other would look at the same as they would look at Molly, the biggest anything could be stacked side by side to.\u201dI hate you so much...\u201dShe whispered furiously as she looked out towards Molly\u2019s smiling face that took up the sky. While in her anger, her foot had met empty air of the gaps between the threads, causing her to stumble and plummet through the gap, screaming and flailing through the air, only for something very big and very pink to catch her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWoah! That was close! But just where the hell...\u201d Susan quickly looked onto the soft ground she had been deposited onto, instantly realizing where she was. \u201cWell, now this oughta be fun. Let\u2019s just see how everyone loves Ms. Overgrown Fat Bitch after this...\u201d Wasting no time, Susan dropped onto her hands and knees and proceeded to rub the ground vigorously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm...mmm...\u201d Molly moaned lightly as she bit her lip, trying not to alarm anyone of the mysterious pleasure she was feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, freak girl, moan all you want! Let everyone see just how much of a destructive weirdo you really are!\u201dSusan chuckled to herself as her hands moved over the vast pink landscape, the ground dotted with craters and canyons that she could get lost in. As she massaged, Molly\u2019s moaning only became louder, and her classmates began to take notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMolly, are you okay, dear?\u201dMrs. Wight asked from within the titanic girl\u2019s cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm...yeah.\u201dShe replied lustily, her nipple hardening and growing, poking out of the tip of her bra, a gigantic mountain rising out of the fabric.\u201dJust uh...feeling something.\u201dShe giggled, but it didn\u2019t sound happy, more forced.\u201dIs....is everybody accounted for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019ll have to check. We\u2019re spread out across miles of terrain of your chest, dear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pleasurable sensation coming from her chest continued to increase, Molly no longer knowing how long she could hold out without letting out a gigantic moan. \u201cWell, I think...someone might\u2019ve gotten where they shouldn\u2019t be...so I wanna make sure. Actually, you mind if I just double-check?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, we wouldn\u2019t want you to be uncomfortable. How would you like to do this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust hold on and then fall into my hand when I move my body.\u201d<br>\r\nThe orange-haired goddess slowly lifted her back off the ground, now sitting upon her colossal rear. Next, she cupped her hands below her bust and slowly leaned forwards, causing all of her classmates to fall safely onto her soft palms. Susan, on the other hand, grabbed Molly\u2019s nipple and held on for dear life, even when her world was turned on a 180 degree angle. Once Molly thought she had removed everyone from her chest, she returned to a sitting position and slowly placed her journeypeople on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Mrs. Wight, go ahead and count.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher did as instructed, quickly taking attendance of her students. \u201cHmmm...It seems someone is missing...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll show her what trying to get rid of me gets you!\u201d Susan exclaimed as she proceeded to rub once more, harder and faster than ever as Molly\u2019s nipple began to grow beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMolly dear? What\u2019s happening?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...uh...\u201dShe moaned a little afterwards. In all honesty, she had almost forgotten what it was like to be sexually aroused, and now this nice, but small massaging feeling was erecting her entire tender nipple.\u201dI think...I\u2019m growing...\u201dShe murmured it, but it was still the voice of a thunderous god to the tiny people below. The arousal must\u2019ve activated another trigger in her growth sequence, and with no sign of how big she was going to get. At least it was a slow growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright everyone...remain calm!\u201dMrs. Wight called out to her students.\u201dAnd Molly, please stay still. Or..be gentle in finding that last student:Susan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orange titaness winced at the name.\u201dSure.\u201dShe whispered as she neared six-thousand miles tall. Molly then gently moved her hand on top of her breast, alerting Susan of her presence. \u201cI know you\u2019re in there, Susan. Please stop now. I don\u2019t want you getting hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr else what?!\u201d Susan called out. \u201cYou\u2019ll just grow or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m growing because...\u201d Molly paused to let out another slight moan, \u201c...because of you. Now I\u2019m asking you to please stop or I\u2019ll have to force you out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake me, Fat Country!\u201d she replied as she redoubled her efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly paused for a moment as a small wave of pleasure shot throughout her entire being. It was warm, comfortable, and almost right in a sense. Then, Molly could feel herself give into her primal instincts; she did not know why, but she knew that she could not stop such a natural process. In an instant, the goth acted on these urges, moaning loudly as she added 1500 miles onto her height in less than a minute\u2019s time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh.....oh!\u201dMolly moaned as she neared 8000 miles in height, terrifying those on her palm with her bigger size, and she only grew more. Susan looked around, stopping her massaging for a moment, surprised to see the pink land had nearly tripled in size in only a minute\u2019s time. She was honestly frightened of how big the girl she hated was getting.\u201dWhy...\u201dShe looked up, Molly\u2019 massive eye gazing down at her like a sun.\u201dWhy have you stopped...?\u201dShe whispered lustfully, bringing her finger down, a landscape all it\u2019s own, and jabbing it into her nipple, smushing Susan into the soft flesh. Molly then gently rubbed her around on it, only making it harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMolly! Stop!\u201dMrs. Wight called out.\u201dYou\u2019ll crush her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she just couldn\u2019t help it. For eighteen years she had been deprived of ever feeling pleasure for herself, and she wasn\u2019t going to let this moment slip by. She arched her hand holding her classmates until they tumbled down to her fingertip, and bringing them up, she brought them down to her right breast, rubbing twenty nine of their tiny bodies into her other nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis...just feels so great...\u201d Molly moaned as she soared past 9000 miles. \u201cI just...can\u2019t stop...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, this is what you think I meant by \u2018letting loose\u2019, eh?\u201d a familiar voice sounded in her ear. \u201cI\u2019m almost ashamed of you, Mol, but you really do have to stop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBro? Is that you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course! Where giant women are abound, I\u2019ll be there to do something about it!\u201d he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you even...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll explain later, but right now, you have to stop this. Listen to me, you can do this again in a little while if you want, but right now, you need to stop, put everyone back on the ground, and get off the planet. Do you know you\u2019re starting to run out of ocean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I am?!\u201d Molly asked as she began to regain control of her senses, removing her hand from her chest and all of the frightened students, Susan included. \u201cI didn\u2019t crush anything, did I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot yet, but if you don\u2019t stop, you\u2019ll crush the coastal U.S. beneath your foot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no!\u201d Molly took in a deep breath as she tried to calm herself down, yet her growth only persisted, now at 9500 miles. \u201cC\u2019mon! Stop growing already! No more! Not now!\u201d Realizing that she might be putting the class in great danger at such heights, she quickly bent downwards and moved her hands towards the coast, making sure they all landed safely on the ground. \u201cI\u2019m sorry everyone!\u201d she whispered, her voice booming across the planet despite her soft voice. \u201cI never meant for any of this to happen! I\u2019m just...I\u2019m just a complete failure! A monster!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! No sister of mine is a monster!\u201d her brother comforted her as she grew onwards. \u201cWell, you might happen to have a thing for gals your size, but I think that just might be me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe only sniffled in reply, small tears streaming down her face once more as she only grew ever larger, her titanic form towering higher and higher as her body dominated more and more of the horizon. After five minutes packed with solid growth, the orange goddess had finally stopped her ascension heavenwards, leaving the massive girl at 12,000 miles tall.\u201dWow...\u201dShe whispered at her higher viewpoint, entire continents laid out before her.\u201dI\u2019m....big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBig is a bit of an understatement. I\u2019d say you\u2019re more like \u2018large enough to qualify as a planet\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not helping...\u201d she grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLast time I checked, I believe I was. I did just free you from what could\u2019ve been even more growth, didn\u2019t I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m...pretty sure I did. I mean, think about it, you could\u2019ve been like 15,000 miles tall if I didn\u2019t intervene, plus some...other things I\u2019d rather not mention...But anyways, you\u2019re lucky you\u2019re my sister, otherwise I woulda just let you keep on growing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, how kind of you...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, right? I should get some sorta \u2018Best Older Brother Ever\u2019 award or something!\u201d he laughed. \u201cBut in all seriousness, just be glad you didn\u2019t get any larger - you almost ran outta ocean there for a second. If I were you, I\u2019d try space. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll survive now out there with no problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly\u2019s eyes widened at the thought of leaving earth. She had clung to the small hope that she would stop growing at a manageable size and remain earthbound, but with recent events, it didn\u2019t seem likely at all. At her newest size, the slightest twitch from created powerful quakes, and even the batting of her eyelashes created powerful gusts of wind that messed with the turbulence and weather of those below. Plus, she had just  attempted to become aroused publicly with thirty people. To her hate groups, this is the perfect dish on her. She would be reviled now, a threat and a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut...b-but...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMolly...\u201dHis voice softened.\u201dYou have to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c....\u201d</span></div></div>",

She lowered him back down to their hometown gently, then raised back up, looking at the world laid out before her one last time.\u201d....Bye everyone...\u201dShe whispered softly before springing upwards, rocketing herself off the planet into weightless space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the gigantic goth floated off into space, the entire planet - and its denizens - breathed a sigh of relief as Molly\u2019s massive form no longer dwelled upon the Earth. A great deal of stress was removed from the planet\u2019s crust, attempting to contain her incalculable weight while supporting the remainder of the Earth\u2019s surface. However, due to her last major growth spurt and previous walk around the Earth, several small imprints of her feet were now etched into its surface, as well as a gargantuan sole-shaped crater encompassing most of the Pacific Ocean. Molly\u2019s class was still getting over the shock of her astounding growth and lack of control, but all of them, even Susan, felt bad that the kind girl had to abandon her home; she had not even said goodbye to her boyfriend before she left. For those who knew her for the innocent girl she was, they were equally saddened; for the rest of the world, they were glad that the immensely overgrown teen would no longer be creating havoc by simply breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI promise I\u2019ll be back... Molly told herself as she floated away from Earth.  But not until I\u2019m bigger...Much bigger...Not until I\u2019m big enough...My brother was right: That wasn\u2019t a full spurt, and I can feel another one building on the incomplete one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Many Days Later</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly seemed to had vanished. For the first day of her exile, she was visible in the sky, simply floating there and gazing down sadly at earth. The second, she drifted farther away. By the third day, she had gone out to explore the rest of the solar system. Then after that, poof. Somebody so big seemed to disappear into nothing. NASA had done everything in their power to spot her out there amongst the stars, but they were used to looking for slow-moving celestial bodies, not an astronomical girl that could move much faster than their telescopes could match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only on the tenth day did Molly return. It was a day the entire sky across the globe turned orange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello everyone,\u201d Molly whispered, her voice heard as a truly godlike roar across the heavens. \u201cI\u2019m back...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly\u2019s right bra cup was hovering directly over the planet, allowing no one on Earth to see anything but an endless wall of neon orange fabric covering the sky. Scientists had no idea how Molly suddenly appeared or why their devices did not pick up the image of a massive titaness directly in front of the Earth until now. The goth easily stood well over half a million miles in length, her body having grown considerably in the few days she had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wanted to wait until I was big enough to come back,\u201d she began. \u201cI don\u2019t want any of you to look at the face of the girl who almost destroyed the planet, so I made sure to be extra massive before doing this. Anyways, the reason why I\u2019m back is...to apologize for everything I\u2019ve ever done while big. I don\u2019t expect forgiveness, but I at least want to try to do what\u2019s right. Oh, and as for how I got here, let\u2019s just say that I\u2019ve started to \u2018evolve\u2019 during my recent spurts...I can...do things that can kind of...qualify as superpowers I guess? Like this, for instance...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll across the world, people were awed and befuddled at what was happening. In their minds, they could make out an image of Molly, perfectly human sized, waving and smiling at them, but from outer space, as if they were looking in on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI gave you guys a view of me...I can do a lot of stuff now. Like read minds, grow on my own will, though I\u2019m still learning to control that last one. That\u2019s why it took me ten days to show up. Oh, but look at this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn everyone\u2019s mind\u2019s eye, they could see Molly\u2019s already expansive show become even larger, her bra showing no sign of straining against the massive mounds of flesh. She amplified from a D cup to a G cup in no time. To those paying attention to the sky instead of their mind, they could only see the orange fabric grow closer to earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...can do pretty much anything I want now...But not yet EVERYTHING I want to do now. Like I can\u2019t rebuild the planet yet, but I can do tons of other things. But anyways, like I said, I\u2019m mainly here just to say sorry to everyone. I\u2019ve hurt everyone in at least some way, some more than others, but I want to apologize to everyone in general since I know my voice is probably getting pretty unbearable to hear...and yeah, I can\u2019t really fix that volume problem either, sorry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people of Earth found the girl\u2019s apology to be genuine; they all knew she never meant to harm anyone and that she always took the utmost care whenever she would do even the slightest action on the planet. One by one, everyone expressed their forgiveness to the titanic Molly; even Susan, with all of her past history of disgust for the girl, sympathized and accepted the mammoth girl\u2019s apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you everyone. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t be around for much longer. I can grow at will, but I still have mandatory spurts now and then, so I don\u2019t wanna endanger you all with my upcoming surge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she blew a kiss at earth, then she simply vanished, a result of one of her newer powers. In reality, she had gone off to an empty portion of space to allow her growth spurt to kick in. In a matter of moments, she was double that of a million miles tall, and still expanding rapidly into the cosmos, the only limit be her will and what she would do with the celestial objects around her. The teen did not know, but she knew she had to grow.</span></div></div>",

In another galaxy, countless lightyears away, a super-advanced race treated the giggle as a sign from their God to begin worshipping. In reality, this fit of laughter came from a teenage girl, albeit the teenage girl being massive enough to hold the universe in the palm of her hand. This girl was the Orange Goddess, the Great Orange Giga, and a plethora of various other names in various other tongues earthen and alien alike. But simply, she was Molly Ethans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe floated in an all-encompassing inky blackness, with only herself and the universe to keep her company. And wasn't it company! She could...somehow, zoom in the thoughts of a single person, or expand her mind a little and hear the troubles of an entire race. Usually she would sit there quietly and listen, but sometimes she would lend her hand in aid. Once, she kept an entire solar system from being sucked into a black hole by simply reaching into the speck of light before her and pinching the black hole shut. In another instance, on a less drastic scale, she helped a young man get a date for the prom. Her powers of manipulation came in quite handy whenever she wanted. But no, Molly would never abuse her powers. She dared not think of the day if she ever turned evil...in fact, she promised herself that if any evil action was her cause, she would wipe herself from existance, from ever living, from the minds of all who knew her and leave everything else alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for now, she was happy for another day. She currently only wore a pair of bright orange bra and panties, and even though she was simply too big for anybody to see her, she still felt quite bare. So, with a thought, Molly's usual attire appeared out of thin air and clothed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

The origins of such a being date back about 17 years ago back on planet Earth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Project Deus\", an experimental procedure authorized by the United States government to breed regular human babies into potential gods to be under the control of the U.S. military. The logic behind \"Project Deus\" was that with gods on their side, any military action taken against the U.S. would instantly be deflected and countered, or so was the goal of the project. 100 mothers volunteered themselves to be part of the project, some of them out of wanting to help their country, others from the amount of money they were paid for their participation: $500,000 to be paid upon the birth of the child. Each of the mothers' babies were subjected to various gene-altering drugs and injections to mold and morph the child into the ultimate being. However, upon the birth of the children, each of them were stillborn, filling the hearts of their mothers with absolute grief. Yet, due to some strange miracle, only one of the babies in the sample group survived, a perfectly healthy baby girl named Molly Ethans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the next several years, Molly was monitored extensively by government scientists; her family was also additionally compensated with each visit the scientists made, so the Ethans family never had to worry about money issues. Molly herself was raised with the utmost kindness by her parents, finding herself to be nice to everyone and everything, incapable of even harming a fly. After about 7 years of monitoring the girl, the scientists found no signs of abnormal DNA or other \"godlike\" characteristics present within Molly. Believing the project to be an utter failure, the government signed a contact with the Ethans family to provide them with a large sum of money every year for the rest of their lives for their numerous tests of their child. The scientists were then stripped of their ranks within the government and all of the project's records and documents were destroyed and burned, not leaving a single trace of the government's incredible waste of the taxpayers' money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of her life, Molly had a normal childhood, going to school and having fun with her many friends, albeit a bit shy in social situations, yet always managing to have fun and be extra nice. When she turned 12, Molly decided to become a \"goth\", signified by dying her naturally dark-orange hair bright-orange. However, just before her 13th birthday, Molly's life was about to change forever...  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAre they coming?\u201d demanded Vera Cartington, as she drummed her fingers on the ground, crushing several houses, helped by the manicured nails and the gold rings on several of her fingers. There she was, all 850 feet of overgrown brat (150 times 5ft8in), draped over the landscape, a mass of long blonde locks. Her top half was scarcely contained in a low cut and cropped silk top, her legs were encased in what would be $1,000 designer jeans, and she was adorned in bling which must be worth almost the entire gold reserves of the world. At 20 she should have outgrown this brattiness by now, but not Vera. She was spoilt and has never grown up. She was moody, demanding and could be remarkably uncaring at times to the needs of others. Yet she was intelligent and sexy and had a winning smile when she wanted to put it on and had her doting father round her bling clad little finger. This was helped by the fact that when she didn\u2019t get her way she tended to break things, as many cities and their inhabitants had found to their cost over the years. Daddy who incidentally was normal size was very very rich and influential and had got many powerful people, companies  and governments and their wealth on his side to provide Vera with all her wants. The alternative couldn\u2019t bear thinking about. The military had tried to do something but it was Daddy\u2019s daughter and the world had come to accept the giantess in their midst, enduring the hammering Vera gave it, even when she wasn\u2019t having a tantrum. As now. Somehow she had chosen to lie across a small town, totally destroying it. The inhabitants had no chance, but nobody could do anything, the consequences would have been a lot worse. As the sun shone off her multiple earrings, necklaces , bracelets and rings, her would be $10,000 gold Cartier watch, her nose stud was a solid 1ft diameter sphere of solid gold and her belly button ring was the size of a small car, blinding planes for miles, she suddenly became aware of something happening. A procession of vehicles was trundling towards her. Her eyes lit up, her $1,500 equivalent Louboutin boots were coming at last. Roads had to be cleared for miles to allow for the wide load. The view was spectacular, the boots were 250 feet tall, 125 feet long and more than 50 feet wide at their widest point as they rested on several low loaders. They were standing upright as Vera wanted to see them, and supported by dozens of helicopters with supporting chains. They must have cost $100m with the huge discount given. Several bridges had to be dismantled to allow the boots to pass, although Vera herself had helped in this regard, a recent major rampage had destroyed much of the infrastructure in this part of the world.  As she got up to look her right foot casually and uncaringly and accidentally planted itself on a historic building\u2026\u201dno, not that \u201c, grimaced her father, it was one of the best items in his property portfolio, only to be met with an icy stare from the golden ice queen\u2026\u2026.and she padded over the landscape towards the procession\u2026\u2026\u2026..<br>\r\n\u201cCome on give me them!\u201d, she demanded, as she snatched them, \u201cget my socks!\u201d. \u201cNoooo, wait\u2026\u201d. Too late, she didn\u2019t wait for the helicopters to disconnect the chains or the low loaders to release the boots, it was carnage, the lowloaders, dozens of helicopters and their crews, and she ended up stepping on the wreckage. Then she turned to her father and the assorted businessmen and politicians with a smile that melted hearts, \u201cthanks, daddy\u201d\u2026\u2026.before walking back to where she was previously, where her bag was. Supremely satisfied, she was a happy bunny as she skipped, much to the further distress of the landscape. Meanwhile her socks were there to her delight.<br>\r\nAs she crashed down by her bag to put on the socks and then the boots, she noticed her soles. \u201cs\u201c%^*$! My feet are so dirty, I do need to wash them. Yawn! Too far to walk\u201d. She was in one of her frequent lazy moods, her sumptuous pad was only 100 yards away for her (8.5 miles), hidden by mountains. At 2 miles by 2 miles and 1,500 feet high it had all the rich giantess about town could wish for and more and cost a cool $10 billion to build and that was before fitting it out. \u201coooo, look, a reservoir\u2026.\u201d, she said chirpily. Sensing what was about to happen and not being able to do a thing about it, the authorities quickly scrambled a squadron of planes to get one of her towels. Trampling a suburb or 2 on the way she reached the reservoir and plunged her feet in\u2026\u201daaah!\u201d. Oblivious to the fact the water was flooding everywhere she splashed around before taking the towel (which had got there just in time, there was no thanks for getting it, she just assumed it was there) she sat down on some nearby soft trees and wiped her feet. Tossing the towel away where it snagged a passing train she took her socks and put them on. \u201cNow, the boots\u2026\u201d, she smiled. Seeing they weren\u2019t there she screamed, \u201cget me my $&amp;^%ing boots!\u201d. Conscious of a tantrum coming and its effect on all their lives the planes were scrambled again to bring the boots over. This time at least they released the boots before Vera grabbed them. Glaring at the planes (these to her inferior ants should have been quicker off the mark) she turned round and looked at the glorious VERY tall Louboutin boots and her face turned into a beaming smile. She had been waiting for what seemed to her a very long time for them to be made but now they were hers. Proudly she put them on, one at a time, each zip worked perfectly as she slowly zipped them up over the tight skinny jeans she was wearing. She wiggled her boot clad feet in the ruins of the town she had laid on previously and just loved the look of these smooth black boots with a very tall heel and the trademark red sole. \u201cHmmm, I must test these out, where should I go?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she carelessly stepped onto a row of houses causing them to collapse like dominoes, her expression turned to a worried frown as she inspected her boots, she didn't want to scratch them so soon, never mind about the crushed humanity and structures, but breathed a sigh a of relief when there was not a scratch. She then looked around at the gathering of important people including her doting father who was saying \"isn't my girl beautiful...\" to the assembled group who collectively could hardly disguise a gulp. Her father was torn, he was in awe of his daughter, her beauty etc, yet in private he too winced at her bouts of destruction and shared that view with friends, but he couldn't be seen to do it by his 20 year old 850ft tall daughter. \"Are you watching? How do I look?\"...any thoughts fears conversations etc were rudely interrupted by the loudness of the voice and they looked around at a gorgeous sight, masses of blonde hair waving in the wind, boobs and cleavage proudly in front, seemingly stretching the fabric of her top more than usual, a beaming smile as Vera posed hand on hip, twirling and trampling everything underfoot to dust as she did so, unknowingly, uncaringly.....as she did this she suddenly saw in the near distance an ideal catwalk. It was a major highway to the nearest big city 50 miles away. The eyes of the onlookers were glued to this beautiful giantess as she flaunted her sexuality, posing like a true model, and started walking over to the \"catwalk\". \"Are you \u00a3$%$ing watching me?\", her voice was suddenly strident as she saw the gathering seemingly get further and further away from her. It just didn't occur to her that maybe it was impossible for tinies to move as quick as the goddess Vera. Quick as a flash they got into helicopters and followed Vera as she came to the highway. It was long and very busy, actually full of citizens in their cars etc fleeing Vera. Surely they knew there was a giantess around and have abandoned the area a long time ago, but the fact is Vera's appearances were relatively infrequent outside her estate and very random and occasionally like now she had had a new pad built and nobody knew. Without hesitation a trademark red-soled Louboutin boot crashed down on the busy roadway, crushing scores of jammed cars, and the the other a she strolled sexily down the road, wiggling her hips tightly encased in her tight jeans. Her jewellery reflected in the bright sunlight, blinding a lot of the motorists so they for a moment couldn't see, sometimes crucial when it came to a CRUNCH! of boot crushing 100s of cars to tinfoil. Vera smiled with beautiful white teeth at the onlookers in their helicopters who had to appear to smile while in reality they were sick in their stomachs at the carnage as she got closer and closer to the city...........</span></div></div>",

The helicopters meekly followed her until she waved them away catching one or 2 in the draught and they crashed to the ground, completely ignored by Vera. Her father had known better and his helicopter was well back but some of the newer pilots....... Absolutely oblivious to the carnage at her feet, the cars, the roadway, trees etc and particularly the people, several 1000 all told....when she watched the TV news later and saw this she just shrugged, \"what do you want ME to do about it?\", much to the shock of those serving her every need, as she ate another piece of steak, and signalled for another beer, but they really should have known she was like this, after all this time....<br>\r\nAnyway, wiping her feet/shoes when she came in is not something that Vera did very much, she had an army of 1000 tinies to do that, and this time was no exception, as the dirty boot prints across the deep pile carpet testified\u2026..she was so pleased with her new boots that even as she curled up on the expensive soft leather sofa she was still wearing them.

She kept changing channels and found nothing. She was beginning to get a little buzzed by now, having downed 3 beers and half a bottle of champagne and was beginning to be a bit theatrical and raucous. Not content with drowning 100 tinies when she playfully upturned the champagne bottle and poured some on the carpet and throwing bits of food to see how many tinies she could hit, she suddenly decided to go out again. This was a dangerous development. Fresh from strutting her stuff with her new boots and the rush that gave her and the increased lack of concern about the multitudes who shared the planet with her, she had gone much further than she had done for a long time, and it wasn't even a rampage in anger, she was now distinctly tipsy as she crashed around her pad getting dressed, putting on a soft brown leather bomber jacket, silk scarf and her favourite Dents black leather gloves (the type that would have been $150 a pair at normal size and she owned several pairs of them), These all went so well with her designer jeans and the Louboutin boots. Putting her hand behind her head and ruffling her hair, she looked at herself in the mirror and liked what she saw. She then put her would be $3,000 Chanel bag over her shoulder and went out into the cool late afternoon air. Folding her arms across her chest to try and keep herself warm she took her first steps. Where would she go? Her drunkeness was beginning to show more obviously now as she occasionally staggered. Explosions filled the air as she staggered and stepped on a local power plant......\"ooops! hic! heehee!\" was her ominously light-hearted reaction. \"I'm sho big and you're sho tiny\", she giggled as she saw the tiny power station workers running for their lives in panic. She then proceeded to stomp on as many as she could, causing huge tremors as she did so. As has already been said this was an ominous development. previously it had been the relatively infrequent though serious rampages. These were defined occasions and Vera was sometimes de-escalated before too much damage was done, even the worst ones over the years were followed by long periods where she wasn't seen and people could rebuild their lives, they had accepted it as an inescapable hazard of life, like living in an earthquake zone, but this was different. Not only had she been around several days in a row now but the destruction was becoming more casual and more mundane to her, and the population was now terrified in a way they hadn't been for a long time. When Vera used to rampage when she didn't get what she wanted there was often a warning sign and a city could evacuate, now she had become much more unpredictable, and now she was drunk as well, what was going on with Vera? Having thoroughly enjoyed the hunt and squish of 100s of power station workers she actually began to deliberately go out of her way to crush people and things as she walked. She followed roads through towns and villages and often obliterated them with a few steps from her favourite boots. She often stopped and picked up things and laughed uproariously as she crushed them with her gloved fingers, she tore up power lines, picked up trains, as well as enjoying the crunching of 1000s trees underfoot..........then her eyes lit on the highway she had trampled on the previous day as a catwalk. \"was that really done by l'il old me, yesterday?\", hic!, \"coooool! Hey, wasn't there a city at the end of it? I could have some real fun there...\"......staggering again, she said to herself \"it's a long way, I need some sustenance, giggle2, as she fumbled in her bag and brought out a half bottle of whisky, which she proceeded to swig from, straight from the bottle.......</span></div></div>",

All thoughts of not wanting to dirty or scuff her new boots had gone in the drunken haze of her mind, well she could always order some more, as her booted feet buried themselves in dust and rubble and flames. Taking another swig she suddenly noticed above the sounds of destruction another loud noise, a noise of droning. She looked round startled. It was a fleet of helicopters. Vera flicked her hair back with leather gloved hands and looked at the tiny flies. Suddenly  there was the sound of a voice, incredibly amplified so she could hear. It was her father, the one person she would listen to seriously. He doted on her and some would say indulge her (but she was large) but also could be firm. This was one of those times. \u201cVera! What on earth are you doing! Do you know what you are doing! Are you crazy? And you\u2019re drunk! \u201c. Vera stood there open mouthed at this barrage, she hadn\u2019t been spoken to like this for several years. As she stood there shocked she dropped her bottle of vodka she was swigging from and shattered on impact, spraying the city below with lethal shards, and where there were fires they were added to by the spilt vodka, causing a conflagration in places, much to the further dismay of the inhabitants of the helicopters, representing the great and the good of the world.  Alas their dismay grew even greater at Vera\u2019s next action. \u201c$%^&amp; you! How DARE you talk to me like that! I\u2019m a goddess and don\u2019t you ever forget it! If I could be even taller I would so I can ravage this \u00a3$%^ing place even quicker!\u201d. This was bad, she was very, very angry. And the landscape suffered even more. She stomped and smashed the city to oblivion in very short order, along with its inhabitants. 3 million perished as she crushed city block after city block, crushed aircraft, tore up bridges and railway lines, and for good measure tore up chunks of city and threw them at the helicopters. In a blind rage she was not considering that her father, her champion, was in one of them as she smashed many out of the sky. It is just as well that he escaped very quickly. Not content with destroying the city she proceeded to obliterate every feature in the region, dozens of towns and villages, railway lines, trees, factories, power lines, she smashed the local reservoirs and stomped on a dam which flooded several square miles. The population was in total panic, total meltdown, they had lived alongside Vera for her entire life with her faults and foibles (and good points even), but there had been nothing like this. However, just when she got to the regional capital, a city of 20 million people and started frenziedly destroying it, something happened\u2026\u2026..</span></div></div>",

She was so used to being alone or when she was with people, those that she actually liked or at least tolerated, those who weren't casually and summarily squashed in passing, were only about half in inch high to her, the size of bugs, and bugs were for the most part....bugs........so she never felt a presence....but this was distinct......distracted, she stopped her crying. Barely had she done that than she felt something around her shoulders, it felt strangely comforting. \"What the $%^%?\", she said in a sort of sotto voce exclamation. She turned round and got the shock of her life.......it was another girl, at 23 a little older than herself, but she was huge like Vera herself! Long straight dark brown locks flowed down her leather clad shoulders of what looked like a perfect leather motorcycle jacket and it was an arm clad in another part of that same garment that rested comfortingly round her shoulders, with a leather gloved hand squeezing her arm.......\"are you OK? Hiiiii I'm Anna, by the way...\". Anna's face beamed, an extraordinarily friendly open smile, the type that make the other person immediately feel top of the world. \"Er...hi, I'm Vera.....\", she was a little uncertain, not knowing what to make of this newcomer. She had a lifetime being accustomed to being the only one at her size and most of the time was very happy about her superior position in society, but now at a stroke........she looked around at the other girl, Anna. Anna was dressed neck to toe in shiny black leather, big knee length flattish boots worn over tight shiny leather trousers, matched by her motorcycle type jacket and the gloves, her long dark brown hair framing her gorgeous beaming face and flowing down to 3/4 way down her back. She was warm and open and friendly to Vera. Yet look down and those leather clad legs were kneeling down in death and destruction, which increased as she moved her legs to stay comfortable (she even picked up and threw away several tall buildings which could have very uncomfortable if she had accidentally knelt on them). Massive footprints seemed to go on for miles, confident footprints, seeming complete casual indifference to where her boot clad feet had landed, and in the distance a huge motorcycle with a helmet on the handlebars, with its front wheel wedged against a dam which looked ready to collapse at any moment under the strain. Vera had all sorts of mixed feelings brought up by the sudden presence of Anna. She could be the friend that she had always wanted yet she was cross that nobody had mentioned that Anna existed. She saw the carnage caused by Anna's approach and in one sense was almost repelled by it, there was humanity and kindness in her nature though it didn't always show itself, buried by years of being a brat, and yet there was something about Anna's awesome power and seeming indifference to her surroundings that actually aroused Vera a bit, particularly as it reminded herself of her own attitude over the years towards her tiny surroundings, what she had done to countless towns and cities and people, whether obliviously or to the other extreme the deliberate wholesale destruction she had caused to the region all around her that very day and how that had also aroused her for a while. Then Anna spoke.....\"let me explain........\".</span></div></div>",

With that, Anna sat down next to Vera, her leather clad behind compressing several city blocks to dust, and it was done oh so calmly and naturally, resting her right gloved hand on another city block for support. Then her looooong leather clad booted legs scythed a trail of destruction and flames through downtown as they stretched out, and Anna didn't bat an eyelid as by that action alone another 10,000 perished. Anna put her free arm around Vera's shoulder. \"Don't be afraid, Vera\", Anna said soothingly, Vera smiled in response, she was beginning to warm to the new presence. \"As you very well know, I'm not from these parts, in fact I'm not even from this world, I landed my spaceship over in that direction\", she pointed in the direction of the motorcycle, \"well, it WAS a nice city, haha, and had to ride over here on my bike. I stopped over there so as not to cause too much commotion and disturb you. You see, we have been watching you from afar for a number of years, sort of guardian angels, seeing you grow up, seeing your attitude towards things and this planet, how the inhabitants suffered when you didn't get your way, and now the recent destruction....... don't tell me you didn't enjoy it, seeing the destruction, hearing the screams......\". Anna's tone of voice changed subtly as she said that, from soothing comfort to a bit more animated, not unnoticed by Vera as she also looked around again at the destruction wrought by Anna, it looked purposeful and deliberate and....at that moment Vera felt an involuntary twinge of excitement in her being, the exhibition of raw sexy power and confidence, and Anna was really cool. Vera smiled again...\"yeah, it was actually kinda nice, really\". \"I thought you would say that\" said Anna with a wink. Vera was totally warming to Anna now, at last somebody of her own age and own size to talk to, and they started chatting about things, things that girls talk about, and also the joys and problems of everyday living. Presently after a pause Anna said \"well, aren't you going to show me your world?\". \"Sure, I was about to suggest that\", Vera smiled \"and would you like to come to my pad afterwards for a drink and something to eat?\". And with that the two gigantic girls got up, planting booted feet on yet more structures, before strolling off, two earth tremor machines. As they made their way through the city and out the other side the inhabitants were in constant fear and panic as the city in the giantesses' path was levelled and 100s of 1000s more people died. The two chatted animatedly as they went, regaling each other with stories, Vera showing Anna all the sights and watching as Anna did random acts of destruction, though Anna pointed out to Vera that just by walking she was doing her bit as well and she had destroyed her whole local area earlier, Soon Vera joined in these random acts as the two of them giggled through what was becoming another rampage. It was at that point that the two of them came round to the damaged dam that Anna's motorcycle was resting against. \"I'll just go to over to collect your bike, Anna\", said Vera and then you can take it to my house. \"OK\", said Anna as she stood there arms folded across her chest. Anna could only look on with open mouth at what happened next. Vera, now with a confident swagger in her step now, strolled casually (and destructively) over to the dam and bike and holding the bike, kicked the dam. At that it gave way, unleashing millions of gallons of water into the valley, Vera having to jump to avoid being splashed too much. In that valley lived 10 million people, most of whom perished as their settlements were washed away in the deluge. Anna's mouth opened more...\"awesome!\" she said under her breath at that supreme act of carnage. Vera was beaming and proud as she walked over to Anna. They hugged each other warmly. The Anna said: \"that was soooo awesome, I have a proposition for you, how would you like to join us and be a destroyer of worlds with us?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Anna was all ears as Vera, arms folded across her chest, brown leather jacketed arms pushing up her barely covered cleavage, her necklaces and pendants clanking emphasising her bronzed chest, her black leather gloved right hand highlighted against the brown as she rested it on her left upper arm just above the inside of her elbow, while the other disappeared under the same place the other side, exposing some of the multiple bangles she wore on her wrists, continued talking. \"Anyway when you came along this feeling grew that something important was happening, my destiny was being revealed, a sense of identity, of worth, and then watching you nonchalantly casually crushing everything you touched and so matter of factly, it made me feel so warm inside, the power, the control, and wrecking that dam, that was one of the most awesome things I have ever done. It's been really lonely with only these tiny people as company, I have 1000s upon 1000s of them, catering for my every need, if I accidentally squashed some there would be more (giggle).

Vera took a bottle and started drinking as well. \u201cMmmm, I just love your outfit and your jewellery, expensive?\u201d \u201cYeah, I think\u201d,  Vera giggled. \u201cYou know, you area really cool girl Vera\u2026\u2026\u201d, Anna smiled as she said these words.

That\u2019s soooo cool\u201d. Anna looked at Vera\u2019s retreating tightly jean clad backside and smiled.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Anna didn\u2019t have to wait very long. A few minutes and a couple of bottles of beer later (Anna drank fast) there were sounds of crashing. This seemed to be interspersed with sounds of what sounded like very quiet collective human screams (?)\u2026\u2026.then Vera appeared. Visibly drunkenly fired up, having consumed more alcohol, she was sexily strutting along, provocatively swinging her hips and her arms, and looking steamily at Anna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna sat open mouthed, she couldn\u2019t believe this vision, masses of blonde hair and neck ear and nose jewellery, and most of all a skin tight leather catsuit, which showed every curve. The figure hugging trousers were tucked into matching knee length boots with a stiletto heel, the top half was a halterneck top showing a lot of cleavage and bare shoulders and a lot of the back where tattoos could be seen, there was even a hole where the belly button piercings could be seen, all solid gold, The look was completed by long leather opera gloves which went up to beyond the elbow to finish just below arm tattoos half way up on her upper arms, with multiple solid gold bangles on each wrist and a solid gold chain belt round the waist. The zip was down a bit to maximise that cleavage, pointed to by several gold pendants and necklaces. Anna was entranced, aroused even.<br>\r\nOn top of that what Vera was doing was also really turning her on. As she raunchily walked along the long marble passage, she was smashing and trashing everything as she went, sweeping ornaments off shelves, pictures off walls, bumping against furniture with her hips causing things to fall off, she occasionally paused to pull over a glass cabinet or a book case or turn over a table, it was pandemonium, the noise, but Anna loved it and being done by such a sexy babe as Vera. She loved the way Vera enjoyed trampling through the mass of broken glass etc with her booted feet. She kicked cupboards as she went too which splintered and shattered. The early part of the walk Vera was swigging from a bottle of rare chartreuse (worth $20,000 in normal size) and threw the still half full bottle at a cabinet of crystal in the kitchen with inevitable results. Vera was really letting rip and Anna was loving it, it reminded her soooo much of when she used to rampage through multitudes of cities in various planets up to last year, now she had been promoted to a guardian, she didn\u2019t do so much destroying, but now with Vera doing what she was doing\u2026..mmmmm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis feeling was topped off by what was going on at Vera\u2019s booted feet.  It looked like 100s or even 1000s of tinies were running from her in abject panic, many ending up as much as Vera casually stepped on many as she walked, occasionally stopping to be more thorough. This was new even for Vera. Up to now tinies could count on being as safe as they could, Vera never went anywhere near their quarters, at least without warning. Many tinies often got casually and accidentally squashed and when Vera was angry it was more but never was there such wholesale slaughter of her house tinies. She had totally devastated their quarters and was deliberately smushing 1000s  upon 1000s of them.<br>\r\nAnna was entranced. Presently Vera stopped not far from Anna and with gloved hands on tightly leather clad hips did a twirl. \u201cLike it?\u201d, said Vera. \u201cLike it?\u201d, Anna\u2019s voice was slightly raised, \u201ccome over here my gorgeous\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Vera approached, Anna got up and put her arms on Vera\u2019s shoulders and looked her in the eyes, \u201cthat was\u2026\u2026.I can\u2019t think of what to say\u201d, but Vera could see the effect of what she had done on what Anna was feeling. Their lips met again. When the kiss had ended Anna repeated what she said earlier, \u201cyou really don\u2019t care about your things, do you?\u201d\u2026\u201dNaaah!\u201d, She demonstrated again by crashing her boot through a glass topped table near Anna. \u201cWhatever I smash will be immediately replaced\u201d, \u201ceven if you smash the whole place and kill off your house tinies?\u201d, queried Anna, knowing that was exactly what Vera was aiming for. \u201cErrrrr\u2026.\u201d, Vera\u2019s mind was confused, \u201cbut I SO wanted to smash up everything for you\u2026..\u201d, replied Vera, now slightly tearfully the drink was playing with her emotions as she then burst into tears on Anna\u2019s leather clad chest,. Anna put her arms comfortingly around her and said \u201cthere, there\u201d, as she rubbed Vera\u2019s back soothingly. \u201cI thought so\u201d, smiled Anna knowingly, \u201cbut don\u2019t worry, with what I\u2019ve got for you, you won\u2019t need to bother replacing anything\u201d. \u201cReally?\u201d, sniffled Vera, stopping crying. Vera felt comforted yet was puzzled. \u201cHow?\u201d. Anna gave Vera a big soft kiss, \u201cI will tell you tomorrow morning, we\u2019re  a bit drunk at the moment, giggle\u201d. Vera giggled too. In her inebriated state her enquiring faculties were more on hold than they would be normally\u2026.then Anna whispered softly in Vera\u2019s ear, \u201cnow, shall we tear apart the rest of this place together, the two of us?\u201d. Vera, suddenly animated, nodded her head vigorously:- \u201cyeaaah! Cooool!\u201d, Anna replied, \u201cwe\u2019d better leave the bedroom [which had an en-suite bathroom] for what I have in mind later, baby\u201d, Anna\u2019s voice had changed again to sexy. And Vera responded accordingly. Kissing passionately they the set about wrecking Vera\u2019s pad, casually and sensuously and joyfully, (and drunkenly as they guzzled Vera\u2019s champagne by way of celebration, even crashing more than one pair of bottles together deliberately hard enough for them to shatter). And as for the remaining tinies\u2026\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a heady mix, and arousing too for both of them, as they eventually ended up in passionate embrace (and more) in the sumptuous bed in the luxuriously appointed bedroom\u2026\u2026\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nThe next morning when Vera woke up it was OUCH! SUCH a hangover. As she stumbled towards her en-suite bathroom it suddenly occurred to her: \u201c^&amp;*$, where is Anna?\u201d. She looked around at the mess in the bedroom, it had been quite a night and the room had got almost as trashed as the rest of the pad, and there were bloodstains of masses of tinies everywhere\u2026\u2026\u2026.she couldn\u2019t even watch TV, she vaguely remembered stoving it in just before she threw it through the stained glass window, and her favourite vase wasn\u2019t there\u2026well Anna did ask\u2026\u2026.and it was worth it as it too went through a window\u2026all in the build-up to the two of them enjoying an orgasmic experience with each other. But where was she? Suddenly her eyes lit on a big package in the corner covered with metal hearts made from torn up railway lines (Anna had been busy in the early hours, much to the dismay of a not too far away million strong city) and a note attached\u2026\u2026.Vera\u2019s hangover almost seemed to miraculously disappear as she saw this, bringing such pleasure again to Vera, knowing this is from her wonderful friend (and more) Anna\u2026\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera walked over to the corner of the room where the exquisitely wrapped package was. She smiled at the trouble Anna had obviously taken with it but it didn\u2019t stop Vera wondering why Anna had vanished, it was such a great evening and their friendship and more was growing so why the disappearance? Vera was at one and the same time puzzled/concerned and yet exhilarated. What a day!.....she can\u2019t believe how much happened and how quickly from the time she was weeping in the partly ruined city and Anna appeared to the last intimate act before she fell asleep\u2026\u2026.that she was about to fulfil her life\u2019s destiny as a destroyer of worlds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lovingly stroked the package. This was Anna all over, the way she does things. Then she saw a note attached. She opened the gold envelope and started reading:- \u201cMy darling Vera, don\u2019t worry, I haven\u2019t gone far, I\u2019ll see you later,. Being with you last night was soooo wonderful, you made me so horny with the way you enjoyed ravaging your things and killing your tinies, that when we came together in your bedroom I orgasmed more than I have ever ever done before. I was so excited afterwards that I couldn\u2019t sleep.<br>\r\n\u201cI had to go out to give you some space to think about things, your future life, and for you to take ownership of the destiny which is yours (and I also thought:\u201d\u00a3%$^ it, I need to ravage some cities, I haven\u2019t done it for so long, and our time together last night reawakened my cravings\u2026.).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeanwhile in this package I have wrapped up something wonderful for you, to enhance your future experience as a goddess, a destroyer of worlds. But take your time before opening it, maybe bath, eat, do your morning things, and get dressed, and the opening the package will be all the better for it, trust me.\u2026\u2026\u2026soooooo looking forward to seeing you later. Love Anna, xxxxxxxx.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Vera did what her gorgeous new friend Anna said as she tried to go about her morning routines with the hangover and the questions still there. What did Anna mean when she talked about the wonderful thing she had for her, both yesterday and in the note she just read\u2026\u2026and that thought again, what about my father? She started pondering these things as she stumbled around the wreckage of her apartment\u2026\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been quite a night, it seemed everything in the apartment had been completely trashed and there was nothing left. She couldn\u2019t even summon her tinies as pools of goo and smears represented the fact that they were all slaughtered\u2026\u2026..yet Vera was too hung over to even kick up her normal fuss, which ironically would have meant the smashing of a number of the ornaments which were now in pieces on the floor\u2026\u2026then as luck would have it she went to her kitchen and found not so much damage (Anna had sneakily steered Vera away from there, knowing she would need it in the morning). Vera was able to cook herself a good breakfast and lots of coffee and was then able to have a long hot bath in her undamaged bathroom (again Anna had steered Vera away from that area, though with difficulty knowing from watching her over recent times from afar Vera\u2019s penchant for bathing in her expensive clothes and jewellery particularly to relieve the times when she was bored and Vera was fired up in her trashing spree would have been attracted there).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Anna was getting dressed the lure / pull of the package was getting greater by the second......<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Vera was in the bath, she just couldn\u2019t stop thinking of Anna. She frequently touched herself, imagining being with her. Being able to destroy civilisations and planets together, getting turned by the total power and nihilism of it, which just enhanced the whole sexual experience. Anna meanwhile was of the very same mind as she spent the early hours of the morning laying waste to 1000s of square miles of landscape, millions of people, billions of $s\u2026\u2026feeling Vera\u2019s presence with every destructive stomp of her heeled booted feet\u2026\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrying off and starting to get dressed, Vera was so happy. All the thoughts of the future excited her, so much that the Hangover quickly ceased being an issue. She was even dismissing thoughts of her father now: \u201cI don\u2019t $%&amp;^ing need him anymore, him and his cronies, sooooo eager to please, I might give them to Anna to crush with her leather gloved hands, and watch, hahaha!\u201d. Yet even as she said this, her countenance fell, \u201cmy father, how could I say that?\u201d, she wailed\u2026\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind was torn, her glittering future, yet the niggle of where her father fits in was an issue. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll find out when I open this package\u201d, so she did just that. She lifted the package from her table and put it on her bed and started eagerly tearing the paper. Before she got very far she noticed another note from Vera. Opening it she read:-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy darling Vera xxxxx,<br>\r\nBy the time you read this you have probably had some thoughts about your father. I know when we were having our fun together last night you dismissed him and his friends, but I sense this was more the drink and the occasion talking, you really do love your father and I\u2019m sure you are troubled about what will happen to him when we crush this world and it is sowing doubts in your mind about whether you want to become a destroyer of worlds. Well, please, please, don\u2019t worry, it is all being taken care of, my darling\u2026..\u201d PTO.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera quickly turned over the page\u2026\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne of the reasons I had to leave this morning (apart from destruction fun :)) was to make sure your father was safe. He requested his friends to be included too. You see your father is a special human being (which is why we are going along with his request that his friends are included in this too), one of the few tinies to have ever been inside a goddess and survived, even more than that, he maybe by fear maybe something else he impregnated her, yes your mother was a goddess like us, and she was smushing tinies with her sensitive parts when one must have escaped\u2026\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera couldn\u2019t believe what she was reading, her jaw dropped, as she continued reading\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen we found she was pregnant she was elevated to another plane, as a mother of goddesses, to protect her. Then when you were born we weren\u2019t sure how much of a goddess you were or whether you were a tiny, as you were so small. Because of your tiny size we had to put you in the custody of your father on this planet and monitor you to see what would happen. Needless to say you turned out more than all right :) . Your mother really wants to see you when she comes back from her supervision of some galaxy crushing elsewhere in the universe, she has been following your life with eagerness, and talking with your father frequently, she really didn\u2019t want to let you go but she had to for your safety. Your father and his friends meanwhile have been placed in a safe chamber at your mother\u2019s apartment\u2026..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-m-y mother is alive!\u201d, Vera exclaimed, \u201cand my father knew about this all the time, the $%^&amp;*^, why didn\u2019t he tell me?\u201d, she shouted, throwing a vase at a mirror on the wall. <br>\r\nIt was almost as if Anna was hearing what Vera was saying for when Vera was quickly drawn back to the letter the next thing she read was, \u201cat this moment you are probably feeling bewildered and angry, and I can sooo understand, it happened to me too\u2026\u2026yes my father was a tiny as well\u2026\u2026but mother and daughter had to be kept apart until we knew that the daughter was a true goddess rather than the tiny genes predominating, for safety apart from anything else\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is all going to be OK, baby, really it is, I turned out all right didn\u2019t I?\u201d\u2026\u2026. Vera smiled, and continued reading: \u201cnow if you open the package the is something wonderful for you, and your anger, fears and worries will melt away\u2026\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as she took hold of the package again her countenance lifted\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her eyes opened wide, she couldn\u2019t believe it, it was so beautiful, it was a canister made of crystal, encrusted with diamonds and infused with gold and platinum. If it had been tiny size it would have been worth millions, let alone Vera sized\u2026\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another note attached:- \u201cyour destiny has nearly arrived Vera, baby, to crush, smash and destroy, everyone, everything, the bad and the good, the ugly and the beautiful, everything subsumed to your and our goddess power as destroyers of worlds. This canister is a cheap trinket compared with our ultimate annihilation of worlds, just let your destructive urge come on again, just think of the priceless things you have casually smashed, in anger or otherwise, the cities you have already ruined\u201d\u2026..Vera felt arousal coming on and started touching herself\u2026..\u201dfinish dressing and then smash this canister to smithereens, it cost the entire GDP of 3 countries (which I will let you finish off later, heehee), and then\u2026\u2026\u2026.my gift to you\u2026\u2026then you will be ready\u2026\u2026..see you later, baby, love Anna\u2026xxxxxxx\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera was out of breath just reading this, she felt amazing, empowered. She was ecstatic. Her destiny awaited and she was going to see her gorgeous darling Anna again and be with her for ever\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to make herself gorgeous for Anna and to receive this gift properly. She piled on really expensive perfume and then just for fun poured the rest out on the carpet before smashing another glass case with the empty bottle, she piled on her jewellery, necklaces, pendants, chains, bracelets bangles, rings, earrings, nose stud, belly button jewellery. She put on her most expensive silk underwear, then a low cut jewel encrusted top. Her blonde locks looked glorious as she even sprayed some diamonds on her hair, some stuck to the spray on her hair golden threads of silky hair, though many clattered to the floor. Then she put on her tightest sexiest shiniest black leather trousers with matching belt and perfect matching leather jacket. Over her leather trousers she wore knee length stiletto heeled black leather boots and the tightest gloves on her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving completed her outfit she looked at herself in the mirror, gloved hands on second skin covered hips, and took a deep breaths as she jutted her cleavage out and smiled a beaming smile. She felt so sexy and turned on even. With that she walked over to her bed as calmly as she could and without a second thought picked up the valuable object she was going to destroy. It was then she gulped and took another deep breath before aiming the canister at her as yet undamaged collection of Ming vases in their glass cabinet. The crash was spectacular, the explosion of sound caused Vera to scream with delight. What happened next surprised and amazed her even more\u2026\u2026\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Vera watched open mouthed as the white cloud almost felt its way into every corner of the room. At the same time the room filled with an incredible perfume. Vera in once sense should have been very scared but yet she knew Anna and her love so was exhilarated. She smiled as she breathed in the gas cloud deeply and let it fill every space in her lungs etc. It was so gorgeous she didn\u2019t even choke or cough. At one and the same time the gas cloud filled more and more of the room and even looked as if it was getting thicker. It snaked towards Vera and eventually surrounded every curve of Vera gorgeous voluptuous leather clad form and filled every crevice\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Vera had this most odd sensation. It was a tingling feeling all over from the top of her gorgeous blonde haired head to the soles of her expensive shiny black boots. She looked at herself\u2026..she was growing! Slowly at first but then it got quicker. Her 850 feet quickly became 900 feet, then 950 feet, 1,000 feet, then 1,050, then 1,100 , then 1,150, and still she grew\u2026\u2026\u2026as she grew the white cloud gradually disappeared almost as if being sucked in by the expanding form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmmm, this is soooo coooool!\u201d, exclaimed Vera ecstatically. As soon as the growth started Vera felt even better, all her doubts, worries, aches, pains, hangover all vanished. \u201cThanks, baby!\u201d, she spoke out to her out of town lover as if she was next to her, knowing that she will meet her again soon. \u201cCould Anna have grown too?\u201d was a thought that went through Vera\u2019s head, the peacefulness in her heart suggested that she knew the answer\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrow, baby, grow!\u201d, cried Vera, as she continued her growth, getting taller and taller by the second. Soon she found herself crashing through the roof of her pad. \u201cOoops!\u201d, said Vera almost mockingly putting her gloved finger to her mouth, \u201cbut I guess I won\u2019t be needing this anymore, haha\u201d.  Vera grew and grew and grew. As her former pad dissolved underfoot as her booted feet grew she looked around, gloved hands on tight leather trousered hips, and again breathed in deeply\u2026\u2026\u201daaaaah! This is soooo good!\u201d . She pressed down on the remaining wreckage of her house, as she did so a surge of energy coursed through her body, arousal, every crushing stomp brought pleasure.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked round at her now tiny garden, she could even look over the small mountains that surrounded where she lived and had a panoramic view of the landscape she had counted as her neighbourhood, much of it now in ruins after the happenings of recent days\u2026\u2026.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs she stood there her phone rang, it was Anna:-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHiiiiii, baby, how was it for you?\u201d, asked Anna almost suggestively. Vera replied jokingly in kind \u201corgasmic!\u201d, they both had a giggle before Vera said, \u201cthis is sooooo cool, I\u2019m like 3,000ft, and can see all around, I can even see where we first met from here, no need for a motorbike for me, heehee\u201d. \u201cMe too, baby, when I left the surrounds of your house, I grew too, as I am able to, and I\u2019m also at 3,000 feet. I had a smashing time, look around again, see the new ruins?\u201d. Vera looked and sure enough she saw heavy bootprints imprinted on the landscape, with debris of towns, roads, all sorts, in them as far as even Vera\u2019s eyes could see. The thought of the destruction she could now do as well made her lick her lips with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ready to join me in creating mayhem, to lay waste this pathetic planet?\u201d, Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeaaaah!, Can\u2019t wait! Where are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember you mentioned the place called New York? Well it\u2019s not such a great city now, haha! What you called the Empire State Building was a bit fragile and as for that funny green woman with a torch, well I\u2019ve put it in my pocket as a souvenir\u2026\u2026.don\u2019t worry I have left something for you\u201d..\u201dcooool\u201d. She had visions of gorgeous Anna kicking over the icons of New York and standing amidst blazing fires, and loved the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera was feeling really good. All those years of being isolated on this tiny planet, not really knowing who she was, but now this what she was born for. The indifference to tinies and their surroundings, her tantrums when she didn\u2019t get what she wanted\u2026\u2026..manifestations of the goddess she was meant to be?.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake your time\u2026\u2026.relax and enjoy\u2026.I\u2019ll come out and meet you if you want and then we can go back there together\u2026\u2026.they thought one was bad enough, now they will have two\u2026.\u201d. \u201dHeehee\u201d\u2026\u2026..they both giggled in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Vera set off\u2026\u2026..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why hadn\u2019t all the tinies escaped? This was a fair question, partly conditioning, to have escaped would have meant much greater wrath on the earth from an angry petulant spoilt giantess brat who would think nothing of mass slaughter and destruction if she felt like it. The strange and ironic thing now is that having found her destiny (and her love) and can now properly indulge in mass slaughter and destruction she was beginning to calm down and not be so volatile, it was almost as if it was growing pains before she became a true destroyer of worlds. Another reason was simply that much of the local infrastructure had been destroyed in the last few days. In the past the rampages were less frequent and much more localised and often with some warning (from the earthly authorities and an expensive herculean effort meant some semblance of normality was restored very quickly, but recently the rampages were more frequent and wider in area, they were also random and with no notice, the earthly authorities in the shape of her father and friends had been sidelined and taken away. So millions upon millions of tinies now had no chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looking down at the wreckage and smiling almost evilly Vera was about to go through the exit, a gap in the hills. Sensuously stroking the hilltops with gloved hand as she went through the gap, many trees, communications masts and an observatory were obliterated, she came out into the open vistas of the countryside. Being much taller now, she could see a lot further. Folding her arms, gloved hands resting on or under the opposing arm, she surveyed the scene. This was the side she hadn\u2019t previously wrecked but it was noticeable that every few hundred yards there were huge craters in the landscape with everything unlucky enough to be there crushed underneath. Every so often there was random more serious destruction. \u201cMmmmmm, bootsteps\u201d, purred Vera, \u201cmy Anna\u2019s bootsteps, what an example to follow, heehee!\u201d. So she did literally follow in Anna\u2019s footsteps\u2026\u2026(or at least in the general direction, Anna said take her time so Vera did, relishing smashing everything as she went), heading towards being able to meet her gorgeous lover again, in New York\u2026\u2026.</span></div></div>",

The contours of the land mattered little as hills which used to be an issue even at 850ft were dismissed as uneven ground as her booted feet crunched onwards. \u201cMmmm, I would love to level mountains\u201d, said Vera to herself, \u201ceven without that, this is soooo cool\u201d, as she paused to empty a stalled train as she had wrecked the overhead a few steps earlier. The 100s and 100s of tiny specks fell to their deaths much to Vera\u2019s amusement as she snapped the chocolate mint size carriages in 2, one by one. The electric doors were shut and the escape mechanisms were only just activating so there were not many escapees. She even bit one or 2 carriages in half and then realised her mouth was full of bugs, before hurriedly spitting them out, \u201ceewwwww, disgusting! Ants!\u201d, before washing her mouth out with water from the bottle she carried in her matching leather shoulder bag, at the same time carelessly wading through an industrial area. As the power station amongst other things crumbled under careless booted feet the electricity started going off all around. If people hadn\u2019t noticed what was going on already they started to realise something was going on now. As the landscape started to get more urban now it was small suburban towns that started getting demolished under the relentless tramp of Vera\u2019s boots. She really wanted to destroy more than she was doing though to those on the ground it was even as it was catastrophic to lives and property and the landscape (crushed trees were in the millions, too), but there was an even greater desire in her, tugging at her heart as she so casually devastated the landscape, she sooooo wanted to see Anna.

Most of the time it was coexistence, and manageable most of the time too, and Vera\u2019s demands frequently did good things for the world economy\u2026\u2026.but now it was different, Vera had blossomed into a young woman and worst of all she had discovered her destructive destiny\u2026\u2026.and Anna was part of that\u2026\u2026\u2026.Anna shrugged at the lack of military presence and carried on destroying things\u2026\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera meanwhile was also carrying on destroying things as she strolled nonchalantly along.

With a nonchalant rub of a gloved hand she wiped the hillside clean of all vegetation, houses and other buildings, radio towers, people, it would have been sooo uncomfortable even though wearing skin tight leather trousers, and sat down clutching her phone, crossing her legs, \u201ccooooeeee!\u201d, she shouted down the phone, \u201cI\u2019m over here\u2026..\u201d, she waved in the direction of Anna, who had quickly turned round in what was the area of JFK airport and waved back, and blew a kiss which Vera reciprocated\u2026..\u201dbe with you shortly, love you!\u201d, Vera said, \u201clove you, too\u201d, replied Anna, as they both switched off their phones and  continued their separate orgies of death and destruction, and looked forward to joining together to smash New York and the eastern seaboard, which wasn\u2019t far away both in distance and time........<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They have every reason to be fearful, as the 2 goddesses already had the blood of multi millions figuratively on their hands. Folding her arms she looked at her leather gloved hands against the leather of the jacket and smiled and started wading through the increasingly heavily populated landscape towards Anna. Block after block crumbled under her boots, but Vera really couldn\u2019t care, this world will be a ruin once she\u2019s finished and on to the next, devastation is her destiny. Pausing to catch an airliner, laden with escapees, which she promptly and peremptorily crushed almost as an automatic reaction, she carried on walking accompanied by booms and crunches. Suddenly she noticed the debris in her hand, \u201coooo, did I really do that without even thinking about, cooool\u201d, as she dropped the wadded metal and the remains of 600 passengers far to the ground.

It actually didn\u2019t take her long to find what she was looking for, an international airport, too bad it was the other side of the city she was destroying as she walked through it. The city of 2 million souls had been relatively spared, with a swathe cut through it like a giant tornado, but now just when everybody else was breathing again, she giggled and smiled, and turned. She walked across the city with almost indecent haste so keen was she to get to the airport, and then on to Anna, but tell that to the 10s of 1000s who perished with each impatient boot step, so she got there quite quickly and, leather clad booted legs astride amidst the flames of a burning suburb she put leather gloved hands on hips. Masses of blonde hair were flying and chunky jewellery gleaming as her face beamed at the sight before her, an international airport, with airliners of the world there, what a way to introduce herself as a destroyer of the rest of the world.

Her tiny employees had mostly made themselves scarce as they knew she was in one of those moods, happy but very unconcerned and careless, a number who hadn't escaped or couldn't escape found themselves red blotches underfoot which transferred to the white carpet in the lounge as she walked in there. Immediately she went to her large fridge and brought out a bottle of champagne, and posing and dancing, and shaking her tight jeans clad booty in front of her large mirror, holding the bottle in various ways, something she delighted in as there was nobody of her own size to interact with, so why not yourself. She was singing and dancing, she was hyper. Immediately she shook the bottle and let the cork fly. As the champagne went everywhere and the cork smashed anther ornament, missing the the mirror this time much to the relief of any employees and with a fake \"oops\" as she put her ringed hand over her mouth, before giggling she started swigging the champagne like there was no tomorrow.

Even after such a short time her hyper behaviour caused the alcohol to reach her bloodstream quicker so she was already beginning to get buzzed. Then came the 3rd bottle. Having gulped that down as well she was onto the fourth. Unsteady on her booted feet now, she started doing what she often did when drunk.........</span></div></div>",

We don't want another incident like last time to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large, broadly built man lumbered down a walkway, clad in a crisp black business suit, a thin man in a labcoat, hal his stature, scurrying behind. The big man was known as Joseph Cartington, AKA the richest and most influential man in the world. He has his hands in every single financial oppurtunity available, and much of the known world buys millions of his products and stocks daily. Nobody knows he he rose to power and wealth, but the same could said about the mystery of his daughter, Vera Cartington. Nobody knows how she came to be the biggest living being in all of existance.Some guessed it was a freak evolution of nature, while others conspire to think that Joseph purposely mutated his daughte at birth for reasons unknown but to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhead of the two men, they approached a large spaceship, a rocket that would take them to their destination. As they boarded, the thin man gulped and began to nervously speak again.\"I'm....I'm ninety-nine point nine pecent s-s-s-sure that your daughter w-will not be in one of her moods today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd better be right,\"Joseph grunted as he strapped into a seat inside the ship, the automated pilot activating and the thrusters engaging to send them into space.\"Because if you're not,\"He continued to berate the scientist, who sat in a seat across from him.\"We'll have another huge mess to clean up, and it'll be on you head this time.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mess he was referring to before, happened exactly sixteen years before. Vera was four years old at the time, and her growth rate had just began to multiply exponentially. Even at her toddler age, she was already an astounding 400ft. in height. And as children are, she was completely unreasonable at the time. Her nannies, yes she had an entire squadron of nannies to care or her, had trie to get her to lie down for a quick nap. But the situation quickly escalated into a catastrophe. Vera went on a rampage, destroying the city near the Cartington Estate, it taking dozens upon dozens of tranquilizer darts to just daze her. She fell with a mighty thud to sleep, so Joseph Cartington made sure that in the years to come, Vera would be kept happy at all times to prevent destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rocket climbed higher and higher through the atmosphere and into the blackness of outer space, a sense of scale was beginning to take place. Joseph looked out the window beside him, chuckling at his daughter's sheer size and power. Literally, earth was her foot stool. Vera Cartington, age 20, was massive on a galactic scale. She had her bare feet propped up on half the planet, her toes alone countries by rights of size. She rested by laying back on an asteroid perfect for her size that she had personally found while floating out one day, and had made it into her personal chair. The rocketship blasted further and further on towards Vera's face, so that she would be able to spot and communicate with them. That day she wore tight denim jeans and a dark red sweater, the soft crimson fabric stretching tightly around her chest area, her breasts easily double the size of earth, planetary in their own right as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoseph chuckled once more, thinking back to how they achieved such a feat to keep the biggest thing in existance alive.It started out with the thought that since earth's resoures would have been quickly depleted by Vera in a matter of day, why not steal resources from other planets? Not many disagreed, so Cartington Companies began to cipher away materials rom planets all across the solar system, a bountiful array of food, fabrics, and other necessities for the astronomical woman were made. Strangely, she rarely need to eat or drink, or even <i>breath</i> for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship's travel came to an end, and floated in ront of Vera's ear, her strands of golden hair around them thick enough to drill through planetoids. Joseph unstrapped himself and walked to the front of the ship, pressing a button on the control panel to activate the intercom.\"Hello pumpkin.\"He greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy! I thought you'd never get here!!\"Vera giggled in a deep southern accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I always try to please my baby girl. Now, what did you want to call me all the way up here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy, I want to....\"</span></div></div>",

As Joseph handed over his credit card (made huge so Vera could hold it) he breathed a sigh of relief that she seemed reasonably content that day. He smiled as Vera zipped up her favourite Louboutin knee length boots over her close fitting jeans and put on her cashmere coat, her silk scarf and pulled on a pair of expensive looking soft black leather gloves, and a big shoulder bag/purse over her shoulder ready to go out. Uninhabited planetoids were around for Vera to use as stepping stones to go shopping. She stepped on 2 and arms folded stood facing Joseph and the  spaceship before waving and blowing a kiss in his direction. All of a sudden she stretched out an arm and plucked a planet out of space and holding it in her gloved hand ate it like an apple. Joseph was horror struck, that planet had 12 billion inhabitants and his daughter was snacking, but he could do nothing for fear of even worse.

Everything must be subsumed to the pleasure of his beautiful goddess daughter and Joseph was so pleased when he saw that what he had done was beyond what he needed to have done.

Mankind felt the pressure of a celestial object like her feet moving towards them. Mankind finally realized that she was divine. Everyone shouted as loud as they could and began to worship for their lives to be spared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow you guys really are germs. you are all worshiping me but all I can hear is a little squeak. If it was not for my hypersensitivity I would not be able to understand you. Although I do not like what I am hearing. Not only are you germs weak but now I know what you are stupid. Obviously you could never even compare to me in anyway but I at least expected you to be able to follow simple commands. You are requesting me to spare your lives. No, you beg me for the honor of worshiping me, for the privilege of dying under my divine body.

She put them down very gently. In her point of view. To the Earth it was an apocalyptic strike. The entire planet began to crack, seas were vaporized yet no one died. All of Mankind began to run towards the feet and showered them with kisses and licks. They thanked her for the honor of being allowed to worship her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Vera brought one her country sized toes down on her worshipers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See germs that's how you should be worshiping me , do not get me wrong, its still pathetic but its entertaining so I as a reward I let some of you die beneath my divine body.\" Vera giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMankind realized that they were powerless before Vera but still worshiped her even though they knew they were doomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Daddy, I have conquered the Earth, I am their Goddess, are you proud of me\" Vera giggled <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoseph stared flabbergasted at Vera.

He and some of his friends had heard about the gorgeous giantess and had instantly gone to seek her out. She had asked them to play a game, and of course they had agreed. Now out of five 14 year old guys, he was the only one left. The others had been 'found' and taken. Dead, dying, eaten, it didn't matter. Anthony had only heard them screaming as she lifted them into the air. Risking a glance out the window, he saw a deserted dirt road with one old car parked outside. He sighed, thinking he was safe for the moment. Suddenly, a huge foot came down and crushed the car flat. An eye loomed through the window, along with a mischievous smile. Anthony had been found. With an ear-splitting tearing sound, the giantess tore the roof off like tinfoil. She was easily 75 feet tall, and only clad in tight-fitting shorts and a blue bikini. She smiled down on Anthony as her hand descended to scoop up the screaming teenager.<br>\r\n\"Yes!!! I win again!\" she yelled, almost popping his eardrums. He cringed, expecting to be popped like a grape. He prayed his parents wouldn't find out he'd died from his own stupidity. But then he was back on the ground. Slowly, he opened his eyes. When he wasn't smeared by her foot, he risked a glance up. She was still smiling down on him.<br>\r\n\"Umm...aren't you gonna kill me or something?\" he asked. The giantess looked mortified.<br>\r\n\"No!! I only kill perverts, psychos, and a couple people on accident. I've only killed 43 people this year!\" she said excitedly. It was late April.<br>\r\n\"Then where are my friends?\" he demanded, growing bolder now that he felt safer. Then she took a step closer, and he jumped back with a yelp as her sandals landed where he'd been standing a moment ago. She was digging around in the back of her pants and hadn't been paying attention. Finally, she pulled four other dazed guys from her massive ass. She carefully placed them down by the startled Anthony.<br>\r\n\"Hey, thanks for coming by! It gets kinda lonely out here. Oh, and by the way my name's Jaz! I think we missed that earlier. Come visit again!\" she said excitedly as they stumbled out of the park gates. Jaz turned away, and returned to her couch made from flattened trailers and lots of specially-made mattresses. This construction had been made by several creeps she'd caught spying on her one day, and had accepted the week of labor over the punishment she had given one of their companions. It had gotten out of control, and had ended very badly for him. But now they were all gone, and probably wouldn't try again. The sun was setting now and Jaz decided to...</span></div></div>",

Sadly, he found out the answer was yes, he is following you, and he has a gun to kill you.  The sound of a silenced gunshot was barely audible and it seemed as though the bullet hole formed in the trailer in front of him.  Seth turned the corner, still running as fast as he could.  He didn't remember ever coming here, but with all the trailer parks around, there's no way he could have seen them all.  He takes frantic turns in the maze of mobile homes, praying he wasn't found.  He was, but not by the man with a gun.  He saw a shadow fall over him.  \"Hi!\" The voice sounded above him and he looked up.  There stood a massive girl.  If all the trailer parks, he had run into this one.  He let out a sound similar to that of someone being punched in the stomach.  He took off running again, this time from two people who he assumed wanted to end his life.  She started to walk behind him.  \"Why are you running?\" Her footsteps would occasionally cause Seth to stumble, and continue.  Everyone who grew up in the town have heard about this trailer park and the monster who lives in it.  He kept running until there stood the man.  Hood over his eyes, sweatshirt, baggy pants.  He watched this man kill someone.  He is the new target, being the only witness.  He stood, frozen.  He stood between two things that most people Seth their pants or cry with one or the other.  Seth threw himself to the ground and heard the whizz of a bullet above him.  He heard the man swear and pull the clip of his gun out.  Seth barreled towards him, hitting the man at full speed and sending the gun into mid-air and catching it.  A clip sat on the ground and he scoops it up, inserting it into the gun.  He trained it on the man's head until he heard the tremor.  He turned to see a hand scoop him up and put him level with the girl's face, and she looked......</span></div></div>",

Swallowing and involuntarily bringing up an image of his own body being sucked down her throat, he forced out some words.<br>\r\n\"He was chasing me. I just knocked him down and took the gun. I wasn't going to hurt him, I swear!!\" he stammered. She didn't look satisfied. She picked up the other man, who was recovering from seth's hit. She stared at him severely, too.<br>\r\n\"You two have both tried to kill each other, and you've disturbed my sleep. I'm not very pleasant when I'm tired, so you two are going to stay with me all night and I'll deal with you in the morning. Now good night!\" Jaz turned towards her trailer bed, and Seth said something about how she was going to keep them there. The giantess had already thought of this problem, and dropped them down the back of her panties. The tight fabric squeezed the two against her massive ass, leaving barely enough room to breathe, much less escape. Seth heard Jaz start snoring, and prayed that she wouldn't roll over.</span></div></div>",

As her huge ass fell on her bed she heard a crunching sound. Suddenly remembering the two men she'd put down her panties, she quickly stood up and looked down. Her bed was empty aside from a small convertible that had been put there from a recent game. She notice that one side looked like she had sat on it. The cobwebs of sleep were still clouding the giantess's mind, and she didn't think to check her underwear. Instead she walk through her trailer park, going down to the small stream across from the rest of the town. She bent over to take a drink from the water when she heard screaming from behind her. Jaz turned around to see what the commotion was. A crowd of people had gathered outside the fence and were pointing at her rear.<br>\r\n\"Hey you pervs, stop staring at my ass!\" she said, taking a step towards the onlookers. Some shouted things about crushing them like she did to him and ran off. Jaz was confused until she remembered her two visitors last night. She looked down at her butt and saw Seth smeared against the fabric and the other man outlined by her tight underwear. Quickly, she ran away from the edge of her park and peeled the bodies off her body. Luckily, only a few people had seen them. Jaz needed to get rid of the bodies, and she brought the first man up to her mouth. She popped him in and chewed the man up. She admitted to herself that the humans did taste pretty good. She swallowed, and then brought Seth up. Just as he was about to go into her gaping mouth, she saw his arm raise and he started pleading with her. Jaz, being a mostly good person, stopped for a second. But she realized that nobody would ever know if she ate a person who wasn't quite dead yet. Plus, she thought again, they taste REALLY good. Seth followed the other man down Jaz's throat.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A loud yawn echoed throughout half the world as a planetary alarm clock, a sign that Jaz was awakening from her sleep. The young teenage girl, barely 16 and a half towered over the mountains beside her enormous body with absolute ease. Many of them weren't even up to par with her fingers; more were crushed by the simple motions of a girl sleeping. She was clad in an equally large gray bra and shorts, tightly fitting against her voluptuous, yet still-growing, body. Her form was a sight to die for, and many often did in fact. Late night people hiking the mountains for a chance to see Jaz's <i>mountains</i>; not many of them returned. All it took was one brush of her large arm, a simple rolling of her body, or maybe even just a yawn. This was Jasmine \"Jaz\" Renee Truitt, the greatest wonder in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't always so big, nor so beautiful. She was born as a normal-sized baby, like everyone else. But due to something\u2026some mutation\u2026some influence\u2026some sort of phenomena had caused Jaz to grow in increasing increments over the course of her life. By the time she was two she was 15 feet tall, by four 35 ft. Leading up to the present, where Jaz towered over all at an awe-rendering 89-miles tall. With boobs the size of some countries, a face just as big, toes the size of medium-sized cities and hands big enough to hold the Earth itself it seemed. Given her personality and age, it seemed a dangerous combination. Teenage girls weren't known for their emotional control; and in some parts of the world her race as a black girl made people worry too. But it seemed for nothing, Jaz was a bit mischievous, teasing, rude, even demanding at certain points, but she was a good girl. Thank God, because her toes alone could dominate the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a large scale project keeping the giantess alive and healthy. Various corporations dedicated themselves to Jaz's food, clothing, and other needs. Since she was born in America, despite her size, she was considered American. And America wanted to make sure it stayed that way. Otherwise other countries might try to turn Jaz into a weapon\u2026one that could not be stopped. Surprisingly, it somehow led to Jaz being normal in terms of personality. In fact, she had a large number of friends across the world. She was quite popular, for very obvious reasons. Her legs rose to the heavens, her breasts could house thousands, and her feet were admittedly cute and large. She was just a looker all around, and her size gave her features that extra touch that drove many perverts wild. It didn't really affect Jaz though, she knew she was awesome. Heck, on occasion she felt like a sort of Goddess over the planet. So long as she was happy she didn't really care what people said or thought about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis mammoth of a beauty slowly stirred awake from her resting place, an unrealistically large plain of land made to resemble a large-scale carpet of sorts, separated from the rest of the world by mountains that rose just to the tips of Jaz's toes. It was large enough to accommodate Jaz and offer some small space, a few feet from her perspective. Resting on the edge of the water, on top of what were once mountains were the two tennis shoes Jaz regularly wore, situated beside a pair of similarly colored sandals she wore on rare occasions. Kept in good condition and placed near the exterior of her own private land. It was amazing to any onlookers to see the violet-colored shoes with their white treads and the light purple soles of the sandals rise so far above the many mountains they could never hope to climb. Not too far from that was another clear plowing of what-was-once-mountain, essentially made to serve the purpose of a clothes drawer. Neatly folded in place there were five shits, three pants, two pairs of shorts, and a couple changes of underwear and pajamas. Grumbling slightly, Jaz extended a hand towards the clothes pile, patting her hand against the Earth in seismic booms as she attempted to locate her outfits. More mountains crumbled to dust from the sheer power of her hand. Just barely her slender fingers managed to grasp the edge of a shirt, just in time to save more miles of mountain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh\u2026wait\u2026I need to take a bath first\u2026\" Jaz grumbled as the faint rumblings of her movements awoke the more stubborn denizens of the planet. Many of them jumped to their windows (Perverts obviously) Hoping to catch a glimpse of the gigantic girl cleaning herself. It was risky though. Along with her rude attitude, Jaz made it painfully clear anyone who messes with her would pay. People who peeped often never did again if they got caught; Jaz herself never killed a soul though. Even if she did, many would consider it worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she rose to her feet Jaz let her shorts fall off with some skilled wiggling of her hips, exposing a bare bottom to the world. With a click unhooking of her bra, soon all of her was bare. And she had a look on her face that said she wasn't the slightest bit concerned someone was watching. Because if they were\u2026her toes would have a nice chat with them. She remembered one time she got a guy so scared he kissed her feet to let him off the hook, at that point Jaz let out a bit of a laugh and agreed to it. But she never quite forgot the feeling that came with someone submitting to her. It's become something of a punishment to anyone caught peeping; they'll have to submit her in some way. Never anything overly bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfidently the giantess stepped over the mountains that were her footwear and placed a foot into the ocean, it sank to just around halfway through her toe. Another step and her ankle were submerged. Several steps later, at the very deepest part of the ocean, Jaz was submerged to about her waist; and with enough room, she sprawled her body out a bit and allowed everything up to her neck to be underwater. Her large breasts floated up near the surface moments after going under. With a quick movement of the hand she quickly deposited her glasses on the shoreline by her belongings; a small cracking of mountains could be heard from their weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh\u2026\" Jaz happily sighed, picking up some underwater coral with her toes and bringing them out into the open air, just so she could drop the large-scale chunks of rock back in as if they were pebbles. Many people caught sight from the shore Jaz's looming bare soles, dropping miniature mountains back into the ocean with ease. It was just a playful act to her; to them it was a display of the highest level of power. It's why no one messed with her\u2026why no one could mess with her. The loud girlish giggle of the girl seemed like the voice of a Goddess at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hmm?</i> A small sound escaped passed Jaz's lips as she felt movements within the confines of her cleavage. Her eyes weren't that great (Hence the glasses) but she was good enough up close, what she saw made her giggle a little bit. The feeling on her breast was a whale, a great white whale flopping around on her boob due to being forced out of its habitat by the large mammary. Jaz gently lifted the creature up with her fingernail, smiling serenely at it. \"There there\u2026.\" She carefully placed him back in the water, where it instantly swam away. It was the kind of thing that proved Jaz was a good person at heart, pretty much the only reason why no one acted against her when she was younger. But now, it wasn't like they could anyway. It was a bit relieving to many people that she hadn't quite realized that no matter what, the world couldn't do a single thing to stop her. Jaz gave another look to her chest before leaning back some, submerging her head for a moment to clean it. Obviously there was no shampoo for someone of Jasmine's size, that would be just silly. But the girl's hair seemed to have adapted to that over time, as it seemed to naturally clean with water. On top of that, it was trained to come back in the same style as it dried. Quite convenient for one of 89-miles height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 20 minutes passed before Jaz stepped back on to her land. She had no towels but it seemed her ground/carpet bed was designed to absorb some small amount of liquid. She often wondered how it was possible to cover an entire landmass for someone of her size, or to craft clothes like hers, or make her glasses or shoes\u2026Jaz never dwelled on that sort of thing for long though. She laid on her back and began to smile as the sun helped dry her body. Not long later, she deemed it was dry enough to put on some underwear. For today the giantess decided on a blue bra and panties, both tightly fitting of course. Next came a pair of shorts, dark blue jean-shorts that came mid-thigh and of course, tightly fitting. They fit when she first got them, but Jaz was still growing after all. She reached for a shirt but paused, a shrug came along with her loud, echoing words. \"Eh, I'll just go without a shirt today. It feels nice\u2026\" Millions cheered as they heard that.  She drew the same conclusion about shoes. So barefoot, in shorts and a bra, Jaz placed her glasses on her face. \"And I know just what to do!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As of late, Jaz had been quite bored. Not too surprising, 89-mile high women couldn't exactly do everything the typical teenage girl could. It was usually due to this boredom that in long periods of time, Jaz would feel like stirring up a bit of mischief, like now. From up in the clouds, the giantess saw in the distance a city, one all too familiar. <i>Perfect</i>, she smirked, taking the first of the dozen or so steps needed to get there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife was the same as always in New York, busy, bustling, same stuff, different day. People drove from place to place, talking on their phones, people were shopping, working, it was another normal old day. Then the sun seemed to go out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Earth trembled, almost all traffic stopped instantly. It was a familiar sound, but it still worried the people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>BOOM</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt came again, louder, stronger, and most importantly, closer. The shadow that hung over the city extended, reaching over halfway into the entire state. Many were grateful for the insurance they purchased, although they still feared for the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">BOOM</font></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was closer than ever; all of New York turned in the direction of the familiar booms. Many caught themselves looking at the Statue or Liberty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">BOOM!!!</font></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Liberty suddenly seemed so insignificant against the seemingly-infinite mountain of cocoa brown behind her, half a mere toe in comparison to the true icon of America. All of New York craned their necks as high as they could go; few managed to actually see anything past the calf without being a good distance away. Standing so high and proud above the state of New York was Jaz, America's one and only giantess. With her hands on her hips, and a smile on her face, many knew what she had come for. Many questioned why New York though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaz craned her neck down to see the puny bug-sized Statue of Liberty. \"<i>That's</i> the statue of Liberty? <b>LA-ME!\" </b>She made no effort to lower her voice; as a result, her voice alone was enough to make very small portions of the statue crack. The whole State of New York\u2026heck, all the people in America who heard (Which meant about\u2026<i>all</i> of America) were offended. No one had a single thought to voice an objection though. Jaz smirked and proceeded, \"Now, I think I would make a much better monument. Wouldn't you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot many people said anything; a short, impatient stomp from Jaz had half the country muttering in agreement. \"Alright, then I guess I'm the new Lady Liberty eh?\" She stared a bit playfully at the original Statue of Liberty, crumbling just from her presence. \"That means we don't need this old thing anymore.\" What came next was one of the most controversial things Jaz ever did; but she was a teenager, she didn't fully grasp everything that was important in the Statue of Liberty. Those who did, could only stare horrified as Jaz raised her biggest toe and moved it over the statue. The giantess didn't realize it, but there were roughly a hundred people in range of that toe, over 90 of them on the island with Lady Liberty. There was no time to get away; there was no way of knowing they were there. After all, each of those people were mere specks to Jaz, she didn't know people gave a damn about the statue when they had a real live giantess. She was completely oblivious as she lowered her toe. The beautiful sight of her well-kept, destructive bare toe was the last thing those hundred people saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany gasped at the latest result of Jaz's mischief. All they could see was her toe wiping away the very island itself, all ships, all people; all debris joined the ocean and washed away along with the evidence on the giantess' foot. Jaz chuckled, \"Now let's give it up to the real big lady in this country!\" Few wanted to, all cheered. Jaz didn't know how deeply she terrified the people with her latest display of power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe faintest sound of a crash echoed into the giantess' ear, and her left boob suddenly felt like something poked it. The black giantess didn't have to struggle to realize what it was; after all it wasn't the first time. Jaz examined where her breast felt the small poke and, sure enough, there was a crashed plane on her boob. No doubt Jaz arriving messed up all the flight plans, and left no room to escape, so they crashed into the softest place they could. It was a bit of a relief to the giantess to see the small specks of people escaping alive from the plane. She lowered her fingernail near her bra, \"Can you guys get on?\" Her voice seemed to have lost all its mischief. As always, when she was aware people were in danger, Jaz turned into an angel and showed her true self. Many people became relieved as they saw the reminder Jaz wasn't bad at heart, no one could forget what just happened though. Even as the giantess lowered the people back on to shore, people still stared at her nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the people were safe, Jaz decided to have some fun disposing of the wreckage of the plane. Nothing overly fancy, she just gave it a small push into her cleavage and, from there, smashed it flat between her boobs. The plane was wiped completely from existence with the force she used. Jaz laughed, \"I'm having fun you guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was the problem; how would she keep up the fun without hurting anyone (Knowingly)? Quite the conundrum. In order to help thing properly the giantess seated herself in the ocean. Being so shallow in comparison to deeper water, it was as if she sat on shore; yet being so big, Jaz's butt was actually <i>on</i> shore. The more perverted people were already on their way for this rare chance. The giantess didn't even notice as she got lost in her own thoughts about what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was now the new Lady Liberty\u2026maybe she could show off to other countries? Nah\u2026then she wouldn't be able to keep having fun with New York. How much fun could you have with a city when you just took down its most popular monument though? She didn't know why, but suddenly the memory of the first man to ever submit to her popped into Jaz's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about a year ago, Jaz was close to 67-miles tall and her breasts were, (by her standards) C's, borderline D's. One day, she was just sleeping, when she was woken up by this weirdest feeling\u2026When she opened her eyes, there was this man\u2026<i>humping</i> her boob! Naturally Jaz got insulted and angry fast, but she made sure to keep her voice low so the rest of the world wouldn't find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just <i>what</i> do you think you're doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man couldn't come up with a good excuse; he never imagined he'd be caught. The sequence of events after that got a bit hazy but Jaz remembered she lowered the man on to her big toe and walked around, that was scary enough for him in itself. But the whole time she talked to him, talked about how she despised perverts and had no qualms toying with them, torturing them, or even crushing them. Now, Jaz didn't know if she'd really go that far, but she was mad enough to at that time. The man was terrified, literally hanging on to the edge of Jaz's toe for dear life as she walked. At some point he reached the point he was holding on to a print as if it were the edge of a cliff. He begged, he begged like a baby, but Jaz was too mad to care. She was violated after all. That was when, in his desperation, the man did something that no one else who angered Jaz ever did. He cried and kissed her foot as a means of appeasement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock alone was enough to snap Jaz out of her rage, and it surprised her by how nice it felt to have someone submit to her like that. After that she was sort of in a rush so it got hazy again, but the man was returned home, and she never saw him again. When she got back to her own landmass, Jaz thought long and hard about what the man did. Over the next year she often did in fact, and she realized she liked it enough to make it a regular thing, torturing someone til they submit. But at the same time, the giantess didn't want to just become some evil monster. So she reached a conclusion, that she'd never do it to anyone, <i>unless</i> that person or persons: exploited her like perverts, were mean enough to her that she got bad, or, were just simply bad people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this moment Jaz questioned if that was such a good idea. Sure, many didn't deserve it, and she did it to those who do\u2026But it was never sufficient. It was, at best, a person a month. Jaz was a teenager, she needed more than that. And she was smart enough to realize it. She tried to find some rational way of going about it, or some alternative\u2026an amendment to her rules that wouldn't be too bad\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought and thought, tapping her foot on the Earth with each moment in a series of booms that irritated so many people. Eventually\u2026She did do something\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The idea Jaz came up with surprised her with how far it'd go. But a rationalization came right along with it, and she didn't have any qualms about it then. She looked to her feet, soles submerged in the ocean, with a faint curiosity. Her toes wiggled, more booms to the Earth. All of New York watched nervously; they knew this wasn't over yet. That was confirmed when the giantess rose back to her feet in a series of tremors, large-scale chunks of the planet crumbling off of her like pebbles. Jaz looked over her shoulder to the city, \"<i>Hmm\u2026\" </i>She turned around and moved a hip to the side, laying a hand on it in an almost sassy pose. Her eyes seemed to be measuring all of New York. The state was roughly 250-miles wide, something capable of being destroyed by Jaz obviously, but it was big enough some people had a chance of escaping from the giantess' 17-mile long feet. When Jaz began to move, they thought that would be the case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver a million eyes traced Jaz's leg up to the thigh where her shorts stopped, following the whole motion of her leg rising into the air. Jaz's foot loomed over 20-miles overhead, wet from the ocean, dropping beads of water as big as city blocks. Everyone watched, transfixed upon the brown foot as it hovered, not many could look far enough to see Jaz's smirk. \"Say \"Hi\" to my foot.\" She chuckled, lowering her foot very quickly. The screams of the speck-sized people never reached her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>BOOM!!!</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound made the whole word quiver, half of it shaking from the impact. Everyone who could see Jaz clearly saw her foot stomp into part of New York. It was quickly obvious though, that this was not the case. The bottom of her foot, the very lower tip, that was what slammed into New York, specifically, it slammed into a portion of the sizable butt print from when the giantess sat down mere minutes ago. It dug a whole a quarter of a mile deep, situating the entire foot as Jaz loomed her bare sole over as much of New York as she could. It stretched for barely 16-miles, casting a shadow for 30. Over 10,000 people were beneath the woman's hovering foot like bugs waiting to be crushed. Still dropping large bits of ocean, some small neighborhoods got flooded. Was Jaz just teasing them to their deaths?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaz cleared her throat to gather attention, \"Well, since I'm the new symbol of America\u2026I think I deserve a little something. Don't you agree?\" No one could respond, but the general thought was asking what she could possibly want. Jaz picked up on this, and wiggled her toes over the many people they threatened. \"It's nothing too bad\u2026I just\u2026I want you people down there to\u2026<i>worship</i> me...\" The look on her face was one of a girl playing a fun game, but it wasn't one joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe universal reaction could be summarized in one word. \"\u2026<i>What?\" </i>There was no denying Jaz's size or abilities, those alone enough to give her the stature and power of a Goddess of sorts. To ask for worship though\u2026that was a bit nuts, even for her. They wouldn't even know where to begin, and, if they didn't\u2026would Jaz actually crush so much? She was still a teenage girl despite her size; this sort of immaturity didn't come as too big of a surprise, just a shock that it was these people who were that unfortunate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm waiting~\" Jaz said with a faint melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone seemed to exchange looks with one another, no one sure what to do next. Their nervousness froze a majority in place. Jaz didn't take too kindly to that, \"<i>Hmph\u2026</i>I see how it is\u2026Maybe I can\u2026\" Her toes wiggled more water into people's homes, \"\u2026give you a <i>little</i> incentive\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one was sure what she meant until she did it. The sky seemed to be growing darker. Spaces seemed tighter. There was a rumbling sound from the bottom of Jaz's foot moving against the Earth. She was lowering her foot! Only one idea popped into everyone's minds. It wasn't doing what Jaz asked either. It was quite the opposite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Panic.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith mere minutes to live against Jaz's bare foot absolute anarchy spread instantly. People started screaming. Some trying desperately to drive out of range of Jaz's foot, traffic quickly backed up. Desperate people began attempting to steal, fight, or simply just start trouble. No one seemed to realize Jaz asked for something very simple. With each passing second the city grew darker beneath Jaz's shadow. And with each second the panic increased even more. All of the world watched as this unfolded, unsure of where things would go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaz's sole began touching the edges of small buildings, people expected them to crumble away instantly she continued her descent. Some did, many did not. Her descent stopped. The bottom of her sole was completely flat as the rest was now looming at a much closer position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really guys? I'm not asking for a lot, I just wanna see what it's like to be worshipped. I mean, it gets pretty boring out here for me. I just wanted to have some fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess' loud voice seemed to bring back reason to the people in a wave of calm. They were never in danger, she just wanted some fun\u2026Jaz was always known for being playful. Mischievous even. In their fear of her recent display of power, everyone seemed to have completely forgotten that fact. As well as the fact Jaz was a person like them. Even if it was out of fear, people began to give the black girl what she wanted. People began to bow before her looming foot. Those closer, as in, near where her foot was planted, even began to massage the small bottom of her skin supporting her entire foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaz let out a happy sigh. It was exactly as she'd imagined. Thousands of people, bowing, submitting to her like she was a Goddess\u2026Never had the girl had so much fun. She let out a girlish giggle, \"Thanks guys, this really made my day.\" Even if they acted out of fear; the innocent giggle of a teenage girl done right seemed to make a good deal of citizens feel good about themselves. The world over people breathed easy knowing Jaz hadn't gone evil on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After this I think I'll even let you guys hang in my boobs for a while\u2026\" She grinned. Plenty of people cheered, but not all as Jaz noticed. \"\u2026Or my feet\u2026butt\u2026mouth\u2026whatever makes you guys happy. I think you earned it.\" That got most of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess felt a small temptation to lower her foot so all it could be worshipped like that one man did\u2026kissing\u2026even licking\u2026That sounded wonderful. But doing so would undoubtedly crush all the people beneath her, and that simply wouldn't do. Jaz wouldn't deny it though, the thought was tempting enough to consider for a moment\u2026Just a moment though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Goddess Jaz\u2026Has a nice ring to it...</i>She whimsically thought; maybe during these little worship sessions she could get people to call her that. That'd be nice\u2026The idea of being a Goddess seemed perfect actually, given Jaz's height, power, and overall like of being worshipped. But she wasn't that mean. Perverts, Bad People, Mean People, and for Fun. It was a slight amendment to her principals, but she'd stick with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Jaz couldn't resist, her words came out before she even realized it. \"Would you guys mind\u2026<i>kissing\u2026</i>my foot\u2026?\" The many buildings up against her large soles gave the perfect spot to do so. And just once, to feel over 10,000 people submitting to her like that\u2026She'd be happy for the rest of the year\u2026She doubted anything would come or happen from it though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, something <i>did </i>happen\u2026<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nAt first it was very subtle. Being directly before the looming for of a giantess, many didn't notice at all. The giantess herself was far too happy with the recent fun she had to pay any mind to it at all. But a few people caught on. And almost all of the people outside of her foot's range noticed. Sooner of later, the rest of the people and Jaz noticed it too. Many of the speck-sized people in comparison had begun to climb buildings to give Jaz what she asked, mainly the people absolutely terrified and those who were into feet. Once on the roof beside her foot though, they noticed a few things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst off, the foot seemed to keep coming closer. It loomed just close enough that one could touch or worship it, but it kept approaching at a very slight pace\u2026the pace was quickening. If one looked to the distance where Jaz wasn't hovering her foot, they would see the shadow of her, stretching over more and more land with each passing moment. It was all too obvious what was happening, though many wished it wasn't so. Jaz's eyes widened with curiosity as she felt her foot pushing against the buildings more\u2026but she wasn't moving it. Her other foot seemed to have begun touching land too, and places that were fuzzy in the distance looked clearer\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm\u2026growing\u2026?\" Jaz muttered in surprise. With the realization it became so much clearer. The buildings Jaz so carefully placed her foot against were getting crushed by the growth of her body, as well as the people who obeyed her wish. All who were left simply stared as the already enormous giantess grew even larger. The 89-mile high Goddess was getting even higher\u2026faster and faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn its growth Jaz's body caused much destruction she hadn't intended. Her body's close position to the land for some fun quickly worked against her. The bottom of her foot she embedded into the ground expanded itself right on top of whoever was near it. It crushed those who worshipped her foot from the bottom as it grew to outsize the butt-print from before, and start growing on to the shoreline. Jaz's foot in the ocean brushed against coral as well as land as it began its own size-adjustments. Soon the toes were brushing over buildings, and crushing them upon contact. Hundreds were dead already, and it wasn't the worst part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was worst was Jaz's uplifted foot\u2026at least, once uplifted. In the process of expanding, the giantess' sole came closer and closer the ground, as well as expanding over more of it. Each second killed dozens if not hundreds, until finally the growth had caused Jaz's foot to touch the Earth itself. She couldn't move it either, as since she was growing, she had no idea what was stable anymore or if moving her foot would cause something worse to happen. The best thing she could do was sit still, and watch as her foot destroyed much in the process of growing even more dangerous. The very planet itself soon began to give way as Jaz was now stepping on it, all people beneath the illustrious beautiful foot dead and more dying as it only got bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWords couldn't come close to describing Jaz's heart at that moment. The whirlwind of emotions that was the heart of a teenage girl became a tempest, a hurricane dozens of times more powerful than any other emotional stage. The girl felt intense sadness at all the people she could feel crunching beneath her, yet so small she couldn't even see them aside from the dirt on it. Men, Women, Children\u2026all sorts of people had their lives cut short by her little game. Her guilt-ridden heart should've brought lakes of tears from her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut another few emotions prevented that. There was a sort of\u2026<i>perverse</i> pleasure Jaz was subconsciously gaining from all this. Her joy was to feel powerful and well\u2026this did the job. Simply by standing there, people were crumbling beneath her like bugs. <i>Goddess Jaz\u2026</i>She mentally repeated what she came up with minutes ago. At the moment, the words were as true and real as the giantess herself. As it was, Jaz had the power and stature of a Goddess\u2026she never quite realized how close she was to achieving her fantasy until now. She got her wish and what happened? She only got greater. Perhaps this was fate. Or maybe Jaz's body was telling her something her mind didn't\u2026maybe she was meant for this\u2026She felt so\u2026so <i>powerful.</i> As her height maxed out she felt she could crush small states and countries beneath her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two conflicting emotions battled it out. The perverse pleasure Jaz was gaining as a result of feeling powerful, and the overall kind and gentle nature she had. Both were a part of her. Both were right. Both were something she wanted. Which one was superior? Was enjoying herself and her new size what she wanted? Or did she want to go and mourn for those lost? Try to figure out something to do to prevent stuff like this again. She didn't know. As her emotions kept on arguing she stared at her foot as the growth finally subsided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't measure it with gaze alone, but Jaz's feet now encompassed 40-miles of solid land. Both feet dug nicely into New York and had thousands of lives splattered on their soles. Jaz herself towered over the entire state, at a looming 200-miles, more than double what she had been before. Her shadow completely blotted out all light in New York, as well as half of the neighboring states. Her body seemed to block out all of the sun for all the state residents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to do much else, Jaz raised her foot at long last and brought it back to the water, where she retreated. A few steps back, her feet were submerged again and she could feel the evidence of her destruction going away with the ocean's tides. Her eyes locked onto the two foot prints covering much of the city, one pretty much all on land, the other about halfway water, halfway land, both perfectly flattened and rounded to perfectly match Jaz's foot's shape. It was essentially nothing but dirt now. There were a few buildings left, but most of them were embedded deeply into the black girl's sole as she grew. They were no doubt currently being washed away by the water she stood in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world seemed to grow eerily quiet to the giantess. Her head was high enough now she couldn't even hear the lower world. All her thoughts turned to herself. Her clothes were barely on, literally, with each moment her bra and shorts had a few more rips and seams in them. It was like a woman wearing clothes built for kids. The already high-cut shorts now became a record for booty shorts, literally cutting about halfway into her bottom. They practically resembled underwear in shape at this point; none of her legs were covered. Jaz's expanded chest was barely contained in its feeble bra, but the garment held together well enough to do its job, admittedly barely. Jaz was lucky as far as her glasses went. Glass was hard to come by in pieces for someone of her size, so a scientist actually came up with a special invention that essentially made Jaz's glasses grow with her. For whatever reason it didn't apply to clothes but she head they were working on that. It'd be quite convenient in things like the current situation, in which she was revealing about as much as someone in a tight bathing suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was more attractive than ever, and the awe-rendered people were in awe for more than one reason because of that. No one was aware of the mental conflict going on inside the giantess right now. No one except her. It seemed something was decided though. As Jaz\u2026                                   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a sigh and her emotions whirling within her, tearing her mind and heart apart, Jaz proceeded to head back to her own island to think. She would definitely need the solitude. As she turned around and raised her right foot for the first step, the world was in awe. Previously at 89 miles, Jaz was already a sight to behold, as if a titan or even a god had descended to reside on earth. But now, at an astonishing 200 miles tall, the populace of the planet were either flabbergasted, terrified out of their wits, excited, or a combination of all three at the sight of Jaz. Her body stretched beyond the heavens, casting a shadow that spread halfway around the world, and most cities that survived her....'incident' on the shore nearby could barely see past her toes, the vast, cocoa brown monuments so high up that the clouds only reached the bottom fraction of the appendages. And when she began to walk, she tried to be as slow in pace as possible, but at her newest size, destruction was imminent. Her footsteps alone generated earthquakes and booms that reveberated around the area and created waves that crashed upon shorelines. With each step, Jaz cringed, praying that she hadn't caused too much trouble. As she neared her home, the walk back now only taking her five or six steps, she wasn't surprised to see that her home had changed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mountains running along the border of the island were now mere specks of dirt in comparison, all of her clothes and footwear wouldn't even fit her anymore, and the island itself was so small that if Jaz tried to sleep on it, she would have to curl up into a fetal position to fit. Even then, she was sure her head and legs would touch the ocean a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down on the island, creating another seismic event with her butt.\"What the fuck am I gonna do...\"Jaz mumbled to herself, though the words were an echo that was heard to many ears. She realized this, and chuckled at the thought of countless mothers covering their children's ears from her language. That cheered her up a little. But, with the current situation, her mood was brought back down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 200 miles tall now, she would have to be more careful with how she did everything. Before, she wasn't all that careful anyway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaz shrugged to herself and continued contemplating. How would the wolrd react? Some countries are probably already lining their armies up right now, missiles and firearms ready, just waiting for a reason to unleash their itty-bitty fury upon her. Another laugh from her, the very idea of something so small believing that they could hurt her. She remembered three years ago, age 13, she had just peaked at 20 miles tall, and a small unknown country had tried to attack Jaz. Being so large, bullets simply bounced off her skin. But when a few tanks aimed and bombed her face, she became quite enraged. The only thing keeping her from going over to that country and ending hundreds of thousands of lives right then and there was the fact that president himself sent wrd to Jaz not to do so. At her height, Jaz listened to nobody. But for some odd reason...her temper cooled before she stomed the place through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, she simply laughs at the thought of anything hurting her. Ever. And she was so big, her mere presense alone probably scared some people too shitless to do anything to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as she continued this line of though, Jaz's sweet side emerged. Her face showed a sign of pity at what she had done earlier. She had...ended....too much. Wives would not be seeing their husbands anymore, boyfriends would never receve that date promised that afternoon, children wouldn't be able to meet their favorite teacher the next day. At that thought, Jaz broke down. She began to cry, her tears filling up the sea and probably making it rise a good few feet. Her sobs softened hearts and made people think twice about her. She bawled for nearly thirty minutes before drying up. She sniffled and wiped away the remaining tears on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tWhen in trouble, there was always one thing a teenage girl could do to make herself feel better: get condolences from her friends. Being a giantess, a beautiful one at that, Jaz had no lack of friends all over the world; but there were only a few she actually considered to be best friends. Some of the kids from her hometown in Virginia, surely they'd be able to help cheer her up a tad. With her eyes she located the small speck that was Hampton, Virginia in the mild distance. Half a dozen states away from New York, yet to Jaz it barely registered as a walk. Regardless, hearing some comforting voices would do her some good; the giantess rose to her feet, a small, but loud boom which echoed like all the others. So as to not be rude, Jaz called out to her friends, \"Hey! Guys! I'm visiting home for a bit!\" There was no conceivable way her voice wouldn't have reached her friends. It may not have been\u2026the most polite way to inform her friends, but in light of recent events Jaz didn't care. Actually\u2026she wouldn't have cared anyway. She took a few steps into the ocean, already over a fourth of the way there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the coast-town of Hampton a few people began to make their way to the beach. None of them lived too far from it, about ten minutes at best, and they knew whenever Jaz was on her way it was time to head there to meet her. Especially with what happened not too long ago with her recent growth, the news had yet to shut up about it. By the time Jaz had arrived to Virginia, there were already two people there, with others likely on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt eased Jaz's heart upon seeing the two familiar specks, the two people closest to the beach and, in-turn, the people who got there the fastest, her closest friends: Whitney and Robert. Upon arriving just at the right distance, Jaz carefully lowered herself so her face would be right before her friends. Just the right amount of distance so she could see and hear them. Both her friends showed clear surprise at how much bigger Jaz was, but they didn't have any negative looks or comments regarding it. Ever since Jaz grew they were perhaps, the most understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert was the best male friend Jaz had. A young white boy from a slightly poor family. Smart and a tad witty, but he was always the first person to offer to help solve a problem. More often than not, he had useful insight too. Robert tended to dress in jeans and t-shirts, not too different from Jaz actually. Only, obviously, he wore stuff made for men. At about 5\"11\" he stood at a nice fair height, although absolutely nothing in comparison to his gigantic friend. It was also pretty much certain he had a crush on Jaz, and would often go extra leaps and bounds for her. But Jaz never reciprocated the feelings, not to mention the fact she couldn't exactly get intimate with a boy the size of dirt to her. Surprisingly it had next to nothing to do with Jaz being a giantess either. Robert had feelings for her for years, back when she could loosely be called \"normal-sized.\" In his eyes, her height just made her more beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other friend was Jaz's closest female friend, Whitney. She was a young black girl with a complexion and facial structure not unlike Jaz herself. The key difference was longer hair, often worn down, and a slightly less endowed body. In all fairness though, the latter was hard to determine considering Whitney generally wore a black hoody and jeans with boots. Her body was something she never showed off because Whitney was incredibly shy. The kind of person who rarely, if ever, talked; although with Jaz it was quite the opposite, she opened up to the giantess all the time. Not exactly a chatterbox, but it was pretty evident she was a lot closer to her friend than anyone else. Even Robert had a hard time getting any words from her. Personality-wise, she was a lot like Jaz though. The main differences were volume and confidence. Jaz had no problems speaking her mind and getting in your face (Her size helped quite a bit) whereas Whitney usually just shrugged or used facial expressions to convey what she means. In terms of tastes, basic personality, and even looks, the two were quite similar. A lot of people joked they were twins back when they were closer to the same height. Nowadays people wonder something else, as Whitney never showed any interest in men. Now, that may be shyness, but many people often found it <i>curious</i> she had no problems opening up to Jaz. At 5\"5\" She was shorter than Robert, but again, nothing in comparison to her giant friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black giantess couldn't help but giggle a bit at seeing them even smaller than before. \"Hey guys. Miss me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney nodded, mumbling something inaudible. Robert's eyes shifted to Jaz's cleavage for a moment, \"Uh, y-yeah. How've you been Jaz?\" If she were any smaller, Jaz would've noticed his face was a tad red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not too good\u2026\" The black giantess slumped. She extended a finger towards the coast, carefully stopping her nail before it came anywhere near anything resembling civilization. That left it about ten feet from shore; they got a little wet doing it, but her friends climbed aboard and Jaz brought them up closer to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp close, it was even harder for them to believe how much she grew. Her fingernail alone had enough space for whole city blocks. The looming face of their friend was just\u2026so large\u2026it was hard not to feel insignificant. Between the two of them they could\u2026hell they couldn't even cover half of a percent of Jaz's immense face. Her pores seemed like they were sizable enough for them. And from Jaz's perspective, even up-close, it was like looking at two ants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney stepped forward to pat Jaz's finger in consolation. Robert did the same, \"Yeah I heard all about what happened. I'm sorry to hear\u2026\" Nothing much else could be said. Jaz wiped out thousands. The fact she stopped sobbing and was actually capable of anything other than flat out being sad was enough a miracle in itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean to do any harm\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly Whitney spoke up; more surprising considering Robert was there. \"What's done is done. You didn't mean to do anything bad and we all understand that\u2026\" Quite lengthy from her, her voice was surprisingly feminine unlike what one would expect from a quiet girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaz smiled, \"Thanks Whitney, you always know what to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She never says anything.\" Robert pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you could learn from that.\" Jaz retorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of the friends stated laughing a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm already feeling a bit better.\" The giantess smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're just that great.\" The small male friend grinned; Whitney bonked him on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe friendly carefree banter of the three friends continued on for quite some time. With people helping her mood Jaz was able to temporarily forget all about the trouble she'd caused and the destruction of her feet. Her closest friends were here with her, that's all she'd needed. Other, not-as-close friends, showed up from time to time. But seeing Jaz already had her favorites doing the job needed, they moved on. Trouble in the world was getting worked out slowly but surely. Jaz's voice echoed enough that many heard her conversation, and they realized she was hurt more by this tragedy than anything. Something would have to be done of course, but a lot of people were a lot less angry than they were before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about two hours of talking Jaz noticed the sun was directly above her, signifying midday. She looked down to her boob, addressing the two specks on it. \"Thanks for everything guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving been placed on the appendage by Jaz due to laziness, Whitney smiled softly and nodded. Robert did the same, mainly because that the location prevented him from speaking without making it painfully clear he was infatuated with the giant girl. Or at least, he couldn't talk without seeming like a pervert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know\u2026\" Jaz looked to the sky, \"Sometimes I get a little lonely being this big. I mean\u2026I don't have anyone else like this\u2026I can't hug anyone, kiss anyone, or even touch someone like this. I wouldn't mind if I had a little bit of company at my size for a while.\" She looked to Whitney, \"We'd have a lot of fun eh Whitney?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me?\" Robert piped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be our pet.\" Jaz laughed playfully. Whitney chuckled, Robert laughed too but he didn't exactly respond negatively to the retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have you guys either way.\" She smiled, \"Best friends right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth her friends nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaz felt her mood lift a lot. There was still the faint sadness, but her friends had done wonders for her mood. She meant what she said though. Despite all her attitude, being a giantess was really lonely for Jaz. She often wondered what would happen if someone like Whitney grew, or if she were shrunken to normal size. Even if just temporarily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ha, like anything's gonna happen</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterestingly enough, something <i>did</i> happen\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Robert reacted fast and ran away from Whitney's expanding bare feet before they crushed him. Jaz carefully stood up and walked back into the ocean, making space for the skyscraper-sized girl before her feet became too big to fit on the beach; soon she was standing on tiptoes to avoid destroying Hampton. She stepped out just on time, and walking backwards into the sea she looked in awe at the shrinking city as she grew faster, going through clouds and becoming big enough to crush the city under her foot in few seconds. She turned around and noticed she was already level with Jaz's ankle. \"Don't worry Whitney, I'm here for you. We'll work this out\" Jaz told her, trying to make sure she stayed calm. Whitney nodded, trying to smile, as she grew faster and faster past Jaz's legs, her knees, her thighs, soon reaching her crotch and triple miles digits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to look not at Hampton, but at Virginia and the whole United States as Jaz hugged her against her body, she soon felt Jaz's large breasts against her back. As she grew past her neck her growth slowed down, and she stopped slightly shorter than Jaz.</span></div></div>",

It's hard to believe, but if there's somehow a chance I've got to try it\" Jaz said. She then moved to New York, just a few steps away at her size, and carefully lied down on the sea, knowing there shouldn't be any ships in the area with her there. Looking at the destroyed districts she then wished to fix everything back, putting all her heart in the wish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Still, the giantess felt a twinge of disappointment.<i> Ah well, I still got them here with me. </i>She looked down to her boobs, \"Would you guys like to head back with me? Just hang out for a while?\" It was <i>very </i>rare for Jaz to offer anything remotely like that; both Robert and Whitney exchanged a surprised look. It was clear the girl was still rather guilt-ridden if she didn't even want to head to her own land alone. Regardless, neither friend refused. It could be fun. Jaz smiled down at her friends, \"Thanks guys, hold on tight\u2026\" She pushed her body back as she slowly began to stand back up. Her friends gripped her boob tightly as they flew up many miles and their ears popped. They were slightly dizzy from the sudden pressure change and shut their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of this, Jaz saw her friends were still there and casually began to head back to her island, humming a soft tune that gave the impression she was all better. As the landmass came into view though, the giantess felt more guilt rising again. Just from where she saw and cried, there sat a huge crater that fit her rounded butt perfectly, as well as demolished about a tenth of the remaining mountains left. Jaz noticed her clothes were gone, her memory of the last time she grew came to mind. The exact same thing happened, Jaz outgrew her clothes; and while out one day, she came back to them gone. The next day, brand new ones, that fit accordingly. She never quite knew what happened or how it was done, but she didn't exactly care either. She hoped today would do that too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the landmass less than a footstep away Jaz reached for her friends, \"Hop on.\" They did as told as sat on her fingernail. With nothing left to worry about, Jaz carefully laid herself flat on her stomach so that her face was right beside the mountains on the opposite edge. Her boobs crushed some mountains and her legs may have been mostly submerged in water, but it worked. The giantess carefully lowered her friends onto the highest mountain, a structure that barely reached Jaz's lower lip, and smirked at her friends again. \"Like it?\" Each vowel she made caused a mild gust of wind from her breath to the two people; it took them a minute to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it.\" Robert smiled; Whitney gave a nod to show she agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaz shrugged, \"It's alright. Now, what do you guys want to do?\" In the distance her feet could be seen kicking against the air in eagerness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one really responded, after all, what could you do with a girl 200-miles tall? It seemed Jaz would have to come up with the idea herself; it was one she often thought of her laughs. \"Why don't you guys have a race?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where?\" Whitney asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess gestured over her shoulder, \"On me! I think it might be kinda cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might take a while\u2026\" The small man mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaz shrugged again, \"It'll kill time. Plus I can use it decide where you guys are sleeping tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleeping?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're staying the night right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney and Robert exchanged another look, both certain of it now Jaz desperately wanted company. They both nodded to the black girl's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! You guys can race and whoever gets farthest gets the prize!\" Jaz lowered her fingernail again to get the two. Again they got on. Moments later they were placed at the peak of one of the world's largest mountains, Jaz's butt. Neither of her smaller friends could suppress their feelings regarding the location. \"You guys can start whenever you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happens to who wins?\" Robert called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaz looked over her shoulder with a devilish smirk, \"The winner gets to sleep in my boobs tonight. The loser sleeps under my toe nail.\" She came up with the losing penalty right off the spot. It seemed to do the trick, as a moment later her friends began the race. It felt funny for two people to be running on her butt, to Jaz it felt like two small ticklish sensations were <i>very</i> slowly creeping up towards her torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her friends, it was unreal. Jaz's butt itself was roughly ten-miles high, forming down into a slope a good five-miles long. Neither Whitney nor Robert could run at full speed without risking tripping or something. As it was now, Whitney was winning by a slim margin. Neither of them could believe they'd just gotten into a race like this, the winner sleeping in Jaz's bosom. Normally they'd probably be a bit chiller about it, but the penalty didn\u2019t seem appealing, and both knew Jaz would do it. Sleeping underneath the toenail of a 200-mile high giantess didn't seem too appealing. Racing on top of a girl came with complications though. Her regular breathing made it hard to find any sort of good footing for long. The occasional giggle or two shook the very ground they ran on. And of course there was the issue of clothing, as Jaz's stretched-shorts were coming closer and closer and stood in their path. It was barely a couple hundred feet high, and mildly wrinkled and slightly holey, Whitney wasted no time in approaching it and beginning to climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert, had a more \"smart\" idea, he decided just running under and going straight through would be best, bad call. Getting underneath the small bit of clothing was no problem at all, it was underneath that was the problem. It was very dark, with little light shining in through the small rips and tears. The air was humid, the warmth of Jaz's body held back by the thin layer of jean-shorts. Then there was something Robert's more perverted side noticed. In his current location\u2026he was essentially invisible from sight, and was right on top of the butt of his childhood crush. He couldn't resist but stop for a moment to plant his hand of the well-toned cocoa brown surface and feel arousal build up inside. He began heading for the exiting side moments later, the shorts had risen up as the tore so that they were now close to the edge of Jaz's rear. Essentially, getting past the shorts meant getting past Jaz's lower body and reaching her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, Whitney made considerable progress in the short time Robert was distracted, already having climbed Jaz's short's remains and worked her way down. In moments she reached bare skin again and began to continue along up Jaz's waist. The feeling of someone down there gave Jaz a sudden excited shiver. She may not have been racing but the giantess was enjoying this more than anyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnexpectedly, that small shiver made a huge problem for Robert. As when Jaz's lower body shivered, it carried a bit of extra force, and the young man felt himself bounce up a few feet. That was nothing special, but when he landed\u2026his foot slipped on the smooth surface of Jaz's rear and he found himself slipping towards the middle, deeper into Jaz's butt. Moments later his descent stopped as it grew pitch black, where it was most humid. Thankfully the young man managed to avoid a close encounter with the butt-hole. Jaz's well-toned rear provided it so he was literally clenched tightly between the two cheeks, far below sat the pit where Jaz did her business, far out of sight. Robert essentially slid down a mile and was now stuck between both cheeks, unable to properly move; meanwhile Whitney was gaining and increasingly large lead. However, he couldn't lie, he was extremely turned on to be where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe race went on for roughly six hours. Jaz found herself getting sleepy and, knowing they couldn't possibly finish in time, decided for a small nap. During that time Whitney did phenomenal, making good progress with necessary brakes, and finishing right around Jaz's navel area, on the back of course. Poor Robert\u2026after struggling for the better part of five hours in what quickly became a sauna, it eventually became so hot that he was sweaty enough to slide himself free. Climbing back up took the rest of the time. So by the time Jaz awoke, Robert was still where he started, Jaz's butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a yawn the giantess awoke and retrieved her friends, \"Wow, you did great Whitney!\" Her eye shifted to her male friend, \"Robert, you just fail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh, likely story perv.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaz quickly moved on, \"Well, I guess it's pretty obvious who won anyway! Way to Whitney! You'll be right up here with me\u2026\" Her eye shifted to the loser, \"Have fun with the dirt down there Robert.\" She smirked mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F E L L !!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't wanna hear it.\" The giantess rolled her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun still shined up in the sky, although it wouldn't for much longer. There was still enough time to do something before going to bed, and Jaz had just the thing\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For whatever reason, the familiar notion Jaz had that morning returned: the desire to be worshipped. The memory of what came from that before still stung clearly in the giantess' mind. She wanted to be worshipped then too; in the end thousands died and she grew to over twice her height. Jaz shook the idea from mind; she couldn't make the same mistake. \"I uh\u2026I guess I'll put you guys where you'll be sleeping. You know, Whitney get's a nice cushiony bed, you, Robert, get the dirt under my toe nail since you lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What part of fe-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaz cut him off by quickly lowering the young man to her feet, which she had just pulled from the water. \"You can say it all you want, I'm not buying it.\" She said, placing the speck on her fingernail beneath her toe nail. Jaz let out a small giggle at the idea of what she just did. She imagined a ticklish sensation of a person walking down there, only imagined though, as she was too big to notice such things. Next came Whitney, who Jaz carefully positioned on the small part of her boob still covered. The remnant of clothing would protect the girl from falling out at any point. Again Jaz giggled as she laid herself down and got comfy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, my friends are living on me...\" She said playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom where she was, Whitney smiled happily and snuggled against the warm, welcoming mammary of her dear friend. It felt safe, warm, and protective to her touch. The feeling was reminiscent of a mountain; it was\u2026almost romantic in a sense. Whitney could be safe here, together with her friend in her time of need. It was the best bed imaginable, even for another girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert's position was the exact opposite. Jaz's toes were warm sure, but nowhere near enough to be cozy. There was no soft surface to rest on; in fact, the ground was nothing spectacular at all. The only thing about the whole terrain was the dirt and debris that came there over the years. Above the toe nail hung like the sky itself, clear enough to see through. The toe itself was soft as can be, but where Robert was right now: not-so-much. The young man felt like a bug where he was, a bug that wandered into the wrong place. Though, he also felt a big tempted. He liked Jaz\u2026<i>all</i> of Jaz\u2026that included her feet. Sleeping here was a dream come true in a sense. Nowhere near the pleasure he could have in Whitney's position, but enough to make it not-so-bad. Robert shivered a little bit as he huddled against Jaz's toe for warmth, smiling as he brushed his face against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaz could only barely feel Whitney, and just smiled about it. On her mind though, the temptation kept on calling her. To be worshipped\u2026before everything that happened she had loved it so much. If no one got hurt then maybe\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No one\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light bulb lit up in the giantess' mind. Who was here? This was her land. The only people here were her friends, and where they currently were, even if Jaz were to grow to ten times her size they'd be safe. She could have her fun without repercussion\u2026The black girl looked the sky again, once more noting there was enough time for one more activity. Could she do it though? They were her friends\u2026Robert was just being a pervert, he could deserve it. But Whitney\u2026if she were to do it it would have to be something good\u2026Jaz looked to where the two were again and felt another idea come. Her urge for worship was as strong as ever, and she couldn't resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys\u2026while you are down there would you like to do something for me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of her friends seemed momentarily confused, but voiced no objection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\u2026could you guys\u2026<i>worship</i> me\u2026? I know it sounds weird, but I like it and\u2026Yeah\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suggestion surprised the two of them, but neither was surprised at the idea. It was a pretty well known fact Jaz appreciated worship. It was something she developed quite a few years ago. They'd never been asked for it before though\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney had no problems doing it. Being on Jaz's breast was nice enough that she'd be happy to. If a small bit of massaging was enough to make her giant friend feel good then sure. Why not? The shy girl giggled a bit as she noticed the area of her friend's nipple growing hard moments after she began though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert didn't quite jump on it like his other friend did. But Jaz noticed this, \"Don't think I forgot how much of a perv you were Robert. Just sit there and I'll leave you there for a week.\" That did the trick, her friend quickly fell to his knees and began to shower Jaz's toe with affection, in the form of kisses (Though he didn't need much motivation to kiss any part of Jaz.) The black giantess smirked as she felt her friend submit to her toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing worshipped felt absolutely\u2026<i>divine</i>. Jaz couldn't come close to describing the joy she was gaining from the sensation on her breast and toe. When Whitney did it it just sent Jaz into a whole new world of happiness. When Robert\u2026didn't, she just reminded him how she treated pervs and he was all for it. The giantess felt like a true Goddess, even her closest friends were now treating her like a better being, even if just because she asked. A soft moan escaped Jaz's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, the memory came back of this morning. Why did Jaz grow? What happened? There was no real way to know, and, truth be told, at the moment she didn't care. Jaz's greatest wish was currently being granted, and she was loving every moment of it. Maybe her friends could do more to improve the feeling\u2026maybe Robert could start worshipping her entire foot, kissing it, massaging it\u2026<i>licking </i>it\u2026Show some submission to the lowest part of her body. Whitney can move down to the nipple, where all her worship would be much more appreciated\u2026But this would be far more demanding to her friends. Would she really do that just for a good feeling? At the current moment, Jaz didn't know. She just relished being worshipped and let her heart tell her what to do.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She had the feeling she would come to regret the decision later, but for now\u2026in all honesty Jaz didn't really care. All she really wanted was just\u2026worship. It was unexplainable how nice it felt to her. But at the same time, it nagged at her mind to force her friends to do it. But right as the problem arose, the giantess quickly devised a way to solve it. \"Hey uh\u2026Whitney..? I'm sorry but\u2026I can't really feel you down there. Why don't you try at the nipple? I know I can feel that.\" She couldn't see the tiny girl frowning a bit at the thought. Not that she had any problem with the idea; she just knew from the erect nipple Jaz had that she had just lied. Regardless, the quiet girl gave a quick shrug and moved down a bit towards Jaz's nipple, massaging with a bit more force in her arms. In a way it was\u2026interesting. The nipple was erect and hard but\u2026it was still soft, it still felt sort of squishy to Whitney's hands. There wasn't really anything to compare it to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she expected it, Jaz couldn't help but moan at how <i>stimulating </i>Whitney's worship was. She had begun to grow a little wet in fact, and there was still the tiny perv under her toe nail. \"Hey perv!\" She raised her voice to address Robert, \"Don't think you can get away with that weak worship you're doing down there! Whitney's up here giving my nipple the time of its life. You better up your game a bit! Put that tongue to good use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below, far down below\u2026miles and miles down, Robert's ears perked as he eavesdropped on Jaz's words when she spoke to Whitney. Whitney was worshipping her nipple? The mere idea of it turned the pervy boy on. Of course, right as these thoughts started coming up Jaz added a bit more dominance to the situation. Apparently he had to up his game. Robert was already kissing and massaging Jaz's toe\u2026there was only really one way to get lower than that\u2026and he did it. Almost overly dramatic about it, the young man slowly stuck his tongue out and gave a strong, firm lick to Jaz's never-ending toe. Such was the start of another session of worship, with Robert licking and kissing as if he was actually making out with the giant appendage. And truth be told, he liked to think so, even if it was only Jaz's toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slight wet feeling that came from her toes made Jaz just moan even louder. It sounded almost\u2026sexual. The giantess was not only getting turned on; it looked like she was on her way to getting full on horny. \"Don't stop.\" She commanded her friends, clenching her gigantic fists to try and avoid doing anything with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth the friends continued to worship at Jaz's command, but that was just it. Command. It was no longer a shy request from an embarrassed friend. It was a command from the girl big enough to wipe out your local area with her toes. It was like a command from a girl beginning to consider herself a goddess deserving of worship. But for the sake of their friend (and their lives) they pressed on, going above and beyond to please the massive giantess that was Jaz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each passing second of the worship Jaz felt more and more pleasured, almost like she was having sex with the mere feeling of being worshipped. She had a real live human licking away at her toes like an insect. And another was stimulating her breasts. Any other girl would have to do these things themselves or pay someone else to do them. Not Jaz, no\u2026she can just demand it and her size does the rest. The current moment was a perfect example. She demanded they keep on worshipping, despite the fact they had to be getting tired, and they were. It was like\u2026No\u2026not even like. At this point it was pretty much fact that Jaz was\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Goddess\u2026.The thought stuck through her head louder than any of the pleasure she was feeling. All of a sudden it seemed like Jaz earned this, she had earned to be worshipped like a God. That at this point\u2026she pretty much was. All the thought she often pushed aside as daydreams and fantasies seemed like they were fact now. If Jaz wanted to she could one day hold the very planet in her hands\u2026If it even deserved that. Maybe she was in a bit of an\u2026off state of mind with the situation. But it seemed to make so much sense\u2026Jaz fought to not say the words she wanted to say so loudly. \"I am a Goddess!\" No, one day maybe\u2026but today\u2026not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just then, in this questionable state of mind, that Jaz\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was in small variables, an inch here, inch there, but slowly Jaz began to expand at a quickening rate. In a minute's time, everyone knew that the black giantess was growing once more.\"And here we go...\"Jaz muttered to herself, trying to stifle a moan from the pleasure of worship from her two best friends. In another two minutes, she had grown a good proportionate 20 miles tall all over, Robert and Whitney currently ceasing their worship, looking about at their surroundings in a state of somewhat awe. To Jaz, she had so far only grown a foot in height, but to the tiny people located on her body, it was like watching a new world form and grow around them.\"J-Jaz....?\"Whitney called out to her giant friend. Jaz's face looked down at her chest and grinned, reassuring her.\"Don't worry, everything's gonna be okay....\"She comforted her. <i>Unless I grow out of control and crush everything</i>, Jaz thought, now frowning at the idea. Then there would be a problem. One of moral faith, and one of where Jaz would sleep tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next event was bound to happen, and it did so with dramatic intent. The sound of fabric tearing was heard around the world, awakening most with it's booming noise.\"Fuuuuck....\"Jaz whispered, feeling her clothing become tighter and tighter upon her body. Seconds later, the inevitable happened, and a splitting rip began to seperate the already thin seams that held Jaz's shorts and bra together. Slowly, the fabric gave up the fight against the growing body, releasing Jaz's naked glory to the world.\"FUUUUUUCCCCCKKKKK.....\"Jaz growled, her deep voice scaring most people due to it's thunderous depth. Hopefully, she would have fitting clothing in the morning. There always was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on? C'mon, telll me!!\"Jaz heard Robert's faint voice call from far off on her toe.\"Nothing that concerns you, perv....\"She replied, imagining how Robert would react if he could fully see her. He'd probably die from blood loss via classic perv nosebleed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Whitney</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the shy girl, this whole situation was quite terrifying, but she kept her composure only because the growing giantess was her best friend. When her bra popped off, Whitney could only hold on for dear life to the soft ground beneath her, her motions probably giving Jaz a massage and only fueling her growth more. When Jaz's boob had stopped shaking from coming out of it's top, Whitney slowly opened her eyes, still afraid of her current event. The soft, cocoa-colored 'mountain', though it was too big to even be considered a mountain, she was upon became steaddily bigger and bigger by the second, becoming larger than anything she ever knew. Off in the distance, Jaz's nipple had hardened and become erect, the only monument needed to show how large Jaz was becoming. It's peak was miles above, towering into the atmosphere, and it could probably hold an entire city and countryside now upon it with room to spare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Robert</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe...he was just confused. Utterly confused to what was going on. He knew Jaz was growing, yes, but to everything around him, oblivious. Underneath Jaz's toenail, he simply tried to stay safe and put on her expanding appendage and not fall off due to the growth quakes that were happening quite frequently now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jaz</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it seemed her growth phase was coming to a close. After only five minutes or so, it was very slow to Jaz, her size upgrade had left her at 250 miles tall now, a quarter bigger than she was before. To the people on the shores of the US, this was a spectacle, and thousands had gathered to watch from their beaches and gaze at Jaz become an even larger mega-giantess. The teenage giantess let out a sigh of relief and laid her head back into te ocean, not caring if her hair got wet. She couldn't go to sleep on her private isalnd anymore, it was completely totaled underneath her butt.\"Whitney...?\"She asked in a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...?\"Her friend's voice was now even more faint and punier than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's....let's just go to sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaz yawned, and without looking up, tapped the top portion of her breast, almost as if giving Whitney a hug. Her friend accepted this by hugging the monolithic finger as much as she could.\"G'night...\"Jaz said, retracting her finger, and wiggling her toes next.\"G'night to you, too, perv.\"She said playfully to Robert. She only heard a small noise, but couldn't comprehend it. He was just too far away. Jaz just took it as him saying goodnight as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she dozed off, her thoughts melded into her dreams, and slowly she drifted off into sleep. How would her life be now? The past day had been quite an emotional rollercoaster. Just this morning, Jaz was only a mere 89 miles tall. Now, a towering 250 miles high. What would she eat, wear, and for that matter, go on? Would she stop growing, or would be destined to to keep expanding?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever...\"Jaz mumbled in her dreaming state. All she knew, was that she wanted some rest.</span></div></div>",

One time while sleeping, the titaness had rolled over and accidentally crushed most of southern China. After this, she was heartbroken but not as devastated as in New York. People had been out of her sight for a long time, and she was sure she killed hundreds with simple movements every day. When she grew tall enough, she attempted to leave the Earth.

But even though she was gone, Earth was still very much in her grip. Literally.<br>\r\nAt any moment, Jaz could pluck the minuscule planet from its orbit with one hand and crush it. Jaz, however, found her body's natural solution to this sudden growth. With her increase in size, new abilities developed. She could project copies of herself at any size smaller than hers anywhere on the globe. These copies Jaz could either personally control, or set them on a kind of 'automatic', where she would think a set of instructions and they would do it, with her personality and how she would do it herself. She could also read the minds of the people on Earth. She established world peace, although after some of her copies waged a bloody war with the nations. Crime was almost gone, as criminals would commit their crimes and promptly find themselves crushed under a foot, or sat on by a laughing giantess. For the same reasn, revolution was impossible. All rebels were tortured quite a bit before being finally being eaten or some other nasty fate. Jaz was quite content with this arrangement, and was even thinking of sending her humans to some other habitable planets she had discovered.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWakey wakey everyone. You know what time it is!\u201d A voice echoed across the entire planet, urging everyone awake at once. With faint murmurs all around, the entire planet Earth shook themselves awake to the sound of their planetary alarm. Night or day it didn\u2019t matter, it was considered \u201cmorning\u201d once the call was made. Every single person in the world did the exact same thing; they awoke, stood up, then got on their knees and began to speak prayers to the heavens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll praise the Almighty Goddess\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive thanks for another day with her\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet her bless us this day\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actual prayers varied, but the context was the same. They were praying to the world\u2019s Goddess, the voice that awoke them all, the Teenage Giga Giantess Jasmine, also known as Jaz. Enough prayers the entire planet could be heard praying to her. If people chose, they could look outside their windows to the sky for a glimpse of her, but the sight was usually quite daunting. Despite being countless miles away, the girl\u2019s form loomed before the planet, big enough she could crush it between her toes if she wanted. Because of this the sky was typically filled with a single, incomprehensibly big body part. On some mornings one could catch Jaz\u2019s pupil. Other days maybe a single tooth out of her smile filled the sky. But most days it was the same endless expanse of cocoa brown skin that was impossible to tell which body part it was. Regardless, it was usually a scary sight that people never seemed to adjust to, the idea that at any moment on the whims of a teenage girl the world could end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow things came to be like this, no one really thought about anymore. One day Jaz was born, the same size as any other child\u2026She just grew a bit differently. By the time she was one she was 10 feet tall. At 3 she hit 40 feet. And now at 16 she was too big to measure. But for an estimate, the planet Earth was about half the size of her big toe. She was somewhere planets away, situated in the voids of space in a comfortable position. She still grew too, so one day, maybe the planet would be but a pore. Thankfully, Jasmine was a very kind girl. She was never mean-spirited and was raised extremely well. The only downside was that, due to her size, she tended to get her way a lot. Whenever she played with another kid as a child, she\u2019d usually win (unless it was hide and seek) and she\u2019d get the other kids to admit she was better than them. She enjoyed winning games a lot. It was this innocent little habit she had that developed into the love for worship she had now. Now she had the entire planet admit she was better, that she was something more. One day she called herself a Goddess and that was that. Each day she\u2019d ask for worship, sometimes even physical worship. Maybe she\u2019d occasionally do something playful. But overall, she was mercifully kind. There were only two real demands she ever had as a Goddess beyond worship. She wanted at least a single article of clothing, and she still needed to eat. Through the magic of science she was blessed with a purple bra and panties ensemble for clothes that grew with her. And as for food\u2026As Jaz found out upon becoming big, there were an infinite number of desolate, lifeless planets out there. So\u2026she began to eat them. A single planet lasted her a couple days or so. Surprisingly Jaz barely needed sustenance. Everything about Jasmine was a miracle if one thought about it. Her body barely needed nutrients. She didn\u2019t seem to really go to the bathroom. She was also hyper-sensitive, she could still actually physically feel individual people despite her size. And of course, she grew. Yet there wasn\u2019t a single explanation why. It just seemed normal now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlobally, Jaz was a blessing too. She was an overseer so no country dared every try to start a war. No war meant most countries worked together, fixing most of the other issues. Sure, there were still problems. But compared to how it was before Jaz, it might as well have been flawless. It resembled a utopia in many ways, almost like a dream. No one ever thought the world could be saved under the rule of a giantess, but here it was. Of course it came at some costs.<br>\r\n\u201cI think my toe would like some kisses today.\u201d The goddess called from above with a short giggle. Above the cocoa brown sky moved, becoming less smooth and more ridgey, with markings much like a finger print. It was Jasmine\u2019s big toe, big enough to blot out the entire sky, coming in close. Jaz asking for direct worship wasn\u2019t that uncommon, but it was especially scary. Why? Because she literally touched the planet with her toe. Most buildings came to about where she would stop, and there her toe would rest until she had her proper fill of the worship she asked for. With her hyper-sensitivity, Jaz could feel when her toe pushed against buildings and she\u2019d stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t anything too new, and on cue most people began heading to positions where they could worship the young girl. Sure it was humiliating and disgusting really, but it was the cost of their society and few complained. Thankfully Jasmine\u2019s feet were very soft and well-kept, notably nice-looking as far as feet went too, with nice, perfect length toes, a smooth sole and nice coloring throughout. If people had to worship a foot, this would be the best one to worship. In minutes people en masse put their lips to the monolithic toe looming over them. The entire world was kissing Jasmine\u2019s toes, with one on either side so the entire planet could do it. The giantess sighed sensually at the feeling of her toes getting kissed. \u201cNot bad at all\u2026But you know what? I think licking em would be even better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like the girl, asking for more, but the people complied. The entire world began to open their mouths to lick the heavenly toes before them. Some even went so far as to try and praise Jaz as they did so. The taste was\u2026Well it tasted like a foot, some traces of dirt, body oils, and sweat. Not the best tasting mixture, but no one said a single word. In the void of space Jasmine couldn\u2019t help but laugh as her toes were licked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, nothing beats the feeling of getting worshipped. Being a Goddess sure is rewarding\u2026\u201d Jaz batted an eye towards the speck between her toes, \u201cAre you guys happy to worship me?\u201d The universal answer was yes, though many didn\u2019t mean it. Jaz bought it though, \u201cI would too. I mean, I\u2019m huge, pretty, and nice. I\u2019m the greatest Goddess ever! In fact, I deserve a reward\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was unusual; no one knew what to do. Suddenly Jasmine\u2019s toes were pulled away and she began to reach for the planet. But what was she up to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you guys will just <i>love</i> it. I know you will\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Always steady and careful Jaz's fingers gently planted themselves on either ends of the planet and effortlessly plucked it from its natural orbital rotation. An entire world filled with billions of lives, no bigger than a marble between her fingers. It would be a true catastrophe if she hadn't done this same act on a regular basis. At first scientists were convinced that Earth's natural polarity would be destroyed and the global weather would be thrown out of wack but sometimes science is just wrong. As was the case here. When Jaz first plucked the planet everyone was convinced the world was now ending but to the surprise of many, nothing ever happened. It was just one of many things the Giga Goddess found she could get away with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know...I've been thinking a lot lately...\" The girl began. Usually her words rolled of the tongue one after another so for her to pause caught the world's attention. It was never a good sign. \"It's been a couple years since I first came to space and became Goddess to you germs you know. All this time you guys have been amazing about attending to my needs and doing everything a girl could ever ask for. Yet I haven't been doing too much for you guys. I mean, I can't imagine how rough it is living on that cramped planet when there's all this other, <i>better</i> space out here in the universe! So good ol Goddess Jazzy is going to help you guys colonize space!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoo...ray?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one really knew how to react. Jasmine was talking about a massive world changing event here as casually as she would dinner and it didn't sound too bad honestly. Technologically people could live in space but there'd be an issue of travel and supplies, both easily solvable by someone of their Deity's stature. Overpopulation was a big issue these days too...So why did the grin filling the sky of the planet make everyone uneasy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you guys are ready...cause one of you lucky continents is going to live in the <i>greatest</i>, most<i> beautiful</i> place ever!\" With her free hand Jasmine hovered a pail of fingers near Earth's orbit, eyeing the different landmasses. There was Asia...or was it North America? Honestly it was so hard to tell when they're all so small. Regardless, it was the chosen land. \"Hope you're ready!\" The warning was moot, no one could ever be ready. Gracefully Jaz's feminine nails dug into the planet around the edges of the land. In easily the single greatest bit of destruction ever known to mankind this girl with just her finger nails completely pulled the continent of Asia straight off of the planet. There was no battle to keep it rooted. Jasmine barely registered any resistance before this massive landmass pulled itself free. Billions of people immediately collapsed as literally their entire world was broken apart at the whims of this young girl. People on Asia couldn't even react. It was something worse than any natural disaster, something completely unstoppable and something they couldn't even fully fathom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsia was now in the depths of space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe continent was totally free of its planet. There was no way to ever undo the damage. The land was just in for whatever this girl had in mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to your new home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaz flashed the country towards something millions of miles away but no human could ever make out anything more than the endless cocoa skin blotting out their sky. Unbeknownst to them...Jaz pointed the country towards her toes. It was a motion as simple as bending over. The Giga Goddess lowered her hand to her outstretched toes and placed this speck-sized land between her big and second toe. She smiled proudly knowing that she did such an act without any sort of casualties. Only a Goddess such as her was capable of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kinda itches though...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver so carefully the goddess wiggled her toes to remedy the problem. She could feel some buildings collapse and the ground break apart but she minimized the damage as best she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the poor humans now between her toes it was something else. On either end of the land was endless plains of light brown. Two massive walls that put the land's own Great Wall to pitiful shame. The appendages didn't even look like toes...they just...were brown. They were beyond description. Asia was now just...in a vast brown field of unimaginable size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A new location means a new name you know...\" Jaz grinned to her toes (Truth be told she couldn't even really see them that well). \"I'm thinking...Toe Jam.\" Everyone realized where they were, not that it did any good. Before panic could start the Goddess' laughter broke it off. \"Just kidding. But since I am kind of your land owner I have a few ground rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audacity of it all was beyond belief. But everyone knew they were powerless and at the very least this Goddess would never do them harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off we need to talk about my Daily Worship. Since you guys live there now you have to worship my feet okay? This means I always want people regularly worshiping them...Licking and Kissing you know how it is...You guys can take shifts. Oh! And I want a church...A nice big statue of me. You got it? As for food and such...You guys can grow whatever you want, expand however you want and so forth. If you need supplies brought in from Earth let me know. You guys also get to eat off the land! I'm sure I have so many microscopic specks of dirt on my feet you guys can help yourself. Same with any sweat I have...Though I don't think that'll be a problem. I don't sweat often....Anywho!\" Jaz struck her Goddess pose, arms at her hips and a big grin as her chest puffed out. \"You guys gotta thank your Goddess now you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout much a choice the land now between Jaz's toes got on their knees and kissed the brown ground beneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Now for the rest of you...\" The Goddess turned back to Earth. At that very moment it became painfully clear no one was escaping the girl this time. Once more the sky was replaced by the vast brown that people took to calling the second sky. Back in her fingers Jaz plucked another continent from Earth, this one being South America. \"You guys go on the other foot!\" Much like how the girl did Asia, now South America was naught but a land between her toes. As before the Giga Giantess laid down the down rules and same as before the people were in no position to do anything other than fall to their knees and worship her toe cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's two down...Hmm\" Jaz stared at the planet between her fingers intently, trying to figure out where to place the remaining lands. Her monolithic fingers reached down and dug the remains of Europe into the vastness of space. \"You guys get to live in my bellybutton!\" Jasmine grinned as she placed the land at her stomach. \"Same rules as the others! Got it?\" The worship she quickly felt let her know the tinies listened well to their Goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Antarctica...I think. You guys are the lucky ones next!\" Surprisingly not mistaken, next the frozen tundras of Antarctica were removed from the world. Where they would be going made Jaz giggle. Gently her fingers planted the land and pulled back. Where they were the people couldn't say. It was just...brown...the land was nothing but brown going on for millions of miles. Surprisingly though overhead was space. There wasn't the cocoa brown sky people were used to. Where were they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine couldn't help but laugh a little, \"I know they say black girls have big butts but this is a little ridiculous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntarctica now resided square in the middle of one of the Goddess' butt cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you guys like kissing my ass. It looks like you'll be doing it a lot from now on.\" Her attention refocused to Earth. \"So three left huh...\" Her fingers plucked Africa next. Jaz stared quizzically at the speck between her fingers. Of course feeling the countless lives she was changing forever. \"Where to put you...I know!\" In the span of mere seconds Africa found itself in an infinitely large cave. The familiar brown of the Goddess surrounded them on all fronts. An untold amount of distance away, a bizarre looking yellow-ish orange ocean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear you...\" Jaz giggled at her lame joke. \"If you can't tell you're in my ear. And I expect to hear a lot of worship from you guys. Got it?\" The Goddess focused her hearing and smiled when she heard the microscopic people praising her...Somehow. She didn't linger on it though. There were still two continents and she had just the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two are going to love this.\" With both her hands Jaz reached for North America and Australia, scraping them from the Earth like it was nothing. All the people were terrified. Yet again the Goddess crossed a boundary, one that could never be uncrossed. The effects on Earth culture, civilization itself. It's beyond human recognition! Though not a single person thought such things at the moment. All that mattered was where they would end up, and if they would live. The latter was obvious of course, somehow Jaz avoided harming no one. But where the ended up was another story. This was a different shade of brown...a darker one. Both lands found themselves deeply situated into one of many infinitely deep canyons. People touched the ground expecting some sort of answer. What they got was the ground beneath their feet shaking uncontrollably. It very soon became a cataclysmic quake that collapsed more than a few buildings. And a loud sound unheard of echoed throughout the vast heavens. A strangely sensual sound well known to Earth culture but never heard in such sheer volume. Jasmine was moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That feels really good...\" The Goddess smiled sheepish, toying with her bra in her fingers. Before grabbing the remaining continents she'd removed it so the two last pieces of Earth could go to their new home. Jaz giggled as she spotted her nipples growing erect, feeling as the untold chaos such a simple body reaction was causing. North America and Australia now resided in one of the many wrinkles of her nipples. It came to Jaz in a dream once and she was so happy she'd done it. With her incredible sensitivity to human activity, people just existing on two of her most sensitive body parts started to drive the girl crazy. She could feel a joyful wetness start between her legs but she paid it no mind and focused solely on her massive bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Start worshiping now! Your Goddess commands it!\" As commanded people fell to their knees and kissed and licked Jaz's nipple. \"Ung!\" The cocoa giant twitched, more aroused than ever before. There were two lands worshiping her feet, one worshiping her belly button, one her ass, a land constantly praising her in her ear, and now two lands dedicated solely to stimulating her nipples. Jasmine had never been more turned on in her life. \"Never stop! I order you guys to keep going!\" She started to pant between moans. When her eyes happened upon something she totally forgot about: Earth. Or rather, what was left of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the landmasses ripped from it the planet was barely a planet anymore. Water dripped into the gaps to try and refill them but it was clear this land was done. Who needed it though? Everything existed on Jaz now. Who would miss a puny planet like this? In fact, it gave the Goddess an idea. It was so wrong, so against everything she ever stood for. How could she not love it? Her lips grew twisted and her eyes mischievous as she mumbled, \"This is gonna be great.\" She looked down to her chest again. \"All you germs keep worshiping me! Your Goddess is about to please herself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of humanity braced itself for what would surely be an apocalyptic event.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jaz took one last look at Earth before she began. Hard to imagine years ago she once resided on it. Now it was just pitiful to look at. In mere minutes Jaz completely destroyed all beauty the sphere ever had, leaving behind a hollowed out mess of a planet. Strangely though she didn't feel bad. How many wars were fought over the territories here? Over all the resources? Honestly humanity was better off living on their Goddess. She offered more than enough land in just her feet alone. She herself could supply everyone all their needs. If any pesky country decided to try and start a war on her watch she'd be the one to stop them. This was the better arrangement by far. As a result Earth was now just a relic of an old age. This was the age of Jasmine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the Goddess would be lying if she wasn't apprehensive. This was after all her home once. But all her mixed feelings paled in comparison to the sheer rush she felt just thinking about crushing an entire planet. This wasn't some desperate move to eat or even necessary really, Jaz was just going to do it because she wanted to. And no one could stop her. All of her body rang with pleasure as billions worshiped her body. No one wanted their Goddess to ruin their homeworld, but no one dared oppose her. The heated giantess grabbed the tiny planet between her fingers, giving it one final inspection. After her recent remodeling there was now no land anywhere to be found. Meaning of course, no one would perish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect.\" The girl said, fingers tightening slightly. Like a pebble being pressed too hard cracks quickly formed across the world. Countless more chasms formed as all of the ocean desperately tried to fill them. It was kind of sad really. Earth almost appeared to be trying to tell Jaz it would be alright. It would be pretty again, just give it time to recover. It was an amusing thought, although it meant nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.\" She said to no one in particular. \"I'll make this as slow and special as possible.\" Each heated word came out slowly, playfully drawn out by the aroused giantess. Carefully her fingers brought the world before her lips. Briefly she was tempted to place the planet on a molar and just eat it but she had something better in mind. No, instead she gave the planet a kiss. \"This is goodbye. We've had some good times but this is it.\" A playful image of her breaking up with the planet popped into her mind. In a way it was fairly accurate. Jaz was, as a Goddess and new landmass to humanity, breaking off her ties with Earth. \"Don't worry, I'll keep all the little people, animals, and plants safe.\" She grinned. A shiver rolled up her spine as another wave of pleasure from her worship rang out. Loudly a moan echoed across the cosmos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes filled with desire, Jaz pulled the planet back. Amidst the ruin and cracks now an immense lip impression was carved into it. Earth didn't have much time left. She had to stop dragging it out. \"This is it...Say goodbye puny world.\" The Goddess placed the world before her, near her knees. She imagined the skies of Earth, all the infinite brown they must've been as she raised her legs until her feet were level with the planet. Slowly her soles turned on their sides, surrounding the planet with her titanic feet. Very carefully the feet began to close together, slowly coming in to finally end Earth once and for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt so wrong. What Jaz was about to do was unparalleled. She could imagine the horror and awe of all the infinite people on her as they prayed she would spare their world. She wasn't dumb, she knew what they thought of her. That's what made this so nice. As much as everyone wanted otherwise, they were on their knees worshiping Jasmine as their one and only Goddess. They didn't want to live between her toes or on her ass or wherever, but they now did. Just because she wanted them to. It didn't occur to her until now, but Jaz realized what the puny people wanted didn't matter. What mattered was what she wanted. Because no matter what it was, people always ended up going along with whatever she wanted. It was her job as their Goddess to guide them. She would take care of them now and forever. Whether they wanted it or not. These people were always destined to worship her, just as she was always destined to take care of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this knowledge the blue speck at her feet meant nothing. But even so Jaz ushered out a command to her royal subjects. \"I'm about to crush your world you little germs! Keep worshiping me, keep encouraging me and I'm going to do it. This is your last chance. If you don't stop I'm going to take that to mean this is what you want and you will now and forever live on me and live to serve me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment, all worship stopped. This was new. They were being given a choice? But...how? All lands were ripped from the Earth, they couldn't just be put back. Jaz, powerful as she was, couldn't just undo her actions. Life on Earth would never be the same, and even if they went back who's to say Jaz wouldn't just change her mind? What if this was a trick of some kind? Another mischievous game she came up with? Paranoia quickly filled the minds of people and before they knew it, they went back to worshiping her. Better to appease and go along with the Goddess than to cross her. That was what they'd learned in their Jaz-filled years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goddess moaned as all her pleasure came back full force. Each individual person returned to worship in droves. Just as she expected. Even so, their acceptance of the new world was a relief. Jaz's feet closed in enough they now touched the planet. Light splashes of all the water of the world gently soaked the tiniest portion of her soles but right now she couldn't even feel it. Jasmine was on fire. Her body burned from the inside out with near-orgasmic pleasure as all of the world acknowledged her as their Goddess. The planet known as Earth just felt like dirt beneath her feet. \"Yeah...That's exactly what it is. Dirt.\" Jaz looked at Earth one last time, barely held together between her soles. She didn't look away as she pressed her feet as tight as she could. That very instant the planet was crushed to dust. There was no going back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarth's age was over, this was now the age of Jaz.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Slowly and ever so gently, the vast pillars of her fingers made contact with the planet, the tip of her forefinger and her thumb either landing on the ocean or in a desolate area. Somehow, Jaz knew just where to grab and keep from crushing millions with just the slightest of action. She could've been careless and ended a continent or two, but she did know a few people down on her little earth that she did not want to crush. A few friends, her family. Lucky for the world, the goddess at large was a kind and considerate one despite her playfulness and ego at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo those closest to her fingers, such as coastal areas or even islands, all anyway could see was an immeasurable wall of cocoa skin, thousands and thousands of miles wide and tall, going on every direction. It was amazing that not even a tidal wave was generated from her touching the planet. To those who were a bit further away, say more inland, were still in awe, the sky filled with a blur of flesh, blotting out the landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here it comes...\" Jaz giggled and began to lift the planet up from its natural position in space, a vast and powerful rumble shaking the whole planet. Everyone gazed up, seeing a massive blinking eye before it was replaced with what was presumably a cheek, and then, two lusciously chocolate brown lips curled up into a smile. \"....My gift, to all of you little germs.\" She winked playfully, even though no one could see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe already massive lips filling the entire sky puckered up, getting even bigger as they closed in closer and closer to the planet's surface. Most people panicked, expecting to be entirely crushed in an instant. Some countries even ordered nuclear strikes, atomic weaponry flying high into the sky to explode harmlessly against a wrinkle on her upper or lower lip, whichever was closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, none of the crushing happened. Eventually, nearly the whole planet was enveloped in a fond kiss from Jaz, the black giga giantess giggling slightly as she pecked her home world, feeling everything with her hyper-sensitivity, billions of people, buildings, and landscapes all under her lips. She could just as well easily suck the planet into her mouth and eat it like a candy, but she dismissed the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled back, smiling, an imprint of her lips on the world, though, strangely, nothing was harmed. \"There. Heh, some of you are pretty good smoochers.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Good enough in fact...I think I want a little more.\" Once more the Giga Goddess puckered her lips and enveloped the planet between the two luscious, endless forms. There was a weird satisfaction in covering an entire planet with a single kiss. Being able to feel all those little lives and buildings. It was just...intoxicating. Some countries still panicked and fired all they could but even as sensitive as she was to humans, the weaponry barely registered. The rest of the world knew to just accept it. Like it or not Jaz determined their everything. Although no one could see what came next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time since the Giga Goddess ascended to the stars the sky was pink. Before she was born it was all sorts of colors, primarily blue. After she become the Goddess of Earth the sky stayed a cocoa brown, perhaps purple once in a while indicating the slight clothing Jasmine owned. But pink? Never before had that color been seen. What could it mean? Most were in mouth agape awe, unaware of what was about to happen. A childish chuckle rumbled the planet as the pink filling the sky drew closer. Light seemed to dim until finally the world was covered in darkness and all that remained was this sense the sky was still falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was more anarchy than ever. People immediately panicking and countries over-reacting more than they had in years but it was all drowned out by the soft breaths and chuckles of this one girl. Oceans seemed to rain down from the heavens and it was only then people began to realize what Jasmine was doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was licking Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world was powerless as the girl casually brushed the planet with her tongue, holding the Earth in place with her infinite lips as her tongue wrapped itself around her home world and drenched the planet in saliva. And all the girl could do was giggle. She could feel all of the world simultaneously being thrashed about by her tongue. From the masses running about to the buildings now coated in the Goddess' saliva to the winds that now consisted solely of her godly breath. If she kept it up even the oceans themselves would run with naught but her saliva. It was a tempting thought honestly. The idea of a world forced to drink her spit and breath her air on top of worshiping her daily? Something to consider...Nah. Too mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was further than Jaz had ever gone before. The tiny people were certain this would finally be the end; but Jaz knew otherwise. She'd long since mastered the art of being careful around things much tinier than her. Especially since becoming Earth's Goddess. But more than that...She just knew it'd be fine. After all, it's always been fine. No matter what boundary Jasmine crosses, no matter what size she becomes, she still can do as she pleases and there has never been a consequence. Or perhaps it's more like she always got whatever she wanted. She wanted to become a Goddess, so she did. She wanted to feel people despite being too big to do so, so she could. She still wanted to interact with Earth without crushing it, so she did. Anytime Jasmine wanted to do something it was almost as if the world bended to her will. Case and point. Right now Earth should be drowning if not crushed under the millions of gallons from Jaz's spit. But not only was it still standing, but the Goddess was <i>certain</i> no one had died. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfident there was no harm befalling anyone Jaz continued. A soft moan escaped her throat as she dragged the planet deeper into her cavernous maw and sloshed her tongue around it. The sheer thrill of causing such pandemonium yet knowing it'll all be fine...If that wasn't proof she was a Goddess what was there? For a moment the cocoa giantess was tempted to place Earth on one of her molars for the ultimate test but she thought better of it. Maybe one day, but for now she was still a Kind Goddess...Even if it was a little debatable at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaz just imagined it. The world completely enveloped in darkness, but just light enough to see a dark pink everywhere. The booming winds of her regular breathing overpowering any and all sound. A single drop of spit falling somewhere and causing tsunamis. The sight of her taste buds out-sizing people by countless meters. And most of all, the helplessness of the people she was toying with. It would take a single millisecond for her to annihilated everything. It was by her mercy Earth still stood. She would never consider destroying it in a million years but just having that kind of power was enough. Jasmine was a Goddess. These ants were nothing compared to her, but she still loved them like a Deity would her creations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Better finish up...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine mentally groaned as her conscience kicked in and forced her tongue to release the planet. Like a responsible Goddess she began to pull Earth back out with her fingers, but not before sucking it dry of her spit. The Goddess grinned at the planet between her fingers. \"How'd ya like that? Heh. Never tried a french kiss before. I think I can get used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everything that happened in the span of minutes no one even had the will to raise an alarm anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like Jaz wanted. Somehow, someway, nothing was destroyed. No lives were lost. Once again it was another Goddess Miracle as people began to call them. No one needed to tell Jasmine though, as the world began to sort itself out she just knew. She never really tried doing anything God-like...But for some reason...Right now she was really tempted. Goddess Jaz looked at the planet between her fingers, mind racing with possible experiments to see if she really could do more than just grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Might as well try</i>. She shrugged. Jasmine focused on her objective. Using only the power of her will she wanted to see if it would become a reality.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was really only one thing of interest to Jaz and that was the tiny blue marble called Earth. Her large eyes locked onto it as she focused on the orb as intensely as she could. What was she doing? Not even she could tell you. It was just a passing whim, a fancy, a moment to do something that would never cause a reaction and expect one. Except, there was certainly a reaction here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God...\" Jaz was in awe at what she was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarth, big enough to fit between her fingers, was growing smaller. The Giga Goddess' fingers had to close tighter and tighter to keep from losing grip on it. Slowly it dwindled in size, with no other reason than the cocoa giantess willed it so. She wasn't growing. She didn't have the usual euphoric sensation that came with expansion nor did any of the neighboring planets or suns and stars get any smaller. It was only Earth that was getting smaller. And they didn't even know it. How could they? The sky was always the same shade of indistinguishable brown. It getting bigger didn't even register to them. It was just beyond their comprehension. And even if they did notice Jaz getting bigger so what? She grew from time to time. No one would've ever thought their world was getting smaller. Besides, with the recent stuff the girl did to them they weren't in much of a position to notice these subtle things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine could only stare blankly. For the first time in years she was genuinely dumbfounded. How long could she do this? How <i>did</i> she do this? Her favorite phrase popped to mind. <i>I am a Goddess</i>. She always meant it just as a joke, playful humor, a gag. Could it be true? Another test was in order. \"Okay....Grow!\" Jaz commanded the speck between her fingers. As per her orders, the planet returned to its normal marble size in moments. The Goddess stared blankly at Earth, mind racing with the infinite possibilities. She shook her head before she got too ahead of herself though. Changing something's size and doing anything were totally different. There had to be more tests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now though, only one test raced through the girl's mind. Her one poison. The one thing she could never do in all her life.  Her fingers released Earth and relocated so that the orb hovered inches over her palm. Jaz's entire life she had to be careful. Always cautious that she wouldn't destroy anything or hurt anyone. She never once allowed herself to intentionally harm anything, no matter how tempting it was. But...if she really was capable of anything. Then if she were to clench her fist right now Earth would be fine. But if she was wrong...everyone...everything she ever knew would be gone forever. For the first time in her life Jaz felt the dilemma of holding billions of lives in the palm of her hand. Even so, slowly, her fingers began to wrap over the tiny blue planet. Almost in a trance the girl stared in fascination, willing with all her heart that her home be okay. Her fingers balled into a fist with Earth in the heart of her palm. Then she finally did, she clenched her hand as hard as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was uncharacteristically nervous. This was all a sudden impulse yet here she just acted. Her hands were sweaty, messing with her usual sensitivity. Was Earth fine in her hands, or was she just holding a clump of dust? As her mind kept racing she couldn't tell anymore. She'd find out the second she opened her hand. But she was scared to. Not only would this determine whether or not Earth still existed, it would determine what kind of a being Jasmine was. Was she a gigantic girl, or something more? Slowly, the fingers opened, Jaz's eyes clenched shut in fear. Once her fingers opened all the way she allowed herself a peek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarth was fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe planet that took the full brunt of Jaz's power stood proudly. The Giga Goddess sighed in relief, her senses returning to normal. Things she was too nervous to realize began to register in her brain. She felt it all. The struggles of the tiny people as her hand held their world tighter than ever before. There were quakes, there were thunderous cracks. Entire nations were flooded with her nervous palm sweat. But no one was fine. Once again, as per her will, Jaz accomplished the impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't even awe. Jaz just...sat there, silent. But that quickly ended as the realization flooded into her. Her big grin returned as she cheered as loudly as she could. \"I'm a Goddess!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe possibilities were endless. Jaz didn't have to be careful anymore! She could do anything she wanted and it would all go her way! For the first time in her life, Jasmine felt like the universe was truly hers. She truly was a Goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what should my first act as a Goddess be...?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Decisions, decisions.\" Jaz mumbled, mind filled with the infinite possibilities. It had been ten minutes since she realized she was now truly a Goddess. With her intial fervor worn off she thought what she'd do next would be obvious. However her mind blanked, leading to this current brainstorm. Impatiently her finger tapped repeated only the insignificant planet before her. With the fear of destroying Earth gone Jaz didn't have to worry about any collateral damage. Her tapping her finger didn't do anyone any harm. Besides. She kind of liked the idea that with every second the planet had repeated quakes just from her tapping her little fingers on it. Each tap almost certainly had enough force to destroy the planet a dozen times over but in accordance with Jaz's godly will the planet remained safe and sound despite every contrary law of physics. Of course the little people on the world didn't know that. Each time Jaz's finger came down from the heavens everyone assumed this was the end. As the brown sky fell it was utter pandemonium. If the world didn't end it was a miracle. Then before any could celebrate the world not ending her finger came back down again. It was honestly rather amusing from the Goddess's perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Man, who knew being a Goddess was so tricky?</i> The girl frowned. She could literally do anything right now. But she couldn't decide between any of it. \"Maybe I can crush you guys between my toes...Nah...Maybe have you all lick em clean? Um....I can grow again? Ugh, but then what after? You guys have any ideas?\" Jaz rudely poked the planet with a bored look, \"None huh? Dunno why I asked. I'm the Goddess here. Hmm...\" Lost in thought the Goddess absentmindedly grabbed the planet and began to roll it between her fingers. Without the need for caution she couldn't care less what she did. Honestly it was really relieving. If not a little alarming how quickly Jaz threw caution to the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys are definitely worshiping me, no doubt about that. But how? I'm a Goddess now I can't just stick you guys on my toes and call it at that. I gotta make this <i>fun</i>.\" Her fingers starting to get tired, Jaz released the planet. For a brief instant the world was left alone to soak in everything in piece. Then Jaz's words filled the sky. \"Mom always said it's easier to think when you're chewing.\" Easily the girl sucked in a breath, bringing the planet into her mouth where it quickly became acquainted with her teeth. \"Mm...Maybe I can have you guys clean out my gums. Can't remember the last time I got to brush my teeth...Not that I ever needed to.\" She said between chews. As casually as one would think while eating normally, this girl had an entire planet between her teeth enduring multiple bites. It felt great of course but Jaz was too lost in thought to focus too much on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I can do anything maybe I should try to change the planet or make something appear. That could be fun.\" Her tongue wrapped around the planet and sucked, removing all the oceans in a second. Not a problem though. They were quickly replenished with the giantess's saliva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaz spat out the planet. \"No offense, but you guys taste like shit.\" She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time the world got a moment to breath while Jaz kept debating on her first act as a Goddess. It had to be great. It had to be something totally awesome. Something no other giantess could just do. \"Man if only I knew everything too.\" She sighed. Maybe she could get some inspiration from Earth? It was worth a shot. The Goddess reflected on all of the planet's culture she could remember. Before it all revolved around her of course. As a girl she got the typical society expectations to doll up and accessorize. Naturally Jasmine said screw that. Although...Now was as good as a chance as any. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'll keep it in mind.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat else was there....Games maybe? It'd been ages since the Goddess used any kind of toy or played a traditional game. She could even have her own spin on it. Planetary bowling. Swim laps in her spit. Heck, she could tie a rope to her toes and to Earth and play paddle ball with her feet...First she'd need to create a rope though....Hmm...She could always make the people build a statue of her...Oh but that'd take time. Maybe just make one? Or better yet, just make the Earth into something. That way she could <i>use</i> it and have people constantly worship her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! I can't pick!\" The girl groaned, dramatically throwing her limbs into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw it. I'm just gonna do the next thing that comes to mind!\" She finally declared stubbornly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as Jaz decided to do whatever came next it suddenly seemed so obvious. Of course by herself she'd have trouble coming up with ideas and playing with Earth. Doing something alone was never as fun as doing it with someone else. And there was only one person she knew that would be up to the job. <i>Gotta concentrate</i>. The girl thought to herself. She never tried anything like this before. Adjusting the Earth and people on it were one thing. Those already existed. But what Jasmine was trying to do was create something wholly new. It started off blurry. She had to envision it first and being new to her abilities didn't help either. Soon though her thoughts started to clear. What was at best a vague image began to grow more detailed and vivid. Her eyes were shut but Jaz was certain that something was being created in front of her. The perfect companion to her own perfect godly self. When she stopped she knew she was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna sit there with your eyes shut all day or you gonna take a peek?\" A familiar voice giggled. Jaz opened her eyes, fully aware of what she was about to see but nonetheless speechless. Before her was a perfect copy of herself. Same size, same proportions, same personality; even the same style of underwear albeit gray instead of purple. Jaz created the perfect companion for a Goddess: herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty great huh?\" The copy smiled confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as great as me.\" Jaz replied all too naturally. \"From now on I'll be Jaz and you can be Jazzy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, duh? We have the same mind. I already knew what my name was.\" Jazzy snarkily replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same sass too it looks like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You love it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just cause I love me.\" The Goddess turned her attention to the floating planet at perfect chest level between the two giantesses. \"You guys probably need an explanation so here's how it is. Now you have two Goddesses! I made another so we can have even more fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys are gonna worship me forever.\" Jazzy teased the planet. \"Once me and Jaz are done you guys are licking my toes <i>clean</i>. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way mine first!\" Jaz frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. We can both get our toes cleaned. I get one half the planet you get the other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't have said it better myself. Now then, I think all three of us need to celebrate another Goddess. Don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\" Jazzy grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarth of course had no say in the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's get started.\" Jaz slowly floating towards her copy. Likewise Jazzy did the same. The two met in a soft embrace, hands gently gripping each other's shoulders. The blue marble that was Earth was poised perfectly at their near-touching cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow what pervs.\" Jazzy snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, still it's a celebration. Might as well let them enjoy it.\" Jaz pulled Jazzy closer in. Their identical bosoms gently bumped into each other, pushing their breasts almost out of their bras. While a soft and sensual experience for the women, for Earth it was being crushed from all sides by the four breasts that each dominated a quarter of the planet. Neither Goddess expressed so much as a second thought towards the planet. It would be fine. This was all about Jaz celebrating her ascension as a deity. It was all about making her happy. If Earth had to get roughed up a bit in the process then oh well. It was pretty much her toy at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have amazing boobs Jaz.\" The copy stared down at her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your's aren't too bad either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey pulled one another tighter, chuckling as they felt the pandemonium Earth was experiencing from a mere hug on their part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should probably save them.\" Jazzy rolled her eyes. Though her voice seemed anything but displeased. The woman lowered her head towards Jaz's cleavage. Slowly her mouth opened and her tongue poked through meekly. The copy looked up at Jaz with mild embarrassment as she proceeded to lick her boob. Jaz tensed as a soft wetness touched her breast. That didn't make Jazzy stop. She leaned further into the Goddess's cleavage, nose pushing Earth deeper between her boobs. Carefully the copy poked her tongue out again, this time pulling Earth towards her with it. When it got close enough the giantess gripped it with her teeth and began to pull back from Jaz's bosom. Entire continents were sliced in half by Jazzy's galactic teeth but the giantess didn't even seem to notice them. Jaz stared at her copy with Earth poking out from between her lips. Jazzy's eyes dared Jaz to take it from her. Jaz was much too happy to oblige.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goddess leaned forward, startling her copy. Jazzy tried to pull back but Jaz's hand quickly stopped her. Before she knew it something was touching her lips. In an instant Jaz grew incredibly close. Jazzy realized her creator was kissing her. The copy welcomed it, opening her mouth just enough that Earth could dislodge from her luscious lips. Carefully they kissed, slowly breathing into one another. With each simple breath poor Earth found entire buildings and forests blown to opposite ends of the planet as a result of cataclysmic winds. Humanity couldn't expect it to get any worse, then the skies grew pink. On the opposite end of Earth was another identical shade of pink pushing from the opposite direction. The two gigantic tongues of Jaz and Jazzy met right where Earth was and quickly wrestled with each other with total disregard for the planet being flooded by their saliva or crushed between their tongues. Neither woman cared. Earth's suffering only added to the fun they were having. It'd been years since Jaz felt true human contact. Even if it was just a carbon copy of herself she couldn't deny the allure of finally having a companion after all these years. This copy existed to make things more fun and interesting and she surpassed even Jaz's godly expectations in that regard. She could feel a mutual wetness in her groin akin to Jazzy's. Both girl's shared the same thoughts and desires, and right now they had everything they ever wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to say how much time passed before they began to release one another. Jazzy drifted back several inches from Jaz who backed up a couple herself. Both had an embarrassed look on their face with a faint trail of saliva connecting their lips still, with Earth dead in the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was quite a celebration.\" Jaz mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I guess being able to do <i>anything</i> really does mean anything.\" Jazzy averted her gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being a Goddess is gonna be fun.\" Jaz smiled, beginning to regain her usual demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hell yeah.\" As was Jazzy. \"In fact, I think those germs on Earth owe us for getting to take part in that. Don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's almost like we're the same person.\" Jaz laughed. \"Get ready germs! It's time to payback your Goddesses!\"</span></div></div>",

In a large electronic sign, the words \u201dDR. CARTER'S PERFECT SURGERY\" proudly flashed across in large text. The leader of the family and small group stepped forward and entered through the automatic doors, her heels click-clacking against the sidewalk. She was known as Miss Ellen Spiral, and she was absolutely gorgeous. At the height of 5'11\", even without heels, she could have gone fashion model easily with her smooth skin, long brown locks flowing down her back, bright green eyes, and her toned and fit body with long, shapely legs, a DD-cup chest, and curves in all the right places. But, she had decided to settle down with a family. Recent events, however, have corrupted even her perfect life: A year ago, her husband had filed for a divorce, his lawsuit winning in court, taking half of what she owned and sharing their children on the weekends, Michael and Lily Spiral. Now, she believed the stress of it all was getting to her. Miss Spiral thought she spotted blemishes and crow's feet popping up on her face, her hair was falling out, and that she was gaining too much weight. All in all, she still appeared beautiful to others except for herself. So, her son, age 17, avid gamer and shut-in, had recommend this new surgery center for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Mom, this is the place!\u201d Michael affirmed yet again as they approached the receptionist\u2019s desk in the lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm...Well, this is a first. You actually didn\u2019t screw up for once,\u201d Lily chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d the mother of the group smiled as she began to talk to the receptionist. \u201cHello! I\u2019ve got a 1 PM appointment with Dr. Carter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, yes, Miss Spiral, I presume?\u201d the receptionist confirmed. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll call him and let him know you\u2019re coming up. Dr. Carter\u2019s office is on the 66th floor. Have a great day!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you very much! C\u2019mon guys, let\u2019s go,\u201d Miss Spiral said as she pointed to the elevators, the trio ascending the building and arriving at the doctor\u2019s office in another few minutes. Upon reaching the door to the office, Lily knocked on the door and was greeted by a \u201cCome in! The door\u2019s open!\u201d from the inside. The Spiral family entered the office and found themselves in a small azure waiting room with a man in a doctor\u2019s coat standing at the end of the room by another white door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, you must be Ellen Spiral!\u201d the man exclaimed. \u201cCome in, come in! I\u2019m Dr. Carter, and it\u2019s a pleasure to meet you. And I\u2019m guessing these are your lovely children.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, they\u2019re my little angels,\u201d Miss Spiral chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEwww...\u201d the children moaned in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Carter laughed before continuing. \u201cI see you and your family have a great sense of humor. Well, anyways, come with me into the examining room so we can begin. Your children can wait here while we\u2019re in the back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. Michael, watch your sister, and don\u2019t get into any trouble, alright my little guys? I\u2019ll be back before you know it!\u201d Miss Spiral said as she followed Dr. Carter into the back of the office, closing the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad Mom\u2019s happy,\u201d Michael said as sat down on a nearby couch and picked up a gaming magazine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but what\u2019s with the \u2018Perfect Surgery\u2019?\u201d Lily asked. \u201cMom\u2019s supposed to get, like, even hotter from this?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Michael replied blatantly, not even looking up from his magazine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily rolled her eyes and sighed. \"Thanks for being soooo informative.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Carter's supposed to be this miracle worker when it comes to plastic surgery, so it'll be like he's taken years off Mom, probably do a little nip and tuck here and there to make sure she stays that way. So, yes, he's making her hotter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't see why...\" Lily continued. \"Mom's already hot enough as it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael shrugged in reply, still looking bored as ever as he continued to flip through his gaming magazine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Miss Spiral,\" Dr. Carter said, strapping medical rubber gloves on, \"you may feel a few...sensations... as the process works itself out when we're finished. 'Perfect Surgery' tends to leave a few marks on the old body. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, pssh. I'll be fine,\" Miss Spiral laughed, laying flat on her back on a cold steel table, the room they were in appearing pure white, smelling of starkness and bleach. Surgical equipment lined every inch of space on the walls, from knifes to scalpels to pinpoint lasers, and even a table of strange bubbling chemicals. Dr. Carter walked over to his patient and held up a needle, injecting a strange purple liquid through the syringe into her arm. \"This will dull the pain and make it all more enjoyable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank...you...\" Miss Spiral gurgled as her vision went cloudy and all she could hear was dull beatings and a few tickles across her body. Within an hour's time, the surgery was complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I think I\u2019m gonna go try on some of my favorite clothes right now!\u201d the optimistic mother exclaimed as she excused herself from the table. \u201cMind doing the dishes today, kids?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! Thanks! I promise we\u2019ll go shopping tomorrow!\u201d Miss Spiral interrupted as she headed into her bedroom and closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you know what this means?\u201d Lily asked her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah, I do all the work, you watch TV,\u201d Michael sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral let out an almost irritated grunt as she put on the last of her clothing, squeezing into them as her new body was much bigger now. \"Ahhh...\" she sighed with relief as her ensemble stretched to conform to her new body. Walking over to the mirror, the woman did a little twirl as she gazed on at her new self's reflection. \"I look FANTASTIC!\" she giggled. Miss Spiral now wore a tight black sports bra and matching shorts that conformed around her hourglass figure, stretching taut against her lovely features. \"Y'know what...\" she mused to herself, \u201dI think I'll go for a jog! Might as well see how this new self does with exercise.\" Miss Spiral sat down for a moment to tie on some running sneakers, and in a few minutes, she was out the door, leaving Michael and Lily home. The two waved her goodbye as she ran into the distance of their urban neighborhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night air was extremely refreshing and the stars twinkled overhead brilliantly. Overall, it had been a perfect day for Miss Spiral: She had become perfect, her kids were perfect little angels, and the night was perfect. Everything was right in her world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the jog stretched on into hours, nobody was out except for Miss Spiral, all asleep as she jogged back home, feeling good about herself with the fresh exercise. Just ten minutes way from home though, she was beginning to feel very odd. \"Oh...ooh my...\" She suddenly stopped to clutch her head, the world spinning around her and millions of pinpricks popping up all over her body. \"These must be the sensations Dr. Carter warned about...\" she said as she tried to shake off the dizzying effects and ignored the dulling and numb feeling of her skin. When her vision had cleared and her body returned to normal seconds later, she was quite surprised: Everything had disappeared. Looking around, all Miss Spiral could see was a fog drifting around her ankles, and a glimpse past that fog, a little toy city with the skyscrapers not even comparable to the treads of her sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did everything go...?\" she asked herself, sounding quite confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael looked out the kitchen window awestruck, eyes wide, pupils dilated, and mouth dropped open.

Why? Wait a sec...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you see it? Right there...\u201d the older sibling pointed towards a section of the shoe tread where two letters were clearly visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cE...S...\u201d The youngest Spiral gulped as she took a few steps backwards. \u201cThat\u2019s...That\u2019s Mom\u2019s shoe...No way...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I can\u2019t believe it too,\u201d her brother admitted. \u201cHow the hell did she get so huge?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know either, but I bet she\u2019ll be on TV.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLily, we have to try to get her attention,\u201d Michael explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?

For all she knew, she simply jogged in the wrong direction into an empty field where a child had forgotten one of their toys. Bringing her face between her knee\u2019s to examine the \u201ctoy\u201d, she was amazed at the detail the little thing contained: Lights flickered in the skyscrapers, little multicolored dots that represented cars sped through the streets, and even smaller than that, itty-bitty specks of dust acted like people. <i>Toys these days sure were getting advanced,</i> she thought. Miss Spiral giggled slightly, imagining that the city actually was real and she was a titaness to the microscopic inhabitants below. How little she knew how true that statement was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how are we going to reach Mom?\u201d Lily asked as Micheal took a turn in their car, the two not finding much trouble getting through the streets as every other citizen was panicking for their lives at the sight of such a massive woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...I\u2019ll think of something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re all doomed...\u201d Lily facepalmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot necessarily...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily then looked at her brother with a disapproving glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, alright, so we\u2019re doomed,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut at least we can TRY to do something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess, but if we don\u2019t succeed, I\u2019m telling Mom it was all your fault.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is it MY fault?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno, but everything is usually your fault,\u201d Lily explained. \u201cRuining my last birthday: Your fault. Causing the power to go out in the house the other day: You plugged in your PS3 and caused the blackout. And now Mom is big enough to step on the entire city with probably just one of her toes: This has you written all over it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, we shouldn\u2019t be arguing right now about this,\u201d Michael sighed as he accelerated the family vehicle. \u201cAnd besides, I think I know how Mom got so big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow? Did you build a growth ray to zap Mom as a bonus gift for today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO! But think about it for a sec: What happened to Mom today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe went from a hot mom to a mega-hot mom,\u201d Lily sighed. \u201cWasn\u2019t that obvious from the dinner hug? Well, that and her jogging outfit now barely fitting her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly!\u201d Michael exclaimed. \u201cSomething had to happen to Mom during the surgery for her to get THIS big. I mean, c\u2019mon, I could understand a few inches taller, but a few dozen MILES taller?! There\u2019s something not-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust stop talking and drive!\u201d Lily demanded. \u201cLet\u2019s just stop Mom and go home. I don\u2019t want to miss tonight\u2019s new episode of my favorite show.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re thinking of TV at a time like this?!\u201d Michael said as he wanted to perform a facepalm of his own, but he could not take his hands off the wheel. \u201cUgh, let\u2019s just hope we reach Mom before she does anything...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The two kids could only watch as the massive running shoe in the distance got even bigger.  Pretty soon the treads were all that could be seen and clouds were seen alongside them.  The massive treads began swallowing mountains off in the distance behind the city skyline, flattening them like clay.  Just when the treads were about to start eating up houses the growth and tremors stopped.  Miss Spiral clutched her already massive breasts which swelled ever larger.  Her sports bra barely stood and her boobs practically spilled out.  The fabric was stretched so thin it was see through.  She giggled in pleasure and her laughter shook the world around her.  The feeling was such a rush that with the foot opposite the kids she brought up in her laughing fit and then brought it crashing down.  Her sneaker landed on a city, flattening the whole thing in an instant.  The shock wave tore apart houses miles away.  Of course Miss Spiral had no idea of the damage she was causing or her growth.  She just thought of it as a side effect of the surgery.  She stood there for a second, her massive, beautiful body hunched over the city.  A drop of sweat fell off her bra and feel to the kids below, destroying the whole intersection they were at.  The car is thrown under the liquid and the children begin choking.  Is this the end for the young Spirals?</span></div></div>",

The doctor had used the scandal for years but all he really did was use the liquid to cause these changes.  Only with the Spiral family it made them huge. The kids quickly swell up after they inhale large amounts of the liquid. Weird things were happening though.  Lily who was 10, began budding a small B cup.  Her thin, child like body grew a little more muscular and her skin had a certain shine to it.  Mike on the other hand was a more subtle change.  He started growing muscles but nothing really changed about him except he appeared younger, and healthier.  Pretty soon the two kids swelled to massive proportions like their mother.  Within seconds they were miles tall and had toes the size of mountains.  Mike had put on large sneakers which had flattened buildings.  Lily had huge flip flops on, the platforms were higher then the clouds and her colossal toes could barely be seen.  The two kids were soon big enough for the giga-sized Miss Spiral to see.  Soon the whole family was all at least 100 miles tall.  The two giant kids looked at their surroundings and began laughing, because they understood much more than Miss Spiral.  Lily saw a airliner flying my her toe and she soon crushed it between her much bigger fingers like a flea.  She began stomping her way through the countryside in her now tight revealing PJs, having a blast.  She was soon out of sight before the other giants could even get their bearings.  Miss Spiral was shocked as she watched her now giant sized daughter flatten city after city.</span></div></div>",

After awhile she found a city that was probably the most noticeable one at her size. She sat down in front of the city, crushing even more smaller towns and cities with her butt. The city was too small for her to enclose with her legs so she used her feet, she moved her feet until they came to the outskirts of the city, the space between them was roughly an inch for lily. She reached down with her right hand and grabbed the tallest building in the city, which for her was like picking up an ant, she giggled a bit at the sight of it before she crushed it between her fingers. Lily got bored of the city and pushed her feet together which flattened the city, she got back up, causing earthquakes for miles around her as she continued her little walk trough the country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of walking through the county and crushing countless cities and town she ended up near the ocean, where she found a few cities near the coast. She went to the coast she took off her flip flops and placed them next to one of the cities before she went into the ocean. She sat down in the ocean that only came up to her hips while she was sitting, this simple action created tidal waves that flooded most of the populated areas and sinking all the ships that weren't even visible to her. Before her she saw at least five cities that she could easily flatten each one with her pinkie but she had some more funs ways to play with them. Lily picked up one of the cities on her flip flop for later, the second one she picked up was placed between her cleavage, barely using any strength she pushed her breast together, making the city a tiny grey spot of dust on her clothing. The third she picked up and brought it to her mouth, she simply licked her finger and the city was gone. The last one that was noticeable to her she simply crushed it between her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily got back up and put her flip flops back on, forgetting about the city she placed on one of them, as she went back on land.

The USA wasn't lighting up like it usually did when she did her alarm clock routine.\"C'mon everybody.....\"She raised her massive bare foot and slammed it into what she hoped was a patch of empty land on the coast of the country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone on the coast of the country quickly perked themselves awake as a massive earthquake hit home, instantly awakening the USA\u2019s entire populace simultaneously. From any location in the United States, one could see the gargantuan foot of the titanic beauty firmly planted into the land, annihilating a large stretch of farmland as if it were nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere we go! You guys just needed some extra incentive this morning, didn\u2019t you?\u201d the large woman giggled playfully as she lifted her foot from the ground, leaving in its place a large foot-shaped crater. \u201cWell, now that you\u2019re all up, you\u2019re able to enjoy this wonderful day!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis titan of a beauty was known as Ellen Spiral, Miss Spiral to the populace of the world. She stood at an intimidating and towering 1500 miles tall, almost as big as the US's length. She wasn't always this astounding stature, in fact, she was a normal human long, long ago. But throughout her life, she began to have...spurts of size change. At first, they were small, maybe ten or twenty feet every day or so. But as she neared the age of an adult, they began to rapidly exponentiate, a marvel and a mystery to the scientific world. But as scientists had concluded, her growth won't slow down, in fact, it will increase. They've managed to create a chart of her size, and fortunately, she's in a dead zone right now, but she's due any day for a size upgrade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what to do today...\"She mused to herself, tapping her foot along to a tune, generating small tidal waves in the ocean. Being so large, she didn't really have much to do actually do other than play with the inhabitants of the USA, or go bother some other country. Sometimes, she liked to sing, or pretend she had a friend as big she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I know!\u201d she exclaimed to herself. \u201cI think I\u2019ll take a day off and give myself a nice rest. I work so hard for this planet that I think I could use a day off!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a cheerful chuckle, Miss Spiral began to hum a playful tune to herself, taking a few steps towards the Sahara desert in Africa, causing small quakes to pulsate through the entire planet with each impact of her soles against the ground. Upon reaching the stretch of wasteland only a few moments later, the colossal woman stopped in front of the desert and began to turn around, facing the United States while showing her mammoth, toned rear clad in a pair of tight black minishorts to the desert below her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, my own personal beach! What a great way to start off my day!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laid and stretched out her magnificent body to its full length, enjoying the bright sun's rays as she laid back and calmed down. Unfortunately, this would not be without consequence. Legally, Miss Spiral was a resident of the US, and she had just illegally crossed into a foreign country without the proper 'paperwork'. Many of the governments of the world liked to ignore this issue, as since the beauty could stride across the planet whenever she liked, but for some particular reason, the continent of Africa would not have her today. An armed force of foot soldiers, tanks, and aircrafts began to take up arms and head towards the giantess's location...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow THIS is a great day off!\u201d the monumental woman sighed happily as her toes stirred playfully in the Atlantic Ocean, sending wave after wave of small tidal waves towards the Western Hemisphere. However, as she continued to enjoy her \u2018beach getaway\u2019, Miss Spiral felt a small sting against her right thigh only a few minutes later. \u201cHmmm? What was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a short amount of time, the combined forces of the African nations had joined together at the American\u2019s legs, determined to force the giantess to leave their land alone, or if necessary, to kill this illegal alien who improperly came onto their land; the sting she had just felt was a series of bombs exploding against her skin, courtesy of their combined air squadrons. Luckily for the massive Miss Spiral, her skin was still as flawless as ever, the bombs having no effect on her skin. Noticing that their first assault was futile, the combined forces began a ground attack, multiple armadas of tanks and foot soldiers firing mercilessly at her magnificent form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the sting as nothing, Miss Spiral resumed her relaxed position, stretching her arms out, unknowingly either sending the entirety of the ground troops flying or crushing them.\"What a perfect day...\"She whispered happily to herself, rolling over to her front so that her back would be as equally tanned. The remaining forces were in awe as a shadow came over them, her massive breasts filling the sky as their last sight before being squashed. Missiles could only sting her, and bullets simply bounced off her skin. What else were they to do other than call a nuclear strike?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With no other options on the table, and the prospect of diplomacy with a 1500 mile woman impossible, the nations quickly gathered in an emergency council session and approved the use of nuclear force to get their point across. Though no nation on the continent was sanctioned to possess said weapons by order of the United Nations, each country had been secretly working on their own nuclear fission projects, and today would be the day that they would finally test the fruits of their hard work. Within minutes of Miss Spiral turning onto her stomach, 20 nuclear missiles were readied, each powerful enough to annihilate large cities in a single blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis day can\u2019t get any better,\u201d Miss Spiral happily hummed to herself as she continued to lie down. \u201cEverything\u2019s been just so perfect! I should take a beach vacation more often!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the command given, the missiles were launched simultaneously from all over Africa, each one of them seeking the same target: The living goddess known as Ellen Spiral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral perked her head up to a low whistling sound. She turned her head, ears piqued for the curious noise.\"Does anyone else hear that?\"She spoke aloud, fully knowing nobody replied, she just like to think of the conversation as an option. Within seconds of the sound, a massive jolt of pain erupted across her back as twenty nuclear arms crashed into her, generating massive mushroom clouds and enough radiation to kill countries dozens of times over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leaders of the nations cheered, a confirmed direct hit. But as the dust settled, their cheers turned to dismayed gasps at the sight of an unharmed, very, very angry Miss Spiral. And worst of all...she seemed to be growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Miss Spiral was a very calm and collected woman, her naturally cheery disposition and optimism making it practically impossible for her to become angered. In fact, the only time in her entire life that she ever became mad was when she overheard someone use a string of expletives and swiftly punished them for their foul mouth. However, due to the intense pain she felt, even at her immense size, she could no longer restrain her emotions: She. Was. Mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat...HURT!\u201d the growing woman screamed, her godlike voice waking up the entire planet as she slowly stood back onto her bare feet. \u201cMy vacation is RUINED!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe string of nuclear blasts had jump-started the titaness\u2019s temporarily halted growth, causing the dead period of her size chart to end and her growth condition to become reactivated. No one knew if her body would soon be enlarging soon to make up for the growth she had missed, but they knew one thing for sure: The old saying was indeed true - \u201cHell hath no fury like Miss Spiral\u2019s scorn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is responsible for RUINING MY VACATION?!\"She screeched, shattering glass across the planet and probably bursting a few eardrums as well. In her rage, her eyes turned to the more populated regions of the continent of Africa.\"You.\"She pointed a finger at the landmass.\"You couldn't just let me have a nice little tanning session....\"She seethed as she turned from 1500 miles tall to a peaking 2000, and still growing. The Sahara was quickly running out of room for her to stand on, and the cities closest to her were evacuating as quickly as they could from the walls of flesh that were her toes ever nearing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SOMEBODY needs to PAY for what they did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that instant, her growth reached an astounding 2500 miles, making her as tall as the USA was long. Fortunately, her growth halted...for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her newly obtained height, Miss Spiral took her first step, her clothes tearing due to being too tight, but she cared not but only for revenge for the cruel deed done against her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a swift punishment from the heavens, Miss Spiral stomped onto the center of the African continent...hard. In an instant, tens of millions of lives perished under her titanic sole, many innocent people extinguished in a moment\u2019s time along with hundreds of cities and villages. With the impact of her foot hitting the Earth\u2019s crust, the massive woman sent shockwaves coursing through the entire planet, causing 6.0 earthquakes to rock the remainder of the planet while a cataclysm larger than any numbers on the Richter scale devastated the continent. In fact, her impact was so powerful that her foot went through the planet itself, leaving a foot shaped crater in the middle of the landmass which quickly filled with volcanic lava from beneath the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving felt her step obtained her desired effect, Miss Spiral slowly lifted her foot up from the ground to examine her work, smiling proudly at her actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think THIS will make up for what you did to me?!\u201d she thundered, her engaged voice echoing across the globe. \u201cOh no, you need to PAY! You just caused me to rip part of my clothes too! And I LOVE my sports bra and shorts!...I\u2019m just getting started!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral bent down, revealing to the other half of the world her butt, stretching out her arms as wide as they went, digging her hands into opposite sides of the continent.\"This is what you deserve for hurting me...\"She whispered fiercely. Like a female Atlas, Miss Spiral gave a mighty grunt as she heaved and picked up the entire landmass of Africa, holding it high above her head like a prize to be won. She tossed it into the air with all of her considerable might, the chunk of rock floating into space aimlessly. In a matter of minutes, every remaining survived suffocated due to the lack of oxygen. Without remorse, Miss Spiral wiped her hands of her deed, and turned back to her home, the United States.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm terribly sorry you had to see that, everyone...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The people of the United States were both stunned and impressed by the sight the world had just witnessed: The complete and utter removal of a continent from the Earth. People from across the globe quickly began to address the incident as a triumphant victory for the now 2500 mile woman, praising Miss Spiral for her actions while shaming the former Africa for taking unauthorized and unnecessary action against her. Scientists quickly rushed to their size charts, taking note of her magnificent increase of 1000 miles in less than a minute. Most of all, everyone in the USA breathed a sigh of relief, glad that she was a citizen of their nations. Today, the entire planet learned that Miss Spiral was a force to be reckoned with, despite her inherently pleasant and cheerful nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, my day is just ruined now...\u201d she sighed as she turned back towards the large hole in the ground where the landmass once stood, it now filling with countless gallons of ocean water, her foot imprint still etched into the planet\u2019s surface. \u201cWhy did they have to ruin my vacation day at the beach? And my favorite and only outfit is torn as well...\u201d She then turned back to the United States once more. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry about that once again, everyone. But I can assure you, I\u2019m still the same me!\u201d she smiled as she tapped her toes on the ground. \u201cStill, I wonder if I can get these clothes fixed somehow. They\u2019re just so tight and comfortable! Oh well...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Miss Spiral yanked off her tattered bra and shorts, revealing her naked glory. Mothers across the globe covered children's eyes and perverts dashed to their telescopes just to get a view of the nude goddess towering above the horizon. She casually threw them into outer space, her ruined clothes joining the doomed landmass to float away into the darkness of outer space. She approached the coast of America, plopped her butt down and waited, just like she always did. Every time she grew, she had to be 'examined' by government officials and scores of scientists to get accurate readings for her growth chart and health. This was something pretty regular, and it was one of the very few times she got to interact with the tinies. She just feared the day she would no longer be able to hear or see them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like countless times before, fleets of tiny specks known as jets hovered in front of her eye. She held out her hand, and they landed on her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake your time, guys,\u201d she said to the scientists who emerged from the planes. \u201cYou just keep getting tinier and tinier every time we do this. I can barely even see you anymore!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe privileged scientists began to perform their various tests to monitor the woman\u2019s size and health of her improved body, finding it hard, as usual, not to stare at her beautiful form - her large bust, her toned butt, her divine legs and feet, and her stunningly gorgeous face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t mind. It\u2019s actually nice to know that I\u2019m still gawked at by all you tiny ones!\u201d Miss Spiral giggled.\u201dBy the way, how\u2019s the thing where getting clothes that grow with me? Project Infinite Spiral?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lead scientist, a man going by the name of Dr. Connor, replied with a microphone amplified to it's highest setting, still a mere whisper to the titanic being.\"We're terribly sorry Ma'm, but it's still in it's....get up and go stages. We're still trying to get cotton to reach the one mile mark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled her eyes and sighed. One mile high was so...tiny. Ever the optimist, she still smiled.\"It's okay guys, I know your trying your best!\"Her grin widened, warming the hearts of the men on her hand.\"I'm sure you'll get it in no time! I can go in the breeze until then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Miss Spiral...\"Dr. Connor stuttered.\"Now, we just have to go through the usual examination. Is that alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any strange sensations?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, just the gigglies in my stomach from being so happy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No fatigue or weariness from your new height?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling more chipper than ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good...\"He flipped through some notes.\"Now, Miss Spiral, we have some news about your....children. It's not...good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral suddenly froze in place, her cheerful attitude suddenly gone as she quickly became worried about her own flesh and blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat...What is it?\u201d she asked stoically. \u201cWhat...What happened to my little angels?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her monolithic size, Miss Spiral\u2019s two children were her entire world. She could do anything to the planet and the world to have fun, but the last thing she would ever do would be do harm her children, even only accidentally. Even throughout her rapid increases in size, Miss Spiral always tried to prevent her children from her adventures, though she did occasionally ask for a foot massage, but only as a joke. Now, however, her reasons for her existence here said to be in bad shape by this scientist. As a mother, she feared for the worst, while simultaneously hoped for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre...Are you sure you wish to know?\u201d he asked once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral paused for a moment, thinking a bit before answering. \u201cYes...Please...Please just tell me they\u2019re alright...\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, they're totally safe! It's just that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They've been...sort of....kidnapped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......Kidnapped.\"She spoke the word as if it were foreign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...by an Anti-You group. The uh....what were they called? Spiraling Out of Control?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I've heard of them...\"Miss Spiral said this darkly. It was a group that had formed in her early years of giantesshood, back when she was an early mother as well. The group was lead by her ex-husband, a man who could not take having such a....freak for a wife. Though their opinion was unpopular, the group had a strong number of supporters amongst politicians eager to win votes and extremists. Only once before had the protestors tried something drastic...sending a firebomb at her when she was a mere 500ft. tall. It ended with half of downtown New York destroyed and many of the Anti-Spiralers going to the hospital that day. But this was...too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we have their location, but...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut...I was told not to tell you where,\u201d Dr. Connor replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not?!\u201d Miss Spiral asked. \u201cMy kids are in danger!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, since you removed Africa from the planet like you did earlier, the government is just being cautious of your increased strength,\u201d he explained. \u201cI\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t give you that information for fear of what you may do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me where they are...NOW!\u201d she asked once again, this time a little irritation present in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I can\u2019t...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou thought I was mad before? You\u2019ll see something much worse than that happen right now if you don\u2019t tell me what I need to know. I was just a mad woman before - I\u2019ll be a mad mother now, and nobody wants to see that happen. Now then, I\u2019ll ask you one last time: Where did they take my children?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Connor gulped heavily before replying, \u201cAlright, but I didn\u2019t tell you this! They\u2019ve been taken deep into the Mojave Desert to a secret bunker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you very much,\u201d Miss Spiral smiled. \u201cHold on kids, Mommy\u2019s coming!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of minutes the scientists had packed their equipment and flew far away from the wrath of the giant mother. Miss Spiral stood up to her full and proud height eager for the task ahead. She would save her babies, win the nation\u2019s love yet again, and sting her prick of a husband.\u201dOh yes....\u201dShe smiled almost mischievously this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to the US, her eyes set on California. With only two steps she arrived, towering over the puny state. With a loud and commanding voice, she spoke:\u201dAlright Freddy,\u201dShe addressed her ex-husband by his nickname. He absolutely hated it.\u201dI know you and your silly little friends are down there with my babies. Now, I\u2019m going to give you a chance to stop pretending that you\u2019re so tough, and let them go. otherwise, you\u2019re going to have an angry, 2500 mile tall woman stepping onto the land, ready to give you a piece of her mind. Now, what is it going to be?\u201dShe knelt down and eyeballed the area of the Mojave Desert, searching for any signs of movement from a group.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a few minutes since she had given her ultimatum, yet Miss Spiral spied no signs of life within the desert sands. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you one last time, let my babies go,\u201d she thundered. \u201cYou saw what I did earlier today; I\u2019m going to do something even worse to you if you don\u2019t give them up right this instant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another few seconds, a small cluster of specks caught the titanic mother\u2019s eye from amongst the endless white desert. \u201cMy little darlings! Are you alright?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t come any closer!\u201d a voice spoke to her from a loudspeaker from way down below. \u201cIf you do, they both get it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou...monster!\u201d Miss Spiral growled angrily, recognizing the familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe? I think you\u2019re the monster here, Ellen!\u201d her ex-husband replied. \u201cYou just keep growing and growing and growing...Hell, look what you did today!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you curse at me!\u201d she instinctively fired back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill the same old Ellen, just bigger...Listen, go away right now and I won\u2019t have to pull the trigger here...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom! Help!\u201d her two children cried out in unison to their gigantic mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFreddy. One last warning, and that\u2019s it.\u201dShe said, dangerous intent in her eyes and her words. She stood back up to her towering height, some of the men below instantly cowering at the sight of the goddess before them. Yes, she was nude, but this only added to their awe, as if a being out of some ancient mythology had decided to step into their world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Frederick.\u201dHe cried up, pressing the glock closer against Lily\u2019s, the youngest daughter, forehead.\u201dDad, you\u2019re a douche.\u201dShe muttered as she gazed over at her older brother Micheal, who struggled against the grip of two burly men that held him by his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re not getting our kids!\u201dHe continued on in his rant.\u201dJust look at you! You\u2019re not even a fucking human anymore! You\u2019re a gigantic, resource-wasting, space-crowding, dunderhead of a monster!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c.......Very well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash she stepped onto the land, her footstep generating a massive sandstorm, stirring up dunes and wastes that had been untouched.\u201dMicheal, Lily! Run while the bad men are blinded!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey followed suit, fleeing their captors with gunshots narrowly missing them. When the dust settled, the group saw no children, only a mighty and terrifyingly angry goddess staring down at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFreddy...Nobody, and I mean NOBODY threatens to kill my babies!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure her children were out of the way, Miss Spiral lifted up her foot without hesitation and began to repeatedly slam her sole into the desert sands, taking out her motherly rage and frustration on those who dared to harm the most precious things in her life. After over 50 stomps in a row, the monolithic mom stopped her rampage and examined what she had done: Not a single trace remained of those who instigated this kidnapping incident, nor their secret bunker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was sure that they were completely gone, she turned her attention back towards another section of the desert sand, eagerly searching for her loved ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKids? Kiiiiids?! Where are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMOOOOOOOMMMM!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly gaining her attention, the behemothic woman soon noticed two small specks jumping wildly in the sand, trying to gain the attention of their saviors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy babies!\u201d she happily proclaimed. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re alright! Mommy came to rescue you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knelt down and extended a finger towards the barely-visible specks, who eagerly climbed onto the familiar safety of the wasteland of skin. She raised it slowly as to not pop their eardrums or make it hard for them to breathe. As gently as she could, Miss Spiral hovered her finger in front of her eye, giving the children a panoramic view of the green globe in front of them.\u201dOh, my babies...I was so worried...\u201dShe sobbed, tears beginning to trickle down her face and make gigantic splashes into the land below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks...thanks for saving us Mom.\u201dMicheal said, hugging the ground as best as he could. Lily did the same, and Miss Spiral held her finger to her cheek, the best hug she could give without accidentally crushing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I\u2019m going to take you both back home, alright? Don\u2019t talk to strangers, do your homework, and please...don\u2019t speak to the media.\u201dShe emphasized on the last one greatly.She would surely have to address her adventures for the day with some news reporter, but for now, her children were safe, her almost-terroristic husband was dead, and it was an overall happy ending for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Mom,\u201d the two agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh, I just have the most wonderful little angels for children,\u201d she smiled down at her palm. \u201cNow just hang on guys; I\u2019ll go as slow as I can. If my clothes weren\u2019t destroyed earlier, I could keep you two safe in my bust until we got there...Oh well, you still get to ride first class on Mom Airlines!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of which, Mom,\u201d Lily began as her mother began the two step journey back to their hometown, \u201cdid I hear you say you were 2500 miles tall earlier?  Weren\u2019t you just 1500 miles tall this morning?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy yes, I was, but you know me, I just got bitten by the growth bug again today,\u201d her mother enthusiastically replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat growth bug sure was intense, huh?\u201d Michael asked. \u201cI mean, you put on about 1000 miles today, Mom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I had to make up for lost growth, dear. I didn\u2019t grow for a really long time as you know, so my body just had to make it up in one big growthy burst. Now you can brag to all your friends at school that your mom has had the biggest growth spurt ever!\u201d she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou broke the record, Mom...again...\u201d the kids reminded her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI sure did.\u201dShe giggled in reply, her hometown so tiny below at her feet. As slowly as possible to keep her children safe and the inhabitants below, she crouched down and extended her finger towards her old neighborhood, her children getting off and landing in the general vicinity of their home. It was a good twenty minutes walk away, but they didn\u2019t mind. If their mother had tried to get them any closer, her finger probably would\u2019ve demolished the entire neighborhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNight Mom!\u201dThey called up before continuing one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight, my little ones.\u201dShe said sweetly as she carefully walked off of the US and into the ocean.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cLily, is it me, or does Mom really love her size?\u201d Michael asked his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDuh, where have you been all these years?\u201d the younger sibling countered. \u201cRemember when mom was just a few hundred feet tall? And then remember when she was \u2018a Momtastic  multiple mile woman\u2019? Even then, she would just keep saying how much she enjoyed the view from up there, and how she was still tiny...Mom thought being over 10 miles tall was tiny!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoint taken.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding proudly in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, Miss Spiral gently drummed her toes against the planet\u2019s surface as she gazed off at the Eastern Hemisphere and the gaping hole she had left in the Earth. \u201cYou know,\u201d she began, talking to no one yet simply enjoying pretending there was someone her size she was talking to, \u201cdespite all that happened today, I think I had the most fun I\u2019ve had in years!\u201d she giggled happily to herself. \u201cThose meanies who ruined my vacation won\u2019t be bothering anyone else anymore, and my little angels are safe and sound thanks to their giant mom...You know what, I think I deserve another day off tomorrow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a happy and very content sigh of relief, Miss Spiral laid down in the ocean, stretching her body out with a great yawn.\u201dI\u2019ll have to rest up if my vacation tomorrow is going to be any fun...\u201dShe mumbled to herself, ignoring the wet waves beginning to ebb in and out across her body. Over the past few years, in her more latest sizes, she had taken to sleeping across the sprawl of expansive sea, now becoming less and less expansive to her. But, the sound of the waves so close to her was calming, and in a few minutes time, she was asleep, her soft snoring gently lulling others to rest as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, while most of the Western Hemisphere slept softly, the scientists who had partially examined her body earlier in the day were still hard at work plotting all of the data they had acquired from the massive woman. With today\u2019s immense spurt, they were now completely baffled; even they could no longer correctly predict when or how much she would grow, and how she continued to survive without needing to perform such basic human functions as consumption and breathing. Even so, these scientists continued to monitor Miss Spiral even while she slept; she was known to occasionally have a growth spurt while she rested, but these occurrences were usually rare. Still, her mammoth frame had to be monitored nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she slept, her gentle snoring soothed all of those in the Eastern Hemisphere who were currently awake, her slumber placing all of them in a calm mood as per usual - this was another reason why Miss Spiral was accepted by most nations despite of her size: Her voice managed to bring peace to the world by activating a wave of tranquility that swept through the planet like that of a siren\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sun began to rise along the western seaboard, its massive light shone down upon the nude 2500 mile mother of two resting peacefully, even in sleep a smile present on her face. Slowly, her body began to turn in the ocean, signaling that the titaness would soon be awake once again, eager to finally take a personal vacation. Of course, she wouldn\u2019t forget to wake everyone else up as she did every day before going off on another gigantic adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a yawn, she stood up, wiping the sleep from her eye and stretching her body heavenwards to work out the kinks in her muscles that had come from lying still for so long.\u201dWakey wakey, everyone...\u201dShe spoke, gently tapping her hand into the ground below, small vibrations waking up the world to their day as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, let\u2019s see what I can do today...\u201dShe said to herself, hands on hips as she scoured the lay of the land around her. She turned towards a goal she had not visited in some time, Asia. With a grin, she began her five-step trek towards the largest landmass in the world.\u201dHello Asia!\u201dShe greeted with a small wave.\u201dI guessed the biggest continent in the world wouldn\u2019t mind the biggest woman in world visiting them?\u201dShe chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo whomever would look up, all they would see was a foot dominating the landscape and a vast expanse of a shadow stretching over their land, and above that foot, a mighty, curvy colossus disappearing into a blur she was so high in the atmosphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo then, I\u2019m here strictly for fun, so go ahead and continue doing what you\u2019re doing. I\u2019m just here to take a much needed day off,\u201d she explained with another chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick movement of her body, Miss Spiral plopped her butt on the continent\u2019s eastern coast and stretched out her luscious legs in front of her while gazing out over towards the rest of Asia. As she gently rubbed her calves and thighs, she quickly spotted something that piqued her interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Is that the Great Wall? I guess it\u2019s true what they say, it CAN be seen from space...Just like me!\u201d she giggled. In fact, Miss Spiral was actually telling the truth: If one were to open up Google Earth, one could see her easily sticking out from the planet near the United States, the most recent image captured about a month ago when she was at a much smaller size. \u201cWould you mind if I did a little bit of measuring? I\u2019d love to see what\u2019s bigger, it or me now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot like anybody could reply, she leaned over towards the wall, extending her hand towards it, hovering her fingers directly over the structure, whoever standing on the wall at that moment catching a glimpse of the sheer magnitude of the being before them. After holding her fingers towards it in every direction, she took it that the wall\u2019s thickness didn\u2019t even compare to that of her fingernails. Her longest finger was a good fraction of the wall\u2019s length.\u201dWow, I really did grow, didn\u2019t I?\u201dShe said to herself in surprise.With every growth spurt, she had begun to take it as a commonplace thing. She would find increasing increments like feet or yards barely noticeable, and even miles didn\u2019t faze her. But a thousand mile jump? That just made her all giggly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, thanks for letting me use your wall!\u201dShe grinned, laying back down to enjoy some sunning. But, she felt a tiny, tickling sensation on her sides. Peering down, it seemed she had...worshippers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm? Oh, hello down there little guys!\u201d she smiled warmly at the tiny people near her hips. \u201cCome to make sure I had a great day off? My, what service! I\u2019ll have to come to visit Asia more often; it\u2019s like I\u2019m being treated like a goddess!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral didn\u2019t know how right she was; with her size comparison stunt at the Great Wall, many people who had never viewed the titaness up close became enamored by her sheer size and beauty, despite only seeing a fraction of her curvaceous form. Combined with her recent jump in height from yesterday and her dual displays of power, various people on the continent, mostly men, began to regard the American mother as a true goddess, simply praising her name in respect for her size and strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm...Well, let\u2019s see...\u201d she pondered for a moment before coming up with an idea. \u201cOh, I know! What\u2019s a vacation without a nice massage to go with it? Mind if I get a little bit of pampering?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The worshippers were only too eager to reply as shouts of \u201cYES!\u201d resounded nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWonderful!\u201d she giggled. \u201cIt\u2019s good to know even someone as big as me is treated with such kindness. Now then, I\u2019ve got just the place you can work on...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed her hand beside the large group of mites that had gathered by her, and they eagerly climbed aboard, though it took some a few minutes to scale the massive wall of flesh. Miss Spiral was patient though. Once she made sure all were centered in her palm, with her free hand, she plucked a group of over a hundred men onto one finger, sitting up, reaching down, and depositing them in between her big and second toe.\u201dHope you guys don\u2019t mind the smell of feet.\u201dShe chuckled, returning her attention to the ones still in her palm. The process repeated with a hundred or so worshippers being placed inside her naval, along her thighs(though, she did warn them not to go near her vagina), some more between her other toes or actually on the appendage itself, and even some of the lucky ones were placed atop of her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying back down flat, she grinned.\u201dAlrighty boys, get to work!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing her eyes in relaxation, Miss Spiral could feel thousands of tiny sensations all across her magnificent body, each of them joining together to form the equivalent of a full-body massage. Despite where they may have been placed, the worshippers were as fervent as they were before, enjoying rubbing the soft skin of the 2500 mile woman they considered a deity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm...Yes, just like that...\u201d she moaned softly. \u201cThis is absolutely wonderful, even better than my day at the beach yesterday! Keep up the great work!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInspired by their \u201cgoddess\u201d\u2019s praise, the men continued to work hard, making sure the mammoth mother was enjoying her day in Asia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer rest continued for an hour, the men working hard to keep her massaged and pleased. Her voice alone caused them to stop immediately and listen to her every word.\u201dOh my...thank you so much everyone, it was so nice and pleasant!\u201dShe announced happily, reaching all over her body and regathering the masses.\u201dNow boys, I\u2019d like some alone time, so return to your homes, jobs, and possibly your wives.\u201dShe chuckled at the last part.\u201dGo on, I\u2019ll probably take another vacation real soon!\u201dShe set her hand down, and they all reluctantly left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBack to tanning, this time, totally uninterrupted...\u201dShe rolled over onto her stomach, allowing her sleek back, full butt, and toned legs to get some sun as well. Unknown to her though, a small assembly of only four men remained, hiding out on one of her toenails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou...you sure this is safe?\u201dOne man asked nervously.\u201dI mean...we shouldn\u2019t even be here! She\u2019ll kill us if she finds us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe won\u2019t find us. She\u2019s too goddamned humongous to even properly see another human being.\u201dThe leader of the group replied by smacking the nervous man upside the head.\u201dNow, we all know the plan, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all nodded fervently.\u201dYou all are each given a small, but extremely powerful explosive that you are to place at a designated location across this bitch\u2019s body. Once we\u2019ve all reported in, we set them off, and boom goes this bitch! She won\u2019t ever mess with Spiraling Out of Control again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining three men nodded in agreement, readying their devices. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll get her foot. You three plant the others on her leg, butt, and back - I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll feel that last one for sure; 20 nuclear missiles really take a toll on a person\u2019s body, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s still in pain from it. Now, get to work!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking off their tops, the men revealed handmade jet pack prototypes on their backs, allowing them to reach the targeted parts of the giantess\u2019s body in a short period of time. Because they had observed her tanning ritual from the day before, the team knew that they would have plenty of time to execute the operation before Miss Spiral flipped onto her front. In the timespan of a few hours, each operative had planted their respective device on a skin cell on her body (her back taking longest to reach), specifically those connected to sensitive nerves that would increase the force of the explosion felt by her. Once all of them were affixed to her body, the group rendezvoused at the specified location, right off of the coast of where Miss Spiral lay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is for what you did to our leader and our other comrades!\u201d the leader of the group declared as he held the detonator in his hands. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten too big, bitch. You should\u2019ve died LONG ago, you massive freak! Now face the wrath of Spiraling Out of Control!\u201d With that, his finger pressed down on the detonation device, activating the explosives on the mega-mom\u2019s body.</span></div></div>",

The bomb on her foot was directly connected to her achilles heel, nearly crippling her. The one on her posterior generated a massive blast, and the one located on her back was where a majority of the nuclear arms had gone off just the day before. With a sudden gasp of pain, waves upon waves of agonizing fire ripped through her body.\u201dNot...again!\u201dShe gasped out, only for the unfamiliar hold of unconsciousness to overtake her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMission accomplished.\u201dThe leader of the group grinned wickedly. He held up a phone.\u201dThe Big Bitch is down, I repeat, the Big Bitch is down.\u201dHe cackled as the men behind him high-fived at the deed they had just done. Though, the nervous man was very unsure of himself. They had just harmed, and possibly killed, another human being, despite how massive she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of minutes, it was being broadcasted all across the world. Miss Spiral, the living goddess, had been harmed once more, and was currently unreactive and unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the Spiral home, Michael and Lily were sitting around, the former gaming and the latter watching her favorite television program in the opposite room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, mind turning that down a bit?\u201d Lily asked her brother. \u201cI can\u2019t hear my show!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd miss hearing what Ezio Auditore has to say? I don\u2019t think so!\u201d the elder brother replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh! I\u2019m sooooo telling Mom next time we see her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately after Lily had uttered those words, the television station she was watched had broke in to breaking news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMicheal! Get in here NOW!\u201d she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you, I\u2019m not turning down Assassin\u2019s Creed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! It\u2019s Mom! She\u2019s unconscious!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael immediately dropped his controller and rushed into the other room, both children looking on in fear of the sight of their giant, sexy mother unconscious and face-down in the Pacific Ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s...She\u2019s gonna be alright...right?\u201d Lily asked her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah, of course,\u201d Michael nodded, a bit unsure himself. \u201cI mean, this is Mom we\u2019re talking about here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe she was right...Maybe she really wasn\u2019t big enough yet...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Don\u2019t start talking like that! She\u2019s probably just fine!\u201d he reassured her. \u201cShe brushed off a nuclear assault against her yesterday, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but...but she was at least conscious then...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...boss?\u201dThe nervous man tugged at the leader\u2019s sleeve, the four terrorists settling down for a victory beer. The larger and much more gruff man turned to the smaller one with a glare in his eye.\u201dWhat is it?\u201dHe barked out, taking a deep swig of the drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just wondering...don\u2019t you think that what we just did was...bad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader paused, only to smack nervous across the face again.\u201dWhat are you, in kindergarten?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut boss...we probably just killed somebody...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen here you pussyfuck...\u201dThe leader yanked him up by his shirt collar.\u201dThat Big Bitch isn\u2019t a \u2018somebody\u2019. She\u2019s a giant monster, a catastrophe waiting to happen. For God\u2019s sake, she picked up an entire continent and threw it off the planet! We just saved the world kid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt the cost of a life...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt the cost of a few explosives. You know how much it costs to make those things?!\u201dThe leader threw down nervous man with a deep, growling laughter, the other two joining suit in their drunken revelry. Nervous man stood up shakily, dusting himself off, turning to the still Miss Spiral in the distance, only for his eyes to widen.\u201dUhh....boss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT, you little fuck?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s getting bigger.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Those residents who lived on Asia\u2019s eastern coast ran in fear as her full, enormous breasts began to grow towards the land, soon about to act as massive bulldozers of calamity to give the women more space to expand. Her growing form caused the waters around her to ripple outwards in every direction as well, causing small tidal waves to head towards Japan and the western coast of the United States, though the latter\u2019s waves would break apart before ever making landfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat...that BITCH!\u201d the leader growled in frustration. \u201cNo matter what we do, she just keeps getting bigger!

We go all-out, making sure we kill her no matter what!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, b-boss...\u201d a henchman began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it now?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cL-Look...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her body neared 3000 miles in height, the titanic beauty\u2019s body began to stir, gently waking from her unconscious state...and still growing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my...what...what happened?\u201dMiss Spiral said groggily. She had never experienced being unconscious before, and the feeling left her quite unnerved. As she slowly rose, the world watched on in a mixture of awe, terror, and wonder. In another display of size, she had upgrade an extra set of size, now a whopping 3500 miles tall. She looked around as if she was confused, the tiny landscape now even smaller from her heightened vantage point.\u201dIt looks like little ol\u2019 me got a bit bigger...again....\u201dShe giggled, stretching her full body towards the heavens, flexing and posing for all of the millions of micro tinies looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t fucking believe it...\u201dThe leader griped.\u201dShe\u2019s not even hurt! She just shrugged off bombs attached to her fucking nervous system!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon you mopes...\u201dHe waved, his other three lackeys following.\u201dWe gotta report back with the rest of the group...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nervous man sighed with relief knowing that she was still alive, but was also simultaneously filled with dread knowing that the group\u2019s motivations had finally reached their ultimate goal: The complete and utter annihilation of the 3500 mile mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I certainly must be getting from the growth fairy pretty often. I think I\u2019ve doubled in size over the past day...Well, you know what they say, bigger is better!\u201d Miss Spiral smiled to herself, proudly stomping the ground below to get a feel of her new size, the monumental mother now larger than the USA was wide. Turning back towards the Asian continent, she waved happily at her billions of fans. \u201cThanks for the great day everyone! Hope you didn\u2019t mind my little growth spurt. I\u2019m definitely gonna take my next vacation here for sure. Bye~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing she had to report for measuring and testing once again, the titaness began to hum a tune to herself as she made her return trip, now taking only three earthshaking steps to complete rather than the five she took earlier. Reaching the spot in the ocean she had sat in the day before, Miss Spiral gently sat down and extended her palm, waiting for the scientists to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut come they did not. She had sat there and waited a good thirty minutes, only for the alarms inside her head to go off. Something was definitely wrong, and she could feel it this time. Standing back up, she turned to look at the US, almost a mid-sized carpet she could walk across if she wanted to, but that would be terrifyingly wrong, billions of people and cities crushed underfoot. She shuddered at the thought, especially if her two babies were to be in her path.\u201dDr. Connors? Tiny government men? Hello-o-o, I\u2019m ready for my check-up!\u201dShe spoke, knowing full well they could hear her, everybody across the planet could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHellllllllllllllloooooo-ooooo!\u201d she called out again. \u201cAnyone at all down there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething inside of her, most likely her mother\u2019s intuition, told her something was amiss. Normally, the government scientists would have arrived by now and her test would be over, but for some reason, their absence worried the titanic woman. Ever the optimist, she continued to hope her intuition was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm...Should I just come to you guys this time?\u201d she asked. \u201cOr if you need me to lay down, I can always do that. Just let me know!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another five minutes of waiting, she still didn\u2019t receive any reply. Now unsure of what to do, Miss Spiral decided to talk with the two humans who would always talk with her: Her children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMicheal, Lily, come out of the house, Mommy\u2019s coming home for a quick visit!\u201dShe took only one small step this time, and her hometown was right by her feet.\u201dOh my, it looks like this place gets smaller and smaller everytime I visit...\u201dShe giggled, only for a very, very small thing to pique her interest. A helicopter was circling around her toes. Probably a news media copter. With a heavy sigh, the monolithic Mom knew she would have to speak with them sooner or later, might as well be sooner. She just hoped her babies wouldn\u2019t mind. Reaching down, she plucked the tiny thing right out of mid-air with her fingernail, raising it up to her eye for a good look of the micro mites occupying it.\u201dWhat is it that you want?\u201dShe asked, sounding almost irritated. Very few things made her upset, but one sure thing did: The media. They always asked the dumbest questions and assumed the worst things, especially with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small woman stepped out of the copter with a camera man behind her.\u201dMay we get a few words from the living goddess herself about the events over the past few days?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA few words? Sure: I got even bigger,\u201d she answered succinctly, obviously annoyed by the local news team. \u201cIs that all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, mind if we just ask you a few more questions?\u201d the interviewer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust make it quick,\u201d she responded, her voice slightly angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. Well then, what do you have to say about getting rid of Africa yesterday? Don\u2019t you think that was a bit extreme?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey nuked me...Have you even been hit with nuclear missiles before?\u201d the gigantic woman asked, her annoyance reaching critical levels due to another of the media\u2019s dumb questions. \u201cI made them pay for what they did to me, simple as that. Can we hurry this up please? I need to see my kids.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about Spiraling Out of Control? What do you think about their attack on you today? Lastly, why do you think you\u2019ve grown over two times your size in only two days time? Do you think all of humanity is doomed to fall against your growing body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, the titanic being rolled her eyes.\u201dOkay, all in that order: I believe they\u2019re a terrorist group, attacking me for no good reason just because I exist, and their \u2018attack\u2019 on me backfired, it just made me harder to kill. And, I like being this big, I really do, and to be honest, I have absolutely no idea why I\u2019ve grown like this, ask some scientists around, they\u2019ve plotted out a chart that maps my growth.\u201dShe paused as she considered the last question, she had heard it many times before, and it always unsettled her. Early on in her growing stages, one scientist had come up to her and told her bluntly that it was a very likely outcome that she could become big enough to destroy the world if she wanted to. She thought the idea silly at the time, as she was only around 30ft. tall back in her 20s, but now with all of the activity recently, the prospect was becoming more and more likely.\u201dI believe...that I would never harm anyone of this earth, at least not intentionally. Earth is safe as long as I am around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough questions for now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut we\u2019re just getting to the juicy parts, ma'am! The viewers out there want to know the truth!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to know the truth? The truth is I\u2019m going to settle your itty-bitty selves back down on the ground and you\u2019re not going to bother me again. I need to speak with my kids.\u201dWith that, the interview was over, she crouched down and deposited the copter, woman, and her cameraman right on the outskirts of town, a good 20 miles from any means of contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that done, she turned back to the neighborhood where she had once lived, her eyes focusing in on a small, small homestead with two barely-visible specks waving at her.</span></div></div>",

That\u2019s my little honor student!\u201d the gargantuan mother smiled down proudly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look refreshed too, Mom,\u201d Michael answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd also correct! You two are such smart little guys! I\u2019m so lucky to have such wonderful children!\u201d Miss Spiral smiled warmly, glad to be with her family once again. \u201cI had the nicest little massage today, so I feel absolutely great. And can you believe I got it for free? What an amazing deal!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I can believe it...\u201d Lily sighed. \u201cSo Mom, how much did you grow this time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, just another little one like yesterday. I\u2019m still getting bigger all the time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid...Did she just say 1000 miles was little?!\u201d Michael said, in awe of how his mother thought of her recent size upgrades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTold you she would.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyways, hop on kids, I need to talk to you two for a moment about something important...or if you like staring at my pampered toes, I can just talk to you from here,\u201d she said optimistically as she gently tapped her toes against the ground, causing the entire town to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we\u2019d be safer on your finger, Mom...\u201dMichael said cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing, kiddos!\u201dShe grinned, reaching down with an extended forefinger, her two favorite minute people climbing onto it. Bringing her finger gently up, she began.\u201dNow kids, did any government men come by today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not at all. Just the usual paparazzi trying to get us to answer questions about you.\u201dLily replied, sitting herself down on one of the fingerprint lines thick enough to hold a city upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget the pervs,\u201dMichael added, sitting down beside his sibling.\u201dYou have no idea how of those guys come around asking if we can get \u2018em a talk with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...no government men? No scientists? Nobody?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both shrugged.\u201dSorry mom...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGentlemen,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large warehouse with over a hundred people gathered within lighted up to reveal a stage, and upon that stage, Dr. Connors, the Leader, and the Nervous Man all three stood.\u201dWe welcome you to this week\u2019s Anti-Spiraler meeting!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s Spiraling Out of Control! Eventually, we\u2019ll all be sucked in!\u201dThe building rang with their greeting and mantra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone, this is Dr. Connors,\u201dThe Leader pointed at the frail man in a stark white labcoat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s been working with the Big Bitch ever since she started growing, way back from the beginning, and as you know,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a secret member of your little club as well.\u201dDr. Connors stepped forward, cutting the leader off.\u201dI can speak for myself, thank you.\u201dHe adjust the collar of his coat before continuing.\u201dNow, I bet you\u2019re all wondering why I\u2019m here today. It\u2019s very simple. Over the past decade or so, I\u2019ve been gathering data and samples of Miss Spiral, she and our silly government think it\u2019s to keep track of her health. Not so, in fact, I\u2019ve actually found the means of her growth. A very random, and very volatile super-mutagen, a one in a trillion chance of ever occurring within the human gene pool. Unfortunately, it happened with her. But, I do have a solution,\u201dHe reached into a pocket and pulled out a small vial with an odd, glowing liquid inside.\u201dThis fluorescent little concoction is the cure to all of our problems!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat...what\u2019ll do?\u201dThe Nervous Man questioned slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRapid cellular degeneration, my good man!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c.....What?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will make her smaller.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much we talking \u2018bout here, Doc?\u201dThe Leader looked at the vial quzzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m very sure that it will indeed reduce her back down the size of a normal human being...with a few side effects like paranoid mental stability, blindness, and possibly cancer. But it\u2019ll work, I guarantee it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s great! All we gotta do is inject her with the stuff-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot very likely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do ya mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Connors pulled a very bland expression in reply, raising one eyebrow.\u201dThe woman can shrug off a nuclear missile, sir. I doubt a simple human-sized needle would puncture her skin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen how do we get it in her?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery simple: One man will have to approach her while she rests and deposit it into her mouth. From there,\u201dHe held out his arms.\u201dWe are victorious!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll volunteer for it,\u201d the leader said. \u201cI want the satisfaction of bringing the Big Bitch down myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen so be it! Tomorrow, she shall be bigger no more! Meeting adjourned!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, I\u2019ll be off for the night! Sleep well kids!\u201d Miss Spiral bid farewell to her children as she headed back towards the Atlantic Ocean to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNight Mom!\u201d the two shouted as they watched their titanic mother walk off into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she lay down in the now smaller ocean, she began to ponder the day\u2019s events as she drifted off to sleep. \u201cAh, another wonderful day with my wonderful angels. I simply can\u2019t wait until tomorrow...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the living goddess fell asleep, the instigator from earlier in the day arrived in front of her mouth via jet, potion in hand. \u201cAnd now, it\u2019s time to shrink, you overgrown freak!\u201d With that, he poured the vial\u2019s entire contents into her mouth, watching as they became absorbed into her system before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one knew what the potion\u2019s true effects would be. Only time would tell if the monolithic mother would indeed return to a mortal size, despite her love of growth and her massive height.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cUhh...sir...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Connors had just returned to his lab, a small outpost in D.C., right after it was confirmed from his fellow Anti-Spiraler that the vial had been dumped into Miss Spiral\u2019s mouth. The building had a staff of over a hundred men, all running tests, data streams, and news regarding the giant woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist turned to see one of his underlings sitting at a desk, his eyes wide as he gazed at a computer screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201dConnors asked as he approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, we\u2019re getting a live feed of this right now via satellite...\u201dHe turned and tapped on a microphone, his voice being broadcasted all across the world to major news stations.\u201dThis is the Spiral Observation Station #2. I have news regarding Ellen Spiral. This is live video people...She\u2019s getting bigger. Again. Estimated height, unknown. Estimated time of growth, unknown. This is an emergency, report to your local disaster shelters immediately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Connors paled in the face at the sight on the video.\u201dAnd I had all the confidence in the world that it would work...\u201dhe whispered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did the best you could sir,\u201d a fellow researcher said to him, attempting to relieve him of his terrible mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy best wasn\u2019t good enough,\u201d Dr. Connors replied. \u201cThat potion was our last hope of stopping her. For 12 whole years, 12 whole years! I\u2019ve been monitoring her all that time, ever since she was only a small 8 ft tall freak! I was going to stop her, I had all the data to stop her, my formula was designed specifically for her finally shrink! How...How the hell did she grow from it?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure we can still stop her. We can\u2019t give up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor sighed for a moment before recomposing himself. \u201cYou\u2019re right, but since this failed, she\u2019s now truly Spiraling Out of Control...For all we know, we may have just accidentally given birth to a goddess. We\u2019ll all be sucked in...into the overgrown Ellen Spiral...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sir?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t give up. I\u2019ll make one last potion and give it to her myself. This time, I\u2019ll make it as potent as I can. I don\u2019t care if it kills her, we have to succeed no matter what the cost. She has to shrink! It\u2019s time to stop Ellen Spiral, once and for all!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing up with a quick plan as to how to deliver his new potion, Dr.Connors sent out a radio message to group members across the globe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAttention Anti-Spiralers: Our best efforts have failed; the target is now over 4000 miles and is still expanding...and this time, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll just be a 1000 mile jump. Ellen Spiral, known to many of you as the Big Bitch or the Fucking Freak, has finally begun to spiral out of control. If we allow her to continue any further, she may bring about the destruction of Earth as we know it. Tonight, I shall craft one last potion to shrink her back to normal, but tomorrow, I\u2019m ordering an all-out assault on this massive woman we all hate so much. She may have survived a nuclear strike, but remember, no matter how big she may be, she\u2019s still only human - she can still feel pain and die. We cannot let the history books say that humanity allowed itself to give birth to a goddess; we must make our last stand and take her down once and for all. Hit her with every available weapon we have, even the experimental Anti-Spiral weapons we\u2019ve saved for just such an occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...She\u2019s spiraling out of control...Eventually, we\u2019ll all be sucked in...Ellen Spiral must die...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world continued to watch onwards to their television sets, computers, or even the sky itself as Miss Spiral escalated higher and higher in height, her form still sleeping rather peacefully despite all of this. Michael and Lily were up late into the night, tracking her progress with the rest of the globe as she just seemed to get bigger and bigger in a slow yet steady rate of growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did not stop until early morn, just as the sun\u2019s rays began to shed its light upon America and Miss Spiral herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the Spiral Observation Station #2,\u201dThe voice sounded tired as he had been up the entire time, watching the screen of the beautiful mom just become more and more godlike in stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd, it is reported her growth has stopped, I repeat, Ellen Spiral\u2019s growth has stopped at 7500....miles tall....\u201dHe gasped out the unfathomably large number just as she yawned and began to wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWhat a beautiful new day...\u201dShe fluttered her eyes open.\u201dBut why...why do I feel so funny this morning...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral slowly stood up to her full height, her large chest jiggling slightly as she watched in awe, realizing how much her view of the world had changed overnight. Whereas before it would take her several steps to travel across her home country, she now estimated that she could reach the other side of it in a single step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I grew...I grew!\u201d she cheered, absolutely loving and embracing her new height with a truly godlike thundering laughter that could be heard across the solar system. As she shifted her weight slightly, the planet buckled beneath her immense weight, recognizing her presence as one of a being that could rival the planet itself. \u201cThis\u2019ll make waking up everyone else a breeze now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Spiral Observation #2! The titaness is about to move! Have the whole planet brace for impact!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning everyone! It\u2019s time to wake up to another wonderful day!\u201d Miss Spiral whispered as she raised her left foot into the air and began to gently drop it back to the same place on the ground, knowing full well she would only need a gentle stomp to achieve her wake-up effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gently lowered her foot to the ground, sending powerful vibrations all across the globe. Immediately, those who had not fallen asleep while watching her were surely awake now.\u201dLook at me everybody!\u201dShe giggled.\u201dLook how big I\u2019ve gotten! There\u2019s so much more to do now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Connors worked furiously in his lab, the incessant thunder and noise generated by Miss Spiral his fuel to create the potion even faster. He held up a phone to signal to the battalions of Anti-Spiralers readying for combat.\u201dBegin assault against the Big Bitch. Take her down...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom every country across the world, at least a dozen fighter jets took to the skies to begin battle with the massive mom. Ships set to sea, armed with heavy artillery cannons and thousands of men readied with guns. Their secret Anti-Spiraler weapons, powerful lasers and prototype explosives, were also packed into the arsenal. All the while, the oblivious giantess tapped her chin with her finger, considering what to do today...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see...What to do, what to do...\u201d she pondered. \u201cI took a day off yesterday, so I should definitely do something fun today. Oh! Maybe I can finally go on that world tour run? But then again, I don\u2019t want to hurt anyone...Oh, I know! I\u2019ll make an Earth-angel! Or maybe...Yes, I\u2019ll go and measure myself again. Hopefully that nice little wall is still there,\u201d Miss Spiral smiled as she gently tapped her toes to a happy tune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could take her next step, the members of Spiraling Out of Control made their move, beginning their attack on the overwhelming titaness. With her toes over 100 miles each, each vehicle locked on to a massive digit, dumping all of their ammunition on her smooth flesh. With the use of their Anti-Spiral lasers, Miss Spiral could actually begin to feel a pain emanating from her feet, the intensity slowly beginning to grow stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch! What\u2019s going on down there?\u201d she asked herself, gazing down at her toes so far below.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Her eyes expressed a mixture of confusion and concern at the sight of countless specks zooming around her toes, fires and explosions going off now and again against the skin.\u201dI slept so good...and I wake up to this mess?\u201dShe shook her head, cringing a bit at the sensation of sudden pain shooting across her digits.\u201dI\u2019m guessing you mites are with Spiraling Out of Control?\u201dShe guessed as she raised her right big toe and slammed it down in quick succession, instantly obliterating a large number of her attackers. Yet, she had to admire their persistence. The others did not flee in terror like they should have at the sight of a hundred mile-sized toe crash into the ocean. With a sigh, Miss Spiral went to work with dealing with the tiny nuisances, slowly raising each of her toes and bringing them back down, destroying enemies with every boom of toe meeting earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the braver pilots who risked flying higher took the advantage. With their lasers blasting at her ankles, Miss Spiral felt them give way and herself falling to her knees, giving her tiny foes chance to blast away at her upper body now.\u201dPfft...shoo...go away!\u201dShe swatted at the mites buzzing around her with annoying and very painful accuracy of their lasers and missiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she dropped to her knees, reporters from around the world began to pick up on this developing story, broadcasting live the final battle between the resistance movement and the largest woman to ever exist. Many people rooted for Miss Spiral; though she was big, she was incredibly kind as well, making sure not to hurt anyone intentionally. However, an equally large number of humans began to side with the Anti-Spiralers, believing that she had finally grown too large to be left alive; they believed that her body would eventually outgrow the planet and that she had to be taken down before then. Miss Spiral\u2019s own children watched the epic brawl from their television at home, rooting on their mother with all their being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon Mom, you can do it! I know you can!\u201d Michael cheered on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah Mom, with your size, you can do anything!\u201d Lily added. \u201cJust put that size of yours to good use!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them looked at each other and nodded, knowing the perfect cheer to say: \u201cGrow Mom! Grow, Grow, Grow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Miss Spiral\u2019s anger was starting to build as the assault continued, a rare occasion for the usually cool-headed woman. \u201cNow you guys are starting to get almost as annoying as those pesky media guys. Please just stop already!\u201d she exclaimed as she swiped her hand across her upper body, taking out a few planes yet damaging that area in the process by exposing herself to more fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep it up, we\u2019ve almost got her,\u201d Dr. Connors commanded. \u201cPrepare the special bomb filled with the formula; make sure she ingests it...She WILL shrink and die....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCopy that, sir.\u201dThe jet with the formula bomb reported in, flying around at a safe distance away from the main fight, looking for the perfect time for his comrades to open up a way directly to Miss Spiral\u2019s open mouth. All he had to do was play the waiting game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral proved to be quite the capable and inventive combatant against the pitifully tiny forces. She would actually catch some of the specks in midair and crush them with her nails,or actually give her hair a little flip and allow her brown locks to catch planes in them and let them crash on the strands. But all in all, it seemed to be a standstill battle, she would crush dozens, only for countless more to take their place, constantly firing at her legs to make sure she wouldn\u2019t stand up and keep her height advantage, many flying around her face now.\u201dI\u2019m getting really tired of you all!\u201dShe griped, quickly finding a solution to be rid of the swarm around her face. She began to suck in. A torrent of powerful wind began finding the specks, sucking the jets in like a vacuum into the fathomless maw of her luscious lips and into her mouth to be destroyed by her tongue and teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m taking the shot, over. The Big Bitch is going down.\u201dThe main jet rapidly accelerated towards her mouth, easily being sucked into tunnel of air like the others. Except this time, he released a small bomb into her mouth, the device exploding upon contact with her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once she stopped, gagging at the sudden taste spreading across her mouth.\u201dOh my, that is nasty! Blech!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTango 1, report in,\u201d Dr. Connors ordered. \u201cWhat is the status of the medicine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoger that, Eagle 1,\u201d the pilot answered. \u201cIt\u2019s a hit, the Big Bitch has taken her meds. She said it tastes like crap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it should; means that it\u2019s having a positive reaction to her body,\u201d the doctor sighed in relief. \u201cAlright, it should take a minute or two for it to take effect, so keep her occupied until then.\u201d He then switched back to massive radio communications. \u201cAll units, report! This is it, our final moment. Just keep up the attack for another few minutes and the Spiral will no longer be a threat. We can do this! Don\u2019t let up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenewed by the fact that the potion had been ingested, the rebels amped up their efforts, firing every last blast they could muster at her massive form. Miss Spiral, on the other hand, was too busy with getting rid of the awful taste in her mouth to properly counterattack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYucky! I wonder what I ate?\u201d she asked as she let out a small burp. \u201cWhoops! Excuse me! I wonder if it was all those itty bitty planes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another minute of battling the titaness, the Anti-Spiralers managed to land a direct hit on her stomach, causing Miss Spiral to fall over and land on her breasts, taking out most of the naval units in the process. With her body lower to the ground, the teams began to focus on her back, hoping to take advantage of her injuries there from the previous days. As she yelped out in pain, Miss Spiral quickly regained her stance on her knees once again, now more annoyed than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, now I\u2019m done playing nice!\u201d she proclaimed. However, before she could vent her anger, Miss Spiral clutched her stomach, feeling it begin to gurgle. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpiral Observation Station #1, get ready to analyze the target!\u201d Dr. Connor commanded. \u201cIt\u2019s time to watch the beginning of the end.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her stomach began to settle down, Miss Spiral felt a strange, warm sensation travel throughout her body. It was the moment of truth: Did the formula finally work?</span></div></div>",

The fighters retreated to a reasonable distance, still at the ready whenever Miss Spiral would shrink to apprehend her once she was normal sized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel...\u201dMiss Spiral spoke cautiously, her mouth still reeking of the taste from the formula bomb. She slowly stood up, glad her attackers had left, but her stomach still gurgled, the only sound heard for miles. The earth held it\u2019s breath in anticipation at what would come next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c....Strange...\u201dShe finished her sentence with a hiccup. All at once, everything went to shit for the Anti-Spiralers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Connors could not believe what he was seeing, slack-jawed and wide eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remainder of the Anti-Spiral forces retreated in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe populace of the world gazed up in awe as Miss Spiral began to grow once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, it was slow, but rapidly beginning to pick up pace. In a matter of seconds, 7500 miles was just a memory as she entered 8000 miles and continued to shoot up into the atmosphere.\u201dOh my....oh my!\u201dEven Miss Spiral found her size increase dizzying. Her rapidly expanding feet was quickly approaching the US\u2019s coastline, and she had to take a few steps back just to make sure her toes didn\u2019t reach land and destroy whatever laid there. But with her persistant growth, she quickly found that she was running out of safe ocean to stand on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverybody! Quickly, retreat to your nearest disaster shelter! I repeat, RETREAT!\u201dWarning signals flashed across the globe as billions panicked and fled to whatever safety they could find. School gyms were immediately crowded, underground fallout shelters took people quickly, and streets were packed with traffic with people fleeing with homes of outrunning the gargantuan woman quickly encompassing the entire western hemisphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, ever so slowly, her growth died down. After five minutes packed with solid size escalation, Miss Spiral was now a towering, intimidating, and frightening 10,000 miles tall, taking up the view of almost the entire planet.One country could gaze at her titanic toes, while on the other side of the globe countries were meeting the back of her heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I got bigger...\u201dShe whispered, still thunderous roars in the ears of all below. She would usually be happy, but after the events of the recent days, she began to ponder something. How had she grown? Every time she was attacked. She was peaceful, she was kind, and yet people still feared her, still hated her, still wanted her destroyed. Now, the gigantic being had a decision to make. She knew that her presence on earth was dangerous to the entire human race. One wrong twitch, and bye-bye went a civilization. One wrong step, and she\u2019d shatter the planet. She would have to leave to protect the ones she loved. Or...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, she could enact her revenge. The thought came across her mind vile, but disgustingly appealing at the same time. She could rule this world if she wanted to, hell, she always could have right from day one of being a giantess. She could become a fearful and terrifying goddess, mighty in her wrath towards all that had wronged her. It actually reviled her that she was CONSIDERING such an evil thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she gazed down at the countries laid out before her with their countless mortals staring up at her, waiting for a decision, the enormous Ellen Spiral finally made up her mind.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI...I understand now...\u201d she whispered. \u201cI love my size, I absolutely do, but because of what\u2019s been happening the past few days, I know that I can\u2019t stay on Earth anymore. I don\u2019t want to hurt anyone else, so I\u2019ll save everyone the trouble and leave the Earth in peace. I\u2019m still getting bigger, so I think it\u2019d be for the best...though I wouldn\u2019t mind finally getting some clothes again!\u201d Miss Spiral giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people of Earth let out a collective sigh of relief as the immeasurable woman decided she\u2019d leave the planet to stop all of this senseless fighting. Despite the war they had waged against her all these years, even Dr. Connors felt sorry for the huge mother, sad that he could not finally return her to normal despite her constant protests. However, because of this, he swore to himself to focus his research on the Infinite Spiral project, determined to make some clothes that would grow along with her no matter how big she became.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBye everyone...especially to my two precious babies...I\u2019ll miss you all.\u201dWith that, she bent a little at the knees and sprang up, rocketing herself into space with her considerable strength. Miss Spiral floated around earth for the longest time, simply gazing at it and admiring the tiny planet she had once lived on.\u201dIt\u2019s so very pretty...\u201dShe cooed, a smile on her face yet tears in her eyes. The massive mother turned around and began floating away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodbye everyone...\u201d she smiled once more as she gazed out into the vast star ocean of the cosmos. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll come back to visit you all someday...Who knows, I might just be able to fit just my toe on the planet for a little toe-cation!\u201d Miss Spiral giggled as she continued to float off into the endless void of space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then, what fun can I have out here in space,\u201d she pondered. Before she could continue, the monumental mother felt a chill encompassing her naked body, one of the first she had felt in a long time. \u201cBrrr! It sure is chilly in space! If I had known that, I would\u2019ve brought an itty bitty jacket! Now let\u2019s see...Oh, I know! I\u2019ll help out those tiny scientists on Earth by checking on Mars! I wonder if there really are such things as aliens? Oh well, I bet they\u2019ll have never seen something as big as me before!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her attention towards a small red dot countless miles off in the distance, Miss Spiral began to head towards her new destination, still thinking of how to help the people of Earth no matter how big she became and despite her voluntary exile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began floating over towards the mars, unknown of the journey ahead. With the red planet so far away, 250 million miles to be exact, she had plenty of time to think as she traveled, and plenty of time for the denizens of earth to recover from the destruction she had brought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Several Months Later</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, now this is more like it...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral was in her usual tanning position upon Mars, the titanic, 10,000 mile tall being finding the desolate world perfect for her to live on. Sure, it was small, and she could traverse it in a few minute\u2019s time, but no living being would ever be harmed by her, and she hadn\u2019t been attacked by aliens, so that was a plus as well. It had been almost half a year since she left behind the home she once knew, and she knew nothing of what was going on over on her home world. She would like to look up at it in the sky every once in a while, just gazing at it for hours on end, enjoying it\u2019s blue color and lazy revolving. She could sometimes see the marks she had left, the hole where Africa had once been, an imprint of her once smaller body laying down, footprints, stuff like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she missed it all so deathly much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral happily sighed, \u201cI miss the Earth, I really do. I wonder what\u2019s been happening down there after all this time?\u201d she pondered as she flipped onto her stomach, letting the Sun begin to tan the other side of her luscious body. Due to the effects of the potions she had ingested, Miss Spiral\u2019s body dynamics had become fundamentally altered: She no longer needed to sleep, yet she did only to remember what is was like to do so; her body had stopped aging - she would now be eternally youthful and immortal; and all of her senses had become heightened to superhuman levels. She was basically now a living goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope everyone\u2019s doing fine down there without me...\u201d she paused for a moment before continuing. \u201cTomorrow\u2019s Lily\u2019s birthday...and I won\u2019t be there to share it with my darling little angel...\u201d Gathering herself once more, Miss Spiral quickly had a bright idea come to mind. \u201cOh! Wait! That\u2019s perfect! I might not be there in person, but I sure can give her the best birthday present ever!\u201d she giggled as she resumed her tan, deciding to create her gift once she had pampered herself enough for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Next Day, That Very Night</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure I can\u2019t open my eyes yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust keep the friggin\u2019 blindfold on, Lily.\u201dMichael sighed as he, his younger sibling, and several other party-goers sat on their front lawn, looking up towards the night sky in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom\u2019ll have your birthday present soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can you possibly know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNASA\u2019s keepin\u2019 tabs on mom now that she\u2019s in their field of expertise, space. And they sent me a message just this morning about a gift from her, to you...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...\u201dMichael looked at his wristwatch, waiting for the exact time Miss Spiral had given in the message, midnight. One minute away. 45 seconds...30...10....3,2,1...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily removed the blindfold covering her face to see her older brother smiling down at her and handing her a telescope. She took it in hand, held it up to her eye, and followed where Michael\u2019s finger pointed to the stars above. It took her to Mars. She saw her giant mother on the surface of the red planet waving at her in the telescope\u2019s eye, and by her feet, etched into the earth itself, it read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI love you Lily, happy birthday baby.

You alright?\u201d Michael asked as she hugged his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I...I\u2019m fine,\u201d she replied as she dried her tears. \u201cThis is the best birthday present ever, and now whenever I look up at Mars, I\u2019ll always be able to see how much Mom loves the two of us, even though she\u2019s so far away from us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, Mom really outdid herself this time,\u201d he smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry sis, I miss her too. I miss her more than anything. It\u2019s just not the same without Mom on Earth, but at least she remembered your birthday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really miss her...I miss Mom!\u201d Lily cried once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere there...Hey, wanna know a secret?\u201d he brother smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t tell her or I\u2019ll deny it, alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, what is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I miss the smell of Mom\u2019s feet.

Anyways, thanks Mom...Thank you so much. This was the best birthday ever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral grinned as she laid down on the red ground, staring up at earth, just like she knew her children were staring back at her. It made her warm, it made her feel almost...human. She liked that feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight, my babies!\u201dShe waved as she closed her eyes to sleep, knowing full well that she would not dream. Ever since her body\u2019s chemical make up changed, whenever she forced her self to rest, she did not sleep, only saw blackness, and when she awoke, she would feel just fine. Not tired, not anything. Just big and happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly drifted off to a snooze, her snores and soft breathing echoing throughout the solar system. But as she rested, a small shuttle blasted off from earth, it\u2019s destination, Mars. The ship carried only a crew of three men, but these men were important. Dr. Connors, the Leader, and the Nervous Man, each one playing pivotal roles in the story of the gigantic goddess.\u201dSo Doc....why are we doing this again?\u201dThe Leader asked, feeling incredibly uncomfortable in his space suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo inform Ellen Spiral of the happenings of earth and what involves her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re coming along because....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo apologize to her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201dConnors placidly looked out the window, the shuttle rocketing them closer and closer to the red planet.\u201dWe\u2019ve wronged this woman so much...we must make amends if we are to ever be at peace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s your problem bub, I\u2019m getting off this thing!\u201dHe unstrapped himself from his seat and began floating towards the emergency escape pod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want to helplessly float through the soul-sucking void of space, be my guest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe returned to his seat without question, strapping in quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-do you t-t-think...she\u2019ll forgive u-us?\u201dThe Nervous Man questioned, his voice stuttering and meek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure of it.\u201dConnors nodded.\u201dI worked on the woman for twelve years.

Let\u2019s just get this over with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, according to my calculations, Ellen should be awakening from her current rest period any moment now,\u201d the doctor explained. \u201cWe just have to be patient.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as predicted, exactly three minutes later, Miss Spiral slowly began to stir as she opened her eyes to another day alone. \u201cAh! It\u2019s another big wonderful day!\u201d she giggled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon waking up, her eyes roved over the red landscape, a very odd and peculiar sighting before her on the ground far below. She spotted it out in a heartbeat, a bright, chrome rocketship that glinted in the sunlight, a welcome break in the tedium of living alone for so long. And to the giant woman\u2019s joy and surprise, tiny, tiny dots, three of them, waving at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving no human contact for six months left her a little shaky as she lowered her finger towards them, the appendage quivering slightly. She was about to speak with someone. The excitement inside was about to burst out, but she had to contain it for the safety of the little ones on the tip of her finger, which she raised to her eye to greet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello all!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Spiral, glad to see you\u2019re in tip-top shape.\u201dOne of the microscopic mites spoke through an amplification piece in his suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDr. Connors? it\u2019s been so long! How\u2019ve you been?! And who are your friends?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been...trying my dear woman, trying. And my companions are Rick,\u201dHe pointed at leader.\u201dAnd Dudley here.\u201dA hand gestured towards the nervous man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd...we\u2019ve come to give you some good news...and to apologize.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApologize for what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo apologize for all we put you through on Earth. We forced you to leave everything behind and made you what you are now, and for that, we are truly, truly sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean, Dr. Connors?\u201d she asked. \u201cI always enjoyed your little tests.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...besides that, I was secretly working with Spiraling Out of Control in the latter stages of your life on Earth. Remember those last powerful bursts you experienced? Those were the result of my experiments on you...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What?!\u201d Miss Spiral said as her eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had honest intentions though, I can assure you of that,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe potions were supposed to cause rapid cellular degeneration in your body, thus causing you to shrink. I was only trying to help both you and everyone on the planet...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDr. Connors...it\u2019s perfectly alright. In fact, I\u2019m actually going to thank you for giving me such a nice size boost!\u201d she smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve never been happier!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I forced you to leave the planet...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, sure, but I could never give up my size. I love being big just as much as I love my little darlings...actually, probably a whole lot more!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat...that is greatly reassuring. Thank you, Ellen.\u201dDr. Connors gave a little bow and flourish of his hand.\u201dNow, my companions wish to tell you something as well...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDudley, the nervous man, stepped forward, shaking violently in his space suit, staring up at the beautiful, giant face lovingly gazing back down at him.\u201dH-hello...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDearie, you\u2019re shaking to death! Are you cold?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-n-no....I....\u201dHe tapped his helmet to make sure his microphone piece was working properly.\u201dI...just wanted to apologize t-t-too....I\u2019m a-a-a member of....w-was a member of Spiraling Out of Control....a....and I helped with bombing you....\u201dHe cringed at the words.\u201dAnd my friend here...Rick...he was the leader after you stomped on Frederick...he would like to say he\u2019s sorry t-t-too...\u201dHe elbowed the man beside him, who perked up immediately and looked up at the giant woman with distaste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah....whatever he said. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dRick mumbled with crossed arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey, say it like you m-mean it!\u201d his comrade prodded him. \u201cYou promised!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, fiiiine!\u201d the ex-leader gave in. \u201cI\u2019m...sorry for attacking you like we did. It was wrong of us to do that to you. You weren\u2019t doing anything to harm the planet, and we just tried to kill you for no reason at all. There, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that\u2019s as close to an apology as you\u2019re going to get from him,\u201d Dr. Connors sighed. \u201cBut on behalf of him and all members of Spiraling Out of Control, we all wish to apologize for everything we did to you...Oh, and we had no association with the Africa attack; that was all them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I sorta guessed that last one. They were pretty unorganized,\u201d Miss Spiral chuckled. \u201cBut anyways, I forgive all of you. No hard feelings. Besides, everything worked out great in the end, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-T-Thank you ma\u2019am!\u201d Dudley stuttered as he bowed his head. \u201cIt really means a lot to us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, thanks toots,\u201d Rick agreed, still uncaring. \u201cSorry about all that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a problem guys! Like I said, I\u2019ve got you all to thank for my current wonderful height!\u201d the titanic mother laughed once more. \u201cOh! What\u2019s the good news you guys have? Let me guess, they\u2019ve made today Miss Ellen Spiral Day, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly, my dear.\u201dDr. Connors chuckled.\u201dIt\u2019s actually several pieces of good news. First off, the Spiraling Out of Control group has transformed into a Pro-You group! The...\u2019Spiraling Towards the Future\u2019? They\u2019ve become a charity, aiding those who had been...harmed from one of your...fits, or repairing property destroyed during your years as a giga giantess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful, doc! I\u2019m so glad they\u2019ve taken a turn for the better!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSecond of all, we\u2019ve been studying you, and have mapped out an entirely new growth chart. You\u2019re due for a new spurt in oh say....an hour or two?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre...are you sure? Is it that soon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuite positive, and it\u2019s going to be a big one....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Connors turned around and pointed at their ship.\u201dBefore I relay the final piece of news, could you kindly bring up our rocket as well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201dMiss Spiral reached down and gently plucked up the tiny vehicle, setting it down beside the three specks on her finger with her free hand.\u201dNow, we believe using the formula used to originally shrink you, but having the opposite effect, on clothing, we can grow some suitable outfits for you, so that you will not be indecent anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful!\u201dShe cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, we\u2019ve arranged many articles of clothing to choose from. A simple undergarment pairing of bra and panties, a nice summer dress, some lounging clothes...oh, and your favorite jogging attire, extra tight, just the way you like it. Plus, some flip-flops and sneakers if you like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are we waiting for then? Make \u2018em grow for me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, Dr. Connors gently poured the serum on each of the items they had brought with them, watching as the mixture slowly became absorbed into the atoms of each article of clothing. The various outfits and shoes began to glow for a moment before returning to their normal state, seemingly normal to the naked eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, did it work?\u201d the 10,000 mile woman wondered. \u201cOh, and could you grow me a pair of heels in the meantime too? A girl can never have too many pairs of shoes!\u201d Admittedly, Miss Spiral never wore shoes on a regular basis, but she enjoyed having the option of wearing them if she so wished to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll make sure to make a note of some high heels in your size when I return to the lab, but yes, I believe so...They should resonate with your body\u2019s heat signature, so you should be able to grow what you\u2019d like and keep what you don\u2019t wish to wear smaller for as long as you\u2019d like,\u201d the doctor explained. \u201cOh, and any clothes you wear will enlarge perfectly along with you as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, how wonderful!\u201d Miss Spiral cheered. \u201cHere, give \u2018em here, I\u2019ll change as soon as you guys leave!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, the three men did as requested as they left the clothing on her massive digit. \u201cNow then, we must be off for Earth once again. We\u2019ll hopefully be in contact with you once again after your next spurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! Thank you so much everyone! Have a safe and wonderful trip back, and make sure to tell my kids that Mommy loves them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the voyagers boarded the spaceship and entered in the coordinates to return to their homeworld, launching off the titanic woman\u2019s finger as she waved goodbye to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s see...Let\u2019s get comfy!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She gently closed her hand around the clothes on her finger to get some heat flowing into them. In little under a minute, she began to feel fabric stretching against her skin, and a weight coming upon her hand. Little over a minute, her clothes were fully functional, appropriate for a woman of her magnitude.\u201dOh my!\u201dShe gasped.\u201dMy jogging shorts and sports bra...they look good as new! And those sneakers! So high-style! The dress is a little tacky, but beggars can\u2019t be choosers...and why did they have to pick such a lacy bra and panties? Oh well, I think...\u201dShe slipped on the jogging shorts and sports bra easily, the elastic fabric molding over her perfect curves easily. With that, she slipped on her flip-flops, and watched with amazement as the other clothes began to shrink once they were void of her body heat. She made sure to stow them away safely in a pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, all I have to do is wait for that growth spurt! It\u2019s going to be great!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nOne Hour later</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAttention everyone,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Connors was broadcasting all across the world from inside his rocket, heading straight towards Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you would turn your televisions to the nearest news station, look up on your livecams, or simply gaze up at the sky, you will see Miss Ellen Spiral is about to grow once again, a spectacle one does not wish to miss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll across the globe, people turned their attentions towards the heavens to view the giant woman whose body rivaled the size of a small planet...and was about to become even larger. The denizens of Earth were delighted to finally see the massive mother clad in the familiar outfit she had worn up until a few days ago, pleased that they could stop shielding their children\u2019s eyes from such a sight, in addition to reducing the amount of perverted men drooling over her naked form. The planet\u2019s inhabitants watched eagerly to see Miss Spiral\u2019s growth spurt occur from a third-person perspective, far away from the Earth and completely safe from her soon-to-be expanding frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Miss Spiral\u2019s two children watched on along with the rest of the planet, equally enthusiastic to see how much their colossal mother would enlarge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, how long\u2019s it been since she\u2019s grown again?\u201d Michael asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout six months or so,\u201d Lily answered. \u201cShe\u2019s definitely overdue for one, if not several.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do I get the feeling Mom\u2019s gonna be huge after this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause she most likely will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on Mars, Miss Spiral could feel her body getting ready to grow, becoming excited herself to see how much height she would add on to her already immense stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is gonna be great!\u201d she cheered. \u201cNow to get off of this little planet to make sure I don\u2019t accidentally crush it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike she had done on earth, Miss Spiral bent at her knees and sprang upwards, launching herself into the emptiness of space. Just as she cleared Mars\u2019s atmosphere, she felt herself begin to grow once more.It wasn\u2019t like anything she had experience prehand with growing, this one felt almost...powerful, instinctual....orgasmic in a sense. With a soft moan, she quickly hit the 12,000 mile mark, but that seemed to be simply a warm up for what the rest of her spurt would be. The onlookers of the world would turn to the sky in awe as Miss Spiral\u2019s image quickly began to fill the entire view of the planet, expanding into 15,000 miles, 20,000, and still no signs of stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her eyes closed and her mouth grinning, the monolithic mom continued in her new growth phase...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm...Now THIS is quite the nice little boost,\u201d Miss Spiral chuckled to herself as she continued to enlarge, her body now soaring past the 25,000 mile mark and still persisting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three cosmonauts had the best view of the woman\u2019s latest round of size upgrades, floating in the vast void of space as her seemingly perfect body merely grew on and on and on with no end in sight. Soon enough, the spaceship they had travelled in had docked in the newly created Spiral Observation Station #5, ready to watch the remainder of her spurt while continuing to gain valuable scientific data on Miss Spiral\u2019s unique DNA composition. Upon disembarking the ship, Dr. Connors immediately headed towards the station\u2019s research wing, quickly becoming informed on the current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, tell me, how large is she now?\u201d he inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, well...\u201d the junior scientist paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Spit it out already!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell sir, Ellen Spiral...we...we miscalculated...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean we miscalculated?\u201d Dr. Connors said as he raised his right eyebrow. \u201cThis growth of hers should end at 75,000 miles in height.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, she was 75,000 miles tall...about two minutes ago...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, apparently she\u2019ll be growing much larger than we initially projected.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have the new estimates already?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir, but...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if these estimates are correct, Ellen Spiral may be over one million miles tall when all is said and done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Dr. Connors could muster in response were wide eyes and a flabbergasted, dropped jaw wide open along with a few unintelligible words. For the first time in his life of science and intelligence, the doctor had nothing to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, Miss Spiral kept her eyes closed, still feeling her expansion coming on in waves of sheer pleasure and power, coursing through her body fervently and just making her bigger and bigger by the second. As her growth stretched into the last remaining moments of the spurt, she slowly opened her eyes, feeling the sense of her expansion quickly leave. It almost made her sad, but she knew it would come again eventually, whether it be another day, week, or even a whole year. She would wait. But for now, she would enjoy her new height...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw black, empty space, the occasional star twinkling here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm? Where\u2019d I go?\u201dShe mused to herself, turning her head this way and that.\u201dThat was a long growth...but I don\u2019t see anything...\u201dShe looked down, a vantage point she had become accustomed to, and almost exploded into a fit of pure laughter. Before her, floating harmlessly in front of her naval, a tiny red speck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMars...\u201dMiss Spiral whispered to herself as she reached down towards the once comparable planet to her size. Grabbing the speck with her right hand, she grasped the small orb between her index finger and thumb before bringing it in front of her large green eyes. \u201cMy, look how tiny it\u2019s gotten...And to think I was just small enough to live there only a little while ago!\u201d Miss Spiral giggled happily, almost accidentally crushing the minute object between her fingers. \u201cWell, at least I had a nice little boost just now. I wonder just how big I am now? Oh well, at least my clothes grew with me this time, and even though I\u2019m big now, I\u2019ll be even bigger later!\u201d With a cheerful smile, Miss Spiral deposited the small planet inside of her belly-button for the time being. \u201cNow, let\u2019s see where the Earth went to...I can\u2019t wait to show my little darlings just how much Mommy\u2019s grown!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Scanning the depths of space for a full minute, the goliath of a woman soon spotted a small blue-green sphere off in the distance. \u201cAh, there it is! Don\u2019t worry everyone, I\u2019m coming to visit!\u201d Miss Spiral paused for a moment before proceeding. \u201cOr maybe I should just keep you all with me. I\u2019m practically big enough to be my own little Me-verse!\u201d With another gleeful chuckle, the massive mother began her now much shorter journey to her home planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHovering in front of it, the galactic giantess could hardly believe the small blue speck with hints of green on it was something she once walked upon. Peering down at it, she could only imagine what she looked like to the tiny invisible people she once identified with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn earth, it was a whole other story as every on the planet looked up in awe at the living goddess. Miss Spiral\u2019s sheer size couldn\u2019t even be fully comprehended, she was simply a massive blur that took up the sky, no definite shape to her gargantuan height. But when she spoke, everyone listened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello down there, little earth!\u201dShe giggled as she waved at the speck.\u201dAs you can see, little ol\u2019 me has gotten a lot bigger! And, I\u2019ve decided for a change of scenery for you all! Earth\u2019s stayed in that one spot for so long, I believe it\u2019s gotten rather boring. Wouldn\u2019t it be much more fun if I placed you all in my bust? Ooh, or how about in my nipple! That\u2019ll tickle! or how about in between my toes? I did want that toe-cation, but it looks like I\u2019ve outgrown that option...\u201dShe giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone on earth was equally scared, hopeful, and confused as the titaness\u2019s words. It would be...interesting to see what Miss Spiral would do to earth, but what about the sunlight they required for their plants and for the natural cycle of day and night? But oddly enough, everyone was okay with what she was going to do. It wasn\u2019t like anybody could stop her anyway. Nothing could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking about where to place the planet for a few minutes, Miss Spiral finally came to a decision. \u201cAlrighty! I think I\u2019ll put you all in my...Oh, what\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was about to relocate the Earth onto a section of her body, the titaness spotted a large meteor headed straight towards the planet. While several times the size of the planet, the asteroid only appeared as a slightly larger speck before the goddess of a woman. The people of Earth began to panic wildly at their imminent doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy babies!\u201d Miss Spiral shouted as she too began to spring into mother-mode. \u201cHang on kids! Mommy\u2019ll save you!\u201d Wasting no time, she quickly plucked the hurdling meteor from its path and swiftly crush it in her hand, letting its remains sprinkle harmlessly across the galaxy. \u201cAh, there we go! Now you\u2019re all safe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery single person on Earth rejoiced as the massive woman known as Ellen Spiral single-handedly, both literally and metaphorically, saved the planet from destruction. Cheers of joy began to ring out from every corner of the globe as countless humans sang of her prasies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, there\u2019s no need to thank me,\u201d Miss Spiral smiled modestly. \u201cJust doing my duty as a massive mom! Now where was I?...Oh, right, time to choose your new location on me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral gently waved her hand around the speck, the motion of her palm slowly moving the Earth. She wouldn\u2019t dare try to touch it and risk crushing some continents with her fingers. This way was much more subtle and safe. With a few sweeps of her hand around the world, the planet was making its journey towards its newest destination, Miss Spiral\u2019s chest, two orbs barely contained within the elastic of her sports bra, planetary in their own right as well. To the inhabitants of the planet, it was as if a great wind had come over the entire planet, moving it towards the massive new \u2018planets\u2019 that blocked out the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlmost theeerrr-eeerrre!\u201d Miss Spiral giggled as the Earth drew closer to her ample chest. Once the planet had almost collided with the mammoth mammaries, the monolithic mother gently bent downwards and adjusted her sports bra slightly, smiling as the small orb gently nestled itself between her bust. \u201cAh, there we go! Now hold on tight, I wanna make sure you\u2019re all nice and comfy down there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding her body back up to her full height, Miss Spiral adjusted her sports bra once more, making sure the Earth was wedged comfortably in her bust before completely enclosing it in the elastic darkness of her clothing. The mom\u2019s immense orbs held the planet firmly in place within her cleavage, acting both as planet-sized retainers and guardians of the Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere we go! That\u2019s much better!\u201d Miss Spiral chuckled as she gently pat her bust. \u201cNow my little darlings will always be safe, and close to Mommy\u2019s heart!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she said was true, with her words ringing in everybody\u2019s ears, over the muffling flesh that encompassed the entire globe, her heartbeat echoed across the whole planet, giving a air of peace and calm to the human populace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm...what to do now, everyone?\u201dShe peered down at her chest, jiggling it ever so slightly.\u201dNow that you\u2019re all along for the ride, I suppose I\u2019ll have to be extra careful...but don\u2019t worry, I always am!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could...see what else is out there beyond our little pocket in the universe....play with some of the planets here....go tanning near the sun...or just wait for my next growth spurt. But that might take a while...\u201dShe smacked her hand against her forehead.\u201dSilly me! I really should have asked Dr. Connors about the rest of my growth chart! Now he\u2019s absolutely too teeny for me to even hear anymore!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realization came quick. Humans were much too small for her to speak with or even interact with anymore. She was astronomical now. The feeling left a quiet tinge of sadness in her, but was quickly replaced with the fact that she still could protect them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, they may all be tiny, but being this big is actually the best thing I could ever ask for!\u201d Miss Spiral giggled to herself. \u201cI mean, how many other people can say they\u2019re protecting an entire planet with just their chest? None that I know of, at least. Besides, if I wasn\u2019t this huge anyways, the Earth would\u2019ve been destroyed a few minutes ago! In a way, it\u2019s like I\u2019m like the planet\u2019s personal protector!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see...Hmmm...You know, depending on when I\u2019m due for my next spurt, they might have communication technology by then so I can talk to them,\u201d she pondered. \u201cThey did make my new clothes grow with me, so they might be able to do something like this too...Oh well! Time to go work on my tan!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a content smile, the gargantuan woman slowly floated towards the sun, her 1.5 million mile body visible throughout the solar system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back on Earth, the planet\u2019s denizens began to try to adjust to their new placement within the solar system. Due to the intense opaqueness of her sports bra, no sunlight was able to reach the Earth\u2019s surface, and the planet\u2019s scientists began to discover a way to remedy the current situation. Nonetheless, they were all thankful for Miss Spiral\u2019s actions.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dr. Connors sat down at his desk and rubbed his temples, sighing in disbelief at the giant woman\u2019s newest size. She truly was a goddess. He looked up at the contents on his desk with weary eyes, but a happy smile. She had become his life\u2019s work, and he wouldn\u2019t let her cosmic scale get him down. He had so much more plans. A small satellite was to be deployed to her ear for communication purposes, and from there, many more functions would be made. They could actually live on her! Setting up new structures that wouldn\u2019t be destroyed with her movements would be a challenge, but one he would gladly take. As for the sunlight to reach earth, he supposed he could convince her to wear that thinner bra every now and again, or go in the nude if she wished, but he really did have to get her those heels soon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waved his hand, and an assistant came by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave that satellite launched with two crewman. I want to tell Ellen about...plans for the future. Just...make sure they have their thermo-suits on. She\u2019s close to the sun, and those temperatures will melt any normal human into dust.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproximately thirty minutes after the order was given, the satellite was ready for launch. Using the latest in military technology, the metallic capsule was equipped with the latest in rocket booster technology; after escaping from the darkness of Miss Spiral\u2019s sports bra, it would only be about a five minute journey to the face of the living goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs everything all set?\u201d Dr. Connors asked as he boarded the satellite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir, everything\u2019s ready!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, launching!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the satellite began its expedition to the top of the over 1 million mile mother, managing to escape the tight elastic fabric only barely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, did you have to really make this bra so tight on her?\u201d the pilot asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was her favorite outfit. I had to remake it just to her exact specifications,\u201d the doctor replied. \u201cBesides, it IS her signature outfit after all. Oh, that reminds me...Lieutenant, do you have the package?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir, I\u2019ve got it right here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe satellite rocket higher and higher until it reached its destination after maneuvering around some stray hairs thicker than the planet itself. It went onto float deep in her ear canal, the two men aboard would leave via a secondary escape pod.\u201dAlright...\u201dThe pilot flipped a switch, and the satellite was a go. He began speaking into a mouthpiece.\u201dTesting...testing...Miss Spiral, can you hear us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm?\u201dShe titled her head, sending the small machine even deeper into her ear, threatening to crash it into some wax.\u201dWho said that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUs, the tiny people. We\u2019ve established a communications link within your ear, so whenever need be, you and Dr. Connors, or anyone in particular, may speak with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that\u2019s just wonderful!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Miss Spiral. Now, we have a few words for you. The earth is in...curious condition. Our plantlife won\u2019t survive long without sunlight, so might we ask...you remove your bra?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust until we can find some way to filter light in through your clothing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral thought about complying for a moment, yet she felt incredibly comfortable in her favorite outfit. It was a tough decision to make, but in the end, the mammoth mother chose an alternative route...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s all you little guys need? Pssh, that\u2019s easy!\u201d she giggled as she waved her right hand in mid-air as if what she was planning was going to be no problem for her. \u201cIf you need the Sun...then I\u2019ll just become the Sun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What?!\u201d the three men yelled in unison, completely flabbergasted at the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019ll be easy! Just give me a few minutes and Earth\u2019ll have all the light it\u2019ll ever need!\u201d she exclaimed with a giddy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-Are you sure about this Ellen?\u201d Dr. Connors asked. \u201cBy the laws of science, this shouldn\u2019t even be possible...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course! I saw it in a book once, so it has to work!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men looked at each other once more, all of them unsure as to her plan of action. \u201cUmmm...Alright then, that sounds good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! I just hope lil\u2019 ol\u2019 me\u2019ll be big enough by the time I get there!\u201d she chuckled. \u201cNow, what else would you like to talk about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh yes...we have a package...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf what?\u201dShe piqued curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf a device Dr. Connors invented...it will gauge your current height for you and relay when your next growth spurt will hit...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been needing that! Thank you oh so very much!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, could you move some of your hair away from your ear? We would like to fly safely back to earth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a problem~\u201dShe sweeped the hair away from her right ear to behind her head, giving the small men a safe and free way to travel back home to Earth in their pods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Ellen, I have some things to discuss with you...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo right ahead doc!\u201dShe cheered as she could hear his words clear as day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you intend to do by...becoming the sun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust trust me doc, all in good time...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut our plants have little time as it is...if you were to simply remove your bra...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou silly little pervs! All in good time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed.\u201dVery well, now onto business. We have ideas of actually moving some of the populace onto you, colonizing your body in a sense. Is that alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you really have to, just wait until there\u2019s more of me to go around first!\u201d the mighty mom chuckled. \u201cJust make sure everything\u2019s safe before you start. I wouldn\u2019t want anyone to get hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I see. I\u2019ll take that into consideration,\u201d the doctor mentally noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019ve still gotta be me too, ya know - the biggest mom and model ever!\u201d Miss Spiral added, even though she had never modeled before in her life but was always asked to become one. \u201cI guess you can say I\u2019m a momdel!\u201d she laughed at her own pun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, I wouldn\u2019t want to overburden you with this, of course,\u201d Dr. Connors suggested. \u201cIf all else fails, we could always live with you rather than on you as you continue to grow larger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds great to me, doc!\u201d she cheered enthusiastically. \u201cAnything else to talk about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well, um, let\u2019s see here...Oh, I did manage to get you those high heels you wanted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did?! That\u2019s wonderful news! Now I can look even more momdel-y in some cute footwear! Thank you all so much!\u201d Miss Spiral thanked him once again. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to try them on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be with you shortly...in a few hours or so we\u2019ll send another vessel to land on your palm. You will wait exactly thirty minutes to give the men time to evacuate carefully before you close your hand and make the heels grow to match you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks doc!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Ellen. We\u2019ll be in touch.\u201dConnors ended his talk with her, turning off his microphone and thus ending his voice inside her ear.</span></div></div>",

One stamped Miss Spiral\u2019s next growth spurt, bound to happen within a few days; she would be noted by the satellite in her ear when the time came. Another had a diagram of a structure made of hyper-tense metals, ones that could bend, but not break for the buildings to be placed upon the astronomical woman. Her natural pull of gravity would hold any tiny humans to her, as if she was a planet all her own. And from the latest scans and readings the Observation Stations had gathered, she even produced oxygen from her skin. Miss Spiral wasn\u2019t destined to end the human race with her size; she was to save it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow...How can this be?\u201d the doctor asked himself as he looked over her readings of the planet-sized woman. \u201cShe\u2019s releasing oxygen from her pores...This shouldn\u2019t be possible. Have I made her into a living goddess through my serums? That could be a possibility, but could they have really altered her already mutated genetics by such an extreme amount? Well, I suppose I\u2019ll have to take a few samples of her once again to confirm this data, but in the meantime, I must continue to monitor her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the people of the Earth began to adjust to their new life between Miss Spiral\u2019s chest, an announcement went out to all citizens, alerting them that the light problem facing the planet would be resolved in a few days during the mother\u2019s next growth spurt. Some jumped to the initiative of inducing a growth spurt to speed up the process, but the majority of the people resigned themselves to waiting, knowing that the issue would be solved soon enough. In the meantime, another vessel prepared to launch from the planet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs the cargo secured?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, sir!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then, prepare for takeoff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second vessel took off for Miss Spiral\u2019s left hand, her palm held wide open for the tinies to safely land upon it like it was an entirely different planet. Within a hour\u2019s time they landed on a patch of skin cells that could outsize any desert on the planet and deposited her heels onto the rough, fleshy landscape. A signal was sent to her, and Miss Spiral began her countdown to thirty minutes. \u201cOne mississippi....two mississippi....\u201d she giggled to herself. And in that short time, they had returned to their home world conveniently stationed in her gargantuan busom. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s get these bad boys a fit...\u201d she closed her hand, and waited for the heels to grow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree Days Later<br>\r\nWithin three short days, all Miss Spiral had done was lay out in front of the solar body and tan. She had no other necessity at the moment, so such a thing was possible for her. Her skin had smoldered to a beautiful golden-bronze glow, giving her long brown hair an almost luscious glow and making her bright green eyes pop even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Ellen?\u201d Dr. Connors\u2019 voice echoed in her ear, the satellite still fully functional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeeeessss?\u201d she piqued in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh! Those days just flew by! How big am I gonna get now Doc?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello? You there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s just...It\u2019s going to be another big one...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral simply giggled in reply. \u201cOh, you\u2019re always so funny, Doc. When are you guys gonna realize that they aren\u2019t really big to me? Heck, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m even big yet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRiiiiiight...Well, regardless, we estimate that you\u2019ll be about fifty times your current height, if not just a bit more. At your size range, it\u2019s hard to make completely accurate predictions; estimates are the closest thing we can make unfortunately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s just fine. At least I know how big I\u2019ll be...sorta...\u201d the massive mother chuckled to herself. \u201cJust make sure everyone\u2019s prepared down there. Wouldn\u2019t want lil\u2019 ol\u2019 Earth to be surprised by me growing again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, in the past few days, we\u2019ve made the proper precautions,\u201d Dr. Connors affirmed. \u201cEveryone is readying themselves for the upcoming earthquakes your body will cause by growing, but don\u2019t worry, these quakes will only occur during this spurt. After this, all of your growths will be havoc free.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s great news! Glad my chest\u2019ll be safe for everyone. See, I know what I\u2019m doing...\u201d Before continuing on, Miss Spiral felt a familiar sensation traveling throughout her body. \u201cOooooh, I can feel it coming on now! Doc, I\u2019ll hold it off for as long as I can, just make sure everyone\u2019s ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight.\u201d Picking up his telecommunication device, the scientist radioed his home planet. \u201cAttention everyone, Ellen Spiral is about to grow. Please ready Operation Pillow Earth in your towns and cities. The duration of the spurt will be unknown, but be ready as soon as possible. She\u2019ll grow at any moment now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs everyone prepared?\u201d Miss Spiral asked, trying to delay the glorious urge to expand building within her. \u201cI can hold it in a little longer if you need me to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ve alerted everyone,\u201d he replied. \u201cGrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhew! I never thought you\u2019d say that!\u201d the monolithic mom chuckled. \u201cAlright, time to shine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once she stopped resisting the urge of growth within her, and in an instant it surged through every cell of her body, supercharging her into a massive spurt.\u201dOoh...\u201dThe cheery woman smiled wide as she kept her eyes open this time to witness the diminishing sun before her. It was a funny thing indeed. She could remember being a tiny, tiny person, back when she was just skyscraper-sized. She would look up to the sun and imagine how big it was, almost fathomless to the mere mind. But here it was, shrinking - or in correct terms, she was growing - right before her, and it created a sense of giddiness along with the feeling of growth. Quickly it became a beach ball, then a bowling ball, children\u2019s ball, and was becoming smaller still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on Earth<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a costly operation, but a successful one. Girders of the super-tense, super-flexible metals had been shipped to the highest survivable points on earth, a small frame set up. If any of Miss Spiral\u2019s body made contact with the planet, the beams would fully take on the force and protect the planet. It was a security measure, but entirely unnecessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human populace looked up in awe as the sky seemed to grow darker and darker, the world disappearing deeper and deeper into the monolithic mom\u2019s cleavage until it entirely became too small to be held by her breasts; instead, the planet vanished into a small pore of the V of her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, her growth came to a stop, and Miss Spiral looked down towards the sun. \u201cWow...This is...so amazing...\u201d she mused, completely in awe of her latest size upgrade. \u201cI can barely even see the Sun anymore...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAttention Dr. Connors! Dr. Connors, can you hear me?\u201d a voice called out from within the doctor\u2019s satellite. \u201cAre you alright? Do you have the latest readings?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m fine, but how\u2019s the planet holding up?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEarth is perfectly fine. No contact was made by her chest against any portion of the planet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear. Anyways, it seems Ellen Spiral grew larger than we projected once again...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow big is she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c100 million miles...\u201d Miss Spiral chuckled as she grasped the practically microscopic ball of flame in her fingers, making sure to handle it gently. \u201cAnd to think that I once used to look up at you...Oh well, I\u2019m glad that I\u2019m going to be your replacement!\u201d With a sudden motion of her hand, the mammoth woman deposited the star into her mouth and swallowed it whole, surprising Dr. Connors at her action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMayday, mayday! Prepare the planet for the Blackout Plan!\u201d he quickly shouted over his radio. \u201cShe\u2019s just consumed the-Wait a second, something\u2019s happening...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as soon as Miss Spiral consumed the Sun, her body began to glow brightly, emitting the same light the star had given out earlier, only on a larger scale. From deep within her chest, Earth was bathed in an appropriate amount of solar rays once again, their light problem now solved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, you won\u2019t believe this! There\u2019s light on Earth again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEllen Spiral...\u201d Dr. Connors began, \u201c...she\u2019s become a living goddess...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, to be honest sir,\u201dThe voice on the other end of his satellite feed replied.\u201d...She\u2019s always been a goddess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Agreed.\u201dConnors replied, flabbergasted as always with Ellen Spiral. He switched links with the intercom and went to speaking with Miss Spiral again.\u201dYou\u2019ve done it again, Ellen...\u201dHe breathed out in relief.\u201dYou\u2019ve saved us all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no need to be so flattering, Doc!

You bomb me, you threaten me! You attack me with no FUCKING reason whatsoever!\u201dShe screamed, shattering more than a few eardrums and mirrors across planet. She grinned maliciously as she raised her right foot and brought it down ever so slowly upon Latin America, the entire landmass destroyed instantly underneath her sole.\u201dWell, NO MORE. I hereby declare you all my SLAVES, and I am to be your GODDESS. Your angry, ANGRY goddess.\u201dWith that, Miss Spiral cackled, a deep, boneshaking chill running down the spines of every person on the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people of Earth began to regret all that they had done to the massive mother; she had done nothing but good no matter what size she became, yet they only continued to fear and antagonize her despite her countless acts of kindness. Everyone across the globe knew that they had contributed in some way to this point, either by talking bad about her, working or supporting Spiraling Out of Control, or by any other negative means which finally caused Miss Spiral to snap. With her most recent size boost, the people knew that this goliath could never be stopped, and now that they had pissed her off, they could do nothing but accept whatever decisions her 10,000 mile frame chose to implement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly about a step\u2019s journey from the new goddess, the woman\u2019s two children looked on in amazement at their television, watching as their mother intentionally ended an entire subcontinent beneath her enormous foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no...This isn\u2019t good...\u201d Michael gulped. \u201cMom finally snapped...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you see what she just did?\u201d Lily asked. \u201cShe stomped on all those people...I\u2019ve only seen Mom this mad once, and she didn\u2019t stop until she was satisfied with the outcome...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think she\u2019s finally let herself believe what everyone\u2019s been portraying her as: An evil goddess bent on destroying the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd knowing Mom, she\u2019ll most likely give them what they\u2019ve been asking for. That and...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily paused before continuing, \u201c...we both know she\u2019s only going to get even bigger...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt...at least that won\u2019t be for a while...right?\u201dThe older sibling chuckled very nervously.\u201dI mean...there\u2019s no more of that medicine...and she\u2019s probably in one of her dead zones in the growth chart, right...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both hoped that these facts were true, or more than just earth was in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, what should I do as your new goddess...?\u201dMiss Spiral\u2019s face remained plastered with a grin of absolute wickedness and malice.\u201dI believe I need to...come to terms with the rest of the world about this. I mean, not everybody just witnessed me destroy hundreds of your puny jets and boats, plus, some of you microbes might\u2019ve missed Latin America...it\u2019s kind of paste underneath my foot now.\u201dShe cackled.\u201dAttention leaders of the world, I want each and every one of you to meet me, right here in one hour\u2019s time! If not...well, let\u2019s just say your country won\u2019t last very long in the new world order...\u201dMiss Spiral giggled almost maniacally as she raised her foot and picked off some rubble that had gotten stuck to the bottom of her sole, mountains and entire cities falling to the ocean below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heads of state of each country began to assemble their homeland\u2019s fastest transportation vehicles, eager to make it to the goddess\u2019s meeting point in the desired time; they did not want to anger the furious woman any more than she already was. Miss Spiral stood still as she watched over her planet, continuing to pick off more rubble off of her foot to kill some time as the leaders began to arrive next to her other foot, taking in the powerful and unavoidable smell of her feet upon arrival. All the while, the titaness\u2019s mind continued to plan her next course of action, her anger and fury only continuing to grow with every second that passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm...You know what? I\u2019m starting to get bored...\u201d she chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m changing that one hour to thirty minutes, same conditions apply. Hope you can still make it~\u201d Miss Spiral laughed, malice filling her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 25 minutes later when the time period was completed, Miss Spiral bent downwards at her feet and quickly grabbed all that was in front of her foot, not caring how quickly she raised them up to her eye level. \u201cLet\u2019s see...I see some of you little germs didn\u2019t listen to me...I\u2019ll make sure their countries will pay the price...\u201d she giggled wickedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I bet you\u2019re all wondering why I gathered you all here,\u201dShe paused to give them a chance to reply, only to cut them off by shaking her hand and chuckling rather darkly at their misfortune, some leaders falling into the cracks and lines of her hand.\u201dYou must think that I\u2019m still not such a bad girl, I want to come to terms with you all, establish a treaty or document or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother pause, only none replied this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou would be right....but you\u2019re wrong. Horribly, horribly wrong. I\u2019m going to kill you all!\u201dShe giggled as she slowly began scrunching her hand into a fist, her monolithic fingers coming down upon the leaders rapidly.\u201dI can\u2019t let you all just live and rally some troops or something....\u201dWith that, she tightly clenched her fist, crushing them all in a split second.\u201dIt\u2019s not like any of you can stop me anyways...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the leaders of entire nations gone and no central power to oppose her, Miss Spiral turned her attention to her favorite little country, the USA. She didn\u2019t even have to walk anymore to reach it, the tiny landmass was right there by her feet.\u201dAnd as for you,\u201dShe pointed down at the country.\u201dI think a little...redecorating is in order if this is going to be the \u2018birthplace of the living goddess\u2019.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I could always toss a few of you unwanted states into space...or get rid of Canada. Never liked that silly little country....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about the limitless possibilities she had, Miss Spiral grinned darkly, choosing her next course of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Canada, looks like your time\u2019s up,\u201d she proclaimed as she stared angrily at the doomed country. \u201cYou should feel honored, you\u2019ll be the first to feel the true might of your new goddess!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral began to cackle wildly as she slowly turned her backside towards the top of the Western Hemisphere, preparing to smash the entire nation against her massive, full butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid Mom...did she really just do all that...?\u201d Lily asked her brother, now somewhat scared of the woman who had given them life. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody to run the governments of the world anymore!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe...She wasn\u2019t kidding...\u201d Michael slowly answered, still in complete shock himself at his mother\u2019s actions. \u201cShe really has decided she\u2019s going to be angry goddess and that everyone else really are slaves to her...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should\u2019ve known she wasn\u2019t joking a long time ago...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom...swore...For the first time in her life, she yelled out her first swear to the entire planet,\u201d Lily explained. \u201cWhen she did that, I knew she was completely serious: She was going to do what she said she was going to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! You\u2019re forgetting something important here!\u201d Michael cheered her up. \u201cShe\u2019s still our Mom, and she still loves us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily paused for a moment before answering, \u201cYeah, you\u2019re actually right for once. Mom might destroy and kill everyone else, but she\u2019d never hurt us. She loves us more than anything; she even made sure to spare the town just now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee? She\u2019s still Mom under all that anger! Now I just hope she somehow regains her senses...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she will. Mom\u2019ll be Mom, just...a very destructive goddess from now on...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Miss Spiral began to sit down, her enormous rear end dawning upon the doomed country in almost slow-motion. Miss Spiral did this purposely, she wanted to relish the moments just before impact, imagining the screams and pleas of all the helpless, puny mortals below about to meet their end by her end. It all happened in a blur once the tense moment ended. With an earth-shattering crash, Miss Spiral\u2019s round and voluptuous butt smashed into Canada, instantly obliterating any means of life underneath her. But no, she was still not satisfied. Giving a quick twist of her hips, she made sure nothing remained as she wiggled her butt deeper and deeper into the crust of the planet. Once she was satisfied with millions becoming smears against her cheeks, she stood back up, wiping off dirt and gravel and chunks of land from her ass, proud with her work of two perfectly round imprints of her behind deep in the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, that felt satisfying!\u201dShe grinned a wide, almost predatory smile. Looking back down at the US, more specifically, her hometown, Miss Spiral\u2019s eyes almost softened for a second before hardening quickly.\u201dMichael! Lily! Get out of the home! Your goddess demands to speak with you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid Mom just refer to herself as our goddess?\u201d Michael asked aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but I think she\u2019s just trying to keep up her \u2018angry goddess\u2019 image up,\u201d Lily shrugged as she slipped on a pair of sandals. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess you\u2019re right,\u201d he sighed with relief. \u201cMom is still Mom after all. She probably just wants to let us know we\u2019ll be safe or something. C\u2019mon, we can\u2019t keep \u2018Goddess Mom\u2019 waiting...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two youths did as their only remaining parent instructed and exited their house, awed by seeing their much larger mother\u2019s foot up close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t kidding,\u201d Lily whistled. \u201cShe\u2019s definitely in the quintuple digit mile range by now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her 10,000 mile viewpoint, Miss Spiral was able to watch as her children did as she ordered, exiting their home relatively quickly. Next, she slowly lowered her massive index finger down in front of the town. \u201cClimb up, germs.\u201d Once they had climbed up the self-proclaimed deity, she slowly brought them up to her eye level, ready to finally converse with her latest company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, Mom...\u201dMichael waved at her almost happily, only for her glaring eye to silence him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, uh...Mom...\u201dLily began, only to stop at the sheer rage broiling beneath her pupil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am not your mother anymore.\u201dMiss Spiral said callously, not caring to lower her voice, forcing the two on her finger to cover their ears in pain.\u201dCalling me your mother would suggest that I was human. I\u2019m NOT. I\u2019m your goddess now, divine in stature and beauty, and you are going to treat me as such.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Mom-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT DID I JUST SAY?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they gazed into the massive green orb that could be the moon to them, their reflections came back in the pupil. They could see what was going on inside Miss Spiral. Turmoil. She was treating the ones she loved like they were nothing, and yet, they were nothing to her, microscopic mites to be discarded at will. It was the conflict within her now to do so or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c.....I\u2019ve suddenly grown bored of you two. I\u2019ll return later.\u201dWith that, she lowered them back down to their home, not caring what she crushed with her finger on the way down. Once they were off, Miss Spiral stomped off into the distance to continue her domination over the planet.</span></div></div>",

She even said she wasn\u2019t our mom anymore...I think she might finally have lost it. She really does think she\u2019s a goddess now, an angry, unstoppable goddess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot to mention smoking hot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? I\u2019m just saying what we\u2019ve known for years,\u201d Lily shrugged. \u201cStill, I think she\u2019s just finally letting herself go; all that anger building up in her and now she\u2019s embracing it. This isn\u2019t gonna be good...Oh well, let\u2019s go see if she\u2019s on TV!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another two mighty stomps, not caring what may have been crushed underfoot, Miss Spiral stood in front of Asia once again, this time completely furious of the only object on the planet that was larger than herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, this thing is an insult to my size and power,\u201d Miss Spiral boomed down towards the people of the eastern coast. \u201cI should\u2019ve destroyed it yesterday, but it paid off to wait...Now I can crush it and ALL of you at once!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral continued her tour of destruction as she reached down with her left hand clenched into a fist, smashing the borders of the continent into fine dirt, creating earthquakes and devastating countless. Making sure nobody could escape the hundred-mile deep trench she created with her hand around Asia, she decided it was time to have a little play time, take it slow with this one. She wanted them all to suffer at her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching down once more, she picked up a good, sizable chunk of the land in the palm of her right hand, raising it up to her mouth, and taking a massive bite out of the landmass like a burger. She chewed it slowly, hundreds of villages and towns wiped out in an instant in her mouth.\u201dEh...I\u2019ve had better.\u201dShe shrugged.\u201dBut you should always finish your meal...can\u2019t let food go to waste.\u201dWith that, she downed it all in one bite, gulping millions of lives down in a flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a small burp, she turned to the rest of Asia, her acts of evil not quite finished yet.\u201dOh, I still have plenty more for you all down there...\u201dWith that, she knelt down, slowly lowering her torso down towards the continent, her massive, bare breasts filling the sky overhead, coming down like two meteors of the apocalypse onto Asia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, this\u2019ll make a great spot for me to finally check my cup size,\u201d Miss Spiral grinned as in an instant, her magnificent bust slammed into the crust below, killing tens of millions beneath her perfect mounds, annihilating several countries with ease as if it were nothing to her. Wanting to add insult to injury, she then began to cup each breast in each hand and began to move them around in the space they were occupying, deepening the impact they had made in addition to making sure there was a 0% chance of survival for those who were unfortunate enough to suffer her wrath. \u201cHave to make sure it\u2019s in there nice and deep,\u201d she added with a malicious chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a full minute of her impression, Miss Spiral lifted up her chest slowly, dusting off large chunks of land off of her titanic busom. Gazing down at her majestic work, the self-proclaimed goddess smiled proudly as she gauged her cup size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm...Well, I seem to be a bit bigger than before, maybe an E-cup or bigger...This is a cause for some well-deserved celebration...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood back up, her attention turned to another nearby country, Australia. The massive being didn\u2019t even have to walk, it was a quick turn around for her to face it.\u201dYou know what...\u201dShe smiled down at it menacingly.\u201dI\u2019ve never liked you aussies either. Your accents are far too annoying...so, as a celebration, you pathetic nothings get to be destroyed as well! Feel honored!\u201dShe cackled as she dipped her foot into the ocean bordering the edge of the country, digging her foot deeper and deeper into the earth until she felt magma touch her toe tips. It didn\u2019t hurt her thick skin, only gave her a warm tingly feeling. With a grunt, Miss Spiral kicked upwards as one would kick a soccer ball, sending the entire country of Australia and a good amount of earth chunks to fly into outer space, joining the lost Africa in the darkness of the cosmos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa-ha! That was too much fun! They should make that into a sport!\u201dShe cackled with glee and a clap of her hands as the force of her kick sent Australia straight into the sun at high-speeds.\u201dLet\u2019s see who\u2019s left...\u201dShe turned to face the remainder of the world, the survivors cowering in fear of her titanic frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat...was actually pretty impressive...\u201d Michael admitted as he witnessed the ejection of a second continent from the planet, this time with massive repercussions for the remainder of the globe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily sighed. \u201cI knew having Mom play soccer with me years ago would come back to haunt us. I mean, she was only a few hundred feet tall then, but still, I can tell she\u2019s been practicing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll that\u2019s left is Europe and South America...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...and then she\u2019ll come back here...for us...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019ll definitely take us with her wherever she goes, I know it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, let\u2019s hope so...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her attention towards the nearest continent, Miss Spiral took a single, powerful step, planting her foot directly in the center of the Middle East. \u201cWell, well, well, it looks like it\u2019s your lucky day too, Europe,\u201d she chuckled wickedly. \u201cYour pathetic people annoy me the most! You\u2019re all just so rude and evil, and absolutely worthless to me! And because of that, I\u2019m gonna love taking out my anger out on all of you...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore beginning her fun with the doomed nations, Miss Spiral spit on the combined countries in disgust, further displaying her utter disgust for all the slaves that were beneath the massive woman. Next, in a swift motion, she bent downwards and grabbed a huge mound of the planet in her hand and slowly placed it between her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope you can withstand the pressure. If not, too bad!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Once she was satisfied, she wiped the remnants off of her chest, chunks of what once held life falling to the ocean below.\u201dI\u2019m not done with you just yet, Europe...\u201dShe looked down at the devastated landmass that barely resembled it\u2019s former shape. But some pieces of green remained, signaling to the living goddess that survivors of her rampage remained.\u201dBuh-bye, you germs!\u201dShe cackled, and in one fluid motion, raised her fist, bent down, and punched the earth, her fist going straight through the planet and leaving a massive hole that quickly filled with magma and countless gallons of the surrounding seas. Miss Spiral pulled her hand out of the planet, wiping off some of the molten hot goo from her forearm as if the inferno-like heat it produced was a nuisance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlmost done with finishing up my world tour...just a few more annoyances remaining...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow all that remained of the destroyed planet was South and North America, only about 35% of the Earth\u2019s population remaining after Miss Spiral\u2019s incredible rampage.

With two small steps, Miss Spiral loomed high over the doomed landscape, shaking her right foot of its debris high over the continent, crushing several dozen cities before her true wrath began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll that forest and nothing good coming from your pathetic little land...I should\u2019ve taken care of you all first!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slight chuckle, Miss Spiral bent her knees slightly before leaping a small amount into the air and turning her stomach towards the ground. Then, as she extended her body to its full length in mid-air, she playfully shouted, \u201cLook out below!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an earth-shattering thud, her body slammed into the planet, causing the entire continent to sink heavily into the Earth\u2019s crust, a massive wave of lava soon rising up and gently warming Miss Spiral\u2019s toned stomach. \u201cAh, thanking me with a nice heat massage? Well, that won\u2019t get you spared from me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood back with a giggle, removing any lava or earth crust from her flat stomach. She looked down, but her face flashed almost disappointment. In replace of South America, an imprint of her body stretched into the ground. All that remained of the destroyed world was a partially already destroyed North America. Miss Spiral bellowed out a menacing, terrifying laugh that rang through the cosmos.\u201dAww...I\u2019ve already broken almost all of my toys!\u201dShe turned with a wide, toothy grin and bright, evil green eyes.\u201dAt least my....\u2019homeland\u2019 can still entertain it\u2019s goddess...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached down and scooped up a handful of the states she had divided up and quickly downed them into her mouth like they were snacks, smacking her lips with satisfaction. Another set she flung into space, another met it\u2019s end by being grinded into dust between her fingers. She continued this process for about ten minutes, going through all fifty states of the USA, disposing of each in a different manner, until all that remained was the small patch of land containing her hometown and some surrounding countryside. The titanic woman gazed down at it almost uncertainly, but it was replaced with the wicked grin she had wore during her entire destruction of humankind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady or not, your goddess is coming...\u201dShe cackled as she reached down towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, is it me, or is this looking like Mom\u2019s about to do something with us?\u201d Michael gulped as his mother\u2019s hand completely engulfed their hometown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this is gonna be good...\u201d Lily agreed. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like we can do anything at this point. Mom\u2019s just too big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCackling wildly, Miss Spiral slowly raised the plot of land in front of her eyes, gazing at it with the utmost certainty of what she was about to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve been thinking...and a goddess doesn\u2019t have a homeland, a hometown, or anything home-like. The only thing I need is a large throne fit for my immense, beautiful form!\u201d she laughed, her voice at such a close range deafening almost all in the city in her palm. \u201cAnd looking at all of you now, I never realized that my so-called home would be the thing that finally makes me a true goddess...once I\u2019ve destroyed you all of course. Then, I\u2019ll be truly almighty...No, beyond that...I\u2019ll be Momnipotent!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral trembled with power at that realization, almost as if her body completely agreed with her decision and reasoning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now, it\u2019s time for the end of you...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, you can\u2019t!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the Miss Spiral barked at the voices below that could still hear her, signaling her ultimate decision: \u201cI HAVE no family! The only one I love is myself and no one else!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words cut deep into the former children of the living goddess, and every remaining survivor in the town felt it. Humanity truly was doomed. With her proclamation of divinity and renouncement of her family, she slowly angled the plot of land the town occupied onto her thumb, her index finger hovering ominously overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom....you can't do this!\u201dLily was crying hysterically, tears streaming heavily down her face.\u201dWe love you...and we know you still love us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou grew up here! You raised us here! You just can\u2019t forget all of that!\u201dMicheal added by yelling, hoping their persistence would at least grant them a moment\u2019s peace and a chance from the 10,000-mile tall woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light in her eye told them all they needed to know. She wasn\u2019t the loving mother they once knew, she was a powerful, vengeful goddess, and her wrath upon the world that had wronged her was about to be complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBye bye, you insignificant nothings...\u201dShe whispered, arching her index finger, preparing to flick the entire town into space and watch it crumble away into nothings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for a tiny, tiny tingly sensation down by her toes to interrupt her. Peering down curiously, the giant woman had to squint her eyes to properly see so far below. Fighter Jets. Boats. The remnants of Spiraling Out of Control had somehow avoided her until this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Connors stood aboard the largest battleship in their fleet, the mighty vessel not even comparable to the dirt in between her toeprint lines, but this was humanity\u2019s last stand against the towering being. A fight they knew they would lose, but one they would not go down without trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSend in the newest formula batch.\u201dThe man signaled to a squad of jets rigged with explosives containing a new formula, this once much more acidic, and would seep into her skin upon contact.\u201dBig Bitch,\u201dHe called out on a radio amplified to his highest noise available, but even then she could not hear him, only staring down with her free hand on her hip and a mocking sneer on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re going down.\u201dHe proclaimed as the anti-spiralers took to battle with her once more.</span></div></div>",

Even now that I\u2019ve become the angry, cruel goddess you\u2019ve made me become? Well, normally I would crush you like the insignificant insects you are, but seeing as you\u2019re the last of my toys, I\u2019ll let you try your best to defeat me, though you won\u2019t even hurt me...THEN I\u2019ll obliterate you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo! Now\u2019s our only shot!\u201d Dr. Connors signaled. \u201cAll other units provide cover fire for the air units!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the command sent to all the remaining units, the various battleships began to fire their remaining volleys, each one only landing in a pore on the goddess\u2019s impressive pinky toe. None of the shots fired even registered to Miss Spiral; her skin had become too thick to suffer pain that could easily decimate a city in seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you little bugs even trying down there?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019m starting to grow bored of this...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNOW! It must be NOW!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoger that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squadron of fighter jets joined in formation and began to fire their special missiles, all of them connecting at the same spot on the toe that stood over 150 miles tall. \u201cAll missiles hit the target sir. Requesting further instructions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell done soldiers. Now all we have to do is wait...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing from high above, the deity signaled that her game was about to come to an end. \u201cWell, this was fun, but it\u2019s time for this all to end...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Miss Spiral raised her other foot high into the air, she began to feel an odd sensation on her other foot which began to spread through her entire body. \u201cHmmm? What\u2019s this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s working!\u201d the doctor proclaimed. \u201cAll units, pull back! The Big Bitch will finally be finished...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm...\u201dMiss Spiral titled her head as the feeling entered the remainder of her body. Curiously, she closed her eyes and relaxed to allow the sensation to take place, placing her foot back down carelessly, ending the entire remainder of the Anti-Spiralers without a thought, she didn\u2019t even need to try. The feeling was strange to her at first, but slowly began taking on a familiar form. With her grin returning, Miss Spiral mouthed one word with her luscious lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrowth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the entire town had fled. All around them, nothing but a destroyed wasteland of what used to be a thriving country, now only desolation and despair left. Michael and Lily ran as fast they could from the towering figure of their mother in the distance, tears still falling from their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMicheal...\u201dLily whispered as she turned to look at him mid-dash. \u201cMom...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s...not our mom anymore, sis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut she IS!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that too, but...but you saw that look in her eyes, right?\u201d he asked. \u201cHave you ever seen her look at anything like that before, including us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No,\u201d Lily admitted. \u201cShe was...She was actually going to do it, and she wouldn\u2019t care about what happened to us...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate saying it too, Lily, but Mom\u2019s not mom anymore,\u201d Michael explained. \u201cShe\u2019s a goddess now, and if we live through this, we\u2019ll probably end up dead anyways.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily paused for a moment before replying, \u201cShe\u2019s...She\u2019s gonna...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvery time she\u2019s fought the Anti-Spiralers, she has...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the massive Miss Spiral\u2019s voice rang out across the planet with a twisted chuckle, \u201cI wonder if this worthless planet will be able to hold me soon enough...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, starting with a whisper and increasing in volume, the goddess began to prepare the remaining survivors for the end:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrow...Grow...Grow...GROW!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if her words were a command, her body began to comply immediately.. She stretched higher and higher into the sky by the second, 10,000 miles tall soon a simple dream left behind. Her expanding feet stretched onto land and bulldozed their way through the ground, coming upon the survivors fast as walls of infinite flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMicheal...?\u201dLily whispered as she and her brother stopped, the others around them screaming and their futile attempts in trying to outrun the growing toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLily...it\u2019s okay.\u201dHe held her close just their former mother\u2019s big toe grew right onto them and smeared them into an unrecognizable paste in mere seconds. Their death was quick, painless, but for the remainder of the earth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral\u2019s mere presence on the globe was destroying it. Cracks and fissures began to grow along the planet, her immense weight and still-growing form taking a heavy toll on the small orb. In a matter of seconds, the entire world gave way underneath her, shattering the planet into massive chunks of rock and magma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHA! I destroyed earth without doing nothing but growing! And I\u2019m still not even done yet!\u201dShe cackled as she became bigger and bigger, easily reaching 100,000 miles in just seconds, and no sign of slowing down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entities of the endless cosmos simply watched in silence as the self-proclaimed goddess continued to relentlessly expand, her breasts now larger than planets themselves and still enlarging. Miss Spiral only laughed wickedly as she enjoyed every instant of her expansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, now I\u2019ll have lots of more little toys to play with...\u201d she said aloud. \u201cAnd plenty of room to keep growing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued to become more and more immense, Venus was in its closest orbit to the former Earth than it ever had been. However, it was the second planet from the Sun\u2019s unlucky day as Miss Spiral\u2019s titanic right thigh began to take up more of the space around it. Soon enough, the planet impacted with the woman\u2019s increasing leg, exploding into countless pieces of space rock instantaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm? What was that?\u201d the now 450,000 mile Miss Spiral asked. \u201cOh, another pathetic planet decided to challenge me? HA! Good! This is just another testament of my growth and power. My anger shall never subside!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn fact...\u201dShe contemplated more thoughts of rage as she grew more and more astronomical.\u201dI do believe this whole universe is to blame...I\u2019ve been treated like garbage all my life, and I finally have to power to shape entire planets to my whim! In fact, once I grow so large, possibly galaxies, universes, reality itself!\u201dShe giggled maniacally to herself.\u201dI\u2019ll just keep on growing...and everything will be beneath me...but for now...\u201dShe could feel her growth subsiding. As it slowed, the solar system was to be her plaything as she neared a whopping 1.5 million miles tall, her vast size encompassing over most of the planets there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s have some fun...\u201dMiss Spiral chuckled as she swatted at Mars, the red dot instantly turned to dust against the sheer force her palm smashed into it with. \u201cHeh, that was easier than destroying the Earth!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral then stared at her massive body, completely loving the sheer power and size she possessed. She was now truly unstoppable, no cosmic force in existence strong enough to rival her unique form. Now ready to continue on her path of destruction, the newborn goddess decided to make her way towards her favorite tanning spot: The Sun.</span></div></div>",

Of course, I\u2019ll have some fun along the way...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking off into the distance, Miss Spiral was able to spot a few other planets towards her final destination, they in their closest orbit to the Sun - it was almost as if the cosmos had brought the planets together on purpose for her amusement. Cackling wickedly, she then began to stop in front of her next victim: Mercury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re so pretty...\u201dShe pinched the planet between her fingers, holding it up to her bright green eye.\u201dToo bad you\u2019re so pathetically small...\u201dWith that, she ground it into dust between her appendages with ease, the small orb giving way as it were nothing to her power. One by one, Miss Spiral passed the floating planets and destroyed them with a manic laugh and malicious grins. Some met their fate by slamming into her body, others were devoured as if the astral bodies were candy. But soon, they were all gone, and Miss Spiral found herself in front of the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...that\u2019s so lovely and warm...\u201dShe paused, her anger had simmered down quite dramatically. Earth and the human race was utterly gone, most of the solar system had met it\u2019s end, and she was stuck at the \u2018small\u2019 stature of a million and a half miles tall. She had nothing to do now, and that brought boredom, and with boredom, calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm...\u201dShe took to floating in a lying down position, tanning her beautiful naked form before the bright warmth of the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t have ended Earth so quickly...maybe I should have kept some as worshippers...\u201dHer mind flashed to Micheal and Lily, but they were long dead now, and she felt no regret for killing the ones she had called family. No shred of humanity was left in the living goddess. \u201cOn second thought, if the Earth couldn\u2019t hold my body, it really wasn\u2019t meant to survive anyways. Then again, why would I need worshippers when all I need are slaves?\u201d she cackled to herself, her voice echoing through the endless vacuum of space. \u201cEverything will bow down to me whether they like it or not...All I have to do is wait until I grow again...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back towards the Sun, the massive woman smiled, \u201cAnd hopefully I\u2019ll finally be able to get the perfect tan. I\u2019d say it\u2019s much more of a goddess-y skin color! Hmmm...I wonder what it\u2019ll be like once everything\u2019s beneath me? Ohhhhh, I can\u2019t wait!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she tanned, the near-deity had dozed off into a peaceful state, her mind empty and her breathing calm. But as she tanned, she drifted slowly, ever so slowly closer and closer to the sun until her body made full contact with the sheer ball of heat and light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh...wuzzat?\u201dShe mumbled to herself, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. A small, tingling was touching her body, and she couldn\u2019t help but giggle. Looking to her side, she smirked at the view. Solar heat was fully raging against her, but all it did was leave her a nice warm and toasty feeling across her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s kinda nice...even the sun recognizes my goddesshood!\u201dShe cackled, only to notice something odd. As her body continued touching the searing strings of flame, it seemed the fire was entering her body through the pores of her skin, as if she was absorbing it. In a matter of seconds, the spot she was near had entirely died out, a deadzone in the sun, her body having ciphered the energy.\u201dHmm....\u201dCuriously, Miss Spiral held out her hand towards a brighter spot and touched it, and as soon as skin made contact, the light dimmed as it entered her body. Her eyes perked up at the exact moment the heat entered her, the universe around her grew a tad smaller...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, well, lookie here! The sun wants to give me it\u2019s power! How sweet!\u201d Miss Spiral laughed wickedly. \u201cWell, if you insist, I\u2019ll gladly take it from you. Besides, a goddess needs all the power she can get...not to mention more size.\u201d Now fully aware of what was occurring to her body, the goddess began to wrap her body around the planet, embracing it in a cosmic hug. Once her grip on the star was secure, Miss Spiral could feel the Sun\u2019s energy become absorbed into her body, boosting her height larger and larger. After about a minute or so, the massive mom had become too huge to maintain the hug and released the star, it now large enough to fit in the palm of her hand. Not wasting any time, Miss Spiral grabbed the star and continued to siphon the life-giving energy from it until it turned into a black mass of extinguished elements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm...That was a nice boost...\u201d she cackled to herself, the Sun now a barely visible speck on the edge of her finger. \u201cBut now that I can\u2019t tan anymore, I\u2019ll just have to have myself a little solar snack...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Miss Spiral brought the drained star to her mouth and uncaringly dumped it into her mouth, swallowing it whole.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, now what to d-Oh my...What\u2019s this feeling?\u201d Though she had drained the Sun of its energy, she had consumed the star\u2019s inner core intact, and now it was having an effect on her body from the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt an intense heat begin to overwhelm her senses, the fire coming from her gut. It merged alongside the feeling of growth, and she moaned in almost orgasmic pleasure as she rocketed outwards in all directions, growing faster and larger by the second. The seemingly dead core had jump-started a wave of growth that shouldn\u2019t have come for at least a month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon outsized the entire solar system, the stars and their energy being absorbed into her as well, giving more fuel to the fire. Eventually she could compete with the Milky Way Galaxy, but that too became just another snack for the energy-absorbing goddess. Miss Spiral\u2019s growth showed no signs of slowing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is...amazing...\u201dShe whispered to herself, snatching up a nearby galaxy and gobbling it down quickly, entire planets and cosmic bodies dissapearing into her taste buds.\u201dSoon....the entire universe will bow to me...Miss Spiral...Goddess of all I survey!\u201dShe cackled as she gathered up more and more galaxies, the celestial deities becoming more and more minute until they could fit into her fingerprints. Yet she continued expanding.</span></div></div>",

Smaller beings who weren't as tuned in with the galaxies didn't even hear or feel the echo or spacial rumble at all. At some point in outer space, a slight shift was apparent in the never-ending dark void as a wall of flesh closed over itself in a massive blink, an astronomical eye of green falling over, well, everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen Spiral, or as she preferred Miss Spiral, giggled once again to herself, her index finger extended and held upright in front of her eye to examine what sat so preciously on the tip of her finger . . . a small, shining speck, barely visible unless one squinted and focused clearly on it. The entirety of the universe. The goddess was big, more than even astronomical could define, and could become even bigger than this 'tiny' size she was at. Sometimes she liked to hold the multiverse as well. But for now, this was a suitable size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had perfect clarity of what was going on in every corner of the universe-speck before her, and smiled. Her two children were doing quite well in school, but she would have to punish her son later on for that D in math.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, as she floated in the vast darkness tween dimensions, she wondered what to do.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly a flash hit her and she expanded, and before she knew it she was sitting in front of another city which looked much more real.  Clouds floated around her belly and she began looking around.  MOM? she boomed.  She realized she wasn't in her house anymore and what was in front of her was a dream come true.  She realized she was around a mile tall sitting down and she easily was bigger than any skyscraper, even if she was to lie down.  She looked under her butt to see tiny houses and she knew the fate of her mother.  Oh well Amy thought, now I can finally have some fun!</span></div></div>",

Amy reached down with her impossibly long arm, trying not to hit any buildings as her hand barely fit between the skyscrapers, and tried picking up a tiny car with her nails. She tried being gentle but the toy stood no chance and was turned to dust.  \"OOPS, SORRY BUGS\"  Amy thundered.  She flicked the remains of the car away, carrying the car several blocks over into a building.  Amy went for a larger target this time, an oil truck on a nearby bridge.  She snatched the tiny vehicle between two fingers and gently dropped it in her palm. <br>\r\n      <br>\r\nThe man inside looked terrified.  \"WON'T YOU COME OUT AND PLAY LITTLE BUGGY?\"  Amy boomed, nearly blowing the entire truck away.

Without a care in the world she is building a castle from the sand, and miles of ground from underneath it.. and anything that happened to be in some northern African country, including cities, farms, tourists... All mashed together to be used as a building material by the young girl. But at least the castle is looking great, with walls easily miles thick and towering taller than any mountain range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople are already used to it and most of them is just trying to move along with their lives. At least those not caught by hands gathering more dirt and not buried under gigantic avalanches when she drops some, at least. And not killed by enormous earthquakes that ravage the land.. it's not exactly easy to ignore her actions. That's why some people are trying to run away \u2013 not out of fear, but rather annoyed by all this or simply unwilling to spend some time dead or trapped in a devastated neighborhoods. The assume she will revert the destruction, but it is still pretty inconvenient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd few people are doing the opposite \u2013 watching the enormous giantess, taking pictures, filming, sometimes streaming it for as long as their network connection works. It's been a few months since she became a goddess and Internet is already full of photos and videos of Amy playing around the world, but there's a steady stream of new ones published each day on every portal. Unless she happens to play around US, Europe or Asia and messes up the servers breaking few of them temporarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of her 'fans' \u2013 as Candace likes to call it, although Amy doesn't mind, or care \u2013 are even trying to get closer. Sometimes to get a better viewpoint for a 'killer picture' \u2013 which usually ends up killing them before they upload it, sometimes just to watch and experience it. Sometimes few hotheads even try to climb her.. which results in their even quicker death when she moves. Still they always claim it was worth it after being restored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut right now her castle is almost complete and Amy is simply sitting down, waiting for water to fill a little moat she just made. Of course the 'little' trench she made with a single finger is actually a couple miles wide and deep \u2013 and a hundred miles long, which takes water quite some time to fill it through an opening she made to the sea. The canyon is slowly draining water and sucks ships, yachts and whatever happened to be still floating after the tsunamis caused by her steps receded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is wearing a simple pink two-piece swimsuit instead of her usual attire since she wanted to play in the sea earlier \u2013 but instead came up with an idea to build the sandcastle. Her feet already dried up in the desert air and Amy thought about changing back, but maybe she'll decide to swim after this? And the only thing still missing to complete her little idea is somebody to populate it. She figured she should get a princess, but where will she find one? France maybe? She remembers it being somewhere nearby \u2013 but it has been some time since she played with maps. And of course the whole world looks like a map to her now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, water is slowly advancing through the moat and produces puffs of clouds, when it meets molten lava that was spewing from underground where she dug too deep and ruptured earth's crust. Amy finally gets bored and decides to speed up the process by grabbing a few handfuls of seawater and pouring it into the trench directly. It still takes a few minutes, but the building is finally complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she is getting ready to stand up, she notices...</span></div></div>",

Using a finger nail she casually scraped the top of the plane off before lightly shaking it's contents onto her sand castle. With a satisfied grin she tossed the pane away.

Even when she squats down, they still can't see her face but her massive breasts and...a tail? This massive but beautiful fox girl was Vixen Vex or Vix for short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the past, Vixen was a normal sized human baby when she was born in this city, but she rapidly grows every year...No one knows why she keep growing and to make it worst, Vixen develop a fox like ears, very sharp claws, and a soft tail and once again, no one knows why she have them. In the present,she has fully grown up to a massive 85 mile, easily towering over the cities and mountains all together! Many people in the world feared that she will destroy their homeland or possibly Earth, but the residents of Vixen's hometown doesn't think so, she is trying to be the best gentle giantess for her people and the whole world. The companies decide to help this special girl to be healthy and alive by giving her food about a half size of country, clothes to match her height and any possible way to entertain her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, Vixen was up and ready for her day, she puts on her favorite azure bedlah shirt, azure mini skirt, and azure ballet flats. She looks down at her hometown between her feet with a grin. \"Morning guys!\" Her soft voice echoes throughout the world. \"I was wondering its alright if I go for a stroll across the land? I'll be able to get home by dinner time.\" Half of the residents think its not a good idea since most cities are still scared of her due to some 'accidents' she made, but the other half thinks its okay for her to explore the world and she may try to be friends with other people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVixen really wants to explore the world for a while...But she likes to spend time with her friends and of course some perverted men who wants to explore her body. She finally made a decision and she decided to... </span></div></div>",

She grab many mere speck size ships from the sea and place them between her massive toes, she then order the people to climb her toes and massages them. The poor speck people were massaging her toes like there's no tomorrow, Vix was enjoying the feeling of her servants massaging her beautiful toes and wiggles them a little. She then place the ships back and decide to tease the city by hovering her foot over it. She heard the people screaming in chaos, thinking its the end of the world, she only respond by giggling that echoes across the world, fearing many cities near San Diego and thus...California's Monster was born<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt has been two years since that incident...and she's thinking about returning her favorite playground, so her first spot for her exploring trip is none other than California. She looks down at her city with a grin and tells the resident she will be leaving now, hearing the poor mere speck men sadness. Vix waves good bye at them and head towards her destination. \"California...Guess who's coming back to play.\" She smirked as her mischief side taking over once again, she only need to take a dozen or steps to reach her favorite 'playground.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the city of San Diego, it was still the same like everyday: People drove from place to place, talking on their phones, going shopping, working, riding the trolley,etc. It was indeed a pretty much normal day since the horrible nightmare two years ago. But all of the sudden...the sun has gone out like a solar eclipse. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\nBoom!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the whole city,actually the whole California,was trembled by a major earthquake. It was a familiar sound, but it still worried the people as half of them remembering the nightmare of California's Monster.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>Boom!!</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time it was louder and very close. The people begins to realize this is no ordinary earthquake...No, this is much, MUCH worst than earthquakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>BOOM!!!! </b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of San Diego craned their necks as high as they could go; few managed to actually see anything past the calf without being a good distance away. Standing so high and proud above the state of California...was the California's Monster Vixen. \"Hello my little...Remember me?\" Her voice booms down San Diego, every widows and glass objects breaks in seconds. The people was shaken in fear, the California Monster has grown even bigger than before! \"Before we had fun, why don't we change the California's Monster to California's Goddess? It sounds pretty fair right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot many people said anything; a short tap from Vixen which made the state trembled, had half the country muttering in agreement. \"Excellent! Now then my people...what shall we do today?\" She thought about it, tapping her foot on Earth once again...She finally got a perfect solution for them.  <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vixen Vex demurely folded her 4-mile hands behind her loosely-dangling blue top. She hid one leg behind another in mock-shyness, twisting her ankle around, toes pointed to the soft soil. A coy smile crept her cute, peachy cheeks. It would look absolutely adorable - were it not for the fact that her heel easily surpassed the cloud layers! Vix spread her right leg out, leaning in. Each of the great pillars twice were the length of San Clemente Island!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's start my 'Big World Tour' on the right foot!\" She leaned over it, bringing the ballet flat to the ground. \"I know how beautiful you think my feet are, so I'll let you massage them again! Just keep your pants on while I get everything ready.\"<br>\r\n<font class=\"size3\" style=\"\">BOOM.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive shake of her shoe as it fell near the city made everything drop. She made sure to place it away from the inhabited area - still, measly trees from the Peninsular Ranges snapped apart like toothpicks beneath the pressure. The shockwave overturned cars; forced citizens to hold onto street signs and lights for support, or be sent flying meters into the sky; and made even construction workers with heavy ear protection cover their ears. Massive evacuations rushed them from dangerous elevated zones; those who remained were treated to a horrifying sight as the dust cleared around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good Lord...\" A businessman shivered, looking to what were once mountains. \"The rubber of her shoe is taller than the One America Plaza!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside him, an older store owner pointed up, her breath shallow. \"And she's taking her shoes off! Not again...\" Her mind flooded with repressed memories of the wriggling digits - dangling right above her fair city. She'd hid away the first time - but satellite footage was repeated on news reports, again and again, of California's Monster Fox looming above with her mischievous grin. It made San Diego look like a tiny patch of moss in the world, being teased by a teen; and the proud, massive ships were little bath toys. Now, that same foot was hovering over them, reaching bigger widths than ever - as Vix spread the immense, round ball to the world, as if to give everyone a close-up shot of their new task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young girl in the shop stared flatly up, between the five prolonged shadows. \"Woah. Even Miss Vex's panties are blue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth adults hid her eyes in a flash. But indeed: when she leaned over, the azure skirt revealed a rear that was as blue, clean, and puffy as the skies themselves... If not far more deadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVixen's tail wagged in contentment, sending great flocks of quails flying from the forests, around her maroon hair. \"Aaaah~ This takes me down memory lane! Even the breeze here feels so good against my little piggies!\" Each phalange flexed out, one by one, basking in the refreshing glow of the sweet California sun - and spreading their shadow above their immense buildings. \"They're probably not that 'little' to you, though! It's good to see San Diego's gotten bigger in two years. And Bet you're happy to see me all grown, too! I wonder...\" Her mouth curled up in a sneaky, foxy smile, making residents' hearts sink. \"Now that I'm 85 miles, has my foot outgrown your city? I wanna compare!\" As the immense fox girl peeked down, her ankle rotated, hovering closer to the skyline. The populace collectively held their breaths as shadows approached. She didn't even notice as the dirt sediments from her shoes landed below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUD. THUD. Blue threads from some of her old socks descended, blocking major roads, snaking around and above buildings; some poor people were even caught in the earth-shattering lint, their eyes and noses filled with their goddess. A faint odor of berry lotion filled the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that chaos ended swiftly when Vixen moved her gigantic foot away, a little grin on her face. \"Huh, the city wins the size contest! Congratulations! I'd still need to take four or five steps to squish you all. But my foot's gaining on you, and it doesn't look like I'll stop growing! We'll see if you all fit underneath it next time, okay?\" She placed the sole back down with a new <b>BOOOM</b>, and began removing her left foot from its flat. Her plush backside now sat on the ground, legs stretched out, with San Diego between them. \"Maybe when I've reached 250 miles!... If that ever happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople screamed and mumbled at her words, and the sight of her flowing blue dress in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time?\" The store owner murmured. \"She wants to come back... AGAIN?\" Her eyes went small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man added on to that, looking at the healthy coating of dirt across her soles - unable to see much beyond that, and not willing to look more. \"Did she say she was... still getting bigger? Is this not enough for that monster, when she can do anything to us?\" A shiver ran down his spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little girl shouted to the sky, her fists pumping: \"Yeah, come on! Quit playing around and squash us already!\" Both adults covered her mouth, terrified, as crowds looked on in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gigantic fox giggled at the screams, rocking some of the less-sturdy buildings. \"Don't worry. I'm not going to crush you. Unless you really want me to~\" Her dazzling emerald eye sent a wink down to the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she pulled her left foot from its ballet flat, slipping each toe out tenderly over its topline, her nose wiggled gently in surprise. Her mouth made a clear \"^\" shape in the air, framed by her wavy maroon locks. \"Oh? My poor little pinky is sorta itchy... I must've caught a redwood in it!\" Each of her sharp claws scratched over it, sending a flurry of skin flakes and dirt over San Deigo - before a devious idea crept into her mind. Her hand swept over the city, fingers opening above the Symphony towers. \"Could I borrow this for a second, guys? Thanks! Yo~ink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that careless onomatopoeia, Vixen Vex uprooted the Symphony Towers. She rubbed the metal surface, along with anyone unlucky enough to still be within, against the underside of her pinky toe! They saw the tip overflowing on one end, and the ball of her foot like a mountain on the other; placing them right between the sweaty joints of the mega-sized digit. Her touch was careful enough to not break it; but the rubbing pressure strong enough that people below and within could hear a fierce rumble ringing out. Vixen brought her head up and sighed in relief, wavy hair crashing over her shoulders as she ground the great building into her soft, easily-receding flesh. Eventually, indeed, the building dislodged a massive tree from her wrinkles with a satisfying, swift squelch. It crashed down below with other bits of detritus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah, thank you! These skyscrapers are so tiny, but they made me feel so good! Maybe you should rename them to 'toescrapers'.\" She chuckled, placing it back down. The Symphony Towers were structurally intact - if cut off from all water and power. But along each window, a thin layer of perspiration and dirt coated them, showing off the work they'd been put to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVixen Vex shrugged, and flopped over onto her soft stomach, onto scarce spots of empty ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size3\" style=\"\">BOOM!</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer left foot thundered down, crashing right beside San Diego.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size3\" style=\"\">BOOOM.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n54 square miles of sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt lay upwards, taking in the rays, curling and uncurling - an unconscious act which sent tremors through the county. Some of her toes skirted the Mexican border as they flexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a little kick, the Goddess of California brought her right foot down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">BOOOOM.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrees blew away for miles from the force. Her footfall barely missed the other side of San Diego. Now, anyone within the city - from the tallest structures to the streets - could only see a gently-flexing peachy wall to their north and south; and a skirt out to the west.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVixen Vex splashed playfully in the water, creating great waves - which she blocked with her palm before they swept over the other islands. If she really tried, lying down with her soles surrounding San Diego, she's be able to brush Los Angeles with the tips of her fingers. \"Sorry to keep everyone waiting! My feet are ready for your love, everyone!\" Her toes created minor quakes as they brushed between the soft ground, digging new canyons out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, crowds began moving to her feet. Some were eager to greet their goddess, and finally get a touch of her sweet skin; others were simply trying to keep her from getting bored, and deciding to endanger the nation any more. City officials split volunteers in groups, re-routing trolleys, buses, and airplanes, and sending in more vehicles to take them  to the right spots. The flashing displays helpfully pointed tiny people to their destinations, such as: \"LEFT HEEL\"; \"RIGHT ARCH\", \"LEFT FOOT - MIDDLE TOE\", or \"RIGHT FOOT - BIG TOE\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough not everyone was willing or able to make the exodus, eager volunteers from across California flew in to replace them. The incident two years ago had left scars on the nation, and made \"California's Monster\" a figure of terror... But also left Vixen Vex with a \"tiny\" fanbase, who jumped at the chance to make her happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with not long of a wait at all, the welcoming sole nerves felt the rub of two million tiny hands. It was mild at first, only a tickle; but with time, she soon felt their little speck limbs earnestly kneading every little wrinkle and fold. \"Yes, just like that!\" She peeked over her wagging tail, to the tiny forms across her soles, scrunching them slightly as a gesture of approval. \"It's even better at 85 miles - you can get all the nooks and crannies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe businessman was hard at work pushing the skin around her left arc, and managed a small smile. \"It's so soft...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe store owner was deep in a wrinkle, doing the best she could. \"Can she really feel this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young girl blinked flatly at the sight of wiggling toes on the horizon. \"Is this some foot fetish thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth adults covered her mouth.</span></div></div>",

The young woman wiggled her toes within the comfortable footwear, each of her toes painted a deep black, identical to that of her fingernails, as she gently flicked a strand of hair away from her left eye, waking up the local populace in the process. Violet's magnificent form towered high above the city she had been raised in - the city that had caused her to become this monumental in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly about several months earlier was Violet an average-sized hybrid standing at 5'10\" tall; however, due to an unforeseen accident and subsequent explosion at the chemical laboratory at which she once worked, the girl's DNA was fundamentally altered, causing her to rapidly grow to her present height, in addition to no longer needing most of the basic human functions such as the need to breathe, eat, excrete, and sleep, as well as attaining unwavering homeostasis within her body, which would cause her to become ageless and even immortal. Luckily for her, the chemicals that had caused Violet to enlarge also had a similar effect on the clothing she wore on that day, allowing them to grow along with her expanding frame to keep her fully clothed; the outfit in question consisted of a tight black tube-shirt with a skull emblem on the front which exposed her bellybutton, cut along the top of the skull to reveal an ample amount of cleavage from her full C-cup breasts, a pair of snug black low rider pants which drew attention to her curvy legs and plump rear, and her aforementioned pair of matching gladiator sandals - she was quite grateful that the incident occurred on \"Casual Friday\". Upon realizing the transformation her body had undergone, the goth's mood was one of awe and contentment rather than fear and worry - Violet felt more relaxed and comfortable at her new height than she had ever been at her regular size; it simply felt more natural \u2013 almost right, even \u2013 to be a 65 mile giantess, and she instantly knew that she would never want to become smaller again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, the reaction of those within the city was that of standard chaos and fear, worried that this massive behemoth of a woman would crush their entire county in a single step. However, Violet almost immediately allayed their fears as she told them of her kind nature, despite her gothic appearance. With the destruction of the town's largest source of income, the laboratory, the titaness suggested a simple solution to once again make her hometown more prosperous: She would volunteer herself as the world's largest tourist attraction. The executives of the city quickly accepted Violet's offer and soon executed a worldwide marketing blitz about the gigantic fox-girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come see Violet, the goddess of our time!\" their advertisements proclaimed. \"Climb the mighty deity and show off to your friends that you've scaled the world's tallest being! Whisper a prayer at her feet and have your wildest dreams come true! Though she may be visible from space, there's nowhere else you can see her in person, so come visit the Goth Goddess today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few days, the campaign - combined with worldwide news coverage of the world's first 65 mile being - had worked beautifully; people from all corners of the Earth scrambled to take pictures of the titanic woman, to climb various segments of her body, and to worship her fervently as if she was an actual goddess. During this time, Violet merely smiled as she helped her city thrive once more by offering her body to bring in needed revenue - she had to admit to herself that growing larger was the best thing that had ever happened to her, and she occasionally did enjoy some of the prayers that tourists offered unto her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, months into her new life, Violet stretched her body in front of the city below her, blocking out the Sun with her extensive frame and bathing the city in a lesser wave of darkness with her shadow as she prepared for the new day ahead. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Debris cluttered every conceivable space. As far as the eye could see there was destruction and death. Entire buildings: now mere rubble. A small city with a population nearing two thousand: now in the double digits. Years of development and progress for so many lives, all wiped out in an instant. The few who survived looked up to the heavens with a single thought. <i>Why?</i> Their eyes met with the answer, covered with the blood and ruin of their once fair city. It was too big to fully comprehend, and when it came down a second time all life and all remaining signs of civilization were wiped out in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove there was the unmistakable sounds of a loud voice giggling, almost like the massacre was a game to her. Ruth stared down to her foot, wiggling her toes over the city she crushed in only two steps. Raising her sole her slender hand casually brushed off what looked like dirt, but of course it was all the destruction she just brought upon an unsuspecting town. The woman was aware that she just killed over a thousand lives, but she viewed it like most people view bugs: with little care. It was to be expected of course. She was a giantess standing at a whopping thousand miles tall, with feet encompassing several miles by themselves. It was inevitable for her to crush something. At first the lost lives scarred her, but once the effect was lost it struck Ruth that crushing stuff was an oddly satisfying stress relief. That was why this city was now gone, Ruth was doing it to relieve some stress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlayfully the pink-haired girl\u2019s toes dug into the dust that was once the city, grinding it into the dirt. From her perspective it was impossible to distinguish between the grayish-brown dirt and the grayish-brown dust she grinded from the buildings. Ruth was by no means a bad girl, in fact she was a genuinely sweet girl to anyone she cared about. But that was just it: people she cared about. Anyone else barely registered to her. There was no point in trying to befriend every ant around her so she simply stopped trying; it made things so much simpler. Of course once her occasional rampage on some poor city happened people were quick to disapprove, but what would they say to her? They were five feet tall, she was a thousand-miles tall. As such no one dared to ever cross Ruth, just how she liked it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrushing the small city was just the little bit of mindless violence she needed, the girl tossed a wink at the decayed city. \u201cThank you.\u201d She laughed as she kissed her finger then planted it on the dust that was once an entire city. Ruth rose back to her feet and casually brushed the dirt from her clothes. Her outfit of the day was a pair of tight, red-plaid shorts and a white tank top. Her feet, as usual, were bare. Given her size clothes were a bit hard to come by so it was only the necessities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot showing any second thoughts about her destruction, Ruth turned around and casually began walking around. Each step covered miles of terrain so she had to keep an eye out for small cities she might crush by accident. There was no need for unnecessary violence. Keeping that in mind Ruth walked, pondering what to do next. She intended for that little bit of stress relief to last at least a <i>few</i> minutes. Now she was bored, and needless to say her options were a bit limited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth took another step, her feet felt cold all of a sudden. A quick look down revealed a large lake her feet were submerged in. It brought goose bumps but at least her feet were clean now. She shrugged it off and saw a city nearby. It was big, much bigger than the city she just toyed with. This one actually deserved the title city. It went on for at least twenty miles in all directions and had to have housed over ten thousand people at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis will do nicely.\u201d Ruth grinned as an idea popped into her head.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the city a shadow loomed over all of it, an immense figure barely comprehendible: Ruth. But everyone knew it was her, nothing else came close to being that big. That\u2019s when they all froze. Why was Ruth, the giantess known for her cruelty when bored or upset, standing over their fair city? The answer came in the form of her left foot, raised over four miles of the city and dripping city block-sized water drops that clung to her feet from their lake. Ruth\u2019s toes wiggled as a chuckle echoed from her lips, \u201cPlease don\u2019t make this boring for me.\u201d There was no time for anyone to so much as turn and run, Ruth stomped her foot down, instantly destroying miles of land and thousands of lives in a maelstrom of devastating winds, seismic quakes off the scale, and debris the likes of which no one could ever conceive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that one single stomp everyone knew they were a part of Ruth\u2019s bored ploy to kill time. The beauty now seemed like death itself as she casually brought her other foot from the water and planted it beside her other one. More destruction and mayhem, and that was just from her casually laying the foot in place. Anyone who was left saw Ruth\u2019s feet above some of their largest buildings: well-kept, beautiful, soft, deadly. The city was a full 20 miles in diameter and in five seconds about five miles of that was wiped from the map, with a neighboring two miles destroyed just from the shockwave. The saddest part? Ruth was so big that she didn\u2019t even use her entire foot; they were each about 180 miles long. No this was just the ball of her foot and up, and half of that was still in the lake to minimalize damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth frowned, \u201cI better be more careful, if I take a few more steps this\u2019ll be done before I know it.\u201d The giantess took a single step; at her size such a motion brought her to the other edge of the city, just beyond its outskirts. Already there was an abundance of vehicles attempting to flee imminent death, Ruth saw these and laughed. \u201cThere is no escape.\u201d She teased as she knelt over and brought a single finger down on the roads. Her finger in itself was a 30-miles wide and over a 60-miles long. Just by touching them she destroyed over a dozen vehicles and created a three-hundred foot-deep hole between the city and salvation, if she decided to push she could make the hole well over a dozen mile deep. She did similarly to any neighboring roads; everyone was trapped at the giantess\u2019 mercy. Everyone who was so quick to retreat now had to look up at the looming beauty as she smirked down at the specks, \u201cI think I have a perfect game for you guys.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her fingernails Ruth dug up several large chunks of Earth and dumped them into her palm. After a handful of scoops in her hand laid well over a hundred vehicles (Not counting the ones crushed from her bringing them up there.) Smiling Ruth brought them up to eye level so they could all stare into her immense pupils. Some people abandoned their vehicles before they were crushed. Standing atop Ruth\u2019s palm their shoes seemed to almost slide against her skin. A few realized this was due to body oils, but most of them just looked to Ruth\u2019s face and were too scared to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sight of the people Ruth couldn\u2019t help but giggle. Even up close not one of the specks remotely resembled a person, and likewise with the people they couldn\u2019t even see far enough to her other eye. Ruth took a step back to the lake she started at. It was a lovely lake, big enough to fit both of her feet so it was much larger than the town. Ruth planted her knees on the ground, destroying so more things as she hovered her palm over the lake. \u201cI hope you can all swim!\u201d Without warning she tilted her palm over, allowing each and every person she collected plummet to the waters below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir screams and splashed were in audible to her as Ruth gleefully watched the little specks of dirt-sized people flail about in the water in panic. In the dead center of the lake there was no hope of swimming away. Ruth knew that, it was just her little playpen for them. Chuckling the woman placed a finger in the water and slowly began to churn it. In seconds a small vortex formed near the center of the lake and the people began to slide under the water and fight for air against the strong whirlpool bringing them under. After a minute or two Ruth let the whirlpool she made die down; half the specks that rose back up weren\u2019t moving. Those who survived frantically swam towards the shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis did not go unnoticed. \u201cTrying to leave again? Boy you guys just don\u2019t learn!\u201d Ruth frowned as she tried to come up with another creative activity. Unfortunately for the people, this water-based game was quickly losing its luster for the giantess. When she finally spoke again it was a shrug, \u201cYou know what, I think I\u2019m about done here anyway.\u201d The people wondered what that meant but when they heard swishing sounds from around Ruth\u2019s mouth they began to realize. Her spit sounded like a gunshot at its volume and it had much the same effect. Coming in at high speeds the impact alone killed most of the few who were left. Only a handful managed to live with a broken limb or two as they flailed in the spit pool she created. \u201cIf you guys get out of that then you can go.\u201d Ruth winked as she stood back to face the town. It was a death sentence, Ruth\u2019s spit was sticky and made moving nearly impossible. After having already been battered to death and survived against impossible odds the handful left had to accept their fate and drown in the teenage giantess\u2019 saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the city Ruth saw there was still a good three-fourths of it left. It lasted much longer than the last one she toyed with. Playfully she placed her left foot\u2019s toes vertically and began to walk them along the town. With each movement of the toes more and more death and destruction were caused. It was futile to even try and oppose death at this point. Once her toes couldn\u2019t go on without her moving Ruth brought her foot back. \u201cMy legs are kinda sore. I think I need to sit down\u2026\u201d She thought out loud purposely as her eyes darted back to a nice chunk of the city behind her. Once she sat down that was gone too, with a louder boom than her steps. To avoid destroying what little was left she sat with her legs up against her chest, damn near pushing her breasts from her thin shirt. Now less than half of this unknown city remained, and she was looking right at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat to do with you guys? Crush you with my feet? My hands? My butt? So many choices\u2026\u201d The little stretch of relatively intact civilization went on for about seven miles. A single stomp could do it, or her sitting down, or even a slap with her palm. It could all work, but there was one thing Ruth thought up that made her mind. Ever since she was born a giant she\u2019d destroyed cities. Years of it led to some creative ideas, and this one was by far her favorite. Wearing a mischievous smile Ruth began to lift her shirt up and slide it off, exposing the world to the two biggest breasts ever conceived. Two bordering D-cups contained within a tight crimson bra that barely held the two back. Both were a full hundred miles in diameter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth slid herself back and repositioned herself so she was resting on her own mammaries. The remained section of the city could only see the crimson coloring of her bra with pale-ish skin out in the distance. It was as if the blue sky had been blotted out by darkness, then turned to a dark red to foreshadow more doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth giggled, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll <i>love</i> this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth began to push her chest forward; slowly steamrolling over what little city was left. People were pushed into the immense softness of her supple breasts and deluded themselves that, for a moment, they would be fine. But the pressure of Ruth\u2019s breasts, no matter how soft they were, assured they died in a splatter of blood beneath her. Not even buildings could stand up to her chest as they crumbled to dust in seconds. The entire time Ruth kept on pushing, continuing the destruction until finally nothing was left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all was said and done Ruth stood back up and wiped her chest clean. Her eyes shined with an innocent joy. There was no cruelty in what she did. It was just a game to her, and she had fun. She grabbed her shirt she casually tossed aside and frowned. Part of it landed in the lake and was wet. \u201cAh well.\u201d She shrugged as she swung it over her shoulder; she could go without a shirt for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a lot of fun.\u201d Ruth smiled. In a familiar gesture she kissed her finger and planted it over the remains of the town, thanking them for entertaining her. But now that it was done, what could she do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sort of like a tingling that started at her feet and worked its way up through her body until her whole body seemed to feel the same way. Ruth\u2019s mind cleared instantly with it as a smile quickly came. Naturally of course, she was about to grow some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore such could happen however, the giantess scanned the landscape for any cities that may get crushed in her ascension. There was only one that caught her attention. With a couple steps she knelt over and gently dug the entire city from the ground with her fingers and cupped it in her palms. No doubt everyone in said city was scared she\u2019d crush them or eat them but no such luck. Ruth wasn\u2019t bored at the moment. Besides, two cities was enough for now. Gently Ruth walked for a couple minutes to a far enough place to be safe. With each second the growth she was trying to hold back screamed to come out. She may or may not have accidentally let a few inches slip by though. But the city was now back in the dirt and Ruth booked it back to where she was before. She wanted to head to water to be as safe as possible but there was no holding it anymore. She let it out at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body felt alive as the tingling turned to pure ecstasy. Something wanted out of her body and it was finally getting out. The relief of that feeling coupled with the euphoria of growth caused Ruth to echo across the planet with a loud moan. Her eyes shut but she felt the land slowly rub away to make way for her expanding feet. Ruth felt her clothes tighten against her body but not quite giving way. They were designed to grow with her but their growth didn\u2019t account for her body becoming more voluptuous with each expansion. Ruth\u2019s tiny little bra could barely hold back what she suspected was now Double D\u2019s. A part of Ruth enjoyed the idea of becoming more attractive with each piece of growth. She allowed her eyes to open just for a second to see how big her chest was now. Her jaw dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from her chest blocking her view of her own feet, the land was just\u2026nothing compared to her. The planet\u2019s curve was easily visible as were each of its continents. And her growth was not done yet. Ruth bent over to see the ground and could only see the entire area she thought to be safe barely accommodate her feet. Beside her big toe was her shirt she didn\u2019t put on in time for growth, now impossible to even wear. \u201cI better move before something bad happens.\u201d With a single step Ruth reached the ocean and let her growth finish. Two immense footprints were left into the ground and even that would soon be nothing. Ruth\u2019s grow began to subside with larger spurts. Before the giantess could adapt to one height, it was quickly dwarfed by the next one. The east coast was sized like the cities from before, then it was half the country. After a handful of spurts like that Ruth felt her body slowly return to normal. All she could feel was what could best be described as an awesome sense of awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe <i>entire</i> continent of North America was no bigger than the city she could walk around in five steps, five little steps mind you. Landscapes were hardly discernible; most of it seemed like varying colors of dirt. The ocean floor barely made Ruth\u2019s toes wet. Ruth couldn\u2019t even begin to comprehend how big she was, she just\u2026was. Curious, she bent over and examined what was once her shirt; it barely filled her palm now. She\u2019d lost clothes from growth before but something told her the entire planet couldn\u2019t make her a new shirt to cover herself. <i>Ah well, I\u2019m so big I doubt people could make out all of my chest anyway.</i> She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth scanned the land, taking in how small the world was now. If she chose she could probably vacate the planet, she obviously didn\u2019t have trouble breathing. It was an entertaining thought, but maybe later. Ruth\u2019s mind focused on a particular speck she recognized. It was the city she saved prior to her ascension, back then it was just big enough for both hands. Now? Ruth scraped the city back up with her finger nail. She brought it was close to her eyes as possible\u2026she couldn\u2019t see people. There was no seeing people, all she could make out were their largest buildings. She blinked in shock and saw several of the buildings topple over. With awe she realized the simple act of blinking her eyes created enough of a gust of wind to destroy skyscrapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI better put you down again before something happens.\u201d She whispered. Gently the giantess let the city slide from her nail back to where it was before in her old footprints. Rising back to her feet Ruth took it all in. The world practically fit in her hands now, and honestly? She liked it. She was still the same old girl, big or not. But now she just had the chance to try some new things like\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was only one thing Ruth wanted to do right now: play with her new size, and lucky for her there was one nice big playground called North America sitting right before her. It was kind of funny to think that what was before her was a tremendous portion of the planet, yet still so small. Almost curiously the giantess got on her knees to look closer. Just that simple act of adjusting herself in the water created cataclysmic level tidal waves ready to flood the east coast. Even this natural disaster moved at a snails pace in Ruth's eyes. A simple wave of her finger through the water easily dissipated the wave with no effort. Keeping that finger out, Ruth let it hover over the lands she just saved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many states are under here? One? Two? Three? Maybe even four. Just under a single finger.\" It didn't even register how small everything was. As far as Ruth could see, her finger was hovered over a patch of multi-colored dirt. But beneath it were no doubt several cities, millions of people, and dozens of significant land masses. All of that might as well have been specks of dirt in comparison to Ruth. She couldn't see them so they didn't seem like they were there. Even as she curiously lowered her finger further into the ground there was no feeling beneath it. Her mind knew she just caused an untold amount of damage, but her finger felt as if it was brushing through the ground. There was no feeling behind it, no sensation that was rewarding to the senses. But for whatever reason doing this was just the funnest thing Ruth had ever done to the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo call this around her a world was almost...laughable. The entire planet was no bigger than a small personal yard. People were no longer discernible from...anything. Even the great advances of human civilization were but specks in Ruth's eyes. A single step of her foot would be the single most powerful thing to ever exist. It was so...<i>empowering</i>. This level of power Ruth held over every living thing, this was on the level of a God. The thought was oddly titillating, Ruth found herself smiling at the idea of herself as a Goddess. Perhaps she could toy with the idea more later on. For now she just wanted to have some fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth brought her face up close beside her finger to some neighboring lands. It looked like small patch of moss but she knew it was an incredibly huge forest with cities built around key areas. Just to see what would happen Ruth opened her lips and blew. Immediately all of the green was ripped from the ground and cycloned through the air into the distance. \"Heh, that was kind of cool. I wonder how far it went?\" She had no idea as measurements lost all value now. A mile was what...the length of her toe nail? To her the trees flew no more than a foot, but how much was that? She didn't know, but it was probably in a different state now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all fun and stuff...But it's not the same without the human element.\" She frowned, then an idea came to mind. \"Wait! Maybe one of the bigger cities...\" She scanned the east coast until she came upon one of the most infamous cities in the world; New York. For all its splendor and grandeous size, it was but a speck half the size of one of Ruth's fingers. But the fact it could be seen at all was a true testament to how big it was. \"Yay I can see you! But you're all so small, I don't even think my pinky is that small.\" That started the giantess on trying to think of something appropriate in size to compare to the city, one thing came to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo any humans who saw Ruth they had no idea what she was doing. The sky was an immense tan that shuffled about in some form of incomprehensible movement. Though the motion was an everyday one. Everyone in New York watched as Ruth pulled back and did something. When she returned the sky was blotted out by a never ending expanse of skin again, with some kind of pink, wrinkly center. \"Oh my God you guys are even smaller than my nipple!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Ruth was poised with her chest looming over the city, exposed now for the world to see. Not that the world understood what it was seeing. To them it was a mountain attached to an incohesive form. The outer ridge was comprised of several small mountains in a perfect circle. Inside of that circle everything was pink. Immense canyons you could build towns in were little more than wrinkles in her nipple. Everyone was aware of what they were looking at. But even knowing what it was not a single person could see the resemblance. Ruth's breast didn't just hover over one state, it hovered over several. In fact it wouldn't be too far off to say that New York barely matched her nipple in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I lowered my chest right now you'd be...um...you'd be...\" Ruth struggled to find the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM!!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo instead she just slammed her other breast into the neighboring lands. They never stood a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one saw what Ruth just did, but they felt it. A quake echoed throughout the planet and they knew to be afraid. If she willed it, they too would meet that fate. Ruth knew this too and couldn't get rid of her smile, \"So what's stopping me hmm? Give me a reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way to answer of course, but their actions could prove something. \"You know what guys...? I think I figured out just what to do with you all.\"</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Yeah....so basically, this is the exact opposite of my other famous interactive, 'Your Life Smaller', which suffice to say, I am extremely grateful to Lelouch(he helped write most of it), and to all you readers out there. To quench your thirst for GTS, here's another interactive from moi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the story depends on which character you choose to be. Will you follow the tale of a kind giantess, or a destroyer of worlds? You decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world, since the giantess was born, has accustomed to her. No matter what size she is, most of the planet either has a neutral or kind disposition towards her. Even the most successful business companies have pitched in to generate clothing, food, and shelter for one such as her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Heights To Choose From</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<b>Amazon</b><br>\r\n-Your giantess is 12-20ft. in height. Has trouble fitting into most small buildings. Most people are only knee height to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<b>Average</b><br>\r\n-Size ranges from 50-100ft. in size. An average home reachers her shin. People are like toys, barely the size of her thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<b>Big</b><br>\r\n-She's 500-1000ft. tall. She's easily a head, or even a whole torso taller than most skyscrapers. Normal people have become ants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<b>Mega</b><br>\r\n-Now we're getting up there. Your giantess's size scales on a 50-100 mile tall frame, most of a city's skyline and countryside dominated by her toes alone. People are mere dust specks now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<b>Giga</b><br>\r\n-Here we go. One of the biggest sizes around. Easily going from 500 miles....to infinity. This giantess is vast on a grand cosmic scale, and beyond. People are insignifigant, nothing, microscopic germs to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Main Characters</b></u><br>\r\nWho will you choose to be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Molly Ethans<br>\r\nAge: 17<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nPersonality: Quite shy and anti-social. Whatever size is chosen, Molly will try to be the kindest giantess she could be, trying to prevent as much damage as possible.<br>\r\nAppearance: Molly is....hard to describe. In a social click setting, she's an 'Anti Goth' Goth. She's dyed her short feathered hair a stunning bright orange, and wears an ensemble of an orange tank top, which covers her C-cups nicely, black leather belts and leather bands all up her arms, a tight black plaid skirt, and knee-high black boots with large treads and orange lacings. All of this compliments her pale skin nicely, but doesn't match her sweet personality.<br>\r\n(Molly is originally a character from Awesomex18)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Vera Cartington<br>\r\nAge: 20<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nPersonality: As snobbish and bitchy as a girl could get. Her size, along with having the richest daddy in the world, has corrupted her perception of everything around her, seeing everything as inferior and unworthy. Whatever size chosen, if Vera doesn't get her way, a rampage is bound to happen, and people let it happen and pray she doesn't come their way. Because of Joseph Cartington's(Vera's father) money and influence, nobody thinks to stop her.<br>\r\nAppearance: Slender frame outlined by golden tanned skin, crisp blonde hair that goes down her back, a pouty face that decieves her intentions. Usually wears sweaters of the finest silks which enunciates her massive chest, Bordering F cup, along with  tight blue jeans and matching flip-flops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Jasmine 'Jaz' Truitt<br>\r\nAge: 16<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nPersonality: In your face, rude, and to the point, is what describes Jaz. Despite this, she's a rather nice girl, if not a bit loud. Whichever size is chosen for her, Jaz will be a nice giantess, if not a tad mischievious.<br>\r\nAppearance: Dark, cocoa brown skin, black hair cut to her shoulder, a nice face with glasses. Wears normal short-sleeve t-shirts of black or white with jeans and converse shoes. Makes up for her average attire with D, bordering DD cup breasts and a butt to die for.<br>\r\n(Jaz originally is a character from here: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1564499-Cheating-Death\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1564499-Cheating-Death</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Rules</b></u><br>\r\nFollow Them. All of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Basically, all of the rules in my other interactives. If you don't breach any of them, it'll be okay.</td>",
