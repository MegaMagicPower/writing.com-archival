Today was another day at school... not that you actually learned anything as most of your time was spent as someones cushion, insole or just as a big stain somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly pushed yourself up, feeling as if your arms would squish from that alone and slouched over to your dresser. Your clothes had been especially made to survive your condition being made of almost the same material you had become. Someone would have to deliberately rip them off for you to lose them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard your roommates still sleeping - you had to leave earlier to avoid being squished by someone, be it by accident or not - as you slowly got dressed in some plain clothes, a black shirt with some unreadable logo, as well as shorts and some plain socks. You looked in the mirror, seeing your long, blond hair, which somehow seemed to have survived everything so far. Slowly walking out into the living room you quickly are breakfast, some off-brand cereal, brushed your teeth, put your shoes on and left for school, hoping that nobody was waiting for you.</span></div></div>",

Ivy was the head of the science club and probably the smartest person in the school. As such she was fascinated with your condition, becoming your friend and conducting test after test on you, most of which were voluntary. Only a few were done under heavy protesting and usually took days or weeks to complete... like the one time she cut you in half and stuffed you into her sneakers for a month, just to see how that would affect you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked her other, mainly to check if she was carrying sedative, seeing her comically huge labcoat, her white shirt and her jeans behind it, her feet in those dreaded sneakers. She had brown hair that went to her shoulders and had a smile that could kill... literally, as she almost swallowed you during a test because she smiled, once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Sam!\", she greeted you, her voice sweet as honey, a telltale sign that she had been waiting just for you. Mentally preparing for whatever test she had in store for you, you replied with a simple \"Hi\", hoping to shut her down right there. You didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Sam! I'm sure you won't mind helping me with a little experiment, being early and all, right~?\", she asked, knowing you couldn't really say no, anyways... nobody ever could Ivy just seemed to have that kind of aura... and even if you did, you couldn't stop her. \"Uhh, sure? What kind?\" you asked sheepishly, hoping it'd be just some simple thing like holding something for her. \"Well, I wanted...\"</span></div></div>",

Yet you continued to go through life, enduring lots and lots of hardship in school, eventually managed to get a job only to later become a superhero...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you didn't know is that there were countless other universes, one for each encounter... and every encounter could've ended your life in some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, rules!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Water Sports, and basically any vore that doesn't involve eating is forbidden.<br>\r\n2. 18+ is allowed, unless it's \"forced\" or only focuses on it.<br>\r\n3. Try to write in a way that doesn't give people a headache...<br>\r\n4. I reserve the right to delete or change anything that doesn't make sense and doesn't fit with previous chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory wise:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. You're not tiny... yet. You're actually a bit bigger than most people, though that can quickly change. From science to magic to just having parts of your body removed... as long as it's explained, it goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. You're gummy-like. Meaning you can be squished, stretched, cut, molten, formed, etc. There might also be a way for people to harden your body solid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. You can turn out to love being abused, hate it or not minding it. Once again, as long as you give a reason, it goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. You didn't receive any other powers. You're gummy for better or worse, but you never got anything else. You can still get someone during a story-line, but not before that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can make up your own characters or simply choose one of a few premade ones I'll add over time(Nothing after this, if you don't care, you can skip)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Ema Pobra<br>\r\nQuite oblivious and easy to entertain. She has long, red hair, is quite well-developed and dresses casually (Sneakers, t-shirts, etc.).<br>\r\nShe's been Sam's roommate throughout Sam's life and often got her into some unaware disasters, though they always love about it in the end</td>",
