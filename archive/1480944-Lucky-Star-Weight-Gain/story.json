The rest of her family were out for the weekend on a small trip, originally all of them were to go but Tsukaksa declined as she just wanted to stay home this weekend, and while saddened by this a bit, the rest of them were okay with it. \"Oh it so odd to be all alone here, I'm not used to such quietness, it is nice though, Tsukasa said to herself as she was mixing the cookie dough in a plastic bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe batch that Tsukasa was currently working was Japanese Almond Cookies, because she planned on having plenty for her whole family to have when they came back she had made around 100 cookies, lucky for her the bakery close by was having a large sale on the ingredients and had plenty in stock.( Yeah I know its an ass pull, spare me.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the klutzy girl had near finished the last batch, she decided to do something she only rarely did when everyone else was around, Tsukasa then stuck her fingers into the bowl and swiped up the unused dough and put nito her mouth. \"Mmmh! Hehe! it tastes so good!\" Tsukasa giggled as she was taking part in a somewhat childish act of eating. \"Hmm... Thats odd, this tastes a lot better than it normally does, I wonder what the people at the bakery did to it to make it so good.\" she said as she wondered as she continued to lick form the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd better make sure to go thank the workers there later!\". After finishing what was left in the bowl Tsukasa then decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Mhhmm... that cookie dough was good, I'm sure having a few of these cookies here won't be any trouble.\" The klutzy girl then took five cookies from the eighty she had already made,put them onto a plate, and went into the living room,turned on the tv. Tsukasa then realized how odd it was watching the game show that was currently on without her family. \"Oh, it's so strange watching this show without everyone around, so quiet.\" Tsukasa then took a bite out of one of the almond cookies she had gotten, upon consumption, her face lit up with a blissful smile. \"Ohhh, this is even better than the dough!\" Tsukasa then, in a quite unlady-like manner took the remaining four cookies on her plate, and gobbled them down in a hasty manner. \"Mmhhmmm! These are soooo good!\", Tsukasa said savoring the taste she had just gotten moments, showed by her cupping her cheeks in her hands and licking her lips. Being the forgetful girl that she was, Kagami's sister reached down and grabbed for an extra cookie, until she realized she was grabbing at nothing. \"Huh? Oh, there's no more.\" She looked down disheartedly at the now bare plate, but as she did this she got an idea. Tsukasas shifted her eyes towards the kitchen, where there were plenty more of the delicious cookies she had just eaten. \"Mhhmhh... I can't eat anymore than that right now, those are all for mom, dad, Inori, Matsuri, Kagami, and me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukasa then thought over her options of either going into the kitchen and eating more cookies or following her sweet,caring plan of giving her family a nice treat when they got back, but to no avail, she inevitably gave into her temptations for more tasty cookies. \"Oh, I know I shouldn't but...it's not like they know I'm making these.\"  Tsukasa said in her defense. She then took 20 cookies off of the tray of 80, and in an amount of time that would shock even Konata, Tsukasa had swallowed down all the cookies in just under 40 seconds. \"Ohh, that was wondrous!\" Tsukasa oblivious to how she had just eaten the treats, was reminiscing on the taste they had given her. Then, out of nowhere something happened, something the purple haired girl thought she... would never do. Tsukasa let out a huge belch. \"BBBUUURRRPPP!!!\" Right after this,Tsukasa had her hands held up in complete shock and appall, her mouth wide open from what she had just done. It took Tsukasa at least 5 seconds to regain her composure and actually say something once more. \"Ah...ah...oh my gosh! Wa-was that me?!\" the frantic girl said in a panic,blushing heavily,despite the fact that no one had heard her beside herself. As she thought about the very strange act she had done, a rhythimic,high pitched beeping disturbed her thoughts. \"Ohh! The last batch is done!\" Tsukasa hastily ran to the oven to take the cookies out, and while she was doing this she once agian thought about her...burp from earlier. \"Hmmm...maybe I shouldn't be so flustered about it, I mean I am the only one here right now, plus it was only one burp, nothing to worry about.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Tsukasa noticed her light blue shirt riding up on her belly, which was because there was now a small layer of flab on her belly. It was noticeable enough to where a bit of skin was showing beneath her garment. \"What the?! How did this happen?! This shirt fit me perfectly just a minute ago!\" Try as she might, she was unable to pull her shirt down over her bigger stomach. \"Oh, it's no use, *sigh* I guess I'll just leave it like this.\" At that moment the phone rang,startling the girl slightly, getting over to the phone she answered who was calling. \"Hiiragi household, who is speaking?\"  </span></div></div>",

She was grateful Konata wasn't here to see the state she was in. Now THAT would be humiliating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I just baked a few cakes for Yukata's birthday, but the problem is she's sick and we're postponing the party. Problem is we have all these cakes that we can't eat, so, uh, would ya mind maybe takin' a few of them off our hands?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukasa ran her hands over her belly. She didn't get how that was there, but she knew eating cakes wouldn't solve her problems anytime soon. Her wrists were starting to disappear under a thin layer of flab, she noticed to her anxiety. Her hips were getting wider, pressing against the limitations of her panties. Still, it would be rude to not accept such a generous gift. \"Uh, okay, sure, why--?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knocking sound at the door that interrupted Tsukasa's train of thought. She ran over to the door, anxiously, as she glanced nervously through the keyhole. There, standing on the front porch, was Konata, talking into the cell phone! \"Okay, cool, can ya open up?\" Konata said into the cell phone, which resulted in Tsukasa hearing the message both in her ear and through the keyhole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, okay,\" Tsukasa replied, opening the door up. Konata was standing there with a wheelbarrow behind her, a wheelbarrow she dragged into the house, filled with four rather large cakes all piled on top of one another, separated by cardboard. \"Wouldn't that smear the icing?\" Tsukasa asked, nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, probably, but I'm sure it'll taste as good,\" Konata replied, lazily tossing off her shoes as she walked in, rolling her pink little toes in the carpet. The young girl stretched, her shirt pulling up over her belly. Tsukasa couldn't help but notice a slight ring of flesh folding over the lips of her jeans, a ring that lead Tsukasa to notice Konata's slightly rounded belly, her thicker thighs, her wider hips, her breasts, which actually existed now, along with her knuckles that had been swallowed up in flesh. While not chubby, barely even thick, Konata was a little...bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want some?\" Konata replied, drawing Tsukasa out of her day dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata set the ice cream cakes in the refrigerator. As she bent over, her butt pulled against the seams of her seat, and Tsukasa watched as the threads threatened to snap alongside her butt crack. Oh how succulent her buns looked, puffy and soft. Tsukasa couldn't help but hold her breath. Was the seam going to snap? Would it stay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Tsukasa, I appreciate the fact my butt looks nice, but what's with the staring? You haven't started playing for the other team, have you?\" Konata asked, smirking so her dimples (she had dimples?!) shone through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh--!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, do you wanna eat some of the cake? I'm kinda hungry,\" Konata replied, scratching her softer belly by pulling up her shirt, revealing her blubbery softness. Tsukasa felt anxiety run through her. Just what the hell was going on!?</span></div></div>",

But then she looked at the cake, it looked positively delicious, she licked her lips as she gazed at it, it was very kind of Konata to bring these around, and it would be very rude to decline her friends more than generous offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 sure, I guess I\u2019ll take a slice or two\u2026\u201d She said as she was lent in to take a slice, only to be pushed back gently by Konata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe~ how about you just sit there and I\u2019ll do the work, ok?\u201d the blue haired otaku said as she picked up a small slice of cake and held it in front of Tsukasa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay \u2018ahh~\u2019\u201d Konata teased, Tsukasa couldn\u2019t help but blush slightly as she opened her mouth and allowed her short, blue haired friend to feed her a slice of cake, a small one, but Konata knew that Tsukasa wouldn\u2019t be able to handle a large portion of cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukasa swallowed the slice of cake, and before she could say anything to Konata, she noticed that Konata already had another slice of cake waiting for her, Tsukasa was already feeling full, but she couldn\u2019t help but enjoy the sensation of being fed like that, although insanely embarrassing and a bit childish, she sort of felt like a princess being fed like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate the second slice of cake; she could feel her stomach getting slightly bigger and flabbier, her panties started to dig into her more, and she just started to feel softer all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata slyly smiled at her with her trademark catlike smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe got tons of cake left, if we actually wanna get rid of these we better get to work\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She felt in heaven, the delicious taste of all the cakes, the sensual touch of Konata's soft hand against her belly, and the fact that she was being fed and rubbed by such a beautiful chubby girl. Tsukasa was in bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours passed as she ate more and more, her body expanding slowly with each bite until finally she was unable to eat another bite.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Konata was sleeping next to Tsukasa. The flustered twin leaped to her feet, eyes wide and flustered. What happened last night? She vaguely remembered stuffing herself silly, and, as she rested trembling hands over her paunch, she realized the damage, no doubt, had been done to her body. Indeed, her belly and breasts were now filled with pillowy flesh. Neither sagged too much yet, but the weight of the two orbs of flesh was great enough to throw off Tsukasa's center of balance. She tumbled backward, landing on her soft, pillowy butt. She threw her hand out to catch herself, but her pudgy wrist bent at an awkward angle. The sharp pain surging throughout her joint forced Tsukasa to cry out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata rose from her bed at the sound of the shrill shriek. Her eyes were awake yet asleep, dreary yet aware. The sounds of screams had roused her from slumber. As she rolled out of bed, quite literally bouncing off of the floor after tumbling off the edge of the mattress, Konata darted toward Tsukasa, hands outstretched for her. \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I--\" Tsukasa began, only to be distracted. Konata was pretty plump. In fact, she was perhaps a little meatier than she was. She stared in awe at this strange sight, cocking her head in confusion. \"Konata, when did you--I mean--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is it your wrist? Did ya sprain it?\" Konata asked, smirking. Why was she grinning like that? It gave Tsukasa the creeps in a rather bad way, as though Konta was scheming something that involved Tsukasa in a rather awkward way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I think I might. Can you call the hospital or--?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, in a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, why rush these things? Do ya really wanna get a shot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they wouldn't give a shot if I had a sprained wrist, would they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I wasn't talking about the wrist. I was talking about the weight that sprained it. You sure are a butter ball!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, so are you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did this happen?

Just like Konata's usual day, she was playing video games extensively, only she was incredibly obese at 200 kg., pausing every half-minute to stuff a fistful of junk food in her mouth. However, Konata eventually started getting thirsty, and only saw one drink in her room, and that was the energy drink she had been buying recently. Konata reached over and grabbed the drink, and started gulping it down as fast as she could, but the drink never ran out. No matter how much Konata drank, she was still just as thirsty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each sip she took, Konata bloated more and more. She kept drinking in hope that her thirst would eventually be quenched, but it never was. Konata drank the energy drink until her weight had doubled and still continued to drink. It continued throughout the entire dream; Konata drank the never ending energy drink, it never made her any less thirsty so she drank more, and drinking it just made her even fatter. Konata had blimped to 1000 kg. before the seemingly infinite energy drink was finally empty. Her fat had spread all across her bedroom floor and had knocked over all the junk food she had arranged in front of her. Konata was too obese to move anymore, so all she could do was keep playing her video game with the controller she using before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Konata finally woke up from her weird dream, she turned her head and saw the energy drink she had last night.

As she came near the area area of stores where she bought her usual games and manga from, Konata saw a food stand that was selling several types of pocky, except there were at an astounding price of only 200 yen! ( a/n I'm not sure how much pocky is but I assume its not this low, so this what I'm putting it at,)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" Konata shouted as she ran up to the stand. \"Oh hello there! What can do I for you little girl?\" the vendor said, who was a young woman in her early twenties. I'd like some of your pocky please miss!\" Konata said drooling slightly from the mouth at the low price of such a sweet treat. \"And by the way I'm eighteen.\" she staed to the vendor girl. \"Ah! My apoligies miss!\" the young woman said in regards to her assumption. \"Well what kind you want?\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata then looked at the various flavors of pocky, chocolate, strawberry, almond. honey, kiwifruit mango, she even saw the regional flavors like grape, y\u016bbari melon, giant mikan, powdered tea azuki bean, Kobe wine,  and five-fusion berry, There were also flavors like banana, coffee, caramel, marble royal milk tea, melon, milk, honey and milk, choco banana, cream cheese, berry, sweet potato, coconut, crush, pineapple, pumpkin, hazelnut, black sesame, soy bean, marron, Brazilian pudding, mikan, blueberry, apple yogurt, and green tea. \"So many flavors ahhh!\" Konata said in bliss at just how many flavors of the treat there was at this stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I'll take two chocolates, one blueberry, three strawberries, one grape, two honeys, and... one green tea.\" \"Okay miss!\" The woman grabbed the boxes of pocky and gave them to the excited otaku. As Konata had given up all her remaining money she heard the woman say something to her, \"Oh miss! be sure to... but unfortunately at that moment Konata had become too engrossed at the amount of pocky she had just obtained with such a small amount of money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I wonder that vendor was going tell me, oh well I'll go tomorrow after school and ask her.

Making a mental note to go back to the store after school and ask what the store keeper was going to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Konata woke up to find she had gained about 3 more pounds, it wasn't really noticable at all, but she could see the minor change when she got up and went to the shower. Konata now stood naked in front of the mirror for the first time in a while, now seeing just how much weight she had gained.<br>\r\nIt was indeed a small amount, but to her small frame it looked like more. Her normally tonned body was now soft with a small belly on it, her flat chest, hips, waist and butt had also developed a tiny layer of fat, it wasn't much but it ment now she wasn't like an ironing board, she actually had a slight shape to her.<br>\r\nKonata looked in the mirror and cupped her small breasts, until recently nothing had been there but now there they were. She ran her hands down her back and felt that it had to go over her butt. She had never had to do that before and she became quite excited.<br>\r\nKonata showered energetically as she explored her now slightly softer body, wondering that if she let herself get any bigger would her breasts become bigger and her body more 'volumptious', and then finally she could become the sexy woman from a dating sim rather than the manditory loli character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter showering Konata got dressed into her school uniform, it fit snugly on her even though it had been a little loose before. It was not tight or loose now but it infact fit her perfectly, unlike before. After getting dressed she cheerfully went downstairs to get breakfast, she decided not to eat too much, only as much as her belly demanded. In the end however that turned out to be quite alot. She infact missed the train to school since she took so long eating too many portions of breakfast, and had to take a later one, by the time she got to school she had gained another 1 pound, on top of the 1 pound she gained whilst showering and getting dressed. After getting off the train she quickly went to meet up with her friends so she can tell them about her gain and her new 'curvy' figure...</span></div></div>",

She rubbed the sleep away from her slightly parted eyes as she approached the mirror, lumbering over, her slight layer of blubber trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked in the mirror before her, Konata realized, in a second, she really hadn't gained a lot from one quick snack. Sure, she was now somewhat chubby, but she didn't look nearly as spherical as she had imagined she would. Her pants tightly dug into her belly, despite it being mere underwear. She played with her stomach in her pudgy fingered hands, her fingers slightly thicker than usual, her breasts (she had breasts now?) poking through her shirt. As she searched for clothing to fit her, noticing with surprise, and mild pleasure, that her uniforms were tightly pulled against her skin, she appreciated all the nuances of her new body type. There was a certain tremble, a certain quiver, to her flesh that hadn't existed before. At the present time, she wasn't sure whether this development as a good or bad thing. All she knew was that it was here, present, and, for all intents and purposes, interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went down to breakfast, noticing that her father had his lolicon eyes focused on her cousin Yukata. That was something of a relief: it made Konata explaining her new found weight less awkward. She ate a relatively small breakfast as not to bring too much attention to her wider hips or rounder face. She hurried off to the train, only to run into, upon arrival, both Kagami and Tsukasa. Thankfully, as it was winter, Konata's flab was hidden under a jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made the reveal all the more dramatic at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, what's up?\" Kagami asked, her eyes narrowed suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Konata asked, smirking in an unassuming manor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, we know your little game by now,\" Kagami replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do?\" Tsukasa asked, confused, clearly frantically asking herself if she was truly as oblivious as they all said she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whenever you have that look on your face you're planning on doin' somethin' strange! So just say it already! Let us know. You didn't get arrested for lookin' up some weird hentai, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not exactly,\" replied Konata, lazily as usual, \"Just found something out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found what out? Huh?!\" Kagami inquired, drawing nearer as the trio entered the train. \"Wait, ya know what, don't answer that. Probably some anime thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, not at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not related to it in the least?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, anime watching might of contributed to this development, but I don't think it's directly responsible, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what is--?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Konata, did you gain weight?\" Tsukasa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence as the two other girls stared at the usually oblivious one. Tsukasa's face filled with blush as she lowered her head in shame, her eyes averted from the others. Kagami sighed at this, \"Usually I'd say that's bad manors, but when it comes to Konata, you don't need to be bashful seein' as she has no qualms asking the same about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that was the big secret,\" Konata mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was WHAT?!\" Kagami rounded on Konata, an astonished, horrified expression in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but now that she spoiled it, now all that build-up I planned on makin', all the excitement, it's all gone. Kaput...ah well...\" Konata frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry!\" Tsukasa stammered, lowering her head deeper in shame as her face grew redder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't apologize! She's the freak here!\" Kagami stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Kagami, don't get so flustered. Ya know you wanna join me,\" Konata replied, pressing her now present breasts up against Kagami's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I don't--since when do you have boobs, anyway!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I started drinking a few too many energy drinks is all,\" Konata replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least you got lemonade out of lemons...\" Kagami mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we make a lemon out of this train ride, hmmm?\" Konata hummed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tough luck, otaku!\" Kagami grunted, her eyes narrowed.</span></div></div>",

Because she actually looks good with the weight she gained? ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds like you are Jealous\" Konata's playful voice cooed from behind her as she lent over and pressed her chubby body against Kagami \"why are you resisting so much.

But why deny yourself the chance for something amazing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami blushed brightly as she now realised that Tsukasa must have been in on it to help Konata convince her to gain, she gave a deep sigh and closed her eyes. \"Fine, you both win.

If i gain 10lbs and hate it then I am stopping and going straight on a diet.\" she said with some determination<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"that's fine\" Konata cooed \"you'll have such a great time you wont ever want to go back.

Kagami asked herself. 'I have been half my life struggling, watching what I eat, resisting temptation, to keep my body fit and thin, and as attractive as possible, and now I'm going to throw it all off the window because Konata says it feels nice?' Kagami directed her eyes to the little bluenette standing in line.\"It's nice, she says... She certainly doesn't look bad with a couple extra pounds...

I can't have just sweets for lunch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you can! My first choice was fifty percent junk food, and fifty percent sweets; but since I it's your first day, I decided to make it easy for you, and i know the tastes of my Kagamin.\" Konata explained with a smile forming dimples on her plump cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami looked at the mountain of food in front of her, and swallowed again.'She really does know my tastes... Ohhh, those are chocolate cakes, my favourite! Okay, it's only only going to be ten pounds, and if I'm going to do this, I'm going to do it right and enjoy it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the food!\" Kagami exclaimed, and eagerly dug into the food, grabbing brownies, cookies, cakes, and other sweets with both  of her hands, glomping them with one bite each, filling her mouth and leaving small traces of food on her lips and cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-onee-chan!\" Exclaimed Tsukasa, a bit alarmed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe!

Konata seemed so eager, so delighted, to ruin the months, no, years she had spent perfecting her body. All that hard work, all that devotion, to be obliterated in a matter of minutes thanks to one blue haired brat's insisting. It's great to gain weight she says! You'll love not having worry about you eat she says.  Sometimes that girl could be so damn pushy about the stupidest and most random of topics. Maybe it was the otaku in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata ran to the table, or as fast as the once great athlete could considering the layer of flub that had grown over her body, her thick, plump digits holding the plates of food, her knuckles dimpling into one another as she plopped Kagami's dessert laden dish in front of her. At once, Kagami's mouth watered, but letting Konata catch wind of the fact that she likes the food in front of her would mean she wins. Kagami could not allow that to happen. She pushed the plate away, her nose raised in disapproval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dessert for lunch? I can't eat that sugary crap this early,\" Kagami replied, waving the food off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you said--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that,\" Kagami stammered, turning to face Konata shoving a chocolate comet into her mouth, sucking the chocolate out from within, a goofy grin on her lips. Only Konata could look cute doing tha--WHAT THE HELL WAS SHE THINKING!?!?!? She ran her hands hastily through her hair, roughing it up a bit before turning toward the dessert, sighing, and tucking into the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe initial sensation through her mouth was that the first item she tasted, a cake was a fairly decent specimen. She's had better, but it wasn't so bad. The second bite gave her the same impression, and, once the cake slice was completed, she felt relatively satisfied. However, once she started on the cookies, she started to feel a tad nauseated from the cake. Then she tried the marshmellows coated in chocolate, then the brownies, and then the cupcakes, the chocolate comet, and, to her surprise, a cannoli.  She didn't know the school sold that here. Needless to say, after the binge, Kagami tenderly rubbed her distented belly, feeling a distinct urge to vomit out the sugary crap she had just inhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how was it? Wasn't it such a release?\" Konata asked, tucking her pudgy fingers under her doughy slight double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky if I don't release all over you.\"</span></div></div>",

However she couldn't help but feel a bit happy about this lazy and carefree lifestyle, to not constantly diet and worry about her weight, and with Konata doing the same thing but constantly being larger than her, she felt a bit at ease about her slight gain.<br>\r\nDuring this time Kagami's normally flat stomach had become slightly softer and, as Konata says, 'cuter'. <br>\r\nShe looked at herself in the mirror standing in her underwear with Konata behind her in her underwear as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"jeeze Konata, look how fat i've gotten over this weekend alone\" Kagami complained<br>\r\n\"ahh come on, you look great\" she smiled happily and squeezed Kagami's soft tummy<br>\r\n\"hey!\" Kagami replied angrily and knocked Konata away \"since when were you gay?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not gay\" Konata pouted \"I'm being playful\"<br>\r\n\"yeah well go be playful elsewhere\" Kagami said as she was blushing somewhat \"it's bad enough you're fattening me up\"<br>\r\n\"me fattening you up?\" Konata said surprised \"yesterday you fed yourself, happy not to care about your weight and become a lazy ball of fat\"<br>\r\nKagami blushed even brighter and walked off \"whatever...we need to get changed and ready for school, we've spent the whole weekend lazing around eating all day long but we are not going to start skipping school\"<br>\r\n\"aww alright\" Konata pouted as she looked at her chubby belly in the mirror and smiled \"you will love it when you get as big as me Kagami, it feels great!\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sure it does\" Kagami smiled softly as she looked over her shoulder at Konata and smiled softly as she started to get ready.</span></div></div>",

She grinned, her cheeks dimpling, as Kagami stared in awe, her head cocked in confusion.  Clearly she wasn\u2019t used to seeing large mounds of circular delight packed onto places, smothered in delicious syrup before.  Or perhaps she was in awe that someone made them breakfast in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Konata, this isn\u2019t another one of your crazy schemes, is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I honestly didn\u2019t make this, but I ain\u2019t complainin\u2019!\u201d Konata laughed, diving toward the pancakes with a fork placed carefully next to her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that the duo saw the guilty party who had made them this delightful treat: Tsukasa, who was washing the silverware responsible for the meal while helping herself to a couple  pancakes, a smile on her lips.  She turned toward the others, cocking her head slightly. \u201cWell, I just figured you\u2019d want a few pancakes is all.  Do you like them?  It\u2019s my first time making them, and I\u2019m so afraid I put too much flour in them, so I put in some extra syrup so you wouldn\u2019t notice. Sorry if I messed it up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata shoveled the pancakes into her mouth, tasting not so much the wheat-filled pancakes so much as the syrup that coated it. \u201cMMMM\u2014good stuff\u2014MMMM!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami was more restrained, eating it carefully, chewing slowly so she could actually taste the food she was eating.  She turned toward Tsukasa, frowning slightly. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s way too dry.  Next time I\u2019ll help you out with the pancakes, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, okay. I know I\u2019m just not great at it,\u201d Tsukasa laughed, awkwardly scratching the back of her head as her soft cheeks turned scarlet.  She smothered her own pancakes with so much butter the bottom of the plate strongly resembled a stew, before tucking into her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the supply of pancakes was exhausted, and the trio went off to school, where they ended up spending yet another boring day, wasting time learning formulas they\u2019d never use, historical facts that might not help all too much, etc. Kagami was treated to hearing Konata rant on about the injustice of how baseball tended to cut into anime, and even more sexual harassment than she was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus was life.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was surprising how plump she had grown after just a month.  Sure, she wasn't technically obese, or at least Kagami didn't believe she had reached that point just yet, but she sure was chubby. Her plump belly jiggling in front of her as she walked onward, her breasts bouncing with every movement as her wide hips swayed to and fro, shifting with each step of her thick thighs and calves.  Never had Konata been so oversized, and yet, at the same time, kinda cute--WHAT WAS WITH HER!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami sighed, resting her now knuckleless hands on her own pot belly.  Konata had grown quite plump these past few weeks, but Kagami was in no position to tease her about her weight.  She too had skyrocketed in pant sizes after all this indulgence.  She prodded her soft derriere with a finger, pinched the flesh of her belly with her own tender digits, an even stretched slightly, arching her back over so her stomach flesh stretched out, preferably returning to that familiar lithe figure she had so long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami had claimed she'd stop after only ten pounds, but it was evidential that hadn't turned out too true. What was it about Konata that could  convince a girl to sacrifice her body for HER pleasures? It was so odd, but she almost enjoyed this lazed lifestyle.  All Konata did was put food under her nose and put on an anime, which meant that Kagami wasn't just becoming chubby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was becoming a chubby otaku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, the irony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kagami!

It seemed pretty easy, she only had to stop eating sweets and different snacks, and jog for about half an hour, maybe a bit more, everyday. That way, she would return to her former self in no time. After all, it she only had been lazying around and pigging out for a month or so, her life-long costumes should overcome these new habits. Oh boy was she wrong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very next day, sunday, Kagami had a small breakfast, although she still felt a hole in her stomach. Kagami put on her tigh sweatpants, that constricted her waist, and made her potbelly hang a little over the elastic band and a t-shirt that allowed her belly to poke out from under it. She poked her soft mid-section with one of her pudgey fingers, and saw it sink almost two full inches in her flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami looked disgusted,\"Ugh, you'll be gone before I can realize it.\" She began her jogging, her chubby body jiggling with each step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Kagami was about to realize her plan wasn't so perfect as she thought. The extra weight and a month of almost no exercise was making her jogging much harder than she had expected, and in little more than five minutes, she found herself unable to take one step more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puff, puff... I-think, I'll... call it a day.\" And with that, she headed home, walking, of course, and not before resting for about five minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami arrived home, and went to take a shower. She felt the warm water soaking her plump body and the exhaustion melting away. Kagami put on her pj's, that like most her clothes, were snug, and hugged tightly her mid-section, specially her pants. She wasn't planning on leaving the house that day, she had more than enough with the jogging session.<br>\r\n There was nobody else in the house, so she decided just to lay in the living room and watch TV. She found some anime Konata had showed her and she really liked, in fact, after all the time she spent lazying around with Konata and watching anime, she had discovered anime was pretty great and enjoyed most of those Konata had showed her. Commercials had just began, when the hunger she had been feeling since her jogging sesion became unbearable, and her stomach began growling loudly. She blushed, under normal circumstances, the breakfast she had had today should had bee enough to keep her satisfied for at least an hour more, and even then, her stomach wouldn't demand food so urgently. Kagami knew it wasn't a good idea, she knew she had to diet, and this wouldn't help, but she had already done some exercise that day, and a lttle snack couldn't hurt, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I'll just grab something small, just enough to shut up my belly.\" With that, she headed to the kitchen, and grabbed a box of chocolate pocky, and ate it while watching anime. Then, the box was empty, and another anime began, and her belly growled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, just one more... or maybe two. And something to drink.\" Kagami took another box of pocky, and another, and another... And so, she spent the whole morning watching anime and eating pocky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the other Hiiragis were out for the day, they had gone with the Takaras to the Theme Park, but Kagami had refused the offer to... Well, to exercise and avoid pop-corn, ice-cream, cotton candy, and other sweets abundant in that kind of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami scratched the chubby belly poking out from under her pajama top. Strangely enough, her pj's seemed a bit tigher than they did when she put them on, but that was absurd, wasn't it? Kagami didn't realize it until she ran out of pocky, but it was already lunch time, and her mother had left her a bentou box ready. She opened the box to discover a rather frugal lunch. It wasn't surprising, she had asked her mother to make a small lunch, but now that she saw it, she wasn't so sure about it. She had eaten six full boxes of pocky, but she wasn't full, and since it was lunch time and the lunch wasn't precisely abundant, she ate it without thinking it twice. Her mother's cooking was good, but it was nothing compared to Konata's. Kagami had had several opportunities to taste the little bluenette's cuisine (specially the last month) and it was one of the most delicious things she had ever tasted. Besides, Konata wasn't only great cooking food as in main dishes, but also desserts; Kagami enjoyed specially Konata's chocolate cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm... Konata's cake...\" Kagami's thoughts drifted toward the different mouth-watering dishes her friend could cook, and from there, towards the bluenette herself. Kagami pictured her, with her now chubby cheeks, her charming smile, her cute bouncing belly... The little otaku had never been umpleasant to Kagami's eyes, but her recent weight gain made her even more cute, maybe even sex-WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT!!!!!!!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami shook her head furiously. She couldn't be thinking of Konata like THAT! She was her friend, and they were both girls. Kagami shook her head again and, trying to change the focus of her thoughts, she went to the fridge, and grabbed an ice-cream tub, which happened to be chocolate, Kagami's favourite flavour, and began eating it, laying once more on the living room.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

An image of herself, overflowing in her Miko gown, filled the eyes in her mind for the briefest of instances. Her round cheeks filled with scarlet as she struggled to shake the idea out of her head.

She was like hypnotized by those cakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kagami?\" Her mother called her, snapping her out of her sweet thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? W-What is it?\" Kagami asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said whenever you're ready.

Maybe it's better that way, I've gotta lose weight after all...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? Help yourself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami stared for a moment, not believing her ears.\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I've made plenty, and I plan on making some more, better having too much than too little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" Kagami exclaimed, and took a piece of chocolate cake, her favorite, which she devoured with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you need me I'll be with your father at the temple, making some more preparations\" Her mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, bye *gulp* mom.\" Said Kagami as she swallowed the last of her piece of cake, with a contented expression adorning her cherubic face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami's mother left the house, leaving Kagami alone with the still asleep Tsukasa, who would sleep until the afternoon if allowed to, maybe more, since she had had a tiring day yesterday. Kagami looked at the remaining cake. She still felt a bit hungry, and her mother said there was plenty... 'Just one more piece won't matter... I'll exercise later' Kagami thought, as she proceeded to cut another piece of the chocolate cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo pieces of cake and twenty minutes later, Kagami went upstairs to awake her sister and get dressed, she always woke up early to make sure she had plenty of time to get to school, and she ALWAYS had to wake her sister up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami entered her sister's bedroom, and walked towards Tsukasa's bed. \"Tsukasa, Tsukasa wake uuup!\" Kagami shook her sister lightly, and not so lightly after failing in waking her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five more minutes...\" Tsukasa said half-asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, wake up!\" Kagami shook her sister once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm up, I'm up...\" Tsukasa rose slowly from under the sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still have half an hour to get ready, but that doesn't mean you can just go to bed again.\" Said Kagami as she went out the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami sighed as she entered her own bedroom.'Darn Tsukasa and her super fast metabolism. She wouldn't have this problem even if she let herself go twice as much as I have' While Kagami had had to watch her figure all her life, her twin could eat as much as she wanted and wouldn't gain an extra pound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami took off her constricting pajamas and looked at her plumping self in the full body mirror adorning her bedroom's wall. She grabbed her belly with both her hands, her fingers sinking in the fat. 'Has it gotten bigger?' Kagami thought, as she grabbed the love handles above her purple stripped panties.'Well, at least it seems I wear the extra weight pretty well.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She looked at herself from different angles. Kagami's body seemed slightly pear-shaped, not as much as many other women, just a bit bottom-heavy. She had wide hips, and her rump stuck out quite a bit. Her belly also had a fair share of her new weight, and it made her happy to think her bra size had also gone up, even if it was only a bit more than a size. 'I actually don't look so bad, but I now no one would agree with me, well, maybe Konata...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami got her uniform from her closet, and began to get dressed. Her shirt was kind of snug, and her belly almost poked from under it, but it still fitted. However, she began having some problems when she tried to put her skirt on, she found herself unable to button it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mooooon...\"  'It fitted last Friday, it was tight, but it fitted! I can't have gained that much weight, I shouldn't have gained any weight at all...' Kagami thought, as she struggled with her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughh, finally.\" After a couple of minutes of battling the skirt she finally buttoned it up. The skirt dug deeply into her flesh, making her belly and love-handles slightly more noticeable; and didn't seem to be able to cover her plump backside completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Sigh* \"I might be needing a new skirt if I don't lose some weight.\" Kagami said to herself. Kagami exited her room, and went downstairs, were she found Tsukasa asleep with her face in her rice bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Seriously...' \"Tsukasa, wake up!\" Kagami shook her sister's shoulder, waking her up much faster than last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!? Onee-chan! I didn't fall asleep again, did I?\" Tsukasa seemed to be about to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami sighed in exasperation.\"Yes you did, but we're still on time. Finish your rice, and let's go to school.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Onee-chan!\" Tsukasa rushed to finish her bowl of rice. Kagami saw all the cakes still resting on the kitchen table. 'I guess I could get just one more piece.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami ate another piece of cake, and another one afterwards, and headed to school with her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo were are we heading now?</span></div></div>",

She wasn't obese, not by a long shot, and she was just starting to enter what she would call \"fat\". When Konata was her weight she looked fatter, but she was a about a foot shorter than her. Kagami had developed a slight double chin and a pair of chubby cheeks that created a funny contrast with her sharp eyes. She was disheartened to find that, while the previously flat Konata had gone up all the way to a large C cup, she had gone from a B to a C, sad even if her gain was inferior to the otaku's. Her arms were thicker and jiggly, and her once flat belly had turned soft and chubby, creating a not too big muffin top over her too tight panties (which also formed a nice set of love handles). She had wide hips that could easily compete with Konata's, and a plump bubble butt her old skirts had trouble covering completely. Her jiggly legs were characterized by a set of thick thunder thighs, and she could feel a jiggle every time she walked moderately fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I didn't even gain anything good! What's one bra size when your butt could squish a person. That's another thing, why the heck is my butt so fat? Konata looks so much better than me with the extra weight-NO SHE DOES NOT! She's a fat pig, even more so than I am!' She looked at her voluminous butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Agh!, whatever, I'm not that fat! I'll shed off this weight as soon as I really  set my mind into it.' She thought as she took of her underwear and got ready for the bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt certainly is hard for Kagami Hiiragi to admit defeat, put she will soon discover that \"setting her mind into it\" isn't as easy as she thinks.</span></div></div>",

Was Kagami's first thought,'This-This feels kind of good, really good, actually.' Kagami continued to play with her belly for a minute, exploring this unknown feeling. After a short while, Kagami looked at herself in the mirror, as she had been doing quite often lately.But she was looking in a different way. Usually, she was just looking at how disgusting she looked, at how much she had let herself go. This time, however, she was being more optimistic, she was looking at the new assets she usually only gave a second of her attention, and she had quickly dismissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm not all that bad' Kagami observed carefully every inch of her chubby self. Her face had grown a not too prominent second chin that connected with her two full cheeks, making her face adorably cherubic.'That's kind of cute, isn't it? Like Konata's...' Kagami's glance headed south, and encountered her now quite impressive bust, which had grown to a big DD-cup. 'And these are already bigger than Miyuki's, that's an important perk.' Her belly was next; it had grown considerably since the last time she weighed herself, it stuck out quite a bit, not enough for Kagami to not see her feet when looking down, but it did hide her legs from her sight, and was accompanied by two fleshy love-handles.'This could be the worst part, but it's nice to play with it, and it could be much worse...' Then she glanced at her wide hips, probably the most \"developed\" part of her body, along with her backside.'I'm starting to look like a choco-cornet... But I guess there are people who would think of it as \"curves\", in the good sense.' Last, but not least, Kagami looked at her legs, easily twice the size they were before this mess started, maybe bigger.'Those have grown a lot too... At least there's no cellulite, and it's not like I'm completely obese, although I've probably surpassed the \"just chubby\" mark...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaaaaaaarghh!!\" Kagami was frustrated. She didn't know what to think of herself anymore. 'Maybe I'm looking at it the wrong way; it doesn't have to be black or white. I don't think I should gain more weight though, maybe I could just stay like this, or just try to lose a bit... or gain a bit, would that be too much?...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Kagami was pondering about the matter at hand, she was startled by someone knocking at the door, it was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her widened figure earned her some surprised looks from the people who went to the shrine usually, but she didn't,let this affect her; she was decided to enjoy her free time in the festival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManeuvering through the crowd proved to be more difficult with her new voluminous body, and she bumped into several people in her way to the different stands, artists, and restaurant, can't forget restaurants, that plagued the whole place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami was heading to a cotton candy stand to satisfy a small gap in her stomach, when a short, kimono-clad, blue-haired figure turned around all of sudden, colliding with Kagami and knocking her off her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(THUMP!) Kagami fell to the ground and heard a familiar voice afterwards.\"Kagamin!? Looks like you enjoyed all those cakes last week!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami looked up to see a very chubby bluenette giving her a smug cat-like smile. But Kagami wasn't the only one who had been packing on pounds; Konata had too, she seemed to be about...</span></div></div>",

It's not something that happens everyday, after all.\" Kagami finally said.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nKonata squealed , and jumped with joy, making her whole fleshy body jiggle, a fact that had an almost hypnotic effect in Kagami, who observed the not-so-little girl's body with mixed feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wow, she sure has gained weight fast.' Kagami thought. Kagami had been avoiding Konata during the past week, so the sudden extra 40 pounds in her friend's frame shocked and interested her at the same time, making her observe carefully the changes in Konata's body.<br>\r\nKonata's cheeks, while already quite chubby, had ballooned out, and her second chin had become more prominent and always visible, giving her face an even more cherubic look that Kagami found irresistibly cute. Konata' bust, once nonexistent, had grown to the point where they almost rivaled Miyuki's.'Well, at least mine are still bigger.' Kagami couldn't help but think. Next was Konata's belly, probably her most noticiable feature, although her once small derriere didn't fall far behind. Her belly strained her kimono's sash, and stuck out to the point where Konata would be lucky if she saw her own toes when looking down, and bounced with each step she took, fascinating Kagami. Her butt, as said before, was also quite prominent, probably a bit bigger than Kagami's, even if her hips weren't. Her limbs, though not visible under her kimono, had grown thick and meaty, specially her legs which's thighs jiggled even more than her belly did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...st more.\" Kagami heard Konata say while snapping out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What?\" Kagami asked disconcerted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata's cat-like smile seemed to grow even wider. \"I said you can take a picture, it'll last longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami was caught off-guard by the comment.\"W-what are you talking about!?\" Kagami half-yelled while looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata leaned her body toward Kagami's, and dug a pudgy digit in Kagami's fleshy site, making her jump a little. \"You're so obvious Kagamin. You were staring. You like what you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami blushed furiously and crossed her arms while looking further away. \"Wha-Don't be ridiculous! And I told you not to do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata dug her finger a bit deeper in Kagami's flesh.\"Awww, but I know you like it Kagamin.\" Konata opened her hand and grabbed one of Kagami's pudgy love-handles. Kagami \"eeeped\" and jumped, escaping Konata's grasp, and blushed reaching a new level of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KONATA! Stop it! I told you, not here!\" Kagami exclaimed in her embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata backed off and raised her chubby hands in self-defense.\"Ok, ok, I'll be good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd better be.\" Kagami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you liked it.\" Konata whispered, making Kagami blush once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following couple of hours were spent doing typical festival stuff, without anything unusual. Kagami, however, couldn't help but sneak glances at Konata's plump form now and then, with such luck, that she was caught twice doing so, making her blush madly, and Konata smile smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, they had done everything (and eaten everything) they were interested in, so Konata proposed going to her place now, and Kagami agreed. On their way, they talked about the usual random stuff they usually talked about, until Konata, once they arrived at her house, brought up an interesting topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what was all that about losing weight?\" Konata asked smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami blushed a little bit. \"Well, I tried, but It was harder than I expected.\" Kagami confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata giggled \"Yes, I can see it didn't quite work out.\" She poked Kagami's belly much to her embarrasement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami began fidgeting with her fingers.\"But you see, yesterday I found out that maybe this wasn't so bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata's chubby face seemed to brighten. \"Oh reeeeally?\" Asked Konata, a mischievous look km her face. \"Could it be because of... This!?\" Konata dug her hands in Kagami's belly fat, grabbing handfulls of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeek! Konata! What are you doing!?\" Kagami yelled surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like it, don't deny it. I'm right, aren't I?\" Konata contined playing with Kagami's chubby belly in a way similar to how Kagami had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ko-Konata, stop it!\" Kagami couldn't help but moan a little out of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? I know you are enjoying this, but if you insist...\" Konata finally let a very flustered Kagami go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami was breathing heavily. Konata was right, she did enjoy it, even more than whe she did it by herself, but she couldn't let this happen, it wasn't right... Was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck are you doing!?\" Kagami exclaimed between breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Kagamin! I couldn't help it! You are so cute.\" Konata said, causing Kagami to blush.\"Specially when you blush.\" Konata aproximated Kagami slowly.\"And with the Miko cosplay... It's just too much.\" She she put her pudgy hand on Kagami's wide hips, and slid it down to her thick thighs.\"You know you want to...\" Konata whispered to Kagami's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami looked at Konata's cute cherubic face, looking for some kind of sign of being joking, but found none. It was true that she enjoyed it, and Konata looked incredibly cute and alluring right now, but they were friends, and both girls, could she really let this happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If you want I can cook for you. All the chocolate cake you could want~\" she replied tauntingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small amount of drool escaped her mouth at the thought of eating slice after slice of Konata's cake, while a small amount of drool WOULD have escaped Konata's at the thought of an even fluffier Kagami if it weren't for the surprising amount of self control she managed to demonstrate. 'Can't let Kagami get the pleasure of seeing THAT me.' She thought to herself.  'At least, not yet~'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata leaned further into Kagami's plush gut, but Kagami, overwhelmed by the pleasure of the blunnette sinking into her gut, said blunnette's chocolate cake, and trying to figure out just how much she wanted to gain, had completely spaced out and had begun losing her balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't realized this, however, until she was suddenly teetering backwards, trying not to fall over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Whoa!\" She exclaimed, unable to combat the force of gravity. Konata, meanwhile, was all but reliant on Kagami for balance and tumbled down with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the placement both the girls were in before the fall, Konata was placed in the precarious position of her face being buried in Kagami's crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor what seemed like an eternity, neither of them moved. Astonishingly, BOTH of them were mortified. Kagami understandably, but Konata was mortified due to the sheer suddenness of the placement. Normally, with the notion that they were going to have sex, she would have been A-OK, but she just simply wasn't prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both sat there, frozen, until they both began an uncomfortable \"uuuu\" that gradually rose into an \"UUUU\" before they both screamed and leaped away from each other, or at least tried to, given their weights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing this they both just sat there, panting and staring at each other. That is, until Kagami, realizing that she just saw Konata flustered, placed a hand over her mouth and began chuckling. Her chuckling rapidly escalated to laughter, then morphed into full on cackles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! What's so funny!\" Konata shouted, thoroughly annoyed.She didn't get a response aside from the cascading laughter from the girl sitting across from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I *wheeze* can't *snort* breathe\" Kagami eventually manged to utter through her cackling. \"I'll take you up on that cooking offer,\" she managed to say once her laughter had ceased and she had caught her breath \"and as for how much? ...\"</span></div></div>",

Konata's hands moved to her belly, and played with it, slowly at first, but progressively faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep inside, Kagami knew she should complain, but having experienced this before, her body just wouldn't let her, so she let herself get lost in the pleasure, and let a moan escape.\"Wow, you look so cute, you must be really enjoying this, am I right?\" Konata asked, but her only answer was another soft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Kagamin...\" Konata whispered as she slowed her pace a bit, and her pudgy hands lowered to Kagami's soft hips. \"I've wanted to do this for a while, but I restrained myself.\" Konata's cherubic face got closer to Kagami's own chubby one.\"But I can't help it, you're just too much, so I hope you want this too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami saw Konata's cute chubby face getting closer to hers, and at first began to panic 'She isn't going to...

So far everyone seems oblivious to their relationship; perhaps the sudden weight gain in both of the girls has occupied everyone\u2019s minds so much that they haven\u2019t even considered why they\u2019ve spending so much time with each other so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring their time together, Konata and Kagami have explored their feelings for each other, both through feeding sessions, which sometimes took an erotic turn, and make out sessions, and exploring each others bodies. However the two girls have yet to engage in sex, they\u2019re taking it slow for now. So far the most they have done is playing with each others big, fat breasts, much to Konatas delight since she now has boobs to be played with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata and Kagami have learned a lot about each other during their week together, for example, Kagami learned that she loves to have Konata sitting on her lap as they kiss, she absolutely loves how good it feels to have Konatas fatty frame presses against hers, how their tummies smoosh onto each other and how their breasts rub into each other. Konata has also learned how much she loves to have her love handles licked by Kagami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata gained around 10 lbs since they\u2019ve hooked up, although Kagami said that she wouldn\u2019t try to gain any more weight, she actually ended up putting on 4lbs herself, nobody in her family has noticed, but her blue haired lover did, and she loved every ounce of fat that it added onto the twintailed hairs frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecently, Kagami has noticed that Tsukasa has put on a little bit of weight herself, not a whole lot, just enough for her to notice her tummy poking out of her PJ\u2019s, Konata also noticed that Miyuki has gotten a little bigger herself, but unlike Tsukasa, who\u2019s extra softness went straight to her tummy, Miyuki\u2019s \u2018softness\u2019 went straight to her already large breasts, butt and thighs. If this kept up, she would end up with quite the voluptuous hourglass figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to our pair of lovey dovey fatties, Kagami seems to be feeding Konata pieces of chocolate, Konata lazily rests her head on Kagamis super soft, fat thighs as she greedily devours the chocolate that her girlfriend feeds her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Kagami~\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHrm?\u201d Kagami mumbles out, pinching one of the chocolates on Konata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow fat am I?\u201d the blue haired otaku purrs out erotically, grinning slyly as she watches Kagami blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 r-really\u2026 uh... v-very fat\u2026\u201d Kagami mumbles out, not yet used to flirting yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe~ you\u2019re no good at talking dirty!

Or you could say I'm a debudere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Debudere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm sweet and cute, then a big fat butterball,\" Konata replied, pressing her soft frame against Kagami's chest.

No, get real.

She longed for those soft hands to caress her malleable flesh, and, sure enough, Konata granted her inner wishes. The two rolled onto the mattress, their flesh molding against one another, their very bodies morphing to abide to the other's wishes. They were wrapped around each other, their arms just able to link around their upper waists, as they searched for flesh to prod, stroke, gather in their plump hands and latch onto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then...</span></div></div>",

She embraced Kagami once again, one hand caressing Kagami's thick thighs and soft butt, stroking and grabbing her flesh, while her other hand made its way to her shirt's buttons, unbuttoning one at a time, until she had a clear path to Kagami's generous bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami knew well where her fat girlfriend was going, and she wasn't against the idea; the moment Konata expressed her security about the matter, she was happy to comply. Her pudgy hands grabbed Konata's belly's soft flesh, and made their way up to her breasts, where, with some effort, they began to undo Konata's bra with one hand, as the other groped greedily her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two fatties were completely immersed in the passion; grabbing each other's soft an malleable flesh, as they lost pieces of clothing and their fleshy bodies changed shape to accommodate the other's.</span></div></div>",

Each time Konata was on top of Kagami, she felt in danger of popping under her weight, but at the same time, she was in a state of utter euphoria. There was something so beautiful about that position, something so perfect, that she wouldn't mind if she just sank into Konata's chest and vanished inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ran each others hands through their hair now, lips locked as their tongues fiercely groped within the other girl's mouth. Kagami could taste the sweets Konata had been shoveling in her mouth, making the experience slightly more pleasurable than it ought to have been.

With this thoughts in mind, Konata headed to the Takanomiya Shrine.

I've been looking for her.\" Konata called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatsuri turned around, recognizing Konata's voice, and was extremely shocked by Konata's new girth, since it had been about 70 pounds ago since Matsuri had seen her, and her body had grown considerably. Konata's strained kimono had trouble hiding her enlarged belly, and her backside had ballooned out to, being about the same size as Kagami's, if not a bit bigger, her face had grown even chubbier, her limbs had grown thick and jiggly and her double chin was now always visible. In general, Konata's weight seemed to be distributed quite evenly, except for her breast, which, although almost as big as Miyuki's, seemed smaller in her thick frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A, ah, K-Konata! Hi, ehrm, Kagami you say? I'm pretty sure she already went home, you should just go there.\" Matsuri replied, still somewhat dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hmmm, she's back home already? This is getting more and more suspicious' Konata thought,\"Well, thanks Matsuri, see ya!\" The chubby girl said as she waved goodbye and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatsuri couldn't help but stare, and think:'And I thought Kagami was getting fat...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata arrived at the Hiiragi household, and was about to ring the door, when she discovered it wasn't locked. 'Hm? Well, now I'll get to surprise my not-so-little Kagamin!'

Konata never blushed, ever. She was serious, Kagami new it, and this presented a new dilemma: What to answer. Kagami had never thought herself anything but straight, and usually would refuse any girl who asked her out, but this was Konata. Until now, Kagami had only thought of Konata as a friend, but now that she had asked this... She wasn't so sure anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Can I really do this?' Kagami thought,'Konata is cute, no arguing that, and lately, with the extra weight, even more so, and she's a good friend, even if a little annoying, and I know her really well, and she probably knows me even better... Maybe, maybe this is worth a try.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\" Kagami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? Really?\" Konata hadn't been expecting that; her thoughts were rushing through her head,'Really!? It's true that I was being serious, but I didn't expect her to say yes so easily, and if she refused, I could have played it as a big joke, but now, now she said yes! So Kagami is now my, my, my girlfriend!' Konata's face seemed to radiate happiness, and the biggest cat-smile Kagami had ever seen formed on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YAAAY!\" Konata's voluminous frame engulfed Kagami in a huge bear hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami felt the blood going up to her face as she felt Konata's fleshy belly pressed against her own, making a new, yet familiar feeling of pleasure envelop her whole body. Kagami returned the hug, and was startled when Konata's pudgy hands began to rub and squeeze her meaty sides, increasing the pleasurable feeling to the point where she let out a soft moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe, Kagamin, you are so easy to please, I know you liked that.\" Konata pushed away from Kagami a little bit, and grabbed her wrists.\"But since this is a relationship, we both should be allowed to have fun, right?\" And so, Konata pulled Kagami's hands into her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her hands met Konata's soft midsection, Kagami's hopes of this relationship working increased exponentially. Not only she liked being fat, she liked Konata being fat. Her rather thick digits sank into Konata's belly fat, grabbing, rubbing and squeezing, taking pleasure from every second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami's sudden aggressiveness surprised Konata quite a bit, but she couldn't say that she didn't like it. \"Ohoho, Kagamin can be a bad girl too! Me likey!\" Konata put her hands on Kagami's wide hips, and began doing her thing too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kagamin.\" Konata said a short while later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" A beet red Kagami asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since we are girlfriends and all, how about we...</span></div></div>",

As Kagami prepared to stroke her belly against her blue haired friend, their hips heaving, she noticed Tsukasa in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer round face now filled with scarlet, Kagami stared at Tsukasa as Konata finally took notice of the girl. The poor scrawny twin was frozen, her eyes wide and in awe. She trembled slightly as Konata smiled. \"Hey, Tsukasa, you want in on this too?\" Tsukasa didn't respond, but rather took a few steps backward, slowly closing the door. Every creak of the gears sent more chills up Kagami's spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother would hear about this. Everyone would know she was a lesbian with a fat fetish. She'd be the laughing stock of the shrine, and then she'd be doomed. She had to stop Tsukasa! She darted to the door, surprised by how winded she felt as she tore the door open, and wraped her fat fingers around Tsukasa's tiny palms. Her twin tried to resist, but all Kagami needed to do was lean backward, focusing her weight in the room. Tsukasa couldn't resist all 180 pounds of her, and tumbled onto her soft belly. Kagami rolled over on impact, keeping her twin under her bulk.

It was almost sexually pleasurable, but, of course, Kagami swept those ideas under the rug.

You fatso.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata grinned.\"That's what I wanted to hear! I was getting worried my chubby tsundere was getting too dere-dere and not enough tsun-tsun. We can't have that, can we?\" She teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heavier twin knew Konata was just pushing her buttons so she just decided to leave it.\"Let's go Tsukasa.\" she said turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes onee-chan.\" Tsukasa hurried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata didn't let this chance escape.\"Byeee! But don't run.\" She called,\" Wouldn't want this juicy booty to get smaller.\" She said while pinching Kagami's fleshy bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami let out an \"eep\" and blushed further. She knew it was a losing battle, so she just hurried and left with her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were outside, Kagami said \"Sorry about before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok.\" Said Tsukasa softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And please, don't tell anyone about... you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Onee-chan, I won't. I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami smiled.\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The school day passed on by as normal, only difference was that Konata ditched Gym class to eat snacks, and she ate an enormous lunch. Kagami and Tsukasa watched in disbelief as their formerly athletic otaku friend was eating so vigorously. Kagami was disgusted by Konata's sudden change of lifestyle and even moreso by her attempts to convince her to join in. Tsukasa however focused more on how much fun Konata was having eating like this and compaired it to her sister who ate a very restrained amount as she attempted to keep her weight down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that afternoon when Kagami and Tsukasa got home, their parents were not back from work yet. Kagami went straight upstairs to start on her homework whilst Tsukasa decided to try satisfy her curiosity. She went to the kitchen and turned on the oven, as she put on her apron. Soon she got out aload of ingredients as well as many fatty junk foods and she soon began cooking, all the while snacking carelessly on the pile of snacks she had taken out.<br>\r\nShe was surprised at how good it felt to stuff her face without caring, she couldn't help but feel a bit excited, almost as if she was doing something Taboo. Her heart racing as she devowered three bags of potato chips, a small pastry and two large boxes of Pocky.<br>\r\nBy the time she was done, she had finished cooking also. She had made a huge pile of freshly baked cookies and put them on the side to cool, just as she did so the doorbell rang. \"I'll get it\" Tsukasa yelled to her sister as she quickly threw away all the garbage from her mini binge and removed her apron as the doorbell rang again. As quickly as she could (which wasn't very quick at all) she scampered over to the door and opened it to see Konata standing there munching on a bar of chocolate, looking a bit flabbier than she did that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tsukasa\" Konata smiled slyly \"how's it goin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh...not bad\" she blushed \"would you like to come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" Konata giggled as she entered and removed her shoes whilst she waited for Tsukasa to close the door. \"So it seems you decided to see what it was like, hmmm?\" she cooed and gentally poked Tsukasa's tummy, which she just noticed was small and bloated and very noticable under her school shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ahh, well you see...\" she blushed as she was deeply embarrased<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright\" she giggled \"you wanted to see what it was like after I spent the entire day bragging about how great it was to eat without restrictions and get soft and fat. So how was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"erm...\" Tsukasa blushed for a moment and then smiled cutely \"It was fun\" she replied \"I really enjoyed eating like that, and the feeling of my tummy, packed full afterwards. It hurts a little but its nice\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure is\" Konata nodded as she understood completly \"so, you going to make it a regular occurance? It would be nice to have someone to binge with\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like to\" she blushed again \"but what will my family say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"who really cares?\" Konata chuckled \"so long as your healthy and happy that's the only thing that matters, if they dont understand that at first they will come to accept it in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you think so?\" She asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I do. Now how about we get something to eat\" she grinned greedily \"I could smell your freshly baked cookies a mile away\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"we should take them to my room\" Tsukasa blushed \"my parents will return home soon and I dont want to binge with you with them watching\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"good idea. We'll bring some drinks and other snacks up too\" she smiled playfully as they went to the kitchen and grabbed the cookies and everything else fattening that they could carry and took it up to Tsukasa's room.</span></div></div>",

Ahh! that was sooo good, uuurrrrppp!!!\" The small otaku belched loudly as she patted her now swollen gut,\"Oh, that one was bigger than one of dad's.\" Taking a look at her body, she noted that while her belly was pact and taut from her earlier binging the rest of her body had gained a little bit of flab from her earlier snacking around an hour ago. Her limbs had thickened by about a good inch and now that she wasn't obessing over eating Konata could tell her panties had scrunchied up just a little from her butt being slightly flabby now. All in all Konata had now made her weight gain noticeable on a visual level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I wonder how much I weigh now, the blunette then heaved hertself off the floor, wiping off the crumbs that had gotten stuck to her pajamas in her snacking and went to the W.C (toilet room basically for those who don't know) to check her weight. Konata turned on the light switch  and stepped onto the scale. When she looked down she noticed her belly was sticking out 2 inches, no doubt from her eating all that food.  Lokking over just slightly to get over her bigger belly, she could now read her weight on the scale. \"132lbs, wow I can't believe I gained 27lbs so quickly!\" Konata Izumi marveled at her newfound weight, wondering blissfully at her friends's discovery of her bigger body when she went to school tommorrow. \"Hehe they'll be shocked when they see this! Konata then proceeded to slap her belly and watched as it jiggled from the impact. Hmm, well I still feel hungry, one more snack should do me good.\" The otaku then went out of the W.C and walked downstairs to the kitchen to get a few pieces of sugary snacks she left before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh... this should do nicely.\" Konata said carrying yet another armful of snacks. At that moment a voice came out form behind her. \"Huh? Konata what you doing up at this time of the night?\" {Oh jeez!} Konata thought to herself as she turned and saw...</span></div></div>",

She barely needed to move a muscle unattached to her jaws. It was so beautiful, such a lazy dream. Oh, and, naturally, all the anime she could watch. Konata struggled to return to her dreamworld after waking, but, alas, the sunlight burned into her eyes far too greatly to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata pulled on her uniform, an outfit that pulled against her now pudgier form, as she descended the stairway to breakfast. There, she found her father standing at the stove, fiercely cooking food, as though he were some sort of samurai guy in a movie, only the actor playing the samurai clearly had no acting training and was hamming it up big time. Yeah, her dad: the large ham.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, dad, whaddya doin'?\" Konata asked, lazily scratching her thick thigh as she plopped herself down onto her squishy derriere<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Konata, your comment last night, about skipping breakfast, I can't allow my only daughter to just waste away and starve herself!\" her father declared, passionately, \"Even if I need to force food down your throat, you will NOT starve, got it!?\" Konata assured him she wouldn't, giggling to herself in the process.  The guy actually believed that?  What a magnificent fool! What a terrific idiot, doing exactly what she wanted without Konata even saying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...morning...\" Yutaka moaned, groggily descending the stairs, her tiny frame smothered under her sloppily prepared school uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata's father turned toward Yutaka, and, a fanatic expression on his face, pointed at her. \"You! Are you starving yourself too?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Yutaka replied, cocking her head to the side in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did I go wrong?\" he cried, silently, \"Kanata, our daughter and niece are both starving themselves in the name of fashion. In our days, were people this crazy about appearance...?  They were? Well, don't disagree in front of the children, we need to set a good example!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who're you talking to?\" Yutaka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A sign of old age. First you can't remember yesterday's breakfast, then ya start talking to imaginary objects. It's horrible I tell ya!\" Konata said with a laugh, smirking as her father  set up a large plate of food for her, and a large plate for the flustered Yutaka.</span></div></div>",

Yutaka herself being quite small even compared to her older cousin, had filled out quite a bit. Though she never ate as ravenously as the blue haired otaku, due to being given so much to eat for every meal the poor girl was now more wide then she was tall. Her expansive gut had torn a number of her shirts to shreds and due to her weighing a now hefty 246lbs she had to start buying larger sizes, and even those were starting to not cover up her fleshy fat anymore. The girl's breasts, before barely existing, now were a rather pleasant C-cup. Her lower posterior had bulged outward nicely, her cheeks forming a heart shape. Yutaka now possessed a second chin, which hung below her face, swaying every time she opened her mouth, usually to eat or let out the occasional unintentional belch. Her belly stuck out in front of her by about 8 inches, and it's width was nearly 3 times that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata however...had changed far greater then her cousin. Due to taking huge advantage of her father's paranoia about her supposed self starving, she was easily heavier then all three of her friends combined. At an enormous 689lbs, it was a sight to behold that the girl could still stand, and as everyone found out could still be quite athletic at over a quarter of a ton, albeit much slower than before. The girl now held breasts that rivaled those of one of the girls from the Eiken series, both being far bigger than her head.  Now, being the girl she was she had never bought any bras as they held no purpose to her before, but now it was because she was just so used to not wearing one and also because she didn't see much use in having one on her anyway, she finally had some fat there, why not flaunt 'em off a little? The otaku's belly now surged at least 2 feet from her body, her blubber jiggling every time she made even a slight movement. Due to the increase in fat on her stomach, her belly button was now useful for holding cornets and and various snacks for her to munch on as one could reach 9 inches in before hitting the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ass was a hefty mass of flab as well, functioning now like cushions to her body, each cheek could easily swallow up a PS3 and a Xbox360. She particularly enjoyed the feeling of her butt cheeks squashing Kagami when she <i>accidentally</i> sat on her when she came over. Konata now had 5 chins on her face, all flappy and waggly.  Currently, the long blue haired girl was snacking away on a cornet she had stuffed in her navel 5 hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*crunch* *gulp* BBUUURRRPPP!!!\" Konata belched loudly as she sat in her room reading a manga about people with animal traits. \"Hehe, it's so nice to have all these awesome rolls on me.\" she said stuffing the comic back into her fat folds for later reading. \"Konata come here! it's time for dinner!\" her father yelled from the den, the smell of rich flavored food wavered into Konata's nostrils. waddling to the living room Konata was greeted by...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She tried not to let it get to her  and continued to try her best and she's not one to be outdone and is always competitive, but she just felt weighed down a little and was quite tired afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Aww man im beat sigh Misao really pissed me off back there even if she was kidding I can't let it get to me. What she said isn't true anyway. I hope this helped me lose a little weight today though. I should probably go for another run this evening I gotta do better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter P.E. came lunch and she knew she would have to deal with Konata, but she was also starving and just wanted to eat and move on with the day the best she could. She did pack a little extra with her lunch this time and was really looking forward to it. Just then a  blue hair midget appeared and shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hey there Kagamin you ready to have lunch together with us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was afraid you'd start to get all anorexic on us or something. The last thing we need is a friend who's all skin and bones. If I were to ever cuddle with you, you'd be so hard, but not that kinda hard, ya know? Not unless you--\"  Konata's voice trailed off as she realized her sexual inuendo was not lost on her other friends, who were staring at her with a mingled look of stunned amusement and awestruck horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh,\" Miyuki said, changing the topics quickly, \"A girl at your weight should probably gain weight anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're serious?\" Kagami asked, flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe not go out intentionally to gain weight, but for you it'd be healthier than losing it,\" Miyuki replied, \"Since you aren't close to obese. I think I'm probably heavier than you to tell the truth. I'm a little spoiled at home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you're heavier than Kagami,\" Konata replied, shrugging, \"You have boobs. Those weigh more than Kagami's whole body does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyuki was blushing, head lowered in embarressment, but Kagami couldn't help but giggle slightly, if not only in relief. She had been afraid she had packed on a little weight, but now she felt less worried. She finished her bento in moments, and, despite her slightly bloated belly, sighed in relief. She loosened her skirt slightly, noticing her fingers brushed against her slightly soft stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she did have reason to worry.</span></div></div>",

She had a big belly that stuck out and pushed out through her tight clothes and she could no longer see her feet when she looked down. Her arms had quite a bit of fat on them now and her round plump face was actually pretty cute and her thighs had become big and thick like tree trunks. She now had boobs bigger than Miyuki's or anyone else's for that matter as they swelled up quite nicely which she didn't mind to much. Her rear was big and wide and she had a hard time trying to cover it up with her skirt as she wasn't to pleased that her panties could be seen at times especially when she sat at her desk or had to bend over to get something. She jiggled when she would walk or move any part of her. <br>\r\nIt was lunch time and Kagami went to the usual place to meet the others, but Konata wasn't there which Kagami found a bit odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys what happend to Konata?\" Kagami asked a little confused when Miyuki responded \" She had to take care of something for Ms. Kuroi she said she be back very soon and to start without her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they started chatting and enjoying lunch and Konata finally rushed in, but stopped in her tracks and noticed Kagami's big butt showing off her striped green panties and couldn't believe what she was seeing and for a minute was just starring at them, but she quickly caught herself and snapped out of it and went over to join the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys im here\" she said as she sat down across from Kagami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Konata nice of you to join us\" Kagami said as she was enjoying her bag of chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww did someone miss me hmm\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut it out Konata people are starring\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At what I wonder\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh did you say something?\" Kagami asked, but Konata just shook it off and changed the topic to some anime and manga and Kagami not understanding everything she meant or was talking about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Kagami what happend with you and your weight issue\" Konata decided to ask to see what kind of reaction she would get while Miyuki and Tsukasa looked a bit surprised she would ask that and a bit afraid as well as no one really questiond it much since it was a sensitive subject for Kagami and they thought Kagami would be alright, but they did try bringing it up once and Kagami said eveyrthing was ok and she was was being careful and then left it at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah why do you ask\" Kagami asked a little surprised by the question<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you were always watching your figure and all and well I know we said you had nothing to worry about and gaining a few was no big deal for you, but you kind of gained alot since then and well\" Konata was cut off as Kagami spoke up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah your right I know and im fat I get it and well I just kept gaining and and before I knew it I was huge and I just couldn't lose it alright I couldn't help it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright Kagami were here for you we can help\" Miyuki said and Tsukasa nodded in agreement, but Kagami waved them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" It's alright guys it's my problem ill take care of it and Ill watch it for now on, but im actually ok trust me guys im fine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Tsukasa an Miyuki were a bit shocked by that, but both seemd to understand and said no more and were happy Kagami was taking this well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata then added one last thing before lunch ended \"You look pretty good to me  you always did and your still my little tsundere\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Konata knock it off already geez\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus look at those boobs compared to Miyuki's\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami covered them with her hands \"KONATA! she shouted as she turned red and so did Miyuki.</span></div></div>",

Your pretty big, but I think in a good way\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami wasn't sure what she meant by that \"In a good way what the heck does that mean\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata just smiled and then continued on \" Well ive always thought you were good looking and I still think that now and I just think you being so fat has made you even better looking it works on you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami then blushed all over \" Are.. are you being serious or just teasing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No im being serious Kagami I would I ever lie to you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess not, but I never knew you thought that ever especially with how you teased me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Im just having some fun with you know that I like the reactions I get out of you it's cute\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" You really don't mind how fat I am\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No not at all I don't care if your thin or not like I said ive always thought you were good looking and I thought it was silly how your overreacted about your weight when nothing was really wrong ever\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami just didn't know what to think  she coulldn't believe what she was hearing from her. The blue hair otaku contiuned on \" Do you like being that big how do you feel Kagami you don't seem to mind all that much as you might say you haven't really lost any\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami wasn't sure if she should anser it or not, but then Konata said \" It's alright be honest you can tell me and I dont think it matters to anyone else either, but your safe with me Kagami\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Kagami blushed a little, but decided to tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it im happy actually and no I haven't really lost any, but I do try to watch it and eat right yet, but im fine being this big being this fat I never thought I would ever, but here I am I enjoy it actually so im good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata was pleased to hear it \" That's the anser I was hoping for cause I enjoy it to\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami didn't know what she meant by that, but then she felt warmth touching her lips and saw it was Konata kissing her passiontly and Kagami just couldn't beleive it. Finally Konata broke off and asked Kagami one last quesiton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how was that? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami blushed and then before she knew it returned the favor and did the same to Konata and they imbraced each other lovingly as Kagami had her arms wrapped around Konata, but made sure not to squash her and Konata doing her best to wrap her arms around Kagami. Kagami then replied \" That's my answer and thanks for understanding and listening and being so accepting of me always. I like you alot to Konata\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata sat there smiling back at Kagami blushing  somewhat herself now and simply said \" Your welcome ill always be there for you I hope you know that\" Kagami smile back and simply said \" Yes I do and again thank you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that they both stood up and Konata saw a big fat wet Kagami  and liked what she saw <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep it really does work well on you. I love you Kagami\"  and Kagami replied \" I love you to Konata\"<br>\r\nKonata then remembered she had one last thing to say before they headed back to there rooms to meet up with Tsukasa and Miyuki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kagami check it out Timotei Timotei TIMOTEI\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami just stood there not really sure what she just saw \"What the heck?\"</span></div></div>",

Konata liked both pictures, but as she compared them she knew she perferred the bigger Kagami one much more and just smiled wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I love you Kagami no matter what your such a cute butter ball of moe. Oh it's almost time for Haruhi to start click\" Konata said as she began to watch her favorite anime, but the thought of Kagami never really left her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was going on Kagami was eating some pocky while reading a lignt novel, but also had a bag of chips and a piece of cake that her sis had made near as well and was enjoying herself with no worries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sure was a great chapter this has been so relaxing\" Kagami said as she smiled and patted her belly. \"Wow usually I be so freaked out by this, but not anymore plus I always have you by my side\" Kagami smiled and looked at a picture of Konata. \"I love you Konata I always will.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day was sunny and warm and Kagami had left to go to Konata's for the day. Tsukasa was still sleeping so she would meet up later. Konata stood there outside her house with her 3DS, but got distraced when she noticed Kagami walking towards her and she couldn't get her eyes off of her. As Kagami walked her big belly jiggled along with her thick thighs that brushed against each other and her arms also jiggled some as well and Konata liked what she saw as the only thing that came to her mind was this \" She is so moe so awesome\" especially after seeing how cute her chubby face looked and big bouncing boobs that were bigger than Miyuki's in fact it wasn't really that close anymore. She then snapped out of it when Kagami reached her \" Hey Konata nice day I hope you weren't waiting long?\" Kagami said with a gentle warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata caught off guard just a little \"huh yeah sure hey yeah and no it's ok\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Kagami just giggled a little \"you want to head inside for a little while?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah cool off for a little bit before we head out you first\" Konata smiled and held the door for Kagami and as she walked by she then noticed Kagami's big butt moving to it's own beat and she could of sworn she got a glimpse of something green and striped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went straight to Konata's room and just relaxed for a little while chatting and watched a little anime even Kagami enjoyed a few of them especially  the one with a group of girls that start a band after school. That's when Konata noticed something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you changed your hair how come?\" Konata curiously mentiond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yeah well I just felt like doing something different gotta a problem with it go ahead laugh joke all you want\" Kagami with a typical response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata had a response for her alright \"I like it a braided pony tail looks good on you actually\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami then blushed and replied \"Really you really think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I sure do you should keep it like that for a while it's moetastic!\" Konata then gave her a big thumbs up with a wide smile. Kagami still blushing somewhat, but was also very pleased to hear this \" I will thanks Konata, but did you really need to say that last part?\" she said a little annoyed, but also happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata with her cat like grin only said \" Oh come on it's true and it's not my fault your such a cute butter ball your full of cuteness\" and began poking at Kagami's belly and making it jiggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that already geez \" is all Kagami could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden Konata came in and hugged Kagami which she wasn't expecting, but Kagami didn't push her back instead she embraced Konata with a hug as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your nice, soft and warm\" Konata said while Kagami responded \"Thanks Konata your warm to\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both then starred at each other and then leaned in closer and they kissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami was the first to speak again \" I love you Konata\" and Konata replied the same way \"I love you to Kagami\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata then smiled and said \"So next ill turn you into a full blown otaku like me\" Kagami irritatedly said \"as if no way im going to go as far as you ever\" Konata just laughed and replied \"Hey can't blame me for trying, but your still my little or um big tsundere\" Kagami just sighed and said \"some things just never change with you, but stop calling me that\". Konata just smiled, but Kagami then said \"Your right though I am yours and I always will be\" and Konata stated back \"ill always be yours to forever no matter what\" they both smiled back at each other and then kised again \"I love how soft and fat you are Kagami I like you this way\" Konata said \"yeah I thought so and me to I don't mind at all either\" Kagami stated back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't ever change Konata I like you this way\" Kagami replied while Konata with her cat like smile only said \"You know it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami then noticed the time and got her mind focused again \"Hey Tsukasa will be here soon we should get ready\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah your right we can't worry her\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went out and met Tsuaksa right when she was walking up to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys you all ready sorry I slept so late I didn't mean to, but tahnks for waiting\" Tsukasa said bashfully, but with some cheerfullness to and both replied with a yes and they headed out to enjoy the rest of the day, but as they left Kagami and Konata were holding hands and Tsukasa noticed, but thought nothing of it as she always thought it would happen eventually. They walked and chatted and Tsukasa just smiled and listend in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Konata don't confuse anime with reality again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey im just saying think about it that be pretty cool\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"whatever hey lets get something to eat first\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok my big tsundere\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KONATA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell it turned out to be another  typical summer for just about everyone, but for two things became that much more better and interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe End</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Summer was over and it was senior year this was it there final days of high school and from there who knows the possibilities are endless. Kagami was in her room trying to get her uniform on the best she could as she never lost any weight and was probably a tad bit bigger than she was when summer first started. Kagami was busy in thought and was a bit unsure \" I haven't lost any weight and im possibly bigger than before now I hope things will be alright and I don't get bothered about it at school to much\". Just then a knock on her door snapped her out of her thought process as it was Tsukasa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis Konata's on the phone for you\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ok thanks\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Kagami answered wondering why on earth Konata would call her right before school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey how's it going just thought I check up on you is all make sure your alright and ready to go\" Konata replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course im always ready this is Kagami your speaking to what kind of question is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well you know I thought you just might be unsure about something\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami was surprised that Konata had such perfect timing it was almost creepy and also that she  was right on the money on this, but decided not to tell Konata and make her worried at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No everything is fine im almost ready to leave soon thanks for asking though\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well ok if you say so, but just remember im always there for you Kagami it doens't matter what anyone thinks of you they don't know my tsundere like I do\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Konata geez don't call me that,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, but you are my Kagamin! You haven't changed at all your strong, smart, and beautiful just the way I like it. Your still you and noone can take any of that away don't worry about anything just contine to be yourself no matter what\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Konata\" Is all Kagami could say at first as tears started to form and she tried to regroup and was finally able to speak again \"Thanks Konata I don't know what I ever do without you I love you so much\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata was on the other line smiling and then said \"I love you to and your welcome now ill see you at school\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you bet!\" and right before Kagami was about to hang up Konata had one quick thing left to say \"Besides your kind of scary at times, but if anyone tries to mess with you ill give them my super Konata kick\" which followed by a big crash. Kagami shocked and a little annoyed by part of that statement quickly said \"What was that you alright over there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata just laughed and said \"heh heh yeah I just accidentally knocked over our lamp dad won't be to happy I better get a new one quick\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami could only smile and laugh a little to and both said goodbye and hung up. Kagami finished getting ready ate breakfast and her and Tsukasa went off to school. When they arrived there they met up with Konata and Miyuki and chatted for a little bit before going over to check on what class there all in. Kagami was the biggest student there so she was noticed by some and others were to busy talking or trying to get to class to notice, but she did over hear a few comments on how big she was or was that really Kagami, but nothing bad really, but Kagami just acted like her usual self and plus she always had Konata by her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami was the only one put in a different class once again which wasn't much of a surprise to them, but Kagami wouldn't of minded being in the same class with them at least once. There was always lunch time when they would get together and so off they went and Kagami walked and was quickly greeted by Misao.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Hiiragi what's up looks like were in the same class again isn't that something how many times has this happend now\" she said cheerfully just then Ayano showed up and greeted them \"Let's have another good year\" she said calmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisao then chimed in again \"Hey Hiiragi looks like you enjoyed yourself over the summer huh\" as she poked Kagami a little. Kagami a littled pissed by this only replied \"Ha ha very funny big deal im still me and yes I did have a good summer great in fact so there!\". Kagami then walked to her seat and said nothing to Misao the rest of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was only kidding geez she really hasn't changed\" Misao said to Ayano who looked a bit nervous by what just happend. \"You really should think before speaking and be a bit more sensitive to people Misao that wasn't that nice\" Ayano then said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah\" is all Misao said before they and the rest of the class took there seats as class begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami knew Misao was just being Misao, but she irritated her just as much as Konata did, but with Konata it was a litle differen now and Kagami hadn't seen much of either Misao or Ayano over the summer as she was spending alot of it with Konata or her family and Ayano was gone on a family trip. So she knew it was kind of her fault for not being ready for Misao and her statements, but she also knew Misao didn't mean any harm ever with them. For now she focused on class and would try to catch up on things with those two later and hang with Konata and the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be some kind of year, but im ready for it\" Kagami said to herself.</span></div></div>",

They both smiled and moved on as Kagami was up again in the next event. She ran as hard she could and then leaped as far as she could and landed in the sand, but as she landed lost her blanace and fell flat on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing is save from her\" Konata said to herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a rough one for Kagami and Tsukasa didn't fair much better as she blowed through every obstacle as she lost track of her steps. Miyuki on the other hand did very well winning the relay race for there class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wasn't going to do this event at first until I told her about her curves\" Konata said and all Kagami could say was \"That's something a middle aged guy would say\" it kind of creepd her out a little, but that's Konata for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami was exhausted more than she ever has been before sweating all over. The white t shrit she had on didn't to much for her big belly as it didn't really fit as well as she hoped. The shorts very tight covering her big wide jiggly butt. Konata then came over with some water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No matter what you did great Kagami\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks I did my best phew im glad it's over I never want to do this ever again phew\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your such a cute fat butter ball\" Konata said before hugging Kagami. Kagami hugged back and then they both kissed. Kagami didn't have much energy left to respond back to that comment, but she had enough for the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Im hungry let's go celebrate\" is all Kagami could say next<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it let's get Tsukasa and Miyuki first\" Konata said back<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all it wasn't to bad for Kagami as she never had been this big and had to go through a sports fest at her size as it could of been worse and she really did try her best.</span></div></div>",

Afterwards everyone went off to help participate in there own class events. <br>\r\nKagami and Konata were the last ones to take off and as they walked hands held together as it was no secret they were a couple and they didn't mind showing it either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well that went great!\" Konata said with a impressed excited smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yeah I can't believe we were able to pull it off so well especially me\" Kagami said back happily and a little relieved as well.  She jiggled all over that stage very hypnotic like one could say as it was an interesting sight to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ill always have these pics to remember it\" Konata said with a huge grin as she showed Kagami the photos on her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Konata when did you what the please don't send those out to anyone\" Kagami said  frantically while blushing wildly.<br>\r\nThey were of Kagami in her cheerleader outfit and it was pretty tight on her considering how fat she was with her belly sticking out and big boobs bouncing about not looking to bad either. The other pic was of Kagami's big wide butt and a nice view it was as it showed her green striped underwear as the outfit didn't cover it up to well. There was even a photo of Kagami stuffed in her shrine maiden outfit. She had a fun time walking around and trying to fit into that during new years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry I would never do that\" Konata said as she then gave Kagami a kiss \"I love you my cute tsundere Kagamin\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"sigh always calling me that, but I love you to my cute little otaku\" Kagami then said as she leaned in to give Konata a kiss and Konata blushed quite well  especially when Kagami called her that which Kagami loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well time to tell some fortunes\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodluck and have fun\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go be the best monster you can be at your haunted house ill swing by later\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah ill look forward to seeing you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami and Konata then went down seperate halls, but Konata had one last thing to say \"I got a fortune for you right now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really let's hear it\" Kagami eagerly said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ill always be with you ill love you forever\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami couldn't hold back as tears began to form \"Kona Konata ill always be with you ill love you forever to\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey embraced in a warm hug and then Kagami noticed something<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey a little low there aren't you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well im not that tall after all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I meant\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know nothing gets by you, sorry, but I just couldn't resist that big butt of yours\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami giggled a little and then replied \"I never said I didn't mind\" Konata then giggled a little herself and blushed a little to before they went on there way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCulture fest went well for all and before you know it graduation came and Miyuki was hosting the graduation party and let's just say Konata had to worry about her dad not creeping anyone out about some of the stuff he says or comments on so she wasn't able to be with Kagami as much as she wanted until later as Konata insisted on seeing Kagami home which ended up in her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You rock and so do your big squishy boobs\" Konata said happily which made Kagami blush with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hey have you gotten fatter?\"  Konata questioned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I may have gained a few\" Kagami replied back as she did look much bigger than other times. Some might consider her more than just fat now, but to Konata as always viewed things differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Your so beautiful naked my fat ball of moe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you my sweet sexy otaku\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you to\" and both ended up saying \"Forever and always\" at the same time<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" That's my Kagamin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's my Konata!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe End<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After school hours came and Kagami and Tsukasa went straight home, but Kagami didn't leave without embracing Konata in a hug which led to a quick, but sweet kiss. <br>\r\nWhen they arrived home they were surprised to see Matsuri greet them as she has been away at college and going on trips with friends so she hasn't really been around at home to much, but what was more surprising was the fact that she had gained some weight and was quite plump and round now, but Kagami was still bigger. Matsuri had a belly sticking out, but not quite as far as Kagami's and her face was chubby and she had her chubby arms and thich thighs, but she had herself a nice big round butt covered by her tight jeans and her boobs weren't bad either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you two how's it going it's been a while hasn't it\" Matsuri said as she greeted them as they walked into the living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it has nice to see you again\" Tsukasa said cheerfully<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatsuri then looked over at Kagami \"Well things must be good for you gained some weight there huh sis\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah whatever what about you your not exactly thin anymore either\" Kagami stated back a little aggitated as her and Matsuri always argued the most and haven't always been the closest of sisters compared to how Kagami is with Tsukasa and Inori. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but ive been trying to lose it it's not always easy, but at least I haven't given up like you\" Matsuri said and Kagami fired right back once again all while Tsukasa stood there in silence looking a bit nervous of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yeah so what I did try to lose it, but I didn't give up I just didn't lose it that's all. Im a fat cow big deal im not complaning im actually happy yes I still am and I still eat healthy yet, but I just don't worry about it anymore and it's a nice change of pace and im still your sister Kagami\". Kagami said all that with confidence and Matsuri wasn't sure what to say next, but just then Inori along with Miki and Tadao walked in with dinner \"Hey everyone were back let's eat\"  and everyone ate and chatted away, but Kagami stayed pretty silent most of the time and not much was said on Matsuri's weight gain though Inori may have commented on it later with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami was in her room when she got a knock on her door as it was Matsuri. Kagami was reluctant to open it at first, but did anyway and that's when Matsuri spoke up <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Kagami about earlier I didn't mean\" Kagami cut her off and quickly said \"It's alright it's over now and im fine\". She knew that she had probably talked with Inori and Tsukasa and explained why she was in her room now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really shouldn't of said anything im just dumb sometimes I guess. Ive gained alot to im fat and it's not always easy trying to lose it and it just happend so fast before I realized it and well im hoping it's not to late, but hey they warn you about this kind of stuff happening when you go off to college sigh, but I guess I went a little to far though I wasn't worried about anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami was a little shocked that Matsuri was actually talking with her and trying to explain and apoligize as Matsuri isn't always the best at that kind of thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean ive been doing my best with my studies I haven't forgotten about any of that at all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami finally decided to speak up \"maybe you were under alot of stress maybe it got to you a little it happnes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatsure then replied \"Yeah maybe I just never expected to see you so big and that was some response you gave me was it really all true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami answered \" Well yeah after a while I just got used to it I guess im just ok with it I don't mind and I just carried on with everything\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatsuri smiled \"You do seem happy and full of confidence as usual and that's great\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could lose it if I wanted to, but I... just like it this way im fat I know and im ok with it.\" Kagami said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatsuri and Kagami actually continued to chat the rest of the night about other things and at the end perhaps got on better terms with each other more than ever before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Matsuri got up to leave Kagami had one last thing to say to her <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to lose it then go for it keep going don't give up you can do it, but you don't look that bad\" Kagami blushed a little after that last part and maybe it was a little unexpected of her as Matsuri was also blushing a little not expecting to hear her say that last part either \"Oh uh thanks, thanks alot!\" Matsuri replied with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and nice seeing you and thanks for talking Matsuri\" Kagami said also with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure no problem, but your bigger than me so you suck\" Matsuri said sticking her tongue out and laughing and Kagami could only laugh and smile to.</span></div></div>",

Misao screamed which Konata didn't find to pleasing, but just ignored it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Matsuri arrived and then it began and they started scarfing down all the tasty treats as much as possible they really went at it for a while \"Give up\" Matsuri said with her mouth full \"No way ive gone to far now\" Kagami quickly said before pushing more food into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually it ended with Kagami victorious and Matsuri exhausted and full with her head resting on the table in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh I don't feel so good maybe this wasn't such a good idea\" Matsuri said as she got up slowly. Kagami was quite full herself, but was able to handle it a little better than Matsuri. \"ugh so full, but you did better than I thought you would ill give you that are you happy now?\" Kagami said to Matsuri as she walked away and all she could say was \"No more food please no more ugh im going to go rest\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll everyone could do was laugh after that. Miyuki than chimed in \"You certainly can eat Kagami shan that was quite impressive\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah no kidding Hiiragi that was amazing did you see that Ayano did ya did ya\" Misao shouted excitedly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Misao I did wel nice job Kagami see you later. Let's go Misao\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone began to leave and Tsukasa started cleaning up the mess in the kitchen while Konata helped Kagami to her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my Kagamin! Great job I knew you could do it!\" Konata said once she shut the door to Kagami's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah thanks\" is all Kagami said and that's when she noticed her skirt had ripped a little \"are you kidding me geez I just got this one\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Kagami leaned in and planted a kiss on Konata's lips catching her off guard <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was probably one of the sweetest and tastiest kisses ive ever had\" Konata said with a big smile on her face as Kagami's lips were still covered with frosting. Kagami only said \"Im glad you liked it\" Konata then licked Kagami's face which made her blush beat red \"Wha what the Konata!\" Konata only said \"You had some frosting on your cheek\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both then laughed as Tsukasa walked in \"What's so funny guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing\" Konata said with her cat like grin <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah don't worry about it\" Kagami replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukasa just looked a little confused as they continued to laugh and enjoy the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you my fat Kagamin\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you to my little otaku\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe End</span></div></div>",

I'm so full.\" Kagami patted her taut yet still soft belly, which was making her shirt ride up quite a bit. She then realized something.<br>\r\n'Wait a second' she thought, as all the times she stuffed herself silly in the last days came into her mind,'Of course I'm getting fat, I've been eating like a pig. I've gotta stop this. No more sweets until I'm thin again, and I'm gonna begin exercising right now.' With this in mind, Kagami got up as quickly as her stuffed state allowed her to and went to her room to change her school uniform for something that wasn't threatening to rip any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing upstairs was a bit harder than it should have been, and once she got to her room she opened the closet looking for some sweatpants and a sweatshirt. It was quite relieving for Kagami once she got into something more comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'm gonna start right away, one thing is obsessing over being thin and a very different one is turning into a cow. Let's start with 30 sit-ups.\" Kagami said to herself as she finished putting her dieting gear on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami sat down on her room's floor and got ready to start. Now, a couple weeks ago Kagami would have been able to do 30 sit-ups without any major problems; she used to do 25 everyday, but now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Siiiix, seeeeven, *huff* eeeeeiight, ni-niiiiiine, *puff*.... T-te... Teee... Well, nine and a half... I, I'll do a few more tomorrow.\" Kagami's round face was turning a very unhealthy shade of red, and she felt like her abs were on fire. \"It's just because I just ate, I'll rest a little bit and go jogging a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Kagami tried jogging too, and also she failed, lasting barely more than 5 minutes, huffing, puffing, and sweating like she hadn't for quite a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Pant, pant* Ok, I think this is enough for today.\" Kagami muttered as she got home. As she opened the door, she was overwhelmed by a delicious smell coming from the kitchen. She went to check, and saw her mother and sister setting up the table. The food was quite abundant, plenty enough for her whole family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Kagami\" Her mother said, \"You come just in time for dinner. There's a bit more than usual because your father was supposed to come with a friend, but it turns out they won't be coming. Go change,Tsukasa's just finishing making the cake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami turned to her sister. \"You made another one?\" She asked, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the one before was supposed to be for tonight's dinner, but I had to make another one since, you... ate it all...\" Tsukasa answered sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami blushed at hearing this and gave a small nod before heading to her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs Kagami able to resist temptation, or will she fail in her diet.?</span></div></div>",

She didn't have to wait for Tsukasa today as she decided to go with Konata to Gamers. Once she got home she quickly changed into her jogging outfit, but not quick enough as she was about to leave a rumble of thunder was heard followed by a flash of lightning and then pouring rain. Kagami wasn't thrilled at all about this situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it you got to be kidding me I don't believe it. It just has to rain right when im about to go for my run great just great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami didn't have much else to do and no one was home, but her so she decided to change into something a little more comfortable and just read the newest light novel she bought the other day. She then noticed she had a few boxes of pocky left over and ended up eating every box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn I ran out guess ill head to the kitchen and make something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Kagami headed to the kitchen and started shuffling through things trying to find whatever she could to make a great snack. She ended up carring a tray with chips, soda, cake, and probably the biggest sandwhich she ever made in her life and sat down and watched tv. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just fantastic it tastes so good\" Kagami happily said as she finally finished the last bite of cake. Just then the door opened and Tsukasa came walking in and happily said. \"Hey sis how are you doing\" which Kagami replied \"Oh im doing ok I didn't get to run cause of the rain so ive just been relaxing what about you how was it with Konata?' Tsukasa sheepishly replied \"Oh it was interesting and lets just leave it at that ok.' Kagami sighed and knew what she meant as it was always something crazy with Konata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukasa then decided to bake some cookies which Kagami was very pleased to hear as she loved her sisters baking.</span></div></div>",

I gained even more crap how did that happen. Ok calm down it will be fine nothing I can't handle it will be gone before you even know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then went downstairs to have breakfast which her mom had already set for her toast, scrambled eggs, and coffee for Kagami orange juice for Tsukasa. Kagami was more of the mature responsible one after all until it came to food.<br>\r\nShe asked for a little more eggs than usual this time around which her mom was a little surprised about, but thought nothing of it that's when Tsukasa spoke up. \"Hey sis is it me or have you been eating a little bit more than usual these past few days.\" Kagami a little irritated by that, but also blushed a little simply said \"No it's not that much or anything don't worry about it everything's fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh ok sis if you say so\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami finished breakfast read the paper and headed to her room and examined herself a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's not that much a little soft here and there, but nothing major everything's fine and ill lose it I know I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami then got ready to enjoy the rest of her day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her arms were as flabby as can be along her chubby fingers. Her thighs had some meat on them for sure now and were as thick as tree trunks and they touched and jiggled everytime she would walk. Her face rounded out pretty nicely actually and her chubby cheeks were just asking to be pinched. And last, but not least her rear had gotten pretty wide and it was hard to cover underneath a skirt and it went to the beat of it's own. <br>\r\nShe pretty much jiggled all over and was just as Konata put it a cute ball of dough which made Kagami blush rapidly everytime. <br>\r\nKagami one night just stared down at the scale in silence before sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I can't believe this happend how did I let it get this far what happend\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then walked to her room grabbed a donut from the box she left at her desk, but instead of eating it she stared at it and then saw herself in the mirror and then threw the donut at the mirror and watched it smash on impact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMN IT!\" she shouted as she was just angry and upset with herself and then thought to herself <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Look at you look how fat you are why just why\" she started to tear up a little and then she heard a knock on her door.

However it did mean she could go downstairs without fear of her parents catching her. So she went downstairs, dressed in her pyjamas that was a bit tighter than it used to be, particularly the top as a small belly was poking out from under it, Kagami tried to ignore it as she reached the fridge and opened it to look what there was to eat. Immediatly she saw that the desert was still there, a large triple chocolate fudge cake with only one large slice taken out of it which she had earlier. Kagami remembered that no one else wanted some just yet as they were full from dinner hence why there was so much left. She remembered the rich taste of the desert and her mouth watered slightly, eagerly she removed the entire cake from the fridge as well was some whole cream.<br>\r\n\"alright, just one slice will do\" she said to herself getting a plate and cutting off an overly generous slice and then covering it in the cream as she got a spoon to eat it. Immediatly she dug in, moaning slightly at the incredibly delicious taste as her stomach called out for more and more, and soon enough she found that she had finished the slice already.<br>\r\nUnable to control herself Kagami took another slice and repeated the process, proceeding to take another and another until eventually she had devowered the entire cake and all the cream and she lent back in her chair rubbing her full and bloated belly, chocolate all around her mouth as well as down her shirt and a bit on her belly.<br>\r\n\"ohhh my god...\" she groaned rubbing her belly \"that was so delicious...\" when suddenly.</span></div></div>",

Although Kagamis guess could be off since so much fat on such a small frame tends to be misleading. You\u2019d guess that the small bluenette weight as much as Kagami did, possibly more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami noticed that unlike herself whose weight was mostly in her hips, butt and thighs, Konatas weight was mostly in her stomach, Kagami couldn\u2019t take her eyes of it, the way it was causing Konatas shirt to ride up was strangely alluring, and on closure inspection, she could notice Konatas quite prominent love handles. Of course, this wasn\u2019t to say that other parts of Konata didn\u2019t bulk up too with the rest of her; after all, Konata now had breasts, rather sizeable ones too! Thick thighs that were thick enough to count as three of her old, skinny legs. Not to mention her once shapeless butt was now, as Kagami thought; \u201cAbsolutely enormous\u201d, although not was wide as her own, Konatas rump seemed a little bigger than Kagamis\u2026 which made her a bit more jealous than it should have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, earth to the purple haired tsundere!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHu-wha what?!\u201d Kagami blurted out as Konata brought her out of the trance she fell into, Konata was waving her hands in front of Kagami\u2019s face, causing her arm fat to jiggle almost hypnotically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m here! Quit waving your hand infront of me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhehe~\u201d a sly grin formed on Konatas lips as she gazes up at the chubby, well, perhaps more than \u201cjust chubby\u201d twintailed girl, who watched in delight as her face went a bright shade of crimson as she suddenly grabbed Kagamis belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey!

Tsukasa couldn\u2019t help but giggle as she watched the two girls interact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018This dream is crazy\u2026\u2019 Kagami mentally sighed; it seemed as if fatness was encouraged in this dream world of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyhoo!\u201d Konata said as she stepped away from Kagami. \u201cI was going to just copy- er\u2026 I mean <i>borrow </i>your notes from class, but I can\u2019t stand to see my friend waste away like this!\u201d She then proudly proclaimed, probably a bit too proudly, and then turned to Tsukasa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCare to help me cook for your sister?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018There\u2019s no way she\u2019ll actually say yes, this is insane...\u2019 Kagami thought as she watched the scene unfold in front of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, ok!

What brings you to my humble abode?\" Konata exclaimed while waving hello.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, we are in the middle of the street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Akihabara, where otakus, such as myself, reign supreme.\" The bluenette proclaimed proudly. She looked around for a second, and then asked, \"But what is this!? I see a cute little imoto buying merchandising, but I don't see the matching, and equally cute, tsundere onee-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukasa giggled a little at the shorter girl's antics,\"No, Onee-chan didn't come with me. I asked her if she wanted to, but she said she had put on some weight and had to work out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, that's no good, she's always missing out because of her silly diets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I suppose it's important for her. She always has such a hard time keeping her weight in check, since she really likes sweets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata shook her head slowly,\"That's true, I wish she didn't diet so often...\" The girl seemed to be lost in thought for a second, when she suddenly perked up, \"Hey Tsukasa, don't you think it's a real shame?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what is?\" The purple haired girl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that Kagami is always missing out because of her diets.\" Konata replied, \"I mean, it's a real pity that she has to use so much of her time exercising, only because she has such an appetite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess, but I can understand her. She wants to have a nice body and be happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But is she really happy?\" The bluehead replied, perplexing Tsukasa,\"We both know she hates exercising. Doesn't she always seem a bit miserable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukasa's face became thoughtful,\"Yes, that's true, she's always so upset when she has to diet, I feel really bad for her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. On the other hand, when is Kagami at her happiest?\" Konata questioned her friend, who seemed unable to come up with an answer, \"When she's eating! Kagami has a huge appetite and a real sweet tooth, I don't think I've ever seen her as happy as she looks when we go to that one cake buffet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukasa seemed to be struck by realization, \"You are right Kona-chan! She is really happy then. If only she could eat like that without worrying about her weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata got a sly and sharp look on her face at that moment, but Tsukasa didn't catch it, \"You know what? I think there is a way! She won't worry about her weight anymore if she is already fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukasa blinked twice before exclaiming, \"Whaaaat?? What are you saying Kona-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it Tsukasa, Kagami is miserable because she has to diet all the time, but if she gets fat, she won't worry anymore, and she'll be able to eat happily. Sure, she won't like it at first, but give her some time, and she'll love it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You-you really think so?\" Tsukasa stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know so! And this is what we are gonna do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...............................................................<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since Konata and her had that conversation, Tsukasa had been doing all she could to make her sister gain weight, in hope of bringing her happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will happen next?</span></div></div>",

This wouldn't be a proper meal, just incredible servings of all the cakes, foods, and other sweets that Kagami liked. She made items including, but not limited to: Kobe beef, omurice, udon, rice balls with butter and salt, chocolate cakes, pies, and donuts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole thing took several hours of multitasked cooking. She neglected her homework, but felt a different sense of accomplishment as she emerged from the kitchen. Her sister would eat well tonight and  be happy. Tsukasa wanted to see her sister brighten up at all that food. Also, she secretly wanted to test her appetite level. She could report the results to Konata in an email!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami emerged grumpily from her room after doing homework. She would have to exercise a little, and then take a bath, and the stress piles up all over again tomorrow-- Hey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsukasa, what is all this?\" she asked, looking quizzically at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami gave her an incredulous look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kinda overdid it. You will eat it right?\" She gave her sister her patented puppy dog eyes, filled with the encoded with a message. Don't leave any leftovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami got the message, and smiled at her sister. She was a bit of a clutz, but she put her all into everything, especially the way she expressed familial love. Besides, Kagami noticed that the table was filled with her favorites! Her grin split open wide as she bit into a surprisingly unhealthy rice ball. She didn't really know how hungry she was, but she wasn't going to let reasoning interfere separate her from this particular meal. She proceeded with gusto.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In comparison, Tsukasa had a bowl of udon. Kagami thought that was too little. \"Don't you want to eat more, Tsukasa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry sister, I made plenty for both of us. Just eat your fill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she did. In particular, the rice balls had plenty of unique flavor, since they were prepared differently. Kagami felt like she could eat about 100 of them. So the plate of rice balls was one of the first things to go into Kagami's belly. At times, she had one in each hand. She wasn't sure if Tsukasa had any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings continued like this. Tsukasa had taken to sitting with her sister, sipping on an ice tea, and observing the manner in which Kagami ate. The twin-tailed girl was always proper. She took her time eating not too slowly or too quickly, giving Tsukasa compliments along the way. When she looked at food, her eyes glistened, and whenever she could, she made an effort to smile.   Tsukasa kept serving helpings, too. It seemed never-ending until she finally reached the bottom of every container, and all that was left was the plates of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you can finish, sister,\" Tsukasa said, smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth of it was that her stomach felt like a roller coaster of pain. Right now, she felt bloated and full, but she wondered if she could find a second stomach for these leftovers. She would have to work past the hurt, but how often was she invited to eat like this? Her sister literally did all the work. She thought she was doing right by her sister by eating it all. And the twin tailed girl was always working out and dieting, so a bit of spoiling was healthy. All ready for it, she told her sister it was ok: \"I can, but it hurts right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukasa went around the table and boldly went for the clasp of Kagami's skirt. Somehow, Tsukasa's fingers found the way between that distended belly and the table, mere centimeters apart.Kagami let out a grunt as her skirt loosened and her belly dropped, free from restriction. Kagami turned her head toward the motherly girl, who was looking over the shoulder, and saw that she was blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I needed that.\" She put her hand on her belly and patted it. Now that the food had been jostled a bit, she was confident she had room to finish. And eventually, with the last bite of chocolate cake down, she finished. It went down easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aftermath consisted of a warning to Tsukasa not too make that again for at least a year. Her appetite and her waistline could not bail her out every single time. Tsukasa apologized while saying something about how fun the next \"Kagami challenge\" would be, whatever that was. Although, Kagami did wonder if she would be the same after this experience. She literally wolfed down more than she had ever eaten before. She would have to accept that she would look bigger at school tomorrow. </span></div></div>",

That morning, she had discovered the effects of the feast Tsukasa had made for her, which, combined with the 15 pounds she had already gained, added up to a rather embarrassing reality...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------(Earlier that morning)------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C\u00b4moooon... Almost there... This can't be happening!\" Kagami struggled as she tried to make the clasps on her skirt meet properly. Her overeating had added enough weight to her waist and hips that the skirt, which had only been somewhat tight the day before, had become a real challenge wear. Much to Kagami's chagrin, none of the weight seemed to have gone to her chest, as her bra fit perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go!\" With great effort, the twin-tailed girls was able to finally fit into her skirt. Her relief was short-lived, though, as she looked into the mirror, she saw that the muffin top that had formed because of her tight skirt made her shirt ride up, allowing anybody to see her tummy peeking out whenever she wasn't completely still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my goodness! This is my largest uniform shirt.\" Kagami tried to arrange the shirt in a way that it wouldn't show her belly, but it was useless. Seeing how there was absolutely nothing she could do about it, Kagami resigned herself, and decided to go to school that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------(Back to the present)---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be completely fair, nobody had commented on her gain or her small clothes for now, so perhaps it wasn't as noticeable as she thought...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kagamiiiiiiiinnnn!!!\" The purple-haired girl grimaced when she heard the familiar voice calling her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Kona-chan\" Tsukasa greeted the petite bluenette, none the wiser to her sister's distress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Tsukasa! And hello Kagamin, how is my favorite tsun-\" Konata stopped talking mid-sentence, as she seemed to focus on Kagami. After a second, her eyes widened, but her surprise was quickly replaced by a smug cat-like smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, my, somebody's been enjoying herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami winced as she saw her worst fears coming true,\"Wha-what do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, don't be like that, you know what I mean. It seems there's a bit more of you to love...\" Konata poked her friend's showing belly,\"...here...\" Quick in as only the little otaku could be, she moved right behind Kagami and poked both of her sides, where small love handles were forming,\"---and here too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami's face turned beet red as she yelled, \"Stop that, you little freak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata backed off and put her hands in front on her,\"Calm down, Kagami, I'm just having some fun.

I don't want to stay this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, but I mean it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not talking about this anymore.\" Kagami had more important things to think about, like P.E. that morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.E. represented an opportunity to get things back to normal. She would get in a lot of exercise during class, and focus on getting back to her normal weight. Kagami was naturally blessed with a huge appetite. While she couldn't eat a feast like the yesterday everyday, and she would never admit it, she ate about a third of it in comfort. She keeps herself in check by eating less than she actually could and exercising. If you hung around her long enough, you discover that is her lifestyle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGym class itself was a bumpy road. The highlight of the class was radio calisthenics, which everyone did to warm up, and she found that relaxing and easy to do. At the same time though, she was in the gymnasium in ill-fitting gym clothes, and she felt pressure from her bloomers on her tummy whenever she bent her knees. She was so fat! She was tired of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen when they had to play basketball--why did the teacher want to do that today of all days--she was worse at it than usual. In her minds eye, she saw herself bouncing up and down the court, adipose all out of control, and too be honest, it wasn't too far from the truth. Her new center of gravity made everything feel awkward. She even bumped into her teammate, Misao.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friend made the incident into a joke. She bounced off Kagami's left love-handle in an exaggerated fashion, stumbling into the court: \"Waaah! Hiiragi!\" Everyone laughed, but Kagami was unamused, somewhat angry, and embarrassed. Her face was flush with anger. The teacher took notice, and yelled at her for disrupting the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother high point was the exercises at the end of the period. These were also easy for Kagami to do. Yet, they were made difficult for the blunette paired with her. There was one exercise Konata discovered was hard with someone significantly heavier than you. Kagami and Konata put their backs to each other and interlinked arms. The object was to lean forward and lift the other person onto your back, and come back down, and go the other way. Konata felt the brunt of the 20 pounds that Kagami put on recently. Even though Kagami could help her, she was still so heavy! Was this revenge for this morning? The pressure was so immense she started to doubt that 20 pounds was an accurate guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami had a few more classes before lunch, but she had a hard time paying attention. She could not stop thinking about how hungry she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, when lunch rolled around, she ate her bento box quickly. The rice and vegetables and fried eggs were not very filling. While she was talking with her friends. Kagami only noticed that her bento was empty when she brought empty chopsticks to her mouth. She was kind of surprised by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So yeah, Misao acted like a jerk today in gym--\" <i>GROWL.</i> Kagami's tummy interrupted the conversation.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm trying to diet, so I didn't bring much today.\" Lied Kagami, who had brought a completely regular-sized bento,\"It's normal that I'm still a bit hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Kagamin! That's no good, you shouldn't starve yourself, especially when dieting.\" The little bluehead replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean \"especially when dieting\"? It's ok being hungry while dieting, and I had lunch, so I'm not starving myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's wrong. Tell her, Miyuki-san, isn't it bad to be hungry after meals when dieting?\" Konata turned to her bespectacled friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, well, Konata has a point.\" She replied, shocking Kagami,\"It is true that you shouldn't eat much during a diet, but if you are still hungry after a meal, you  are much more prone to snacking, or even binge eating, which can spoil the diet much worse than a bit extra lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami stared at Miyuki for a few seconds as she assimilated this new information. It made sense really. Other people might  be able to go on hungry until dinner, but for her huge appetite and questionable self-control, this was a huge hazard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then I wouldn't mind having some more, but I already ate everything.\" She admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahaha! Do not worry my not-so-little Kagamin! I have come to save the day and satiate your great hunger!\" Konata exclaimed in an overly dramatic manner,\"You can have what's left of mine, I already had my fill.\" She presented her bento box to the twin-tailed girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami, while a bit annoyed by Konata's introduction, was shocked at her kindness, \"Are you sure?\" The shorter girl nodded. Kagami looked at the bento and felt her stomach grumble. It looked delicious, and Konata had barely eaten a quarter of it, She was pretty sure it was bigger than her own bento initially. \"Well then, if you don't mind...\" She reached for the box, but Konata moved it out of her reach. \"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be mad Kagamin. You can have the whole box, on one condition.\" The little otaku explained, allowing a dramatic pause,\"You must let me feed it to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody was a bit surprised by the request, but Kagami was the first to recover and answer, \"What!? No way! I'm not gonna have you feed me for a little extra food, I'd rather go hungry!\" She exclaimed, outraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, are you sure Kagamin? It is really good, and it's got tiny sausages, i know you like them... It would be a waste throwing it away.\" Konata taunted Kagami, nearing the bento to her face, so she could smell it. Kagami's stomach replied by growling loudly,\"You know you want to~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami really wanted to, and the smell and sight of the bento had made her even hungrier. At any rate, if she didn't eat it now, she doubted she would last until dinner, but being fed by Konata would be so humiliating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is her reply?</span></div></div>",

So she would let Konata do what she wanted. \"OK, I'll let you feed me, just let me have it,\" Kagami stated. \"D-D-Don't make this embarrassing!\" Her cheeks were flush, and she was being adorably nervous about the whole decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make things easier, Konata moved her seat to Kagami's side so she didn't have to carry food across the table in order to deliver it to Kagami's delicate mouth.

Things were off to a pleasant start. She sure loved eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big lunchbox had enough rice in it to put a big dent in her appetite. The same could be said for the delicious sausages, friend chicken, eggs, and side dishes. This lunch had a lot of everything. It was definitely enough for Konata, who, in the twin-tailed girl's opinion, had a pretty small, enviable appetite. Her father must be trying to stimulate her growth. That, or Konata planned this. Was she really that clever or lucky...? Whatever. At least this was the kind of meal Kagami needed. After two whole bentos (one of them being extra big) she was finally reaching her limit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed some encouragement to finish the meal the blunette donated. The little otaku didn't mind. \"C'mon, Kagamin! There's only a little bit left. You like chicken.\" Kagami adjusted her seating position. Her blouse, feeling strained all day, and now dealing with an even plumper, more taut stomach, let out an ominous creak. She hadn't been able to cover her stomach all day, now how much pressure do you think her belly is exerting? Those poor buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhn...\" Konata goaded, dangling the chicken in front of her face. Kagami reluctantly opened her mouth. Konata placed the food in her friend's waiting maw. Kagami could only focus on how sleepy she felt as she finally finished off lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a deep exhale. \"Haaaah...\" Her blouse had seen better days, and just didn't have any more room to deal with this. So the bottom two buttons just popped off, making both girls alert. Kagami was immediately embarrassed and aware of the whole classroom. She looked ready to cry. She was just off in her own world while she was being fed like a pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata massaged Kagami's belly once again. \"Doesn't that feel better? I am sure your full now!\" Konata was being so smug and loving it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami didn't do anything about the annoying hand, she had more pressing concerns. Grabbing her friend's shoulders, she said in alarm, \"Konata! I can't wear this anymore! What do I do?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata saved the day by excusing herself and her friend from the classroom. Once they were in private, she let the ballooning tsundere borrow an oversized sweater that was sure to accommodate the cutie. Konata tried her best to calm her friend down before returning to class, saying things like, \"don't be so hard on yourself,\" \"no one will make fun of you, I promise,\" and even, \"You're cuter than you realize!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who knows how the rest of the day would go. Konata certainly felt accomplished with these events. Her plan to make Kagami realize she can live the way she wants by helping her gain weight was happening. And Kagami had the impression she shouldn't keep Konata's sweater, even if it did fit her better. And... covered everything...</span></div></div>",

The sweater she got from Konata covered her perfectly, and although it would have been terribly oversized for Konata, it actually fit the purple-haired girl like a glove, yet doing nothing to conceal the outward curve of her stomach, in fact, it actually made it more noticeable (Horizontal stripes and all). She did have to wonder, though, why would the little otaku carry around such a large sweater? She chose not to give it much thought, and decided to return it to Konata after school, once she got something off her own wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last part turned out not to be as simple as he first thought. Once she got home, she head straight up to her bedroom, and started rummaging through her wardrobe looking for something to wear. She quickly discarded button-up shirts, since, although, her stomach was noticeably less bloated, she didn't want to risk it, and putting them on would probably be a challenge. She tried on a few regular t-shirts, but none seemed to be completely able to cover her growing muffin top. Eventually, Kagami found a flowy top that could cover her belly completely, and actually made it much less noticeable, unlike the sweater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought of taking off her rather tight skirt and look for something else, but after taking so long to find a top, she wasn't really feeling up to it. She frowned at the chubby (though rather cute, she had to admit) girl on the mirror one last time, put Konata's sweater in a bag, and headed for her friend's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Knock knock* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door was opened by Soujiro Izumi, Konata's father, a thin man with blue hair dressed in old timey clothes. \"Oh, hello Kagami, are you looking for Konata?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes, Izumi-san, I wanted to give this back to her.\" She said, turning her head to the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well come on in. She's in her room upstairs, you know the way.\" The man said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Izumi-san\" Kagami said respectfully, before going walking past the man and going upstairs.<br>\r\nSoujiro stood there for a couple seconds, a thoughtful look on his face, 'She looks a bit different? Did she put on some weight?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami opened the door to Konata's room. usually she would knock before going into anyone else's private room, but this was Konata, and she didn't really see the point. Unsurprisingly, the bluenette was on the computer, and turned around at the sound of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello Kagamin! What a nice surprise.\" She said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Konata. I just wanted to give you back the sweater, thanks for letting me borrow it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you Kagamin, but don't worry about it, keep it, you look great in it...</span></div></div>",

But lately events had taken her down a peg, and she no longer felt justified being upset by such statements. \"You're not wrong,\" she admitted, tracing the shape of her burgeoning belly. Right now, Kagami looked a bit rounder, but still a lot like her old self. \"But I can't wear that! It reminds me of all the places I have extra flab, and it's not pleasant. I wish some of this would go to my chest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, Kagami, you want big breasts like Miyuki?\" :3<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! Well, at least I would be bigger where it counted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata put the topic back on track. \"You would really help me out if you would take the sweater for me though, cause it's too big for me, and my dad can't wear it. I got some other stuff I need to get rid of anyway.\" She took a look at Kagami's tight, constrictive skirt and suggested, \"Let's get you into something besides that skirt. It's about to explode.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami reappeared in a large pair of skinny, dark blue jeans to match the purple striped top. Kagami felt fashionable so she did a little twirl. \"Thanks for the clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, conversation died down while Konata whooped her at some video games. Kagami didn't really like them, but the only other person she really played multiplayer with was her dad. At least, he was around the most, so things worked out that way. Kagami obliged her out of pity mostly. She really wished Konata would apply herself more, think about the future a little more. Their future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started playing a fashion game, where you dress up people and try to make money modeling. This sparked a conversation about how Kagami shouldn't live for sake of appearances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm real short, though. We all have stuff we don't like about ourselves,\" Konata said. She compared heights with Kagami for emphasis, even though it was obvious that the other girl was at least two heads taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you can't control your height like your weight or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sure, but I'm not forcing myself to be something I'm not.\" In reality, Konata liked being short. In fact, she observed that being so short had benefits. The top of her head came to underneath her friend's breasts, so, she imagined that hugs would be extra pillowy from now on. She so badly wanted one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually it came to an end with Kagami understanding Konata's point of view. It's her choice what to eat, but not necessarily how much. That comes down to physical reasons beyond her control. With exasperation, her last comment was to ask how they even got to the topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wondered why all of the people in the game looked so perfect,\" her friend remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs evening fell, the two girls finished their homework. Konata wanted to copy, but her friend insisted on teaching her instead, since the bluenette needed to pass an English test. It wasn't going well. Somehow, Kagami got roped into a deal where, if Konata passed the test, then she would come over for dinner. \"Because I know you like watching me eat for some reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to do that, Kagamin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but everyone around me is so simple. Tskukasa exploits my appetite all the time after she makes mistakes. And you, well, you're just weird. I think this will get you more serious about your schoolwork.\" In her own way, she was looking out for her friends future, even though apparently the only thing she could motivate her friend with was herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a growl of her stomach, she pronounced that she was going home to eat dinner now. Kagami went home with her new clothes not long after.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The otaku quickly reached Kagami, and it was a true mystery how she was able to stop without crashing into the bigger girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Behold!\" Konata spared no time, as she shoved a piece of paper into Kagami's face. \"I emerge victorious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami grabbed the paper and inspected it from a distance better suited for reading. As she read it, her eyes widened and her cherubic face filled with surprise. It seemed to be a test, and on the top right corner one could see a proudly displayed 72% in bright red ink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-?! 72% That's amazing! You actually passed! And with a decent grade too!\" Kagami had always believed that Konata was just lazy, and could probably pass all of her classes if she put some effort, but to go up almost 50 from just a little bit of encouragement was more than she had expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, my dear Kagamin. The horrible lord of English has been defeated by the dashing hero! And now there's nothing between her and and the lovely princess!\" Konata declared dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami stared at her with a dead-pan expression, glad that her friend had passed, but kind of worried of what would come next. \"Yeah, congratulations... You should really study more often, you could get much better grades.\" She said, trying to avoid the topic of Konata's reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps. But there's something more important right now! You are coming over for dinner tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami winced a little, knowing there was no way around it. \"Yeah, yeah, I'll be there, just give me a call when you want me to get there.\" Kagami new it would be a big dinner, and she rubbed her soft belly with both dread and excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohoh, I see you can't wait. Don't worry, I'll make a nice big dinner, just for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami could only sigh, knowing that her little deal with Konata would cost her another hit to her waistline...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Konata told Soujirou about coming over for dinner. It wasn't hard to convince him to let her do that because they were thick like thieves, but the hard part would be making sure there was enough food. She warned, \"Kagami has a really big appetite, dad. She's recently started to accept that I think. What do you plan on having for dinner? We need a lot of food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis explained a lot. Like when he saw Kagami earlier, it was apparent that she put on a few, and now he knew why. In response to Konata, though, he explained that he wanted to make sukiyaki, beef hot pot, which they could all share. He didn't want to cook much more. He said that any extra food Konata would want to serve she would need to buy. So, basically, Kagami would have a regular meal with Konata and her family, and Kagami would eat another dinner composed of whatever Konata bought or made from her own ingredients. Konata's reward was watching all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata was happy with this. She had trouble containing herself, and danced and sang around the house. It was like she was still playing hero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, she had saved up so much money from work and allowances, that she bought convenience store bentos, oden, and supreme pizzas with everything. This would be the special part of the feast she had prepared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile at home, Kagami had a feast to prepare for, to give her friend the most out of her reward. She decided to keep up her routine: she did her homework, and did a bit of exercise. As hard as working out was, she whet her appetite doing so. She wanted to arrive hungry so she could eat as much as she was expected to by Konata. It was only polite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other part of the feast preparation was picking something out to wear. She could stay in her restrictive uniform and skirt. If she ate enough, she imagined, the zipper might pop and make a hole, revealing her hip. On the other hand, she really wanted to eat in comfort, so she turned to a pair of sweatpants, and put them on, instead, with a fair bit of drawstring left over. Konata would have to pay attention and notice the drawstring getting shorter and shorter as her pants filled out, and gave up their slack. She compromised, and decided to wear her school blouse, so Konata would eventually see straining buttons over her torso. That is if she took her sweater off first. She put on the sweater Konata gave her to complete the look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami looked at herself in the mirror. She looked like a dieting fat girl with nothing better to wear, but tonight, that's exactly how she wanted to look. It was fan service.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was now only waiting for her phone call. It came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Konata's house, Kagami was greeted by fantastic smells. Also greeted by Soujirou and Konata, who all sat down and had a very normal meal together. There was a lot of food on the table but most of it was set aside in favor of the course Konata's dad prepared. Kagami had three servings of sukiyaki, but was, naturally, still famished after that. Soujirou excused himself, planning to bathe and then go to sleep for the night. He was fine as long as the girls did the dishes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata and Kagami were alone. Konata broke the silence: \"You look nice Kagami.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, I was hoping I could keep your attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all for me?\" Kagami asked, changing the subject. The aromas were pervading her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Let's eat it before it gets cold! I hope your hungry.\" She said this as she fetched one of the pizza boxes (with all the toppings). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami's stomach growled in response. Kagami was blushing, but spoke lightheartedly, \"Dinner was small and took no effort to eat.\" The hero laughed and placed a few slices of pizza on her princesses plate.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kagami began eating the pizza slices on her plate, the first one slow and daintily, somewhat embarrassed by Konata's eager expression, but as she went through the first slice, and then the second, she began to become more and more entranced by the flavor flooding her mouth and the need to satiate her rumbling stomach. Small, dainty bites became progressively bigger and faster, the third slice went down her hungry gulled twice faster then the first two combined. The pizza was good, probably one of the best the elder twin ever had, and her stomach wouldn't stop asking for more. Usually, Kagami would be very self-conscious about pigging out on pizza, but there was only Konata there to see her, and she wouldn't judge her. Konata had earned herself a price, and Kagami figured that if she had to eat, she would go all out for once, both for Konata, and to enjoy herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, her attention shifted completely from Konata's smiling face and focused on the endless amount of pizza before her. Four, five, six slices went down, as she started to chow down mercilessly. Kagami finished the first pizza, but before she noticed it, Konata had already placed the second on her plate. Licking her lips, the purple haired girl took one sliced on each hand, and as soon as she voraciously devoured one, she moved to the other, while her free hand grabbed another one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata watched the whole thing in a daze, moving only to refill Kagami's plate. She really hadn't been expecting this kind of behavior from Kagami, not that she was complaining. It was true that Kagami had a big appetite, but the display of sheer gluttony before her was like nothing she had sen before. She watched on awe as her chubby friend finished the second pizza, showing no signs of slowing down. It seemed that Kagami's extra pounds had really affected her appetite, as Konata could never picture her eating two pizzas before. The way the girl devoured slice after slice, her chubby cheeks always full, her sweatpants slowly stretching as her belly pushed against the sweater; it was... enticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami's onslaught on the pizza only came to a stop when her hands found no more slices. She looked around her, and only then noticed the three empty pizza boxes.\"Hu...Huh!?\" 'Three whole pizzas? Did I really just-? I didn't even notice!'  As she came out of her daze, Kagami realized she was full, stuffed in fact. Her belly was taut and very noticeable against her sweater. She wasn't hungry anymore, yet, the feeling of fullness in her belly was quite nice, if a bit painful. And that amazing feeling of not caring, of just eating anything she wanted, in which nothing mattered besides the food... She wanted it. She craved it. It had been incredible, and now she needed more! Besides, she was justified, she could always just blame Konata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ok, Kagami?\" Konata asked. \"Are you full?\" Was that a bit of  drool on the otaku's chin?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Ah, yes, I'm fine, just a bit hot.\" And it was true, she was actually quite warm, \"Just let me take this off...\" Kagami removed her sweater, with some effort, and felt an odd mixture of embarassment and pride as Konata's eyes widened and moved to her bloated midsection, tightly covered by her blouse, its buttons strained to the max, and letting a small sliver of flesh visible between it and the sweatpants. \"Now, what's next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata took a second to react, \"Huh? Oh, you mean, you are not full?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami's blush deepened a bit,\"Yeah, but I want more. Besides, you earned it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shorter girls couldn't believe her ears, \"For real? You sure? I don't wanna push you, and if-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Konata.\" The twin-tailed girl cut her off, \"I want more food, and I want it now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata was surprised by her friends demand, but she quickly smiled. 'It seems like my plan is working even better than I expected.' \"At your orders, my lady.\" Konata quickly reached for the bento boxes and handed them over to Kagami, who stared at them for a second, opened one, and continued to chow down almost as fast as she had been minutes ago. ' I'd better get that oden ready, who knows how long those will last.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't last a long time, indeed, and Konata was truly delighted by Kagami's amazing appetite and her expanding belly. She watched, entranced by the display, while she prepared the oden. As soon as the bentos were gone, Konata placed the last dish in front of Kagami, whose blouse was somehow still holding on, but it wouldn't last. Kagami started eating the oden, but Konata could see she was starting to slow down, it would seem this was the perfect amount of food. Although the strain was quite visible on the girl's cherubic face, she managed to finish it all, to the last bite. This last swallow was marked by the noise...</span></div></div>",

The last bit of fish or whatever landed like a bomb in her gut, finding a home within it. This last swallow was marked by the noise of the button closest to Kagami's sweatpants popping. <i>Ping!</i> It collided with the tabletop and made its way in front of Konata. Konata looked down, considering the button for but a moment, and eagerly ogled to her friend's middle, her mouth agape. Her eyes witnessed fireworks beginning. With the weakest link broken, the spare tire that Kagami worked on was fighting for room in her clothes. Pressure mounted on each button as they were fired off at different angles. Some buttons made it to the carpeting; others joined the first one on the table. The shirt clung to her shoulders, pointlessly kept her chest covered, and put her stuffed self on full display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sweatpants weren't doing too good either. The belly was so distended the knots in at the end of the drawstring were the only part available. Kagami had to change her seating position to something more reclined, and leaned back, supporting her tummy by leaning on one of her arms. She was using a toothpick, and she wore a satisfied look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I did it! She's completely full. And it's only going to get harder to stop her appetite!</i> This gave Konata such titillation! What an erotic sight! Konata <b>needed</b> to touch her friend again! In a flash she was there rubbing the silky skin. Pressing it into her fingers. Kagami thought she would never forget this feeling. She even considered not washing that hand for a while. Her face probably looked lustful, perhaps even creepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami, at that moment, belched heartily in her face. \"Serves you right!\" She remarked, then laughed about it. Konata also laughed, ultimately not bothered and probably enjoyed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami immediately regretted laughing: \"Oh, my god, ow. There is literally no room in these.\" She demonstrated by trying to work her fingers into the waistband, and not really succeeding. Then she pulled on the drawstrings a couple of times just to experiment. They peeked out, but whenever she let go her belly pushed them inward. The blunette made a desperate little whimper in response. \"I hope this was worth it to you,\" she said again, shaking her belly up and down. \"Ow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah,\" Konata said. She was still preoccupied, drinking in the sensations. She pinched the sides. She regarded how hefty the middle felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata next noted that they didn't have school the next day. \"Anyway, just stay over. Relax.\" And with another, though more restrained and ladylike belch from Kagami, she added, \"Digest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a bad idea,\" Kagami groaned in agreement as she slowly stood up from the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bath is all yours,\" Konata noted. The blunette had to clear the table and do the dishes, so she set about her task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami tried to have a pleasant bath. She really did digest in there. Not only her food either, but she did some thinking. How she was definitely going to blame Konata if she woke up with a cute, bigger potbelly tomorrow. Konata liking fat girls was a shock that she really wasn't ready to deal with, either. As she ruminated, it brought up her own feelings towards Konata. She was determined to find some courage, and her skin pruned in the process. When she finally emerged, she felt refreshed, happy, even as plump as she was. There was a reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami entered her friend's room, where she would sleep in borrowed PJs. A futon was laid out for her. Feeling naughty, though, she stood at the side of the blunette's futon, and turned around. She squatted in preparation for what she was going to do; her fat heart shaped rump loomed ominously. For no real reason, she was going to sit on her friend. It was petty. Kagami was too amused by the idea though. If there was any turning back, Kagami would need to change her mind now. Thinking of Konata, she rationalized, <i>You'll probably like it, anyway.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe plowed down on the blunette, squishing her briefly. The much smaller girl yelped in surprise! But after Kagami knew she was awake, she slid off her friend and into her own futon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that about?!\" Konata exclaimed in confusion. \"You fell on me like a ton a bricks!!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She tucked herself in, and she turned around, lying on her side, to face Konata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata did not seem to calm down. \"Do you have any idea how heavy you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" Kagami admitted. It had been a while since she stepped on the scale. With her diet working the way it was, she doubted she would be any lighter or around her normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, allow me to explain. You squeezed all the air out of me and put so much pressure on my ribs I couldn't suck any air. I could have died.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry! It was just some fun for me, and I was thoughtless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then quiet for some time, while both parties thought of something to say. Eventually Konata said OK, and things were back to normal. Konata said that she was just surprised, and she didn't want any hard feelings about the incident. She especially did not mind that Kagami was heavier. Shortly thereafter, Kagami wondered if her footfalls sounded heavier, too, like, if there was any way that she could know she was in fact heavier, apart from visual evidence. When she posed it to Konata, changing the subject, the blunette said that people don't get big enough to make booming sounds when they walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your belly is getting really big though,\" said Konata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is, isn't it? It's a regular, old pot belly! I'm afraid I'm getting used to it. All the meals you've been feeding me are good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yoy knew I wanted you to be bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, besides Tsukasa and my eating at home, you feed me. Plus, you always are crazy prepared for me to eat myself out of my clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not mad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami did not really know how to respond to that. She felt like she should be mad, but that wasn't really how she acted. She decided to answer the question with a jovial, but still true, statement: \"I guess it's hard to be mad when you're full all the time.\" She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least you're happy.\" Silence followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata was settling in for a night's sleep, thinking that the conversation was over. She didn't expect Kagami's voice to break the ice. \"You said you didn't want any hard feelings, and that you didn't mind me being heavier,\" Kagami started. \"Does that mean you like what I did to you? Can I--\" Kagami's voice cracked. \"Can I sit on you again in the future? It was fun for me.\"</span></div></div>",

Truth to be told, she didn't really enjoy the experience, but that was because Kagami plopped on her without warning all of the sudden, almost crushing her. If Kagami just sat on top of her, instead of falling on her with all her weight... Well, the idea of feeling the full of Kagami's weight and softness on her small frame was actually quite appealing. Furthermore, Kagami seemed to like it too for some reason. If sitting on her helped her friend accept and enjoy her new size, then she was willing to make the \"sacrifice\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, if you want to.\" She replied, surprising Kagami a little,\"But just sitting on me, not jumping on top of me like before, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-of course! That's what I meant, I don't wanna crush you, or anything!\" Kagami blushed a little. She wasn't sure how she had brought herself to ask, but she hadn't been expecting the blue haired otaku to say yes just like that. Then again, this was Konata, she probably just wanted to have a better place to grope her, but she would get to that later. Kagami was pretty excited that Konata had said yes, although she tried not to show it. It was true that she didn't want to crush her friend, but for a second there, when she felt Konata's tiny frame under her weight, she felt... well, powerful. Konata was kind of a shrimp, had absolutely no upper body strength, and probably weighted little more than half of Kagami's weight. If she sat on her, Konata was pretty much immobilized, and had no way of getting up until Kagami let her, and that thought gave her some interesting feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good, I don't want to become a pancake either. Now that that's settled, good night, Kagamin.\" Konata said as she made herself comfortable for a good night's rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, good night.\"</span></div></div>",

Kagami had talked her into getting down on all fours and being a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUGGGGG!\" came Konata's strained cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata found herself precariously supporting Kagami throughout a terribly huge, early breakfast. Konata and Kagami cooked it together, and the twin-tailed girl included all of her Western favorites. Konata enjoyed cooking with her friend. This was less fun. She was on her hands and knees, compressed by Kagami's fat bum. What a bum it was, too. Konata was small anyways, but, at this point, Kagami took up all the space her friend offered her to sit. It would still be several pounds before her butt was actually wider than the blunett was. However, that was going to be just another leg on Kagami's sweet and gourmet-fueled journey to become a fat girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, a fatter girl, anyway. With her spare tire resting comfortably and permanently in her lap, and with a small shirt on that showed a sliver of belly at all times and sometimes *more*, it was obvious how big she really was. No need to tell Konata this, either. She felt the huge Kagami's plentiful poundage over her. Just how much was Kagami weighing now anyway? It was so hot, Konata thought. She might be nearing 90 kilos (200 pounds) now. She originally asked Kagami to not fall on her out of self-preservation. A correct action, no doubt, but it didn't matter how gingerly Kagami sat on her really. It was going to be hard to put up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami chewed and swallowed. She started hearing Konata's weakness and wheezing, and feeling some shakiness in the legs of her 'chair'. \"You okay, down there?\" Her chair faltered in response. One of Konata's arms desperately needed rest, and the chair herself was surprised at being posed a question. Especially one about her well-being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmhm!\" groaned the blunette, trying extra hard to push the fat girl up. She succeeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another bite, Kagami sang, \"There's only a little breakfast left, you're doing great~!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata swore that she could feel every morsel enter Kagami's body and contribute that much more weight to the ordeal.</span></div></div>",

She enjoyed feeling Kagami's weight on top of her, but she just didn't have the strength to keep this up anymore. Truly, she was hanging in there out of sheer willpower; Kagami had asked her to do this for her, and she would stand, at the very least until Kagami...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, this is really good Konata, thanks. Now, let me just finish up the cake and I'll be done.\" Immediately after saying this, Kagami felt her chair buckling under her weight. After the initial shock, Kagami got up as quickly as she could. \"Konata! Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could see Konata laying on the floor face down, looking completely exhausted. The smaller girl took a worrying second before answering, \"Ugh, yeah *huff*, don't worry. I'm just, not really made for this.\" She lay on the floor for another couple seconds before slowly rolling over to her back, almost hitting the table in the process. Kagami could see her face looked very red and her arms were twitching a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami felt rather guilty, remembering back when she almost crushed her friend. \"I'm so sorry Konata, I guess I'm just too heavy, I won't ask to sit on you again.\" It was a bit disappointing, she quite liked the feeling of power she got when she was on Konata, it kind of made up for the loss of control that was giving in to her appetite. \"I should probably cut back on the eating a little, to be fair, even if it's fun...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata's eyes widened in alarm as her friend seemed to lose steam. She couldn't let this happen! Kagami was looking so happy, coming out of her shell and accepting her bigger body (her soft, plush, glorious, new body), if Konata didn't do something, this could be a serious step back. It's not that Konata didn't like being under her either she just couldn't hold her weight like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, Kagamin!\" The little otaku quickly cut her off, \"It's fine, you can still sit on me, I want you to.\" It wasn't a lie, \"It's just that I'm too weak to be your chair like this, but I'm sure there's something else...\" Konata looked thoughtful, before saying \"How about you just sit on me while I'm on the floor like this?\" She proposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" The tubby girl didn't expect that answer, but then again, she knew Konata wanted her to keep eating, and she probably did like being smothered by her weight. She put her hand on her belly absent.mindedly, there was still some cake left after all...<br>\r\nKagami looked at her friend on the ground beneath her. She was really tiny, it really was a wonder how she had been able to hold her up as long as she had. If Kagami sat on her like Konata was proposing, the bluenette wouldn't be able to move at all. She would be completely helpless. Sure, she would be able to move her arms around, but she had no hope of moving Kagami. It made something inside Kagami tingle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean like this?\" Kagami sat on the smaller girl, her sizable rear on top of the other girl's waist and hips, one thick thigh to each side of the bluenette's body. Kagami's chubby cheeks flushed red. The posture was a bit compromising, and some people might have thought there was something else going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uff! Yeah, that's it, that's good.\" Like this she could feel Kagami's heft, but she wasn't crushed, and since she didn't have to do anything, she could just stay like this for a good long while. Not only that, but this position awarded her the best seats in the house; she could see Kagami's stuffed belly straining against her top, and that ever-growing sliver of flesh that just couldn't be covered. She could really appreciated the bell-shape of Kagami's belly and hips. She would even be able to see her friend stuff her face every step of the way, instead of just hearing her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like this; but, you know, facing the table, you won't be able to eat like this. Get off me for a sec and I'll move so you can finish, your breakfast. Wouldn't want my Kagamin to leave hungry, and I know you still have some space in there.\" Said Konata, recovering some of her usual spunk, and earning some more embarrassment from Kagami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

The way she put piece after piece of cake in her mouth, never empty for long, but taking time to savour each morsel.

Konata could feel the tautness of the plump girl's stomach, but there was quite a lot of softness too, certainly more than last time she had the chance to check. She could feel the tender flesh under her fingers, and could hardly help herself as she began to rub and grab.

Konata loved it, there was nothing quite like an embarrassed Kagami. The slightly rounder face only made her cuter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not convinced. I want you to show me that you mean it.

I thought you were getting over that.

We've gone over this, Kagamin, it's okay.\" Again, a single finger traced circles and spirals around Kagami's tummy. \"You are always stressed over something; your grades, your future, your family, your weight... It's fine. You don't need to justify yourself to me. It's okay if you want to eat until you are full and it's fine if you want me to rub your belly. You can't be in control of everything all the time. I get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" The bigger girl wasn't sure what  to say. Konata's finger proved itself quite distracting; a constant reminder of what she actually wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has it occurred to you, that maybe you wanted to lose that bet? Maybe you were hoping for a situation in which you could eat as much as you wanted and no one could blame you for it. You wanted someone else to be responsible. You wanted to not be in control and to not have to worry about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Was that right? Had she wanted to... Well, she wanted to eat, of course, she had accepted that about herself, that she loved eating.<i> 'And yet you still felt guilty about it, didn't you?'</i> Except the previous night and that morning, when she could just blame it on Konata, although nobody was forcing her. It had felt... amazing, eating like that. Konata brought her food and she gobbled it down. No shame, no complications, no thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might be right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I'm right, Kagamin, I know you better than you know yourself!\" The otaku offered her best and most cat-like smile. \"It's okay if you want someone else to take care of you.

Tsundere Crimson? \"You can be completely honest with me, Kagami-chan.\" <i>'Huh, that's new,I kinda like it.'</i> \"Just ask me, and  I'll take care of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami looked to the side as if she wasn't sure, but the decision was already made. \"Please Konata, rub my f-fat, needy gut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course! Anything for my Kagami-chan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata got down to business, rubbing and prodding and squeezing her friend's plump belly. For a few minutes, that was all that mattered in the world for the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See Kagamin? You don't have to worry about a thing. If you just admit what you want, you'll be much happier. Do you like to get your tummy rubbed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmn, yes...\" Kagami replied through the pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do you like stuffing your face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata had a glint in her eyes. \"Then just ask. Let me pamper you, Kagami-chan. I'll bring you food, I'll rub your belly, I'll even feed you myself. In fact, let's make a deal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmngh, what kind of deal...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From now on, I'll bring you an extra meal to school every day. I'll even bring you snacks whenever we get together. If we go out, I'll order food for you too.\" Konata gave the tsundere's belly a friendly pat. \"Let me be in charge of your eating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what? Konata, even if I wanted that, I can't just eat two meals every day. People would-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Nop! No worrying about people. That's the best part. The deal is I bring you food and you eat it, and you have to keep your part of the deal. You don't need to tell people the details, just tell them we made a deal and you can't back down on it, your hands are tied.\" Konata could see that Kagami was beginning to understand. \"That's your part of the deal, once you accept, you won't have to ask me to bring you food ever again. I'll feed you whatever I want whenever I want. And you HAVE to eat it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" She'd HAVE to? She wouldn't be able to say no? If Konata wanted her to stuff herself to the brim, she... She'd have no control, no say over it, no... responsibility.</span></div></div>",

You'll do what I say because otherwise you'll spend all day right under my big fat butt.\" She patted her overstuffed belly with both hands. \"Besides, wasn't the whole point of this that I should do whatever makes me happy? You fattened me up, so now you gotta deal with the consequences.\"</span></div></div>",

She was big in a way that she was actually a force to deal with. Bullies wouldn't be able to push her around anymore about her weight. She was feeling too confident for that, and too strong from carrying around her heavy body. In a way, she couldn\u2019t wait to confront some of their classmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt bad that she viewed Konata as one of the bullies these days; enough to second guess herself since she liked the blue gremlin\u2019s teasing at times, even if she only admitted it to herself. Sometimes, she felt like Konata went a little too far. Kagami told herself that it was just payback for those times. She couldn\u2019t be the one taking things too far now. Certainly not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was beginning to doubt herself again, she saw Konata\u2019s eyes. They softened and her face had that usual cat smile. It was a look of understanding. Or submissiveness, maybe? Once that thought crossed her mind, Kagami became excited all over again. Her friend\u2019s little hands reached out, grabbing her flab and started massaging the huge tummy, making circular movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami moaned. It felt so good. She\u2019d forgotten how full she actually was, but those feelings were coming back the more Konata worked at it. \u201cThat\u2019s more like it,\u201d Kagami said after leaning back, basking in her full belly massage. Konata groaned painfully under the movement since now her tubby friend was relying even more on her for support, but she never stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt continued like this for some time. Konata could feel Kagami\u2019s massive meal jostle and jockey for space in her belly. Her stomach churned as it tried to digest everything. With all this food inside Kagami, Konata thought, her appetite is not going to ever be the same. The huge belly in front of her was proof of that. The way it sloshed forward, Konata could almost touch it with her chin. God, Kagami\u2019s belly was so round, and she seemed so huge. Konata could get used to looking up at Kagami like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer plushy, fat goddess who she was servicing. The goddess\u2019s digestion was going to be so thorough and proceed so smoothly, Konata knew her friend\u2019s belly was going to be completely empty in just a few hours. If she had the ability, she would be trembling right now. Konata excited herself at the thought of Kagami being starving hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve just made you hungrier for lunch! The way that food settled, I bet you\u2019re going to have so much room by then,\u201d Konata said, reaching out and giving the belly a loving and tender pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami had to stop herself from licking her lips. \u201cOh, you know it!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

'your' Kagamin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't like it, Kagamin?\" Konata made a show of looking teary-eyed and hurt, but Kagami knew better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Keep it together, Kagami, she's messing with you again. Doesn't matter how cute she looks, you're playing a role here.'</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I just don't think it's very appropriate. I mean, look at you.\" The larger girl leaned forward and did her best to look threatening, although it was somewhat undermined by her nascent second chin. \"At my beck and call, ready to bring me food and rub my belly. You'll even let me sit on you. It seems to me that I'm not 'your' Kagami, but rather... you are MY Konata.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata's silence and reddening cheeks were rather satisfying to Kagami, but they probably would have been more so if she didn't know that she herself was beet red all the way to her ears. Still, she kept her composure. She wanted to be the one teasing, the one in charge. She had gotten a taste of it and now she had developed an appetite for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'O-oh. She's really going for it, isn't she?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that she was complaining. Konata had always enjoying teasing people, and Kagami especially, but she  was finding that being on the other side of it had its own appeal. Specially like this, pinned down under her pudgy friend's weight. Helplessly at her mercy, made to submit... Maybe she was getting carried away, but she had played enough eroges to see where this was going. Only this time she wasn't the one playing the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'But if you wanna go that route with me, you're gonna have to earn it, no easy mode for you.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust because she was enjoying this, it didn't mean she couldn't turn it around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-your Konata? Of course Kagamin! I'll be all yours!\" The shorter girl stretched her arms above her head as if to offer herself. \"I'll do whatever you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-then you have to rub my belly whenever I want.\" Kagami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was already going to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you'll feed me if I ask you.\" Kagami was almost visibly steaming from sheer embarrassment, but didn't back off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-and when I order you around, you have to call me Ma'am, or K-Kagami-sama!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish, Kagami-sama.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami seemed to take a second to realize she couldn't think of anything else. \"G-good! Then from now on you are m-my Konata!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Not bad, Kagamin, but you're gonna have to do better than that.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kagami-sama?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May your Konata make a request? As a reward for her many duties?\" Konata used her best innocent voice as she laid her trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, I don't know if you've earned it.\" As Kagami pretended to think it over, she absent-mindedly traced circles in her taut belly with one hand. \"But I guess you can ask for something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Gotcha.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since this is such a momentous occasion, to seal the deal, your Konata would request...\" The little otaku brought forth her best impression of a bashful bride. \"A single kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whah-?\" Kagami tried to process the word. \"A k-kiss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Kagami-sama.\" Not even a twitch from Konata's face. She knew this game was hers, but there was no sense in cutting the whole thing short with a sudden laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-on the lips?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe she could gloat a bit. \"It can't be any other way, right? Or aren't you ready to claim you Konata?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata could see Kagami realizing that the jig was up. It had been fun, but any moment now she would start spluttering and call the whole thing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny moment....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'What.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a big reward, and I'm not certain you've earned it, but I'm feeling generous.\" Konata could feel 90 kilos of girl shuffle on top of her as Kagami leaned forward to better position herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'What is happening?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If nothing else, it'll be an incentive for your future performance.\" The chubby girl put one hand to each side of Konata as she stared down at her tiny friend laying on the floor with nothing clever to say, for once. Konata could feel her friend's gut softly pressing against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Oh my God!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you've gotta keep your end of the deal.\" Konata felt a shiver going down her spine. Had Kagami's voice always been this husky? \"You have to do what I tell you and not be a brat. You'll be good won't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Yes!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Konata couldn't even think about what she was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then ask me nicely, I want to be sure you want it.\" Her face was so close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Please'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please what?\" There was only Kagami. Nothing else in Konata's mind but the other girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please ma'am, kiss me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had noticed that Miyuki was blushing heavily at Konata's suggestion. Hiyori was off in lala land, daydreaming a yuri scenario for the two of them. So basically the whole class knew about what they were going to do. Great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami's tummy gurgled as she thought about the situation some more. Konata in particular took interest in Kagami's weight, and strangely, her real feelings. She blushed as she remembered the times she helped Konata, all the times she copied her homework, visited her when she was sick and copied her homework, and the time at the concert. There was something adorable about Konata. She wanted to protect her, which led to some complex feelings of the heart. And with Konata's current offer, Kagami felt that the blunette was trying to reciprocate and be supportive in some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami forced herself out of contemplation. She needed to say something, or she would lose her claim to that delicious food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kagami, are you sure?\" Konata urged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll trade you for it,\" Kagami said flatly. \"You can come over to my house, copy my homework, and we'll do whatever else you want. You can p-play with my belly, like you like to do...\" OK, maybe this would be worse than eating in public. Kagami's ears were red. \"But you have to give me the lunch. It's a trade.\" Unnecessary repeating, a very tsundere thing. But Kagami was keenly aware of what Konata really wanted, and she didn't mind giving it to her in private.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"REALLY?!\" Konata was overjoyed at this! And she shoved the bigger bento in Kagami's direction. Kagami ate it nervously. She could hear some people giggling. Hiyori wore a shocked expression, and her delusions intensified as she started drawing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the mounds of rice and meat and vegetables supplemented Kagami's lunch, she started to feel better. She spoke after swallowing a piece of pork. \"Konata, your dad is a good cook.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thank you. He even cooked for my mom. He says the secret ingredient is love. Kinda like how the pork is lovingly rounding you out now.\" :3<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up,\" Kagami said, blushing and shoving a piece of food in her mouth. Her uniform shirt had gone taut from the extra bento. She looked fuller. Her poor skirt clasp was fighting the good fight, but she might permanently eat her way out of her skirt if she isn't careful. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Since it was so late at night, Kagami thought to take the opportunity to try getting some divine help with her dieting problems. Rushing to her family's shrine, Kagami was planning on praying for better willpower around sweets. Grabbing an ema, Kagami began jotting down desire for a slimmer body. When she finished writing her inscription on the ema though, Kagami witnessed something that could only be described as supernatural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanging up her ema, Kagami smiled, and was about to go back inside to turn in for the night. However, she then suddenly heard a scratching sound coming from her ema. Turning back around, Kagami saw that her ema was being rewritten right before her very eyes! Kanji were somehow magically being erased and replaced with new ones. What was once a prayer for help with her dieting now stared back at her reading, 'Is that really a good thing?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUtterly speechless, Kagami was frozen in place out of pure shock from what she was seeing. Her eyes weren't the only part of her on the receiving end of this though, as Kagami also soon heard a mysterious womanly voice call out to her, \"Young maiden, do you honestly believe that the way they portray obesity is true? That it is ugly? Horrendous? That it should be shunned? Surely you know deep down that isn't the case, hence why you constantly gorge yourself; you desire obesity!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami was still too deep in shock to rebut the voice's claims. If anything, this sent her even deeper into shock. Was this woman really saying that Kagami actually <i>wanted</i> to be fat?! Eventually finding her tongue, Kagami finally spoke up, \"What the heck are you talking about?! Why would I try dieting for weeks if I wanted to be fat?! That doesn't make any sense! Who are you anyways?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Kagami's sound logic, the woman simply laughed. Noticing she had succeeded at flustering Kagami, she continued to push her, \"Your body is constantly fighting back against this arbitrary diet that is being forced onto you by society; it's trying to break free of the boundaries of your mortal shell! You're destined to become far larger than anyone has ever been able to even comprehend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, Kagami was still totally confused by what she was being told. Because of this, the woman decided it was finally time to tell Kagami the truth, \"Young maiden, the reason I do not appear before you is because I am far too large. I have already outgrown the universe you inhabit, and it is because of that which why I am contacting you through telepathy... From birth, you were the one I designated as my successor as the Goddess of Fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time for Kagami to end this. There was no way anything of what she was hearing was real. A Goddess of Fat? That had to be the most ridiculous, and maybe even the most disrespectful thing she had ever heard. There was only one person Kagami knew who would try and pull a prank on her like this, and she wasn't going to just let it slide. Kagami suddenly began looking around in all directions, attempting to locate the source of the voice, \"Alright Konata, I've had enough of this! Just quit it already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis outburst only made the apparent goddess chuckle even more, \"Konata? Funny you should bring her up... She's actually deeply involved in this as well... For you see, there are two types of obese: Blob and Slob. As someone who takes great care in maintaining perfect appearance, you, young maiden, always keep yourself clean of stains from food, sweat, or otherwise, befitting of the blob archetype. Your otaku friend on the other hand... She's lazy, never cleans up, and cares not about those same stains, befitting of the slob archetype. It is best to show the world both sides of the same coin, if we are to convince them of the true beauty of obesity! Your friend has already taken what I said to heart, since I have talked to her first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, an image flashed in Kagami's mind, depicting Konata's room, only even grosser than she remembers it being. What catches Kagami off-guard the most though, is Konata herself. Despite having seen her just a few hours ago, Konata had packed on an astonishing amount of weight! She had to be at least one hundred kilos at this point! When Kagami was taken out of the vision, it had finally clicked with her that there was no way this could be some mere prank. Was this a real goddess...?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a thursday afternoon and Yutaka was playing with her otaku cousin, Konata Izumi, they were playing the New Super Mario Bros. Wii and currently Yutaka had lost almost all her lives while Konata had well over 20. \"Wow Konata you're so good at this game!\" Yutaka said with a cheerful look on her face \"Hmm yeah this game gets pretty easy when you've got tons of propeller power-ups.\" the blue haired girl replied nonchalantly with her cat-like smile she showed so often. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout twenty minutes later, Yutaka had given up after losing for the sixth time on one stage in some jungle level, the frail girl then decided to go and get a drink of water as she was feeling a little parched from her gaming session. As the pink haired girl poured the ice filled a glass with water she let out a few small coughs. \"Ahh, I wish something were found to fix this sickness of mine, it's a little irritating at times.\" the girl said right as she began to sip from her glass, (Ahh that feels nice.)  Yutaka thought while she played with a stray hair that had fallen in the front of her face. As she did this she could hear the phone ringing in the distance. \"I'll get it! yelled her exuberant uncle. A few moments passed and Yutaka heard her uncle call out to her, \"Yutaka! It's for you it's your doctor!\" \"Oh, coming!\" Yutaka hurried to the lving room and got the phone from Sojiro and put it to her ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um yes Doctor Hiyuri?\" She answered questioning what her doctor could be calling for at this time, her check-up wasn't for another three weeks so it couldn't be about that. Ah Yutaka, it's good to hear from you how do you feel?\" the doctor said in a friendly and casual way to the girl. \"Oh um fine I guess, I've been coughing a little today but that's normal for me.\" Ah good, good well, Yutaka I have good if not miraculous news for you,\" Hmm! What is it?!\" Yutaka said excited by the claim the docter had made of his news. \"Well I'm not sure how but I was looking up your sickness on the internet to see if any other people had some information on it that we might not have and by chance I had stumbled upon this claim that said of a way to cure people of the sickness, now normally I would have just looked at this with disinterest, but I called a few of my fellow colleagues out of curiosity and they had said they had patients who had this cure work for them. \"R-really?! We-we-well what is it?!\" Yutaka said in fluster of emotions as she was getting ectastic at the posssibility of being cured. \"Well... I honestly can't explain without thinking it's the product of some asylum occupant. Apparently it requires you to eat a very large amount of food and gain more than twice your current weight, even I have no way of explaining how it works but I've talked it over with people and they all said it works, I could tell from them all being very large in size.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? That sounds very strange Doctor Hiyuri, is that really the only way?\" Yutaka asked in concern of the convoluted cure. \"Well, yes but you should be fine, you will just need to gain alot of weight but once you get to around doubling your weight you should be completly healed, uhh based on my information.\", Doctor Hiyuri said in a tone that could easily spell out he was having trouble saying something that sounded so ridiculous. \"Hmm well alright then I guess gaining weight wouldn't be too bad , I mean I would be cured wouldn't I? Thank you Doctor Hiyuri!\", the small girl said into the phone to her doctor. \"Hm, Okay, I will see you in three weeks to see your new progress on your gain and to give your probably last medicine you'll need.\" Bye Yutaka.\" *click*. At this moment Yutaka made a decision.</span></div></div>",
