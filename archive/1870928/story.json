He offers the reward of money and perhaps the hand in marriage of one of his children to anyone who proves worthy. King Emeril's rule has been long, prosperous and just, but his enemies are many.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe North holds the fearsome barbarian hordes who are being gathered by some unseen force. To the east lie the dread swamps where rumors of dark rituals and great evils being preformed have reached the ears of the King. Far to the west resides the wizard Dreze who has grown land hungry and even now his forces are heading towards the Kingdom of Dar. While in the south unspeakable abominations have been spotted by those few who have escaped them. Many dangers will cross your path to fight these and other evils but will you come away from unscathed? Assuming of course you come back at all. I wish you good luck and fortune on your journey.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho are you to risk all hero?</span></div></div>",

He had managed to escape but the scenes still filled him with a rage that he only controlled with the discipline he received by the knighthood. The Order of the Silver Griffin had taken the orphaned Garrett into their care and trained him and he had repaid them by slaying so much evil the King granted him a noble title and full knighthood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoney meant very little to the newly minted Sir Garrett but that changed when he met the Princess Fina who was the daughter of King Emeril. A penniless noble might have been fine if he came from a long noble line but he was a former peasant and the King made it clear he wasn't good enough for his daughter, so Sir Garrett dedicated himself to gaining the money and prestige to be able to marry him. The only thing that preserved his quest was the fact Princess Fina loved him. She frequently talked of eloping with him and if it wasn't for the vows to his order Sir Garrett would have taken her up on the offer but he couldn't betray the trust of the men and women who loved and raised him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Emeril had promised Sir Garrett the hand of Princess Fina if he eliminated the threat in the dread swamp and Sir Garrett promised he would. Life had changed greatly since his childhood but living with someone he loved once again still sounded wonderful.</span></div></div>",

A knock on the door produced a quick response to enter the room, and the sight he saw shocked him. Before him stood the beautiful blonde princess with her hair tied behind her head wearing a light suit of elven chainmail preparing to go out to do battle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing!?!\u201d Sir Garrett sputtered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Fina smiled at his shock, \u201cI am getting ready to head out with you. Father has been sending you on suicidal missions with no assistance, and I am not about to lose my fianc\u00e9e when we are, so close to getting married because I was too afraid to help him with his troubles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have the training to handle the risks you don\u2019t!\u201d Sir Garrett explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have been training with the captain of the guard and with Arimas I have been learning the magical arts. I know I am not as good as you yet but I can be of great help to you. You can\u2019t tell me an extra pair of eyes wouldn\u2019t help you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was thinking of taking along my squire as back up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWonderful, I\u2019ve always enjoyed his company and the extra hand will make lighter work for the two of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy choices are to make my squire unhappy, you unhappy or both. I guess I have no options other than taking the both of you with me. So, how shall we precede, my lovely lady?\u201d Sir Garrett smiled weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Fina gave Sir Garrett a light kiss which caused him to blush, \u201cThat is why I love you, because you know how to treat a lady.

I will collect my squire and you can make the boat arrangements.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett didn\u2019t take long to collect his squire who was thrilled to be invited on the quest. The Princess bought passage aboard a public transport because it would help provide anonymity she said but Sir Garrett suspected she wanted to live among some of the commoners who she never had contact with. Albert, Sir Garrett\u2019s squire, had discovered the life of a sailor was not for him as he spent most of the voyage at the edge of the boat in various stages of illness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paladin was disappointed he wasn\u2019t able to have much alone time with Fina but the happiness he saw on her face as she talked as a normal person instead of having to put on the airs of nobility made him smile. Sir Garrett kept busy by checking their gears to make sure it was all there and properly stored for the journey, so they wouldn\u2019t have to make any more stops then necessary. The rocking of the boat had little effect on the veteran traveler and he moved swiftly about his work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took longer by boat to arrive at the swamp then it would have by land but the travel would be easier and safer for the less experienced travelers like the Princess and his squire, but the time passed swiftly and it wasn\u2019t long before they arrived in Port Crane. Port Crane was a small trade village that dealt mostly in manufactured goods with the lizard men. It would be the last civilization before the dangers of the swamps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have been invited to stay at the Nelson\u2019s farm before we head into the swamp,\u201d Fina smiled. \u201cWhere do you think we should stay?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You don\u2019t need many male animals on the farm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Sir Garrett started to reach for his sword but pain dropped him to his knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three companions felt an unbearable  heat and began to strip themselves naked no longer caring who saw their nude bodies.

Her face began to stretch forward to a closer match to the sounds she was now making. Her breasts swelled sure to entice many men but they began to form together as they slide down her body as they became an udder. She tried desperately to lick at her vagina as a heat filled her demanding some sort of action to alleviate it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will be hard at first but you will soon know the pleasures of raw animal sexuality,\u201d Mr. Nelson explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquire Albert tried to stand on two feet but found his bones were cracking and shifting into new positions that would only allow four footed motion. Muscle and fat began to swell the frame of the small man. His penis vanished into his body and transformed into the organs needed to incubate offspring and an udder began to form on his body becoming a female ready for breeding and nursing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett\u2019s body swelled as new muscles filled his body quickly more than doubling his size and showing no signs of slowly. His nose sucked in the scent of two attractive and fertile females nearby calling him to impregnate them. Animal instincts began fighting their way to victory over his human mind demanding his swelling penis to action. His companions had finished their shifting into cows ready for breeding and he was becoming more than happy to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrett heaved himself upon Fina the black and white furred cow let out at the surprise of the weight added to her back, but was soon distracted by the penis of her former fiancee finding its way home into her vagina. He pumped in with great vigor before unleashing a torrent of fluid into her receptive womb. The smells of another fertile cow nearby called to his animal side, so he quickly released the satisfied former princess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert fought the instincts of his body but time was not on his side as new hormones beckoned him to obey as the large bull approached him with lust in the eyes. Garrett took advantage of the distracted former squire by jumping on to his back and pressing his penis home into the virgin\u2019s vagina roughly teaching him the pleasures of the flesh. Albert let out a lot moo as the orgasm overtook him and washed humans the thoughts from the mind of the squire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied for the moments the small herd of bovine head towards a fresh field of grass to feed in content meant. The Nelson\u2019s walked slowly towards the gate with no particular rush to close the gate as a sense of victory filled them. Soon they would have two more calves for there farm with a promise of many more to come in the future. The people they had transformed had been young and strong and it was very likely they would pass their strength on to their children. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Garrett could tell the other animal was larger but he was determined to not lose his mates. Even as an animal he felt an attachment to the females that went beyond the instincts of an animal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a flash of a human life calling to him as he locked horns with his rival. It was a distraction to the combat but it fought to be heard, there was something he was forgetting. Garrett had been a champion of the divine and his services were still needed. A powerful head butt from the other bull sent him to the ground. He couldn\u2019t allow himself to be distracted if he wanted to win this fight but was this important, there was the voice of a human telling him to back away.

Sir Garrett backed away from the bull who snorted at him in victory but he ignored it as he fought the urge to continue the combat. He watched in anger and frustration as the large bull started to move towards the cows to claim his prize. Both the animal and human inside of him were angered by the sight his companions being mounted but the celestial voice told him to stay where he was. Cries of mating reached his ears as the others were mated but he didn\u2019t move to stop it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett cried to the heavens his anger and frustration and something above heard him as a pillar of light enveloped him. As the light faded from the sky he stood on his two feet once more, a man. A man with very real anger that even naked he raced to the people who had transformed them. A farm spotted him and held up a pitchfork to stop him but the man didn\u2019t have the training he did. He slapped aside the farm implement and slammed his fist into the throat of the man crushing the passageway for oxygen. The paladin grabbed the pitchfork and entered the house leaving the man trying to grasp for breath that would never come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Nelson screamed in terror as she saw furious warrior enter her home armed and looking than a little ready to inflict serious harm. Mr. Nelson entered and was surprised to see Sir Garrett but he responded quickly as a spell started to form on his lips. The spell died on his lip as soon as it started as he spat out blood, it was very distracting for spell casting to have a pitchfork jammed into his chest. Sir. Garrett grabbed a butcher knife and shoved Mrs. Nelson to the wall and leaned in close to emphasize how much larger and more powerful he was than her. The fear of the death was clear in her eyes and he was glad his threat had been made clear to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need you to change my companions back into humans,\u201d Sir Garrett growled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how,\u201d Mrs. Nelson whispered, afraid to be telling the paladin what he didn\u2019t want to hear. \u201cI only mix potions to transform people into animals, we have never tried to change anyone back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you even think about the lives you take and ruin? For what? A slight increase in profit you rob people of their entire future. I have spent most of my life fighting the monsters that prey on humans and to find my future nearly destroyed by one of the people I am trying to protect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Mrs. Nelson tearfully pleaded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI usually slay the creatures that kill humans so what should I do with you? Perhaps I should give you some of your own product so you can see if you like being animal or I could kill you right here and now and end any future lives you might ruin. If I let you go what guarantee do I have that you won\u2019t start this up somewhere else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was scared of what her fate might be and didn\u2019t know how or if she could alter things in her favor. Mrs. Nelson didn\u2019t have any weapons and no magic that she could use to defend herself against the paladin. There was no chance that he would be willing to take something from her after what she and her husband had done to him so she had little chance of slipping him more potion. She had tried crying but he seemed very unmoved by her tears so the only real hope is that more of the workers would arrive and be able to overpower him. She would have to try and delay for more time if she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy husband forced me to do it,\u201d she begged for mercy. \u201cHe was a sick man who took a perverse pleasure in the transformation of others. I couldn\u2019t get away from him, he threatened to do the same to me.\u201d</span></div></div>",

She felt the heat of the transformation calling for her to remove her clothing. Her feet carried her up the stairs to her bedroom, shedding clothing as she ran leaving a trail for the paladin to follow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been certain that the paladin wouldn\u2019t kill her as long as she didn\u2019t attack him but she had never suspected he would force her to take some of her own medicine. The alchemist had been hoping to get the upper hand on the warrior of the forces of good but she was being forced to take the expensive antidote to the transformation. Relief filled her face as she managed to open the safe and saw several jars of the antidote waiting for her inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hopes to stop the transformation were dashed as she was tossed across the room. Sir Garrett took all of the vials of the antidote and started walking from the room leaving to the alchemist to her fate. Mrs. Nelson grabbed at him but he just ignored her as the transformation started to take full effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease,\u201d she begged as her body started to swell. \u201cGive me one of them at least, squeal!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe animal noise had come unbidden from her lips as her nose swelled out into a proper snout. Her hands lost feeling as they became hooves and bristly hair started to sprout from her body. She tried to scamper after her only hope to escape a lifetime as a pig and ended tumbling her naked body down the stairs. Locks of her beautiful hair lay all around her swelling body as her becoming a pig drew to a close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrges to chase after the human faded as the mind of a sow took control over the body and called her to the nearby pig pens. She made her way inside with a large boar with the last of her human intelligence. The boar eagerly mounted the more than the willing sow who took the seed looking forward to the piglets it could create. She collapsed into bliss as the half hour orgasm told hold of her body and mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett walked out to his companions with some blankets and more importantly the antidote. He poured down the liquid down their throats and made sure they swallowed before taking a step back from the docile beasts. He prayed that this would work. </span></div></div>",

Hooves started to split and form human hands as they started the transition away from animals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Fina started to grow back her long blond hair and to his surprise, his squire grew out long red hair.

If she was really a victim she could have dosed her husband at some point. She was as guilty as her husband for what was happening here and she should suffer the same fate she had chosen for others but he was a paladin who would allow her another chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is the equipment that belonged to me and my companions?\u201d Sir Garrett asked. \u201cI hear your tale of sorrow and warn you that any further betrayal will result in bad things happening to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelief poured over her face, \u201cThis way to your stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlma Nelson would have to be careful about choosing when to get away from the paladin but she suspected he would be distracted when he got his equipment which would give her the chance to gather the farm workers.

She debated if she should stick around for their victory because if something went wrong the paladin wouldn\u2019t be merciful a second time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett smiled when he saw his equipment piled in the corner but there was a little sorrow when he saw the equipment of Albert and Princess Fina who could no longer use their gear. Putting on his armor took time but he wanted to give her a chance to betray him so he pretended to be concentrating heavily on strapping himself in his armor that was a mindless task for him because he had done it thousands of times. She took the bait and raced away from him up the stairs. He made no effort to follow her as he finished putting his equipment on. The warrior pulled his long sword out and smacked it against his shield to announce he was coming and started up the stairs. </span></div></div>",

If you didn\u2019t keep a deal when using her name, she was known to inflict terrible retribution.More than one fool had found themselves used as brick and mortar in her walls for all eternity. Sir Garrett had used her name before to show his respect for her and his word and had always kept the deals and oaths he made but he was going to take out his biggest debt with her yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat goddess Oonair,\u201d Sir Garrett prayed. \u201cI pray to you to take a soul debt out to you. In return, I wish for Princess Fina and Albert to be restored to their human form. I shall perform any three tasks you ask of me to pay you back for this request. I shall slay and get revenge for the wrongs these people have done to me to honor your name. Honor the oath, honor the deal or may revenge be sought against me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paladin felt the goddess agreed to his offer as bright white flames surrounded him and he could see the red outlines of ten people moving towards him. These were the people he must slay to fulfill the start of the contract. He moved with slow purpose towards them excited to fulfill his oath and show his worth so his friend, Albert and his love, Princess Fina would be saved from a lifetime as animals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo men leaped out behind him as he passed a doorway but they were like boys playing at war with no speed or skill for it. His blazing sword gutted both of them as he spun around barely slowing his pace towards his main target of Mrs. Nelson leaving the pair to try and stop themselves from spilling onto the floor as they died. Sir Garrett\u2019s longsword found a home in the heart of a man hidden behind a door as he continued his journey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screams of pain and death of two more men reached the ears of Alma as she waited with the remaining people in the barn. She wished she had run but it was too late now. The others would kill whoever went for the horse first and she would rather gamble that five people could beat one then to gamble that she would be the last survivor in a fight for the horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOonair take you all!\u201d Sir Garrett entered the barn with white flames spewing from his armor and body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe. .we can make a deal,\u201d one of her men whimpered in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have already made a deal,\u201d came the response as the paladin charged forward slamming his shield against the man\u2019s throat and left the man to choke to death as his blade severed the throat of another who was too slow with his guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer remaining two men charged the paladin together but he was prepared for the attack. He blocked the one on the left with his shield as his blade knocked aside the attack from the right. Sir Garrett pressed forward with his shield knocking the man on the left to the ground and turned his full fury on the man to the right. An ill-fitting chain shirt and a dull blade does not a warrior make and it wasn\u2019t long before the man on the right was bleeding to death on the ground from multiple wounds to exposed body parts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlma had been taking careful aim with her crossbow but the bolt bounced harmlessly off the armor of the paladin. She should have known a crossbow for hunting was not useful against an armored knight. Her final farm hand tried to run away as Sir Garrett was distracted but he simply turned and threw his sword with deadly accuracy through the back of the man\u2019s neck. Alma ran for the horse but the holy warrior moved swiftly despite his heavy armor and caught her with ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would love to inflict the transformation on you but I have made a deal with a goddess,\u201d his hands grew tighter until they cut off her breathing. \u201cI am a man of my word.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Sir Garrett might have thought she was human, a pretty young woman to be sure but not even making the top ten of loveliest women he had seen. She had long black braided into a single mass which she played with as she examined the warrior with bright green eyes. It was the power that filled the air that told him she was something other than human. He had felt something when facing down with the dragon Sigar though this was far beyond that. If he didn\u2019t place some focus on staying upright he was certain he would drop to his knees and might even pass out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never expected one of the shining knights of the Silver Griffin asks for my assistance,\u201d She walked forward to him standing a comfortably close to him but he refused to turn his head from her. Garrett had never done a heavy study of the goddess before because he had never intended to call on her so he needed to learn all he could about her and observing someone was the best way to learn in a short period. \u201cThere is so much in you I like loyalty, honesty and even a desire for revenge, yes so much to like. I think that is why I shall make you my justiciar.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that one of your requests?\u201d Sir Garrett knew that taking on the job would mean the realm of mortals would be lost to him as he did the eternal duties demanded of him by his goddess, it was not something that he wanted but he had given his word. The goddess leaned in even closer and he thought she was going to kiss him for a heartbeat before she stepped back and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou would really do it wouldn\u2019t you? Give up on your love for Princess Fina and your squire Albert to fulfill your word to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be giving them up, I did this to save them and you have kept your word so it is only right I do the same. I will carry them with me in my heart always. I would like a chance to say goodbye to them before I take over service to you as justiciar.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have misunderstood me but it is understandable. I won\u2019t have you be my justiciar until you ask to take on the job of your own free will. This is a game for me mortal, I seek to win you to my service through the tasks I give to you and if I lose you go on with the rest of your life as you see fit. Your first task will start now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay I at least say goodbye to the others?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head, \u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOonair waved her hand and the paladin was gone from the lands he had known all his life to a place farther than he had ever traveled before. The goddess smiled and wondered if the man would be up to the challenge she had set before him. She hoped he would succeed and come to work for her because the heavens could be such a lonely place. Sir Garrett had been watched by her for a long time but she didn\u2019t want to give him an inflated sense of self. Humans so rarely kept their word, he was one of the exceptions and she was glad to have been told of him. Whatever happened it was certain to be interesting to her. </span></div></div>",

Elaborate graves filled the cemetery they walked through, he wondered if they past champions of the goddess or monuments to her victories in quests for revenge. She was giving him no time to check things out as she quickly strode towards an alabaster colored palace with ornate scenes carved into the stone. It would take a lifetime to learn what all of these stories were and he strongly suspected the goddess had taken part in all of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMost don\u2019t want to talk to me during life but as you can see many come after death seeking my favor,\u201d her slender hand directed his gaze to the long line of spirits waiting outside of the gates. \u201cYou will pick your first quest from these people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, me!?!\u201d Sir Garrett grabbed Oonair\u2019s shoulder and spun her around which brought a curve up to her lips and he suddenly realized what he was doing to a goddess. \u201cI apologize, I was just surprised you would let me choose the quest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorry not about that, it was not unpleasant, I am not glass that will shatter,\u201d Oonair spun around in a twirl. \u201cYou are most interesting, no mortal has touched me in a century and the last touch was an attempt to strangle me. Now, we have work to do, You will be given three cases and you must decide which one deserves justice and help me to supply it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA throne sat several steps up from the floor, large red cushions and pillows covered the white stone chair, She hoped into pillows and waved Sir Garrett to her side. Angels in heavy plate armor with glowing eyes went into instant motion to allow in three of the spirits from outside. As they entered the home of the goddess they went from being translucent to a solid form resembling life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have come seeking revenge,\u201d the goddess\u2019s voice shook the room with her power causing Sir Garrett to jerk his head towards the goddess whose voice had been so soft and gentle just a moment before. A green fire burned in her eyes as she looked at each of the spirits of the dead seeing inside of them probing them. \u201cStep forward minotaur and tell this paladin your tale.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was betrayed, my city is in danger because of Krous, my brother,\u201d the warrior stepped forward but it was apparently too close as there was a crackle of power warning he had made a mistake and he quickly corrected it. \u201cI, Bractus need you to get revenge for me and end the threat he presents to my city. He will open the gates for the orcs and end my city. You have to save them before it is too late.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough,\u201d Oonair silenced the minotaur who didn\u2019t look happy about being made to wait. \u201cPrincess I believe you are next.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess was beautiful with an elaborate wedding gown with a veil pulled over her face but her soft and gentle features were clear under the thin fabric. Her eyes were a deep purple in color and her ears indicated she was of elven descent. She barely lifted her gaze to talk to the paladin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was slain on my way to my wedding,\u201d he recognized her as Princess Elana, her kingdom was close to Dar and they had some trade relations, he hadn\u2019t heard of her death but the nuptials between her kingdom and another group of elves. \u201cI want those responsible to be killed. They destroyed my future I want the people responsible to pay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho were they?\u201d Sir Garrett asked, it suddenly occurred to him that he might have overstepped but the goddess made no attempt to stop him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I was hit by a crossbow at the start, I think I was the target, I didn\u2019t understand what was happening, masked bandits slew me. They hid my body and of those with me, I tried following them to find out who they were but I wasn\u2019t able to. I spent days praying to all of the gods and goddesses I knew until I came to Oonair, she was the only one who listened to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe last resort as is usual,\u201d Oonair spoke more than a hint of bitterness in her voice. \u201cExcept for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes lost the green fire and were loving as she gazed at the paladin, he blushed. He had always respected her and called upon her name many times in the past when making a deal but to be thanked by a goddess was embarrassing, even if he had shown her more respect than many others did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle one, you are next to call upon me for revenge,\u201d Oonair called on the last one to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Sarah Smith. Hobgoblins destroyed my village,\u201d she still bore the scars of her death upon her, Sir Garrett wondered if it was because she was more attached to her death, the others had looks of anger to them but hers was a look of hate. \u201cThey slaughtered my family, my little brothers, I was supposed to protect him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t be more than twelve years of age and he wondered how much younger her brothers were. Hobgoblins were ruthless and it was rare when they would leave a survivor, their military precision often meant even hiding did little good because they usually burned down the village making sure no cellars escaped their notice. Signs of burning were clear on her body but that hadn\u2019t been the final indignity for her as spear marks in her chest indicated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhose revenge quest will you take up?\u201d Oonair asked.</span></div></div>",

The bounced hard before rolling to a stop.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple cried out in pain drowning out the sound of snapping bones.  Anger clouded Sir Garrett's mind as he stampeded over Mrs. Nelson lowering his head he gored into Mr. Nelson's chest.

His teeth growing into deadly tusks to use against rivals who would harm his sows, he pushed forward and bit deeply into Mr. Nelson\u2019s leg, the laughter of the man ended in that instant as he howled in pain. Mrs. Nelson looked on in shock at what had happened before fear reminded her that she was in danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgetting any bond that might be between her husband and herself she started towards the door but was prevented by the Princess. Fina had been smaller than the woman before the change had started, now she was easily in another weight class and still growing. She grunted angrily at the woman who had betrayed their trust, Mrs. Nelson searched for some means of escape but saw it was quickly evaporating as Albert closed on her from the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can change you back into humans, I just need to get the antidote from inside,\u201d she pleaded with her victims but she had already destroyed any trust they had in her and Fina charged her knocking her to the ground.

She struggled passed Fina in a dress that was growing tight on her body to try and get through to the door. Her mouth couldn\u2019t work the knob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrett watched as Mr. Nelson squared off against him though he was because of the bite. Primal instincts called him to do battle for the sows but he fought it down, he was a trained warrior in control, it would be easy to defeat this opponent with the skills earned over a lifetime. His enemy wouldn\u2019t wait any longer and let out an animal battle cry as he charged forward. Garrett sidestepped and slashed the throat with his tusks drawing a great wound. Mr. Nelson immediately fled back from his victorious enemy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former farmer let out a grunt call to his wife after he had made it a safe distance away but she hesitated to answer. She knew the cure was inside and her husband had lost and could certainly not protect her. Her eyes searched the others for hostile actions towards her but they made none so she turned away from him back to the door trying to figure out how to get inside. The longer they remained in these forms the more likely it was they would fall to their baser instincts and perhaps become simple animals forever.  </span></div></div>",

He worried about the weight of the pack for Princess Fina.  He shook it off though, everyone had to carry their own weight.  She knew this would be a difficult journey into the swamps.  Sir Garrett loved having Fina at his side despite the danger.  Stronger together than apart this would test Fina's resolve to be married to one whose life engendered danger by the nature of it.  Sir Garrett hefted his pack with ease.  He looked to Albert approaching with pack already on.  Princess Fina soon arrived with a smile on her face.  She hefted her pack easier than Sir Garrett thought she would.  <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nPrincess Fina trained hard so that Sir Garrett wouldn't find her a burden.  If the need arose she would be able to take care of herself.  She smiled at Sir Garrett's appraising view.  She stuck out her ample chest for his pleasure.  Making her way down to the docks and beyond.  The rest of the party followed into a quaint village that stood next too the foreboding swamp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLizardmen could be seen in various places bartering for goods and services throughout the village.  The years of peaceful dwelling next to the village civilized them some but savageness still remained in their eyes.  They wore clothes and sometimes even armor that their more primitive brethren shunned.  Princess Fina watched them with fascination as they passed.  She lingered for a moment before catching with the others.  They reached a humble two story inn with a quaint look about it.  Fina's father never let her out of the castle.  A political pawn was all he saw her as.  She now felt like a caged bird set free.  Princess Fina wanted an active life doing good in the world with Sir Garrett.  Not a life of an ornament to be paraded out on special occasions.   She looked forward to staying in the simple inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert observed the inn with reluctance.  He knew that greater pleasures were due him and his family.  His families greatness could be found in any book detailing the history of the kingdom.  His father's weakness was an aberration in an otherwise illustrious family.  While grateful to Sir Garrett for taking him on as a squire but disliked the fact that he lacked true noble blood.  Still, with Sir Garrett's strength he might restore his family to its rightful place.  He would learn and put up with what he had to until he saw a chance to seize glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett arranged for three room feeling fortunate to get separate ones.  This would be their last chance at comfort for a while.  After giving the room keys to everyone they went to their rooms to put their packs down.  Afterwards as a treat for Princess Fina he took her down to the village market for some shopping and soaking up the atmosphere.  He loved her joy at the world around her.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The castle remained the majority of her actual knowledge of the world.  Books and servants provided her the only window into the world outside the stone walls of the castle.  She purchased some fresh fruits and vegetables from some of the simple vendors.  She then spotted a curio shop that intrigued her.  She hurried inside to see if there might be an interesting item she might buy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett looked on his love with pleasure.  He watched her flit about with a wonder at the new world before her.  She didn't recoil from the dirt and dust about.  Nor did she hesitate at interacting as an equal to those who were beneath her royal station.  He congratulated himself on choosing well a partner for his life.

Gaudy costume jewelry that she smiled at thinking of the real jewels she wore while living in the castle.  Books on a variety of subjects from an encyclopedia of monsters to a guide on being the perfect house wife.  She laughed thinking that might not be a bad pick.  She wished for nuptials between Garrett and herself soon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFina perused the figurines looking over the cute porcelain animals.  She feared them getting broken on the adventure.

He knew of Sir Garret\u2019s transformation but he had a tough time imagining his mentor in such a form.  He kept his head about him though.  He found tracks that led away from the sight that belonged to neither princess Fina or Sir Garrett.  He called to Fina, \u201cOver here there are some fresh tracks that might lead us to Sir Garrett.  Sir Garrett taught me some of the tracking he knew.  Fortunately the earth is soft this way making it easy.  The earth isn\u2019t dried out so they are fresh.  I suggest that we hurry though my tracking skills are suspect.  I just hope the trail doesn\u2019t cross any bare rock,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Fina recovered with now having an objective.  She convinced herself that he must have been kidnapped Garrett.  Garrett wouldn\u2019t just leave her, they loved each other.

I trust in your abilities so don\u2019t doubt yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert puffed up with the compliment.  He hurried along the trail of tracks.  He thanked the gods that the tracks remained in the soft earth.  One of the sets footprints was large sinking deeper than the other.  He figured whoever created those carried Sir Garrett.  He kept focused on his tracking not letting his mind wander to who might be behind this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFina couldn\u2019t help but wonder at why someone might kidnap Garrett.  He certainly had his share of enemies but who knew he was here.  Her father didn\u2019t even know which way they came here.  Maybe it was someone after a mermaid.  Magical components for a wizard or pleasure for certain men.  She shuddered at the thought of Garrett being used so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tracks led to a path to a stone tower.  Outside stood a large oafish looking orc.  Brutish with tusks that stuck out of his mouth.  It growled at the sight of them beginning to walk the path towards them.  Hefting its axe it smiled at Albert dismissing Fina as target other than some fun after.  Albert unsheathed his sword readying for the fight.  Fina cast a magic missile spell sending balls of force energy directly into the orc.  The orc looked at Fina shacked then enraged.  Albert took the opportunity to drive his blade into the orcs chest.  The orc tried to make some noise but only gurgling came out.  It dropped lifelessly away from Albert.   </span></div></div>",

That is the only intelligent creature in my care at this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert stammered, \"You didn't know?  Our friend is the mermaid.  Release her now or we will force you.\"  He caught sight of a tank in the corner with a beautiful mermaid swimming in it.  He walked towards it keeping an eye on the wizard who made no sign of aggression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am sorry to have borrowed your friend.  I needed a few mermaid scales for the potion that I am working on.  You of course are welcome to take your friend back.  The potion is important for curing a noble and I could not risk her saying no.  I regret the necessity of my actions.\u201d  Esmer explained his position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Fia and Albert stared incredulous at the wizard.  Esmer for his part busied himself with the final preparations of his potion.  Without looking up mentioned that the tank was unlocked.  The pair hurried over to Garrett who floated about the tank watching all that transpired.  His boobs floating about in the water.  Releasing the top of the tank Garrett broke the surface.  \u201cThank you for coming for me.  Now we need to figure out how to get changed back.  Esmer would you be willing to transform me back in payment for the scales you took?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he waited for the concoction to come to a boil he considered the proposition.  \u201cI guess I could see if I could do something but I must visit the noble with the cure.  No guarantees and I will require payment.  Gold is fine but magic tomes and items are preferred.  Ones that I lack of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem to be avoiding saying who this noble is.  Might I inquire their identity?\u201d  Fina questioned the wizard wondering at his motives.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do try to keep the privacy of those clients that employee me.  I feel that it is none of your business.\u201d  Esmer answered.  \u201cI would prefer that you leave, and take your friend  with you.  I am reaching a point in the concoctions creation that requires care and precision.  I need the utmost concentration.  Return in one week and I will see what I can do for your friend.  Bring payment at that time as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFia and Albert decided not to argue figuring they might need his aid in the near future curing Garrett.  They lifted Garrett out of the tank then Fia cast a float spell on him.  Now weightless they guided him out of the tower.  Albert felt embarrassed seeing the bulbous breasts of Garrett bare and enticing.  \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d  He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrett suggested, \u201cI say that we continue into the swamp.  My new aquatic form might add strength in such an environment.  While it will take some getting used too if you pick me up a trident I will acquit myself well in battle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert nodded.  He worried about the plan but trusted Garrett\u2019s judgement better than his own.  Fia thought about saying something but part of her wished to continue their journey.  She also felt that the potion being her idea got them into this position in the first place.  She didn\u2019t feel she had a right to say anything at the moment. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The ability to wander wherever she might choose held great allure to one who spent much of her confined to a stone room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert gave little thought to where he would spend the night.  Adventuring many times before with Sir Garrett toughened him up from a soft life he once knew.  His father's failures at gambling led his family into a sorry state and the path Sir Garrett took him on might guide them out of it.  Sir Garrett's triumphs in battle earned him a sizable fortune.  Albert already stayed the forfeiture of their ancestral lands with the money he earned as a squire.  In time he might restore his family name and home to its former glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shopping went quickly without any haggling at Sir Garrett's insistence.  Princess Fina wished to make conversation with some lizard men she saw but the paladin insisted that they hurry so that they could find a camp in the swamp before dark.  They headed out with little fan fair. Their journey slowed upon reaching the end of the trail into the swamp.  Sir Garrett led the way with his experience and an old map to reach an old outpost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the old outpost took a few hours leaving the sun low in the sky.  Princess Fina with surprising energy hurried to gathering up firewood excited to be outdoors.  Sir Garrett smiled at Fina setting down his gear.  Albert found an old fire pit clearing it out for the wood Princess Fina gathered.     <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Waiting half an hour to ensure that the young squire Albert slept soundly she slipped out from her covers.  She slipped off her robe revealing a clingy satin negligee.  Sir Garrett faced dangers in his life would soon find himself in an unfamiliar battle.  One he was ill equipped to defend himself in.  The princess cared little for waiting and wanted to consummate their relationship now.  She planned her a tactical strike tonight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett sat on a log quietly taking the surroundings looking about the old ruins.  He pondered what the old place might have looked like in its prime.  The remnants of a once great fortress or perhaps a simple outpost.  He jerked around sensing a presence behind him.  Seeing the nubile young princess sauntering toward him.  He felt defenseless against this new threat.  Despite himself he began to stiffen up as he whispered, \u201cWhat do you think you are doing?  We aren\u2019t married yet we can\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConsider this a demonstration of things to come.  It is about time we cement our relationship.\u201d Fina spoke in a breathy voice.  She swayed her hips putting her arms around Sir Garrett when she reached him.  She sat down on Sir Garrett\u2019s lap pressing her lips on his.  She smiled at the response she felt in the paladin\u2019s lap.  \u201cAt least part of you is happy about this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite himself he returned the kiss he loved the softness of her lips.     He embraced her as he fell back onto the stone floor.  Fina giggled as she continued to make out with her fianc\u00e9e.

Sans any titles just a man and a just sharing their love in the cool glow of moonlight.  Though novices in the art of love making they made up for it with enthusiasm.  Their lips locked in a battle of mutual affection.  No quarter asked for none given as tongues probed attacking each other.  Garrett tough hands massaged the feminine form of his fiancee.  Fina returned his caresses drawing her hands across his well defined muscles.  She guided her right hand to the rigid manhood of her sweetheart.  Fina gently rocked her hand across the shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrett seized hold of Fina\u2019s sides lifting her easily into the air.  Fina leaned over whispering in his ear, \u201cI think those pants are restricting our fun.  How about I help you with them?\u201d  Fina wondered if Garrett would let her cross this line as she put her nimble fingers to work on his pants.  Pulling them down freeing his manhood she felt Garrett lowering her atop him.  His penis pushed apart the lips of her vagina.  She gasped as the pleasure hit her.  She bit her lip trying not to cry awakening Albert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrett let Fina control the rhythm.  She rocked up and down on slowly relishing impaling herself.  Garrett hands slid underneath her negligee up till they reached her large breasts.  He tweaked her hard nipples with her fingers as he rubbed her globes.

Sir Garrett set to work trying to figure out who had built it and what it did. He had too much experience with fighting magic to ever trust it fully until he knew it inside and out.

Her breasts seemed to have grown since he had seen her last night but she didn\u2019t give him a chance to ask any questions as she shoved him back onto his bedroll and started sliding her soft and tender flesh against him.

He knew it was Albert his long time friend and companion. The young man was still a threat to his mate which he couldn\u2019t allow to remain around. The spring wanted only one male for many females, things were more efficient that way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett willed his essence to dominate the male essence of Albert.

She was afraid she was going to be split apart the seemingly endless cum being unloaded into her body swelling her belly and spilling out onto the ground. She didn\u2019t know the pleasures of the flesh could be so great as she orgasmed repeatedly until she finally collapsed in exhaustion. The paladin continued to fuck her long after she had passed out to make sure she was properly impregnated with his children.

The nobleman Albert felt that one should be wary of the dangers out here not curious like the Princess.

As a veteran of the silver order told him once seek not danger for it finds you often enough without help.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Fina cast identification spells to gain more knowledge of this place and the protections on the door.  Knowledge seeped into her mind of how to easily break the magic sealing the stone doors.  Centuries old and forgotten this place contained magic that she could learn.

You say yourself that you detect no evil with your abilities.  There might be some old mystical texts that I might make use of.  Go on if you want I will catch up.\u201d  Not waiting for a response, she dispelled the magical seal.

From the drawings in it though she imagined they were of a sexual nature. The language of them proved difficult to master so she focused on understanding one spell before she proceeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert glanced over to see Princess Fina shirking work to serve her own whims.  He dutifully went about his work while fuming over the spoiled nature of the Princess.  His lineage traced back to the earliest origins of the Kingdom.  He deserved servants at his command.  The stupidity of his father put his family into its current sorry state for which he lamented.  Leaving him with displaced anger and frustration to anything that annoyed him.

Checking Sir Garrett to insure that he continued to busy himself setting up the tents distracted from her.  She began to read the incantation softly so no other heard.  Upon finishing Fina directed the magic to Albert who though struck he didn\u2019t realize it.  She snickered to herself that his anger would soon dissipate.  The spell as she understood it caused the recipient to spew their anger forth or something like that.  She quietly observed to witness the proceedings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert without warning felt his anger to shift inside him.  A hot burning sensation began to build in his groin.  He ran to the woods as he grew erect his cock burning on the inside begging for release.  Furiously he pulled pants down as he sought relief.  A few tugs the lava that dwelt in him erupted onto the ground.  Albert collapsed to the ground his pants still around his ankles but to mellow to care.     </span></div></div>",

He had been betrayed by his kingdom, his order would not be able to help him, and worst of all his beloved Fina was potentially facing a similar punishment.

But so long as I am King you will not soil her in the eyes of the church for whatever man I deem worthy to be her true loving husband.  Therefore you will stay by my daughters side as her handmaiden.  Yes you heard that correctly,\"  The King continued with a  smile upon seeing Garrett's look of confusion.  \"You shall be made into a woman by magical means and you will stay by her side.  You will make sure that she attends to her duty as princess or you will be met with another punishment that I promise will not be as lenient as this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrett wasn't sure he agreed that this punishment was 'lenient'.  It seemed like it would be a living hell to forever be at his loves side but not able to show her and truly express his feelings that he now almost wished his honor had not gotten in the way so many times.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Garrett stood tall and forced himself to smile as he said, \"Thank you my King, I promise you that I will protect the honor of your daughter with all of my being.\"  Fina seemed to break down a little bit upon hearing this.  The King and Captain who both seemed to want Garrett to beg and plead more just looked disappointed.  King Emeril looked to Captain Burgos and nodded as he said, \"Deliver the potion Captain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be my pleasure.\"  Burgos said as he stomped up to Garrett and grabbed him by the throat roughly as he pulled a bubbling purple potion from behind his back.  Burgos forced Garrett's mouth open but Garrett did not fight back, he just looked ta Burgos with a fire in his eyes that betrayed his real feelings toward the situation.  The potion tasted like a sweet and creamy cake.  Garrett enjoyed the taste for a moment before feeling his entire body go into convulsions.  He felt like his bones and flesh were about to rocket off of him.  His entire body was bubbling for only a second but it felt like a painful eternity for Garrett.  Finally the changes stopped, and where there had once stood a bulky former paladin, a slim handmaiden stood.  The prison garb that had fit Garrett fell off this new girl for a brief moment.  But she was able to hide her new privacy from the watchful eyes of the men in the kings court.  The determined former paladin looked with determination at her king and said, \"Do you require anything else of me my King before I begin my new duties?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king who looked very disappointed that he hadn't broken Garrett turned to walk away, \"Just make yourself decent and get out of my sight.  From this day forward you are no longer Garrett, you are nearly Gwen\"  The newly crisped Gwen bowed and approached Fina as the crowd of people of watched this take place left disappointed they didn't see more of a show.  \"My princess.\"  Gwen said as he bowed his head letting a new set of flowing brown locks fall in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFina cried as she hugged her new handmaiden.  She just kept saying that she was sorry over and over again as Gwen patted her on the back.  Gwen lead his princess to her room where the two stood alone.  Fina spoke first, \"My love, Garrett, I do not care how you look or what you are, I still wish to marry you.  We can still leave tonight.  We can still...\"  But Gwen stopped her from speaking more, \"My love...no my princess.  As much as we desire that, it can not be.  This time I was lucky to escape with my life, if we tried to escape to marry again then I do not think your father would be so forgiving of you a second time.  I don't care what happens to me, I just want you to be safe, and if being by your side as a woman is the only way I can assure that, then so be...Mrph\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrett was so distracted by trying to find the words he wanted to say he did not noticed Fina coming in for a kiss.  The kiss was longer and more passionate than either had ever had.  Fina was the first to break it, \"Very well, my Gar...no.  My precious Gwen.  If we can not run and find love together in the world we will make our love here in secret.  No matter what my father or the world throws at us, I want us to be here for each other no matter what.  That is all we wanted before, and as much as I will miss Garrett, I see no reason why Gwen can't pick up where he left off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen was very tempted by her loves words.  Words that were very tempting, but words that could lead to punishment for both of them.  Punishment that would ruin the life of the princess that she loved.  Gwen looked to Fina and knew what she had to do.</span></div></div>",

Their tongued played with each other as they removed their clothing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFina\u2019s thoughts turned to the possibilities for their new life.

They would bide their time most pleasurably until she thought of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen wondered why Fina paused but she soon renewed her addresses to her.  Fina\u2019s nimble fingers titillated the moist nethers of Gwen.  She gasped and moaned under the ministrations.  Her own hands massaged the bountiful chest of Fina.  The evening passed quickly in such delights.  Fina fell asleep tired from the exertions.  Gwen fixed herself up before heading to her own meager quarters.  It would raise suspicions if she stayed with Fina overnight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trudge to her bed reinforced her new station in life.  A small single room poorly furnished she didn\u2019t dwell on it.  Her emotional exhaustion helped her fall asleep on the uncomfortable mattress. </span></div></div>",

A simple squeeze of their soft for a moment while all eyes looked elsewhere.  Gwen showed better judgment than her Fina admitted to herself.  Gwen\u2019s former life as a paladin taught her to be cautious.  Fina\u2019s own pampered life you taught she could have anything she wanted as long as it didn\u2019t interfere with father\u2019s will.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now being in her father\u2019s disfavor she knew luxuries others only dreamed of.  Watchful eyes peered on her life but they didn\u2019t bother her.  Her life filled with servants made her used to people around her at all times.  Fina liked to sneak up on Gwen kiss her on the back of the neck or pinch her in her soft tush.  Gwen tried to contain her startled reactions but often failed yelping out loud.  Her face reddened in anger but she would quickly forgive Fina\u2019s antics.  Gwen scolded her quietly but Fina enjoyed herself to much to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen tried spanking Fina that night while they were alone but Fina resisted and began wrestling with her.  A playful sexual battle ensued with each side struggling for dominance.  Their naked flesh rubbed and stimulated their desire.  Their tongues darted delightfully across the others flesh.  The entwined pairs became distractedly playful with one another.  They failed to hear the unlocking of the door over moans of pleasures they provoked in each other.  In walked the stern faced Captain Burgos with a retinue of his guards.  The strong armed thugs seized the pair pulling them apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFina cried out, \u201cHow dare you put your hands on me!  I will have you put in chains for this!\u201d  The guards laughed at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurgos smirks smugly, \u201cUpon whose request do you think I act?  You were warned, now bare witness to the fruits of your betrayal.  Hold Gwen down and pour in the potion.  Courtesy of Mazara with affection she says.\u201d  The man laughed at Gwen\u2019s futile struggles.  Held down and her mouth forced open Gwen struggled futilely while a foreign liquid was poured down her throat.  Fina\u2019s cries of protest filled the room but affected no ones behavior.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe physical effects soon take their toll on Gwen as sweat beads on her skin.  Her breasts heaved and swelled as her hips filled out developing greater feminine curves.  \u201cYou can let her put on her clothes now the best you can before you let her lead her out of the castle.  You see princess there is no need for hysterics we plan to let her sexualized form free.  Of course never to see you again.  As for you the King will have you restricted to chambers until such time as a suitable marriage is arranged for you.\u201d  The guards led out with no words able to be exchanged.  The guards that held Fina released her and wandered out at Burgos\u2019s behest.  Before he left Fina\u2019s chamber he chuckled, \u201cOh, one more thing the first man to lay with Gwen now will win her heart along with her submission.  And you can count on it leading to her spreading her legs for one eventually.  Do you think if the child she gives birth to is a girl do you think she will name it after you or Mazara who gave her that delectable form?\u201d  Laughing out loud as he left the chamber shutting the door locking it as his heavy footsteps made their way down the hall.  Leaving Fina alone to wallow in her sorrows.    </span></div></div>",

Whatever the magic did to her seemed impossible to fight.  If she could sate her carnal desires than maybe she could work out a plan.  She looked about for a reasonable man to ply with her body.  Someone muscular and hunky.  What was happening to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she didn\u2019t chose carefully she would end up a lady of the evening.  On her back for any man willing to part with a few coin.  The Emeril needed to pay for his treachery.  Gwen focused on that feeling allowing it to grow and fester in her.  It abated someone of the desire for manly company.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCertainly the streets bustled with commerce.  Faces passing with purpose, Gwen wondered which to entice to tarry in her garden.  One with money or connections to aid her new crusade against the Emeril and Burgos.  She used her knowledge to chose from among the prospects.  She sashayed up up to Duke Mornington a powerful man with an eye for the ladies.  His guards prevented most people from getting close.  But under standing orders to let any beauty through to him.  Gwen currently qualified with twin mountains pointing the way to the mans heart.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir sway caught Mornington\u2019s eye as she approached.  \u201cHello, Lord Mornington.  I have an area of importance I wish you to probe.  Would you be willing to retire to a more comfortable area where I can bare all to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMornington grinned at being propositioned so.  Perhaps a gambit to assassinate him but what sport either way.  Besides, those cushions called out to him.  \u201cI would be most eager to help you with any area that needs attention.  Let us us be off then.\u201d  He gestured to his guards to head to a nearby town home that he kept when he stayed in the capital.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen leaned into Mornington as they walked.  She kissed and nibbled at his neck sending shivers down the lord\u2019s body.  Mornington couldn\u2019t imagine an assassin playing the part as well.  Still, he looked to forward checking her entire body for weapons.  Reaching his home he waved his guards once he arrived at his bedroom door.  Shutting the door behind him to seal them in together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen quickly relieved Mornington of any idea that she harbored a weapon.  Tearing her clothes off in a hurry to satiate the heat within her loins.  Her breasts freed from their encasement jiggled by each jostling they received.  Her eagerness only spurred Mornington to join with her.  They locked in an embrace.  Mornington\u2019s caressed the smooth soft skin of this strange woman.  He laughed that he didn\u2019t even know her name.  Gwen\u2019s hands worked furiously to alleviate Mornington of his pants.  Inside them lay the salve to balm her burning desire.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pants fell to the floor as Mornington lifted her off her feet carrying her to the bed.  He set her down gently as he climbed atop her.  Gwen gripped at the bed moaning in pleasure as Mornington started probing her depths with his meat rod.  Her cries of ecstasy penetrated the thick wood doors to the amusement of the guards.     </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Princess Fina stood stunned at the scene before her.  The man she loved being led away as a common criminal, two bulky guards standing in her way.  Tears started to well up in her eyes.  She bit her lip to help her maintain composure.  She saw the guard gesture for her to follow him.  The other guard stayed behind Fina to make sure she complied.  She shuffled after the first guard with reluctance knowing they would lead her to her room as if she were a child.  Princess Fina felt like one often enough with no control over her life.  She found a man who cared for her and listened to her.  A man who respected her.  Her mind began formulating a plan.  She would discover what they would do with Sir Garrett and she would rescue him.  Her handmaiden could be trusted.  Princess Fina's father never paid any attention to the servants wandering about.  Sandra could easily pretend to be sweeping the floor or another menial task and listen to the proceedings.  After she found out what was going to happen to the Sir Garrett she would figure how to best help him.  She had jewels enough to bribe any susceptible guards.  Princess Fina felt she knew best which one's might give into the temptation.  As for the rest she had access to sleeping potions that would do the trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett solemnly walked down the hall.  He knew King Emeril held no love for the prospect of him as a son in law.  Still he would hesitate to eliminate a respected member of the order of the silver griffin.  The King shouldn't be able to dismiss all of his loyal service.   Still,  the King was known making those who got in his way disappear.  He swore an oath to the King and he would accept what came.  Then Sir Garrett noticed they were not heading to the throne room.  He realized that they were heading to the court wizard laboratories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long stone hall lit with only candle light illuminated the magical protective runes carved into the stone.  Any who approached with ill intent would fall afoul of a myriad of curses.  Sir Garrett felt apprehension not knowing what the king had in store for him.  He didn't doubt that King Emeril's hand in this.  He never suspected that the King's hate for him ran so strong.  King Emeril broke the fidelity between them.  He owed no more loyalty and he would escape if the opportunity showed itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large metal doors opened with Mazara the head court wizard Arimas's second in command.  A willowy dark haired woman with a cruel smile on her face.  Her dedication to King Emeril the only thing greater in her life than her love for experimentations.  Her came up and she gave a beckoning flex of her finger to summon them to follow her.  She spoke coolly, \"So rarely do I get a subject in such fine condition as you Sir Garrett.  I have been given explicit instructions to make sure nobody recognizes you after I am done with you.  A real shame to because you do look handsome as you are.  I have sent away the rest of the staff so I could see to you personally.  I think we will have a lot of fun.\"         <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He refused to give in to fear.  He watched the bemused face of Mazara contemplate whether letting him know his fate would be worse with the dread of waiting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMazara's smile grew as she spoke, \"I think it might be the least I can offer you.  I plan to rid of your strength and ability to oppose the King.  After I am through with you all you will be is a docile plaything for whoever King Emeril decides to give you to as a prize.  He graciously let me decide the form and persona that you take as your own.  The only sad part of the final process you won't remember yourself.  I wish to thank you for ridding the kingdom of so many enemies, without you the King wouldn't have as strong a position as he has today. Now let us begin.\"  Mazara lifted a talisman with a sapphire star shaped stone in the middle.  Her eyes rolled back into her head as she faced it at the paladin and began to speak esoteric words that held no meaning to the audience before her.  But captivated all save the strong willed paladin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paladin's wrists shrank freeing him from the constraint of the shackles on his wrists.  He slipped loose of them and grabbed the sword from a mesmerized Captain Burgos.  Sir Garrett began running not looking back to see if any pursued him.  His wrong began to weigh heavily on him so he sheathed the sword and began releasing the straps that held the armor on.  The paladin heard no pursuit running through the metal doors that Mazara failed to shut only the continued chanting of the evil mage.  He spent no time contemplating the odd behavior as he removed the heavy armor from is obviously diminished form.  He grabbed the sword and began to rush away in bare feet.  His feet slapped against the cold stone as he ran down the shadowy corridor.  He made his way to a secret passage that he learned of as a child training to be in the order of the silver griffin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA silver griffin hung on the wall in the rarely used hallway the reached up and pressed the eyes causing a clicking noise the wall opened up to a dark tunnel.  Through the eyes of a griffin it would be revealed.  A tunnel that once led to the former residence of the order so they would always be close at hand for King's call.  Now a forgotten place to all but a few veteran knights with a love for history.  He sealed the door back up once inside leaving no trail for any to pursue him.  He grabbed the lantern from the wall and said, \"Lantern light my way.\"  The crystal lit up with a soft white glow.  He smiled that the stories from his childhood about secret places and commands for magical lanterns suddenly became so useful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett hoped that the magic that had been done to him could be undone.  He feared that magic hadn't finished its work.  Feeling safe he assessed the damage done to him.  His looked scrawny with none of his brawny figure showing through.  He suddenly felt a pulling in his groin his manhood shrank until it pulled into his body.  An opening formed in its place.  A twisting in his stomach began as something seemed to shift inside him.  Sir Garrett began to probe the newly formed pussy sending a tingle throughout his body.  A wetness leaked down his leg as he rubbed his moist vagina.  Remembering himself he reluctantly pulled his hand away from the new joy he found.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett focused on his training and the oath he took as a paladin.  King Emeril needed to be deposed and self pleasure wouldn't help.  He trembled at the thought of what Mazara's vile curse was doing to him.  He fixed his pants the best he could and began making his way again.     <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sir Garrett made his way down the tunnel feeling less and less like a knight.  Foreign desires began to prey on his mind.  His mind dreamt of masculine men taking her.  Their strong arms pulling her into a strong embrace.  Their lips mashed together with his hard manhood pressed against her.  The paladin suddenly realized that she thought of herself as a woman now.  Why shouldn't she with her penis gone.  With that she felt  her body shifting again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer butt plumped into a nice squeezable shape.  The legs lost their hair becoming smooth and soft.  Battle scars faded until they vanished from her body.  With the widening hips walk took on a sway.  Sir Garrett's took on a feminine shape with delicate soft features.  A pert nose with full lips soon became cover long blonde tresses that spilled from her head.  She giggled as she tied back her hair.  Happiness filled Sir Garrett as she knew that no one would recognize her like this.  Her nipples hardened thinking of the joy her body could bring.  Her pants dropped to the ground as her waist dwindled further.  Oh, a man could fit their arms around her nicely now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought set her off as her pussy warm up.  She laid on the hoping to take the edge off.  She probed her pussy with her right hand causing a moan to escape her lips.  Sir Garrett's left hand teased his right nipple.  She felt like a prisoner of her bodies desires.  She couldn't stop as tingling radiated from his nipples.  She felt the flesh expand in her hand.  She increased the rubbing and squeezing with her hands.  Exquisite feelings pulsed through her body.  She finally cried out in orgasm.  She laid on the cool stone in the afterglow for several minutes before remembering herself.  She struggled to get up on her wobbly legs.  She looked down at the sword on the ground but just walked past it.  Her new breasts threw her balance as she continued down the corridor.  Her enormous breasts tented her shirt and swayed with her walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got used to the dual pendulums on her chest she reached the end of the tunnel.  She nervously unlocked the stone door pushing it open with what little strength left her.  She found herself in a dark stone basement with wooden trunks and dresses hung up on ropes strung across the walls.  Sir Garrett pulled her shirt off exposing her nubile body to the cool air.  Her nipples hardened at the exposure but she knew she needed some clothes if she wanted to pass unsuspected in the open.  She ignored her lapse earlier hoping that it might have been a temporary misstep.  She heard female cries of pleasure mixed with male grunting as she put on one of the dresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett struggled but finally managed to get one of the dresses on.  One of the more conservative costumes that she found.  Most of the items were skimpy and provocative.  The lingerie and \"toys\" she found made her realize the former home of the silver order of the griffin now housed a brothel.  She shook her head as she pushed the secret door closed.  Her chest jiggled within the confines of the dress.  The dress freely displayed her boobs but at least it went to the floor.  She found some blue heeled shoes that matched the light blue silk dress.  Moving around in the heels took work but after a few strolls around the basement she got a functional understanding of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett decided to go with a new name to go with her disguise.  Melanie Incognita she thought to herself with a smile.  She regretted leaving the sword but it would hardly go with the disguise.  She pulled the dress up so she could make her way up the stairs.  She felt dainty climbed up the stairs.  She crouched opening the hard wood door a crack to peer out into the hall.  She saw no one she decided to make her move.       <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Amazingly she got to the front the front door unnoticed.  She thanked the gods for her luck as she proceeded out into the fresh air with the afternoon sun caressing her exposed skin.  Melanie sauntered down the road hips swaying seductively.  The heels made it difficult to move quickly down the dirt road.  She cursed that her beautiful blue dress dragged along the ground catching dirt all over it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie started to wonder just where she was going.  She would hit a main crossroad soon if she remembered correctly the area.  If the weather turned she would need shelter and she had no money.  If she traveled to her home she would probably be caught.  Logically the king\u2019s men would watch there.  Still, she remained unrecognizable lest they knew magic to see her true self.  Though her handsome friend Sir Armant \u201cthe heartbreaker\u201d dwelled not too far from here.  He held no love for the king who slew his father for treason.  Succor would be offered by him and companionship if she played it right.  No Melanie you mustn\u2019t think like that even if Armant\u2019s reputation is of his ability to please a comely wench like herself.  No she is a paladin who needed to seek restoration to her former state.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The idea of being enticed to his bedchamber held intriguing prospects to at least part of her.  Her endurance failed as she reached a trail leading to the estate.  She found a fallen tree to sit upon regaining a bit of strength.  Her stomach growled in hunger with her dry mouth left her in a miserable state.  Melanie probably looked a state.  She kicked the dirt fuming till the thundering of hooves brought head up to look for a source.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Armant rode with abandon down the trail.  Frustrations with a life of near exile by Emeril led him to a life of idleness.  Riding horse and women his few pleasures.  Today another denial letter from the lords council.  His restricted travel order continued.  They awaited his betrayal like his father before him.  The temptation certainly stood consideration at times.  Noticing the horse lathered up in near exhaustion he brought it down to a slow trot catching sight of a distressed shapely young woman at the side of the trail.  He swung over his horse dropping down to the ground.  He hurried over calling out, \u201cAre you alright milady?  I am Sir Armant.  I will let no harm to come to you while I am near.  You find yourself upon my estate and at your agreement I invite you to enjoy any of the small comforts it might provide.  Your lips look parched may I offer a drink from my water sack?  May I inquire after your name as well?\u201d  He felt silly for his own excitement but the prospects of a strange beautiful young woman brought him out of his funk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie brightened at the sight of the dashing young knight hurrying to her aid.  She composed herself best she could responding demurely, \u201cI call myself Melanie right now though not always.  I am in need of your assistance.  I am afraid I find myself with no money to pay for food and lodgings on the run from the King.  I throw myself on your mercy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmant laughed at the situation he now found himself in.  Finding himself in an intrigue out here.  Still, his interest piqued he chose to pursue it still further saying, \u201cWell, Melanie as you call yourself now I will do what is in the power to help you.  I can see you are tired I will help you onto my horse and take you to my home for food and rest.  May I ask what has put you in this sorry state?\u201d   </span></div></div>",

The words that came to Armant startled him as Melanie said, \u201cYou once called me Sir Garrett.  I have been betrayed by King Emeril.  His vile servant Mazara did this to me.  I fear that magic not only changed my body but my mind as well.  I think I escaped in time to avoid the worst of the mental transformation.  I call myself Melanie now.  I need your help.  I don\u2019t know how long that I can hide without aid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmant considered the statement before him this beauty presented to him.  He pondered who would make up such a fantastic story if it weren\u2019t true.  A possible trap but he doubted Emeril would bother with an excuse until after he captured Armant.  No, the story rang true.  The whispers of Mazara\u2019s evil works at Emeril\u2019s behest were often spoken of.  The idea of pitting himself against the King brought worries to his mind.  Though any diversion to his exile would be welcome.  He decided his hatred of Emeril\u2019s cruelty swayed him.  Armant said, \u201cI can at least provide you with shelter and food for the night.  We can think clearer in the morning with full bellies and rested bodies.  I am sure that you are weary from your journey ride my horse the rest of the way to the house.\u201d  With that he gestured to his steed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie cried out a thank you proceeding to hug Armant tightly pressing her bounteous breasts into him.  The nubile body felt nice to Armant who let her linger in his arms before she remembered herself breaking away with her face blushing as she turned away.  Armant apologized before helping her onto the horse.  Melanie composed herself and said,  \u201cI am so sorry to have embarrassed myself so.  Here you are helping me and I am a pile of muddled emotions.  I hate to impose on your kindness further but is there the possibility of a bath and change of clothes?<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nArmant laughed, \u201cThink nothing of it.  Misunderstandings happen.  I will have a bath drawn and have some clothes from the attic fetched.  We will get you fixed up with anything that you need.  Now for a back round story we\u2019ll say that your family are friends of my mothers family.  You were waylaid on your way here.  That will explain why you have nothing.  Don\u2019t talk about your past if you can help it.  The servants are discreet and loyal so it shouldn\u2019t be a big issue.  What do you say Melanie you in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie smiled at him saying, \u201cYou are so smart.  I am lucky to have you I will have to think of a way to properly reward you.\u201d  She winked at Armant.  She then froze on the horse staring straight ahead.  Suddenly during the pause she shook her head seeming to clear her mind.  Melanie turned to Armant giving him a reassuring smile.  For his part Armant suspected that Melanie\u2019s struggles were magical in origin.  He felt bad at having no knowledge to aid the suffering former paladin of his curse.  He chose to provide what comfort he could provide to Melanie.    </span></div></div>",

It is very risky to try something, especially in her new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she watched the woman squeal with pleasure an idea came into her head that she could lead the pirate into a trap. Melaine knew he had a weakness for women of beauty and she abundantly fell into that category. She could seduce the pirate and bring him to justice, even if the King wouldn\u2019t make a deal with her, many innocent lives would be saved by imprisoning the man, but it was a great risk because she didn\u2019t have any weapons perhaps it would be better if she went to get some help against the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was surprised to find hand fondling her breast and wondered if she really wanted to capture the pirate or be captured herself.</span></div></div>",

He teased her nipples drawing moans of pleasure from her lips before his hands grabbed hold of the fabric of her dress and yanked it away causing her breast to spill out into the air. His penis felt hard as he ground against the crevasse of her butt as his hands returned to his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we take this upstairs where I can properly interrogate my lovely spy?\u201d He asked. \u201cI will show you pleasures that will make you forget all about the man in there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie felt trapped as the man spun her around and pressed her body against his in a tight embrace. She didn\u2019t want to draw a lot of attention to herself so perhaps it would be better to go upstairs with the man. If she tried to break away right now she was sure to be remembered but if she went upstairs with him she would be just one prostitute among many. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond fought off the demands of the body to give into the man. There might be some logic to the idea of going with the man but she had been a man who had not given into the pleasures of the flesh and that wasn\u2019t going to change with the switch of genders. She stomped her foot down on the man\u2019s foot causing him to release his grip so the paladin could step back and place her breasts back inside of her dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are trying to take liberties, sir,\u201d Melanie glared at the man. \u201cI have places I need to be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t I know it,\u201d a mischievous look formed on the man\u2019s face. He rushed forward and lifted her into his arms like a blushing bride and started to carry her up the stairs. As she started to protest he placed his lips over hers in a passionate kiss. She blinked rapidly in shock and she found herself at the top of the stairs. \u201cShall we start with the bed or do you want to do it on the floor first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was far larger than her with powerful muscles and a handsome face. She wondered if he was a warrior like she used to be as she started to reach out and touch one of the scars on his chest, but she forced herself to change her action. Her fist landed in the throat of the man causing them to go sprawling to the floor as he grunted in pain. She moved quickly to take advantage of the situation and made a break for the door, but the man managed to grab her ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love a woman with spirit,\u201d the man smiled at her. \u201cAn easy conquest is no conquest at all. It looks like this is going to be a much better night than I planned.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Drawing her free foot up as far as she could as if she was going to crawl away and stomped his teeth with all her force. It removed the grip of the man and the smile on his face but as much as she would have liked to enjoy the pain he was in she knew he was certain to want revenge for his hurt pride when he did recover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Sigurt collected himself enough to yell, \u201cStop the girl from leaving!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of several men stumbling and rushing to obey the command of their captain could be heard.

It was tempting to take a horse but she decided it was better to hide. Slipping into the stable she quickly climbed the ladder to the loft. If they chased her into here at least she would be able to fight them one at a time as they came up giving her a slight chance against the numbers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie searched the loft for a place to hide and weapons to defend herself with. She was tempted to grab the pitchfork but was worried it would be noticed to be missing, she thanked the gods when she found a hammer and moved to some stacked trunks. The haystack was almost certain to be checked so she took a chance with the trunks, they shifted under her and a part of her was worried going to tumble to her death. Pressed tightly into the corner she could hear the sounds of yelling. The search had begun and they were spreading across the ground to find her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hope was that most of them were drunk or exhausted by the ladies of the evening. The doors to the stable were thrown open and two men with swords entered with one of them carrying a lantern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome out little lady the more trouble you will have when we find!\u201d a bearded man with two swords called out as he started to check out the stalls for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man with the lantern stood back at the door, his eyes constantly scanning the room. He waved a couple men in who started to saddle horses before riding out. She could feel the pounding of her heart with such intensity but she fought to calm herself as the man approached the ladder unsure if she should go back to try and fight him while she had the chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s here,\u201d beard man told the lantern bearer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just don\u2019t want to take your drunk ass up the ladder,\u201d came the response. \u201cWell, get up there or you can explain to the Captain why you didn\u2019t do a full search of the stables. A flogging isn\u2019t a pleasant thing when the Captain isn\u2019t angry and I assure you I have seen men die under the punishment when he was less angry than he is currently.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust because I am new to the ship and you treated me tonight doesn\u2019t mean you can order me around!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it absolutely!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, as long as we understand each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blade man smiled at his companion before putting away his weapons and heading back to the ladder. He grumbled as he got to the top and started to probe around. Melanie had pulled back so she could no longer see the man but she could hear him move about creaking the floor boards as he searched for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you are in the hay stacks you had better come out or you will get a forking, followed by a real forking,\u201d the man bellowed before giving a nasty laugh to his own joke. The distinctive sound of a pitchfork being stabbed into the piles could be heard. \u201cShe isn\u2019t here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you check everywhere?\u201d the lantern bearer came closer. \u201cYou had better have checked everywhere you lazy bastard.\u201d</span></div></div>",

A hundred different foul odors preceded the man, did he ever bath, she wondered if water could even pierce the thick layer of dirt and grime he had built up like armor over his body against any cleaning. She ducked down as the swaying man came closer wondering if she would have to fight against his cutlass with her hammer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the bitch!\u201d he called down to this companion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheck behind those trunks!\u201d the command demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf we damage anything the madame will be pissed,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t check the Captain will make us dead, your choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time for hiding was at an end, she had to move or be captured, Melanie pressed with all of her might as she heard the first trunk being lifted. Screams of shock were swallowed up as the trunks bumped and crashed into each other on their collision course with the ground. Melanie moved quickly behind the haystacks to observe the results of her attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet up you idiot!\u201d the lantern carrying pirate had dodged the fallen trunks which had burst open revealing dress, lingerie, and other garments. The other man made no response, his battered and broken body silently bled on the floor, the eyes were open but they would never see again. \u201cGreat, just great. I bet I get blamed for this.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie weighed her options, she could continue to hide here and hope there would be no further investigation until she had a chance to make her getaway or she could try to escape. She edged closer as the man paced in a circle swearing, if she jumped she could reach him and if she didn\u2019t break anything in the fall she could take him, if she did that she could use the clothes to wear if no one had heard the tumbling trunks, and if they had money on them they hadn\u2019t spent on whores or liquor it might give her a chance. There were too many if but she wanted to take the chance to fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA creak in the wood announced the jump allowing the lantern to be lifted giving a glimpse of the descending paladin but not enough time to comprehend the implication of the naked woman with a hammer raised high above her head. Death came instantly to the man with the blow, he could take no joy from the curvy form tumble around the ground with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sore and would likely develop a few bruises but was still fine as far as a quick assessment could tell. Melanie rushed the entrance but didn\u2019t find any further investigators coming from the brothel, her keen eyes observed a couple of pirates at the entrance pacing back and forth so she would have to hurry, she couldn\u2019t be certain how soon these men would be missed. </span></div></div>",

She didn\u2019t look to see if a mark had been left behind. Sir Garrett felt silly holding her pants up, it would be better to have a free arm she decided, dropping the clothing. She said a small prayer as she hid the pants in an urn before continuing down the tunnel of the tomb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pace slowed as she allowed herself a chance to relax, small light orbs illuminated the path as she made her way deeper into the tomb. The writing was old but she had studied ancient texts at the monastery as she grew up. These were the tales of the founder of their order Ari Silverblade, she had been the first to ride a griffin it was said but why was the tomb hidden in the castle?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was likely to hide the treasures of the ancient guardian of these lands, someone who had protected the world before there was even a kingdom of Dar. Several of the pieces of art were likely worth a fortune by themselves. She came across a blocked doorway and though there were paths leading away from it something in the room was calling to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way she could move the giant stone door, likely no human could so she looked for an alternative means. The alphabet of the ancients was carved into the doorway, tentatively she pressed one of the letters, it ground against the stone but after some effort, it sank in before returning to its original position. Some sort of password system, she tried to call upon her memory of the Order Silver Griffin mottos over the year and tried a couple but there was no success. Suddenly it dawned on her to think of the personal quotes from Ari. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed in the first word \u201cI\u201d of a phrase and the letter lit up so she continued the quote as the excitement inside her intensified. \u201cAri Silverblade am the claw of the Silver Griffin.\u201d Bright lights filled the room and she felt like she was being scanned for something, she wasn\u2019t sure what, likely to make sure she wasn\u2019t a grave robber. It appeared she was found worthy at the door hissed as oxygen rushed into the room that had no visitor in centuries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett strode across the entranceway and was amazed to find the equipment of Ari spread in displays along the wall and in the center of the room was the tomb of the great paladin. She dropped to her knees and said a prayer for the ancient warrior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI pray you still ride the celestial planes slaying the demons, devils, and other foul creatures that seek to harm the innocent,\u201d she spoke quietly. \u201cI hope you will not feel betrayed by me if I borrow your equipment to help me fight against those who have cursed me and end the threat to this kingdom. Thank you.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe donned the armor which adjusted magically to her curvy new shape and grabbed the sword and shield, she was starting to feel like a warrior again, no longer helpless against her enemies. Sir Garrett clasped on the belt and realized it gave her inhuman strength. All the equipment suddenly felt weightless. Before she left she said another thank you and left the room making sure the door closed behind her so no one would disturb the founder of her order. </span></div></div>",

But first I am going to test a special formula that King Emeril will take if there aren\u2019t any side effects.  So we will spend a lot of time analyzing your new form to make sure you are okay.

With him now asleep she produced a potion pulling the top.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe potion pouring down his throat startled Garrett awake.  He felt Mazara\u2019s spindly fingers held his mouth shut forcing him to swallow.  He seized as the magic gripped him.  He felt compressed in a vise throughout his body.  The restraints loosened on him as his clothes grew loose.  He yelled at Mazara, \u201cWhat is this doing to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pleased look on Mazara brought further discomfort as she explained, \u201cKing Emeril wishes for his youth restored.  I plan to aid him in this so that he can continue his glorious reign.  Be thankful for your restored childhood.  I will observe you for a few days to make sure of the stability.  After that the fun can begin.  You look adorable by the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrett form took on a young child\u2019s shape.  Brawny muscles shrank until no longer defined.

Her magic made her lazy but he doubted that the guards had any such issue.  His small feet pounded the ground as he heard thundering footsteps following close behind him.  Garrett\u2019s advantage of lacking heavy armor would not save him as the clattering noise grew louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning a corner luck favored him seeing a maid scrubbing the floor he knocked over her bucket spilling its soapy contents across the floor.  Garrett kept his footing as he heard the crashing sound of cursing guards intermingled with the cry of the maid.  He felt bad for the trouble he inflicted on her but necessity won out.  His mind raced as he hurried through the halls drawing strange looks.  His next decision whether to sneak out on foot or grab a horse to ride out on.  On foot he would be a lot stealthier but a horse provided speed he lacked right now.  Putting distance between him and the capital seemed the best course of action.  Emeril had too many spies in the city.  He headed to the stables slowing down to catch his breath.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStable hands busied themselves with their work.  Experience taught them not to interfere with that which didn\u2019t concern them.  They saw Garrett but ignored him thinking he might be a visiting dignitaries child.  He looked over the horses finding the fleetest one.  Making sure that no one observed him he slipped into the stall.  The handsome chestnut stallion looked eager for the run Garrett would soon provide.  He opened the stall.  Garrett climbed the stall leaping on the horses back as he reached the top.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse hardly noticed weight change.  He responded obediently to Garrett\u2019s guidance.  Years of horse riding aided him in leading the powerful stallion beneath him.  He urged a gallop that the stallion zealously responded to. The sight of a boy in a man\u2019s shirt drew stares but no alarm was raised.  Garrett hoped that Mazara\u2019s embarrassment at his escape prevented her from alerting others.  Garrett breathed easier as he reached the capitals borders.  Still he had no definite plan as to what to do next.  No provisions left him in a precarious state along with his diminutive size.    </span></div></div>",

He slowed the horse down to a steady trot he rode this way for an hour.  He turned the stallion around then dropped onto a large stone by the trail.  The stallion began to wander off realizing its new freedom.  If they tracked him this far he hoped the stallion would mislead them as to the direction he went.  The hoof prints should show no significant change without him as a rider.  Garrett\u2019s now light weight shouldn\u2019t of deepened the impressions much.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith care he avoid leaving any tracks as he continued his journey to Arietta Thornhart\u2019s place.  A druid of no small ability.  Their past adventures together ended amicably.  She established a home  in unsettled wilderness.  He hoped her collection of potions and plants might provide a restoration to him.  In the hours that passed traveling with his scrawny legs he wore out.  Finding a small stream he filled his stomach with the cool water.  Garrett laid down to rest sleep soon overtook him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Garrett woke up he saw the pleasant mature face of Arietts.

He felt awkward being in the protection of another.  It felt reassuring with her warm body next to his holding it tight.  Garrett asked, \u201cHow much longer till we get there?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should be hitting the clearing momentarily.  I want to suggest you use one of my potions to transform yourself further.  It will make you harder to track.  It would take to long to craft a restoration potion.  Plus I don\u2019t know if I can.  The magic might be beyond my abilities.\u201d  Arietta spoke concerned about protecting her friend.  Hiding him until something could be worked out seemed the best option.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrett responded, \u201cI can see how not looking like myself would help.  The age change certainly helps disguise me but Mazara knows how I look now.  The question is how do you plan to change me?\u201d   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I think I will the final choice up to you.  I keep a variety of potions that can transform into a number of different forms.  I concerned that you will get tracked to my place.  I fear that you will need to make the choice quickly.  But the basic changes I can do are animal, gender, or age.  As an animal I could keep you here and Mazara would suspect nothing.  A druid with animals about would draw no suspicion.  Changing gender I would send you away to someone who will care for you until we can meet up.  With the age transformation I can make you so old or young that Mazara will not recognize you.  So what do you think?\u201d  Arietta asked as they arrived to a comfortable cottage in a clearing.  A greenhouse and other outbuildings sat off a bit for the care of her rare plants and make potions.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If you changed my age I would be unable to act in my own defense either by being infirm or simply incapable as a child.  An animal transformation hampering my ability to communicate with others could prove dangerous.  Persuading people may be all I really have going for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArietta considered Garrett\u2019s words saying, \u201cOkay we better hurry with it because Mazara is clever despite all her other failings as a human.  I wish to provide you with as much of a head start as I can.  I will head in another direction than you to throw them off.  If questioned I will tell her that I am gathering rare plants.  It will be true by then.  I will write you a note for a friend I am sending you too while you take the potion.  Don\u2019t worry it won\u2019t hurt and will be quick.  At your current age there isn\u2019t much difference between a boy and girl.  I have a dress that might fit the new you in the trunk over there.  I like to make clothes for the New dawn orphanage in the capital.  As long as it is for a good cause.\u201d  Smiling she proceeded to grab a potion from her collection before sitting down at a wooden writing table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrett eyed the potion with apprehension before downing the elixir.  The change tickled as his hair flowed from his head stimulated by the potion.  His face softened slightly producing a cute appearance.  He felt the shift in his nether regions.  He now she began to dig through the trunk in a hurry to get dressed and on her way.  Garrett focused on the problems ahead of her rather than the distractions of a new transformation.  She put on a sensible dress that fit well.  Turning to face Arietta she saw her blowing on the seal to her letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArietta grinned at the cute little girl before her, \u201cDon\u2019t you look pretty in your new dress.  Sorry I just can\u2019t get over your new look.  I will leave the reversal in the knot hole out front in case something happens to me.  I would wait at least a few months because Mazara might keep an eye on my place for a while.  I don\u2019t wish to give it to you in case she tracks you down.  The plant base in the potion will mask your magical transformation from basic scrying.  Come outside I will summon a giant eagle to fly you so that you won\u2019t leave any tracks.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArietta tied back Garrett\u2019s hair so it wouldn\u2019t blow in her face when she rode the eagle.  A majestic giant eagle soon glided in after a quick summoning from Arietta.  Arietta hugged Garrett tightly before wishing her good luck and handing her the letter.  A few tears dripped from the pairs\u2019 eyes.  As Garrett\u2019s friend helped her up she gave Arietta a reassuring smile.  Garrett held tight to the eagle as she took off.  She looked back seeing Arietta hiding the eagles tracks.  </span></div></div>",

The home\u2019s quaint appearance didn\u2019t allay any of Garrett\u2019s concern over Arietta\u2019s fate as well as his own.  Now this family was putting itself in danger for him.  He approached the door with trepidation knocking softly on the door.  He heard activity in the house which ceased with his knock.  He heard heavy footsteps approach the door as a deep voice called out, \u201cHello who graces our home with their presence?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrett\u2019s voice weakly responded, \u201cA friend of Arietta.  I have a letter from her that should explain everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened revealing a large burly who smiled upon catching sight of Garrett.  \u201cWell now little sprite how about I check out this letter of yours.  No need to worry little one come inside and wait while I check out this letter of yours.  My wife is fixing up some lunch if you want you can have some.  Sorry, I am rude I call myself Gregory.  What is your name little one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrett responded quietly intimidated at the mans size, \u201cIt explains in the letter who I am.  I prefer that you read rather than me saying.\u201d  Garrett surprised himself with how timidly he behaved.  The strange body combined with the diminished size.  Gregory nodded as he stepped aside to give access to his home.  A comely young woman gave a friendly smile to Garrett gesturing for him to take a seat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarlene overheard the conversation choosing not to pry situated the young girl at the table before fixing the cute little thing a plate.  She hummed while setting the plate down with a grin.  Garrett dug in with an eagerness at the meal presented but he filled quickly.  His smaller stomach stuffed before he even dented pile before him.  Gregory came in scratching his head as he handed the letter off to his spouse.  Sitting down he gave a comforting smile to Garrett, \u201cSo you want to discuss your situation now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrett gave a faint sigh before saying, \u201cI know that I am asking a lot of you to be sheltering me like this.  I am not sure what exactly the letter said but I am in trouble with King Emeril and can use any help you are willing to offer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a deep voice Gregory responded, \u201cThe letter mentioned that you are pursued by Emeril\u2019s cruel wizard Mazara and need hiding.  It also mentions that you are a friend and unjustly pursued.  My wife and me are no friend\u2019s of Emeril\u2019s.  If my wife agrees we will take you in and treat you as our daughter.  I suggest that you don\u2019t tell us your name that way we can truthfully say we don\u2019t know where you are.  What say you Darlene?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young nodded encouragingly squeezing Gregory\u2019s muscular arm saying, \u201cI am with you sweetheart.  How about we call you Amber and from now on call us mom and dad?  Now will anyone recognize you as you are now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrett shook his head, \u201cNo they won\u2019t recognize me as I am now only Arietta would.  It will feel funny calling you mom and dad but I will try my best to fit in and be dutiful.  Thank you for the aid.  Now how can I make myself useful?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarlene laughed, \u201cLet\u2019s get you set up in your room first.  Follow me this way.\u201d  Garrett now Amber he guessed followed Darlene swaying form down a hall to a cosy room.  It looked like a neutral guest room.  A dresser and closet helped make up the room.  \u201cWe can customize to make it your own Amber.  You and I can pick some flowers to brighten it up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber blushed thinking of a paladin of the silver order out picking flowers, \u201cThat is alright I don\u2019t need any flowers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarlene shook her head, \u201cSorry Amber we are going to have to feminize this room and you if anyone is going to believe that you are a young girl.  You need training to help you fit in and it starts now.  You must remember to always keep your knees together or cross them.  I will run you a bath so we can get you cleaned up proper.  Don\u2019t worry most of this will be fun.\u201d  She smiled down to Amber.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amber found the training difficult but Darlene was a forgiving teacher.  Memories of his former days as a squire with each new task a skill to master.  With Darlene or mother as she reminded herself to call her.  She learned the daily chores that were expected of her.  Some were familiar like the cleaning, cooking and laundry duty.  But even these often took on a new nature as a squire they were simple tasks.  With the cooking she learned a multitude of new recipes.  No more was it simply dump into a pot and cook till no flavor remained.  The careful prep work with spices added to create nuanced flavors.  No more armor polishing only the silverware when company came over.    She often found the pronouns of how she thought of herself switching in her mind rare.  Fear of those that could scan the surface thoughts in your head made her cautious of how she even thought of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMother taught her new skills like sewing clothes and quilts.  Dancing the female part with her father Gregory.  The lessons on manners and decorum sat poorly with the former paladin.  Amber\u2019s conscience used to be her guide but her mother taught her about being submissive and taking care to not put forth her opinions.  She knew this was vital to maintain her disguise but still disliked the role she found herself in.  Time bought a new joy to her new parents as they announced her mothers pregnancy.  But it also brought with it a worry as Arietta failed to get into contact her.  Patience never one of her stronger qualities made waiting more difficult.  She even thought of striking out on her own but figured Mazara still pursued her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle news of the outside world reached her new family.  They did hear that Sir Garrett disappeared on a quest and knights of the silver griffon were dispatched to find what happened to him.  The most distressing news that came to him was that Princess Fina was betrothed to another.  Some prince that would provide a new alliance for the kingdom.  Amber felt a tear flow down her cheek but quickly composed herself. She threw herself into her chores hoping that exhaustion might alleviate her anguish.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning she gave herself ten minutes to practice sword forms just to do something familiar.  Amber felt silly using the broom but she had no sword of her own.  Her concentration broke with her mother scolding, \u201cPut that broom to its correct at once.  I don\u2019t want to see you playing like that again.  It is undignified and unladylike.  Now I want to hear you apologize and say you won\u2019t do it again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am sorry mother.  I promise not to do it again,\u201d Amber said reluctantly.  She hated doing it but didn\u2019t want to be on her mother\u2019s side.  She waited for her mother to get out of earshot before grumbling to herself as she swept the porch.  Amber imagined running away to find one of her former colleagues.  Or resigning herself here until Arietta returned.</span></div></div>",

This is how Amber once learned as a young squire in time.  Though it didn\u2019t come easy to her.  She decided that sticking to the distasteful tasks before her.  Submerging herself in the persona of the obedient daughter.  Sweeping with care and diligence she inspected her work, only quitting when she felt satisfied with her work.  She then went to Darlene.  Wait she meant her mother.  Her mom surveyed her work before smiling and nodding in approval, \u201cNow, please come help me in the kitchen.  I need help peeling some vegetables.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes mother.\u201d  Amber trailed behind taking care with the peeling.  She found a rhythm and purpose in the chore.  She remembered days of doing this while training under veteran knights of the silver order.  She put those memories aside focusing on obeying her mother as her dutiful daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA routine for her days soon followed with Amber helping her mother the best she could with with whatever chores she could.  Her diminutive form left almost any lifting out the question.  She found she lacked the endurance of the well trained fighter that she once possessed.  She managed the best she could with sewing and baking.  She reminded herself that the tasks might help in future not only maintaining her disguise but in helping with the household when she started her own home.  Thoughts of Fina intruded unbidden.  Unless she freed herself of this accursed form she would hear of Fina\u2019s nuptials.  With seasons passing she did hear of the celebrated royal and Fina\u2019s leaving with prince Rolland to his own kingdom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart sunk with no prospects for freedom.  Heaving tears from her eyes as she wept without control.  Her mother sent her to her room till she could compose herself.  She settled again into a routine that continued for years.  Arietta never showed and what finally her malaise was the onset of something she never imagined herself experiencing.  Bloody sheets marked the beginning of her trek into puberty.  The hormones ran her rough shod.  The yelling spats between Amber and her mother proved to be an ongoing war.  Her father stayed away trying to avoid being caught in the crossfire.  The changes in her body furthered its estrangement from its formerly masculine shape.  Her dreams betrayed her as she started to dream of men in ways unbecoming a knight of the silver order.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at her ever expanding mounds that wouldn\u2019t quit growing despite all of her prayers.  The curves that started forming on her body only further set her off.  Amber struggled to fit into her dress squishing down her flourishing melon.  Darlene strode in laughing at the sight, \u201cLooks like I should let out that top again.  You already got me beat.  Your babies will not starve that is for sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMother! Get out! I can adjust it myself.  Now give me some privacy.\u201d  Amber\u2019s voice became shrill while yelling.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down!  I just wanted to let you know that your Aunt Julia sent me a letter asking if I could spare you to let you help with her little ones.  I think the change would be good for you.  There are plenty of eligible young men that might catch your fancy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOut, now!\u201d  Amber directed with her finger.  Her mother retreated mumbling under her breath about what a sweet child she used to be.  Too long she waited for Arietta\u2019s now she found herself a young woman.  She needed to pursue her goals but she feared that her heart and mind differed on the goals.  Part of her did long for a child suckling at her breast.  She dreamed such the night before.  Keeping home for a man of her own.  Her mind longed for the reinstatement to her place of respect as a knight of the silver order of the griffin.    </span></div></div>",

Many years had passed since she'd first come here looking for refuge as a defenseless little girl, and for many years she had waited for Arietta to come with news of a cure to her newfound defenseless child-like state. However, in the years since she had grown up to be a woman herself. No longer was she a defenseless child, but instead a beautiful young teenager that looked no older than 14. The recent dreams of men she'd been having reminded her of just how old she'd grown in her time with her foster family. If Arietta hadn't contacted her by now, something definitely was wrong. She had to find out what happened to her and whether the gender reversal potion she'd left for her was still around. If Amber was ever going to restore herself to her former glory, now would have to be the time. But first, she needed to find a way to make it back to Arietta's home in the wood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next morning Amber informed her mother that she would be willing to move to her aunts to help with the children, to which she was overjoyed. Amber's foster foster and mother quickly helped her pack what little possessions she had and set her on the road with one of their horses and a map to guide her on her travels. Travelling on the road alone as a young girl was much different than when she was Sir Garret. She felt extremely vulnerable. No longer did she have the strength to wield a sword as she once had, nor the capability to wear heavy armor. No matter how many years went by, she could not get used to the feeling of vulnerability and weakness that came with being a woman in these dangerous times. Her mind drifted to the thought of needing a man to protect her, but quickly shook off the thought. She did not need a man. She needed to become the man that she once was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hours passed as Amber traveled down the dirt path that lead to her foster families secluded cottage. It was no wonder that the king's men had not found her in such a place. She eventually came upon a fork in the road, stopping to check her map. She had to make a decision. A right will take her to her to the nearby village where her aunt Julia waits, whilst a left will be taking her in the general direction of Arietta's cabin, to which you estimate will take an extra day or two on</div></div>",

They had fought together against some kobolds and some bandits but nothing as far away or as dangerous as the dangerous as the dread swamp. A few nights on the cold hard ground with trail food would serve the lad some good in the reality of adventuring.  Albert\u2019s determination would carry him through because he truly cared about fighting evil and helping out others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Albert Maxwell was the only son of an ancient noble line that had fallen on hard times due to his father\u2019s gambling problem. He was desperate when he learned of the generosity of Sir Garrett so he sought him out to ask for work so he could support his mother and two younger sisters. Sir Garrett had seen potential in the young child of ten and made him the honorable profession of squire to be trained as a knight. It had earned Sir Garrett the eternal thanks of Albert. The now sixteen old noble had repaid the kindness with hard work and diligent training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett pulled Thunder in front of his squire and asked, \u201cAre you ready to come on a quest?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you serious?\u201d Albert\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cOf course I am ready. Just give me a little time to getting ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert vanished as magically as any wizard could and judging by the amount of time it took for him to get back he had planned to come along if offered. As always he was eager and filled with wonder at the world as they traveled for several days to reach the dread swamp. The cold food and rocky ground didn\u2019t even dampen his spirits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finally arrived at the edge of the dread swamp and Sir Garrett decided to camp for the night before exposing the youth to the full dangers of the swamp. It had been nice to have second person along to allow the proper posting of a guard. Sir Garrett had been impressed at the fine work Albert was doing at guard because he hadn\u2019t been caught dozing once on duty.

The smell grew stronger and Sir Garrett readied himself as he heard shuffling and moaning begin to approach.  Sir Garrett made a prayer to the gods that they give him strength in the upcoming fight.  Sir Garrett surveyed his surroundings and found a large boulder that Albert and he could protect themselves from becoming surrounded.  He motioned to Albert who quickly nodded assent and moved to the boulder.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mass of undead began emerge from the swamp.  Their bloated decayed state and unintelligent shuffle toward the pair lead Sir Garrett to believe they were zombies.  Zombies did not become a problem until they reached a horde state like this.  The question on Sir Garrett's mind was their creator with them and controlling their action now.  Zombies liked to go after the nearest intelligent life and destroy it normally.  They might wander around randomly if not controlled.  Something guided the horde together the question remained did it still push them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett and Albert took shots at the zombies with their crossbows while the horde moved to them.  Well placed head shots brought down some of the larger ones they targeted.  The zombies that got touched by the falling zombies became distracted by the sudden sensation.  Sir Garrett figured they must have been let loose by whoever created them.  Zombies the someone controlling them rarely deviated from their target .  Sir Garrett could not be sure how many there were with them pouring out of the forest.  He decided to make a stand here instead of running because zombies ceaselessly pursued their target tirelessly.  He also did not want to risk someone less prepared coming across them.  His duty stood before him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett and Lord Albert dropped their crossbows as the zombies came into melee range.  They pulled out their swords and steeled themselves to the oncoming onslaught.  Sir Garrett's blade struck home with precision and ferocity.  Sir Garrett kept the rage in check while he bashed away zombies with his shield causing them to fall with their poor dexterity into each other.  The domino effect of them falling into each gave space in front of Sir Garrett.  He used the space as a kill zone for the next wave of zombies.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The armor Albert wore afforded some protection from the attacks but the zombies unnatural strength and numbers took their toll.  The gruesome visages and number of the undead caused Albert to panic and trip trying back away.  This lead to several of the undead to fall upon him.  Albert tried not to scream as one of the zombies tried to gnaw his face.  He used his hands to push away the decaying maw for tearing off flesh.  Drippings from the creature fell on Albert causing his stomach to churn at the putrid smell.  Fear of being a meal to these monsters helped to keep his strained muscles from giving way.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett upon seeing the precarious position of his squire called forth his faith and turn back many of the undead.  Several of them fell to the ground now devoid of the negative energy that drove them.   The undead that tried to feed off Albert slumped on top of him.  While Albert pushed himself free and got up on his feet again Sir Garrett continued the fight seeming tireless.  Sir Garrett smiled as Albert rejoined the fight regaining composure.  He knew that facing undead the first is a jarring experience.  He held no ill will to Albert for faltering a little against them.  He was proud that Albert steeled himself from the fear inside him.  Sir Garrett spoke as he knocked back another group of zombies that pressed in.  \"Foolish is the man who has no fear.  Fear can be a great ally for it gives you caution.  You have fought yours and won becoming stronger for it.  Let us triumph this day.\"  With that he split another skull with his blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert nodded thankful that Sir Garrett still held him in high regard.  He wished to earn that respect in time.  He sliced open one of the zombies before him causing its guts to spill forth.  Again he felt his stomach turn over but he held it and pressed his attack.  Albert chopped its head off in three brutal strokes.  The teeth gnashed for a minute after the head tumbled to the ground before going still.  The disturbing sights continued into the late morning before Albert struck the last one down.  Sir Garrett's strength won the day with the aid of Albert.  Albert tended his own wounds while Sir Garrett surveyed the area and decided what needed to be done. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I will let you go back to to your kingdom unharmed after you offer me the slight assistance you can in the minor inconvenience I have.  I will also not attack you during our adventure.\u201d The dragon extended its sharply clawed hand to shake to the goodly paladin before it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett uneasily shook saying, \u201cExcellent let us get on our way.\u201d  The Knight gathered the gear he thought necessary choosing to travel light.  He left behind the full plate hiding it to be retrieved later.  The swamp could be truly treacherous with too much weight on oneself.  Also, the lighter weight added to their advantage of speed.  He didn\u2019t imagine the monstrous dragon would be offering any rides to ease their burden.  He chuckled a little at the image of a fearsome black mounted by virtuous paladin of the order of the griffin.  Powerful enemies often made strange allies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squire looked with trepidation at the dragon before.  Only story books and talk among the knights gave him any frame of reference to such a creature.  The greatest feat to a knight the slaying of one of these beasts.  Their hoards fabled for their wealth.  Albert\u2019s family would be restored to its form state and beyond with this mature dragons treasure.  He put aside such thoughts for later after they defeated the present threat.  Albert enjoyed doing good with adventuring but family honor and glory drove him to great risks at time.  Frustration at the sorry state his family now found itself in caused restless sleep hoping for a way out.  <br>\r\nThe group traveled without conversation.  Each of them mindful of the danger that lay before them.  Stray zombies wandered about the forest indicate they headed in the right direction.  They easily dispatched the unorganized undead with well placed crossbow bolts or a slash from the black dragon if they got close enough.  The dragon insisted they continue and not bury the bodies.  Sir Garrett relented only saying a pray as they traveled fearing the necromancer having darker plans to yet unharmed individuals.<br>\r\nNight began to fall but they pressed on with the knowledge that sanctum lay within a hours travel.  The quality of the undead improved but they proved little match to the skilled paladin and powerful dragon.  Albert at Sir Garrett\u2019s command hung back and took well aimed shots with his crossbow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group soon reached the entrance to the necromancer\u2019s layer.  The stone door was intricately with symbols of a bygone civilization.  Too small for the dragon to enter at its current size the paladin wondered how to proceed.  <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The powerful dragon said, \u201cI don\u2019t think entering will be a problem any longer.\u201d The dragon proceeded to spew caustic acid on the door.  It waited a minute before slamming its weight the door shattering it into chunks of melted stone.  It confidently strode down the carved stone steps as master of all it surveyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett took in the fact that this dragon used magic.  It made him confident of the power of the dragon.  It displayed great intelligence on the part of Swamp Terror.  Sir Garrett would have to keep his eye on the dragon to see how gifted it was.  Sir Garrett followed the dragon which left a wake of destruction behind it.  Pieces of the undead the dragon lay strewn about with acid burns and slashes on them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwamp Terror used his superior senses to make his way through the winding passages.  The necromancer behind all of this couldn\u2019t anticipate that his life would be his own downfall.  Swamp Terror loved the taste of rotten flesh and knew its smell well.   So all he had to do was smell for something fresh and not rotten in order to find his way to the necromancer.  He tracked the living human scent through the halls spraying the undead with his breath weapon following with a series of slashes from his powerful claws.  Swamp Terror figured this dark mage was inexperienced since none of the dead so far posed any great ability or intelligence.  This disappointed the dragon but maybe among his items there still might be something worthwhile.  The dragon\u2019s superior augmented by his lack of caution led him to pull further away from the paladin who played a mop up crew with his squire.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett struck down yet another foul unliving creature that came out of one the numerous rooms the dragon ignored.  He knew the dragon must know where he was headed but paid no heed if Sir Garrett followed.   Sir Garrett lost site the oversized reptile long ago and only the path of body parts guided him.  Sir Garrett remained impressed with Albert\u2019s progress in training as he held his own against any dead that came their way.  The youth\u2019s swordsmanship the equal of most knights Sir Garrett knew.  With time and a level head he might surpass him one day.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert enjoyed slaying the undead as it felt like he was releasing them from suffering such a fate.  He felt better about his performance today.  Without them bunching up on him he could make more precise strokes with his blade.  He wanted the strength that Sir Garrett possessed and was impatient to get it.  His family deserved better than the poverty inflicted upon them by his father.  He knew it wicked of him but he wished an ill fate for his own unprincipled father.  The treasure within this catacomb might alleviate some of the debts his family had.  Albert pondered sneaking off to find some while Sir Garrett was distracted trying to follow the dragon.  No, he couldn\u2019t leave Sir Garrett side with all the danger around.  Maybe after they slew the necromancer some of the spoils would be his.  Sir Garrett was a generous man and understood his woes.  Yes, after there would be plenty of time to look about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwamp Terror disenchanted the door in front of him before slamming his weight against it.  It splinted apart leaving no marks on the smooth black scales.  The necromancer caught stuffing a magical bag of holding with what he could.  He looked on in horror at the black dragon before him.  He whimpered, \u201cPlease we can make a deal if you just let me go.  I could be a powerful ally in the future you will see.  My master taught me much and I have his books.  I will grow quite powerful after I get a bit more control.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon smiled a sinister grin of sharp teeth and said calmly, \u201cI am afraid you are mistaken I have your master\u2019s books.\u201d  With that he sprung on the dark mage slashing his claws across the frail man\u2019s throat.  Swamp Terror backed off bemused with watching the would be necromancer struggle to find words with a torn throat.  Watching the human collapse to the floor Swamp Terror moved over to the magical bag and cast an invisibility on it so the paladin wouldn\u2019t find it.  Even if Sir Garrett did Swamp Terror could blame it on the necromancer.  He would keep his deal and make sure that the paladin left this swamp.  The paladin would return with allies to take him down but would eventually find out that this wasn\u2019t Swamp Terror\u2019s swamp.  Swamp Terror just wanted the magical books the necromancer had.  <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

None of the decayed corpses posed any special danger, only in their number might Sir Garrett be overwhelmed.  They seemed spread out a few to a room.  No, traps could be found as he systematically traversed the unkempt chambers.  Sir Garrett hoped that the necromancer would kill the dragon and he would be easy pray for the paladin.  He doubted that would be the case with no signs of great power behind these walls.  He checked back on Albert who stayed back slightly to make sure nothing got by Sir Garrett and to guard their backs lest anything come from behind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert kept his cool making sure not to hit Sir Garrett with his crossbow.  Checking his surroundings before each pull of the trigger.  He used blessed bolts now that he knew they fought the undead.  Each bolt that struck causing flesh to disintegrate all around the wound.  Even if he didn't place them well their damage still could cripple the zombies.  Albert felt more confident now as they brought down room after room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the pair made a complete search of all the rooms before the last one for any stray undead they entered the room with Sir Garrett in the lead.

I will search for what I can find and of course take this as my new lair.\"  He watched the two humans with disinterest waiting patiently for their response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett responded, \"Our deal holds you will not challenge us until we return to our home?  If so we will not be greedy and only take what we can carry.\"  Sir Garrett truly just wished to return home and claim Princess Fina.  He also didn't want to test the dragon's word to strongly.  Sir Garrett would leave immediately if he didn't know how much Albert's family needed the money.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My word is true you can pass that on to your king.  Your safety will not be challenged by me until your return to tell of my power and greatness.  I truly wish you a safe and speedy journey.\" The dragon spoke placidly towards the paladin before him.  He sat still with an almost dosing expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humans knew better than to linger in front of the dragon lest its anger be incurred.  They made their way through the halls grabbing what spoils they could without looking to long.  Sir Garrett looked regretfully at the bodies knowing he could not provide them a proper burial.  He spoke a prayer as he made his way down the hall.  He didn't want to carry to much in case they had to fight on their journey home.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert for his part vigorously grabbed items that looked valuable.  The items weighed him down but he only thought of the good to his family.  He dropped his crossbow knowing he could easily replace it upon his return to the capital.  He did it quietly know that Sir Garrett would disapprove.  A set of golden candle holders he could replace it and more.  <br>\r\nThey finished looting which Sir Garrett prodded Albert into stopping.  He could see Albert struggling with the weight but he left it to the squire as it was his burden to bear.  Their trip home held no impediments.  Sir Garrett dismissed Albert upon their return telling him to keep all that he carried.  Albert thanked Sir Garrett and headed to his families dilapidated estate.  Sir Garrett headed to the King to claim Fina's hand.  He got himself cleaned before heading out so he could look his best.

He adjusted his shirt and headed out the door with his head held up today would lead to a bright future for him and Fina.

Sir Garrett enjoys being surrounded by the only family he ever knew.  His squire Albert at his side as his best man he only regrets the small showing for Princess Fina.  A few handmaidens and various other servants but no real family to speak of.  Her father sent a manservant with his regrets making note that he was very busy and could not spare the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Fina for her part felt no sadness at the lack of attendance for her.  She enjoyed herself more knowing that surrounding her were real friends who wished her true happiness.  She strode down with confidence and grace that she was brought up in but the smile she held only for her future husband.  Her prospects for true happiness weighed heavily on her side with separation from the power hungry greed of her father.  He never knew true love only the joy of acquisition.  The bliss she knew from being called man and wife only grew with the warm kiss and embrace after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe celebration went well into the evening and beyond.  Fina whispered a few naughty thoughts into Sir Garrett\u2019s ear who soon whisked her off to home with a roar of joy and hoots from those gathered.  The veteran knights made a game of keeping Albert\u2019s mug ever full causing him to pass out soon into the festivities.  The drinking kept up until the last knight passed out from a lack of sobriety.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett drank little looking forward to the twilight activities he planned with Fina.  She laughed smilingly at him as he easily carried her across the threshold of his estate and her new home.  Up the stairs into the master bedroom he set her down on the soft mattress in her elegant dress.  She rolled over that he might release the ties that bound her dress.  He eagerly made short work of them.  She rolled back on her round bottom pulling down the top of her dress revealing her ample chest.  Fina than pressed her lips into her husband\u2019s.  He placed his rough hands on the dress guiding it off her with wiggling help.  The shaking caused an enticing display for the paladin.  He played with his new toys as Fina massaged hers between Kyle Garrett\u2019s thighs.  The flesh sword soon pierced her wet warm opening.  He rocked into her causing her to cry out.  She wrapped her legs around her lover as she felt him tense a little.  Fina greedily wanted all his seed for herself.  He obliged her after pistoning into her for some time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFina rolled him onto his back she sat up with his flesh sword softening begging to grind against it.  It some sprang back to life with erotic dancing of her breasts as she gyrated her body on him.  No reserve between them they continued locked together until exhaustion took them falling asleep still embraced with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears passed with several children to add to their joy.  The couple remained friends with Albert after he left his role as a squire to become a knight.  Alberts family began to find financial stability with his and Sir Garrett\u2019s continuing adventures.  Princess Fina loved the freedom she found with Sir Garrett who treated her as a partner.  She studied magic and felt she made much progress in the field.  When she felt safe to leave her children at home she hoped to journey with her husband.  Though she did find much fun with them she wanted to see more of the places she read of in her tomes.  When Sir Garrett returned home, he watched the kids to give her a break to study or examine some strange artifact he brought back with him.  They seldom heard from Fina\u2019s father who only contacted them when he wanted some evil dispatched by Sir Garrett.  <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The strain grew to great and their armors burst open as their skin hardened like steel.  The hardened skin became scales.  Sharp claws formed out of their finger nails.  Their faces shifted elongated taking on draconic visages. Powerful wings sprang out of their backs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIcy breath shot out of Sir Garrett\u2019s mouth as he yawned.  He got up onto his four feet looking around confused at his perception increase.  Awkwardly he turned around taking in the changed scene before him.  A silver dragon lay on the clothing of Albert with the Black dragon collapsed on the ground tongue hanging out acidic juices leaking out onto the ground.  The statue stood lifeless with no sign of activity.  Garrett looked at himself realizing his own transformation.  He didn\u2019t dwell on it fear Swamp Terrors awakening.  He couldn\u2019t bring himself to strike down the defenseless dragon it went against his code of honor.  He shook awake the silver dragon he imagined to be Albert.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert woke saying, \u201cWhat is going on?  A silver dragon did you save us from the black dragon?\u201d  The reality of the situation soon came to him.  He looked down at himself bewildered.  Albert asked, \u201cWhat in the name of the gods is going on?  Why am I a dragon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrett responded, \u201cThat artifact is behind this.  We must take it and get out of here before Swamp Terror awakens.  I fear the strangeness of our bodies puts us at a disadvantage in a fight.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert asked concerned, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we kill it right now while it is vulnerable?  It would kill us if it could and will always present a danger to other innocents.\u201d</span></div></div>",

It opened its maw spewing noxious acid at them.  Instinct drove them to leap in opposite direct only partially catching them.

He concentrated on the closest zombie to him taking it out first with several striking slashes.  A zombie could take only so many blows before the magic maintaining it failed.  Head shots did the most damage but they were a luxury of distance and precision that Albert had not yet gained.  Albert's well muscled body quivered at the endurance test before him.  The horde pressured biting at his chain mail armor but having little effect other than pinching with the  compression.  His plate helmet protected his head well but the constant flailing limbs striking him take the greatest toll. \t<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert is shaken by the battering but continues unwavering in his strikes.  Sir Garrett unseen by Albert whose caught up in the fury of the fighting nods approvingly at his squire.  Sir Garrett again bashed back the on coming horde of pawing hands and gnashing teeth.  This gave Sir Garrett the time to focus his faith and project it out through his holy symbol destroying the dark forces that now possessed these poor bodies.  Many of the zombies lost the negative energy that drove them collapsing to the ground.  A circle of bodies made a grim scene.  The rest of the zombies shuffled slowly stumbling over their fallen brethren.  Albert recovers some of his strength waiting for the next onslaught.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett could now see the end in sight.  The mass of undead now sparsely together moved toward their food.  He could see through them to the trees beyond.  Sir Garrett pressed forward his attack giving Albert more time to rest.  His dancing strikes struck home cleaving the skulls off a couple before they begin to bunch up again.  They retreating and striking as they whittled them down further.  Albert caught his breath and aided in the final push taking out the horde.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett looked at the bodies and saw that they wore peasant clothing.  Someone probably kidnapped them from local villages.  They were mostly men and the elderly the most likely to be prayed on alone at night.  Local village women and children mostly kept away from the swamps at night.

He learned to take it seriously from ambushes he experienced over his time with Sir Garrett.  The difficult part for him right now was the constant animal noises he heard.  The swamp creatures seemed disturbed by something with all the rustling going on about the undergrowth.  He tightened his grip on his weapon as he heard an odd breathing sound.  A hissing noise that approached the edge of the camp that Albert faced.  Albert hesitated waking Sir Garrett as it might just be a native animal just passing by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe witnesses a snake man hybrid they were called yuan-ti in the monster manuals that he studied in the order of the silver griffin\u2019s library.  A vile race of creatures that would kidnap humans to put them through a revolting process to transform them into yet more yuan-ti.  There could be no parlay between them despite their human intelligence.  They sought only to enslave or transform any civilized race they came across.

Taking famers and villagers proved insufficient training against a skilled veteran.  The blood drawn so far in the melee was its own.

The Yuan-ti with their darkvision ability to see in the blackest of nights held the advantage at night.  Just before dawn they packed their gear and began following the trail the creature left.  Though not elite trackers the pair found no trouble following the monsters trail.  Sir Garrett feared that the Yuan-ti presence might be strong in the swamp, having grown over time.  Their dominance might be leading them to overconfidence.  Sir Garrett's main worry that a sizable force would be at the end of this trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert knew a little of the yuan-ti from the readings that Sir Garrett insisted on.  Some could pass as humans or take the form of a viper.  He quivered slightly thinking on becoming part of their dark transformation ceremony.  All who succumbed to it became subservient to the yuan-ti cause.  Only the power of gods or some archmages could undo the transformation.  Not a fate that Albert intended for himself.  He would force them to kill him before he would submit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett signaled to Albert to stop.  Before them lay a cleared path leading to a wooden watch tower.  They could make out the shapes of at least two humanoid figures.  Sir Garrett readied his crossbow with Albert following suit.  They snuck closer the best they could in their chain armor.  Sir Garrett felt a bit bare in only chain but the swamps treacherous watery nature made plate armor a dangerous proposition.  Stealth didn't come naturally to the valiant paladin but wisdom told him to be cautious.  He gestured to Albert to take the one on the right Albert nodded in response.  The young squire took aim waiting for Sir Garrett's shot to signal the time to strike.  The left one gestured in their direction just in time to find a crossbow bolt striking home in its neck.  The right one turned in shock as it got hit in the side piercing its lung sending blood streaming down its side before falling next to the collapsed companion.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett jumped up making his way to the wooden tower.  Albert fast on his heels readied another bolt to finish anything coming up.  The pair rushed up the tower climbing in they saw a pair of yuan-ti on the floor start to struggle to get up at their arrival.  With a couple slashes of his sword Sir Garrett finished the pair.  Sir Garrett looked out to see wooden fortress set up in the distance.  He figured the yuan-ti set this place up as a new base to act from.  Albert and him might be able to take this place out but would they be able to call reinforcements from somewhere beyond?  He could send Albert to get some help.

Sir Garrett whispered to Albert wait for the outcome of the ensuing battle.  No sense in wasting their strength.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arrows began to pour in from the ramparts.  The scattered yuanti arrows came in haphazardly as the snake people gathered at the wall. The zombies walked forward as slow moving targets.  Many began to fall on the approach but than Sir Garrett noticed quicker movement in the crowd of shambling corpses.  Intermixed with the zombies\u2019 ghouls ran to the walls.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGhouls distinctive foul odor permeated the air around them.  Undead monsters whose hunger for flesh drove them.  Gaunt figures with sharp teeth and clawed fingers.  Running to the walls after breaking from the mass of zombies.  When the Yuanti realized the new threat, they turned their bows to the ghouls.  Easily climbing the walls the first of the ghouls leapt at the snake people.  Several of the yuanti got visibly ill from the stench given off by the ghouls.  The strikes from the ghouls came quick and often.  The Yuanti's light armor offered some protection but they were getting cut up bad.  Concurrently the army of zombies began to reach the walls flailing against the wooden structure.  Arms and teeth of the zombies worked on the wooden walls slowly chipping away as the zombie army surrounded the fort.  Retreat no longer looked like an option for the Yuanti.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett along with Albert watched silently not sure who to root for.  Sir Garrett wondered who controlled the undead army and if this might be a fraction of its strength.  More intelligent undead might direct from the shadows or a foul necromantic wizard.  Another Yuanti guard tower might of sent for reinforcements but right now the undead maintained an advantage in numbers and tenacity.  Sir Garrett thought that with focus on the central structure whatever guided the undead army desired more yuanti to fight.  Or, it might not care what came and desired something in the fort.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cobra headed yuanti slithered to the wall.  Only human arms distinguished it from a giant snake.  It held a large curved sword swinging upon the first ghoul it came upon.  The targeted strike cleaved the head of the putrid smelling undead.  It led the other yuanti as it battled the ghouls that stalked the interior of the fort.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

A python one\u2019s tail curled around a zombie squeezing till it split in two.  Its strong arms knocking aside the zombies as they enclosed on it.  One of the ghouls leapt on its back clawing at the pythons eyes.  The python seized the ghouls head squeezing till the head popped.

Bites from both sides with it only ending at the python\u2019s death from blood loss.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cobra carved up the zombies providing the creature little challenge.  Other yuanti fared worse lacking the skill and strength of the large cobra headed yuanti.  The rush of zombies fed well on the novice fighters ill prepared for the onslaught.  A ghoul spewed a noxious fluid at the cobra who dodged while retaliating with its curved blade slashing a huge gash down its chest and stomach.  The contents spilled out in a grotesque display.  The ghoul lost none of its deadly drive claws slashing fury.

His jump crashed him into the last one that fell back its claws dragging along links of his chainmail failing to catch hold.  Garrett continued forward with confident cut across the neck blood issued forth from the beast.  He wasted no time spinning on his heel to face the remaining pair.  They snarled at him as they renewed their attack on him.  Despite they rushed him with speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrett met them with precision dodging their combined slicing through the leg of the one missing an arm.  Following through with the strike pulling it up he split open the werewolf kicking it down as it bled out.  Albert came running from the tent looking for hostiles.  He witnessed Sir Garrett taking to head of a werewolf who swung at Garrett with a handless arm.  The howls alerted the pair to more enemies on the way.  </span></div></div>",

More civilized than many of their kind the local lizard men upon being alerted of strangers would come back in force.  The more backwards lizard men would probably ambush with no questions any intruders they found.  Seeing his armor the local tribe would come and question the strangers.  Sir Garrett didn't fear their return, he welcomed it.  They might be able to guide him or let him know what dark rituals were being performed and why.  Who another question that plagued him but he rarely got much information from King Emeril.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLately Sir Garrett received less and less detail of the enemies he faced.  Probably, the King hoping for his failure.  Albert started cooking a stew over a small fire as Sir Garrett pondered the King.  Would King Emeril concede his daughter's if Sir Garrett triumphed in the chill of the dark evening the paladin's doubt's surfaced.  What should he do if the King broke his word?  Sir Garrett swore an oath to the King but that might break all ties.  He put away such thinking when he heard movement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHail strangers if you mean no ill intent to the sharp teeth clan than lay down your arms.\u201d A deep voice called out from the shadows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett responded to the call, \u201cWe mean you no harm.  We seek only to end the evil that now resides in this swamp.  With your aid of knowledge, we will be better able to end the threat to your clan.\u201d Sir Garrett placed his hands on his knees waiting for the party of lizardmen come to parlay.  Albert continued tending the stew while waiting for the swamp dwellers to reveal themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen we meet as friends.  It gladdens the heart to see one of the silver order here.  The strength of your knights is even known in the dread swamps.  I am Hikozo chief spearman for the sharp teeth.  We\u2019ll discuss your quest in these and give what assistance we can.\u201d  The largest of the lizardmen said eyeing the pair.      <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

We know not what causes him to stir only that his servants stalk the swamps for sacrifices to fully awaken their master.  Not even the sharp teeth are safe.  We no longer travel alone that we might protect ourselves form their attacks.  The rituals performed bring more danger to our swamps.  The elders talk of either moving on trying to strike at them.  We travel in this hunting party that we may kill some of them.  We have had some luck but they are numerous.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrett listened intently asking, \u201cCould you point us in the direction that they come from?  We were sent here to put an end to the evil.  Any aid you can provide would be appreciated.\u201d  Garrett looked into Hikozo\u2019s eyes to display his seriousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lizardman nodded pleased with Garrett saying, \u201cWe thank you for your help.  There is an ancient stone temple that the elders speak of.  Our people have long considered it taboo to approach it.  I will have the others travel home to tell the elders.  I will lead you the best I can to the temple.  Protecting my people should not be left to strangers to our land.\u201d  The other lizardmen nodded their understanding before hurrying off to alert their tribe that aid arrived.  Hikozo hoped that they might persuade the elders to a more proactive approach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elders of the slow conservative thinking angered Hikozo who personally knew many of those taken by the monsters.  They seemed to believe that in time the problem would take care of itself.  Never committing to any decision just growing fat on the labors of others.  With Sir Garrett help he believed they might defeat the evil.  With that fame he could become chief.  Under his leadership the tribe would prosper.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrett said, \u201cAlbert and me appreciate your strength and knowledge to ours.  It adds to my belief in our eventual triumph.\u201d</span></div></div>",

She waited for the pair to settle down for the night setting the squire to the first watch before she dared to move in any closer. Lady Melody\u2019s love for Sir Garrett had been rejected and she was determined no other woman would have him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears of studying the mystical arts had given Lady Melody the ability to secure her revenge with magic. It was wise to prevent anything from ruining her chances by casting a sleep spell. The mists of sleep covered the camp sending Sir Garrett, his squire and even the horses into a deep dreamless slumber. Once her spell took effect she entered the camp with a delighted smile on her face as she drew close to the slumbering Sir Garrett. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scroll had cost quite a bit of money but it was worth it to watch the mighty paladin Sir Garrett transform into a buxom beauty who would have a hard time lifting her long sword much less her armor. Lady Melody read the scroll causing it to disintegrate into magic which launched itself at the helpless knight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiseled muscles vanished as the magic went about its\u2019 work leaving a slender form behind. Scars and body hair became soft and smooth skin except upon his head where his hair became long luxurious golden locks. The areola expanded on his chest as his nipples extended into the air. Fat flooded the warrior\u2019s chest swelling his breasts into mountains on his tiny form. It wasn\u2019t long before his manhood slid into his body forming into proof of his womanhood. A lovely blonde who barely reached five feet in height now lay where the over six foot paladin once slept. Lady Ashley took a moment to admire the beauty of her revenge before leaving to vanish into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquire Albert awoke with a headache which he quickly shook only to be disturbed by the sight of the bright light of the rising sun. Sir Garrett was going to kill him for falling asleep on watch but it was better to admit the mistake than compound the evil by lying, so he head for the tent where the paladin had laid down. It wasn\u2019t the squire\u2019s day because he didn\u2019t find his knight instead he found a half-naked woman laying down in Sir Garrett\u2019s bed. His face burned with a blush as he reached out to shake the woman awake to get some answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett felt someone shaking her awake and a very strange but not unpleasant feeling of jiggling upon her chest. The paladin\u2019s eyes opened to see her squire gently pushing her with his eyes turned away in embarrassment and she soon saw why. Two fleshy protrusions of a decidedly large proportion hung from her chest. A soft touch by Sir Garrett confirmed her fears that the breasts were real and extremely sensitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDark magic is at work here Albert,\u201d Sir Garrett pulled out one of her shirts and frowned as she realized how oversized it was on her small body. \u201cWe shall have to take swift action.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir Garrett?\u201d Albert questioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Sir Garrett tightened her shirt to give her breast\u2019s some support and continued to make some semblance of an outfit to fit her new form from the male clothing at hand. Adversity had never stopped her before and she wasn\u2019t going to let it happen now. \u201cI have been placed under some form of transformation magic. Let us thank the Gods that I still have my mind or we could be in real trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Albert answered glad that his master was still here in mind and spirit if not body. \u201cWhat should we do next?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It wasn\u2019t so much a desire for revenge as a desire to return to who he was. He felt if he could catch up with the culprit he could be transformed back into a man quickly because the person should have the ability to reverse what has been done. \u201cWe should seek out the culprit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure master?\u201d  Albert looked out concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf we can catch up to culprit quick enough we won\u2019t have to delay our mission too much,\u201d Sir Garrett explained. \u201cThey should have a cure for what they have done to me, and if we go seeking a cure who knows how much work it will entail. If we continue with our mission as I am now I may prove to be an anchor weighing down the success of the mission because this body moves differently than my old one and my equipment is not of the right size.\u201d<br>\r\nAlbert nodded at the explanation,\u201d I will seek out the tracks to the east and do a circle west and you go west and circle east. We will do a quick circle that way and hopefully find a trail to follow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood plan let us commence,\u201d Sir Garrett smiled which caused his or rather now her apprentice to blush. The effect had not been intended but was not to be unexpected considering the little experience his squire had with girls especially beautiful ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long for them to find the trail. The real question was why anyone would wear high heels to the woods. They tracked the footprints back to the road with little difficulty and they were very certain the person would be heading towards civilization considering the expensive pieces of fabric they found caught on thorn bushes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question before them now was if they should push their horses before in the pursuit or take a more methodical approach. If they pushed the animals they could likely catch the person much more quickly but they were taking a great risk of overshooting the target and missing them especially since they didn\u2019t see the person who intruded on the camp. If they took the more time it was likely they would discover who had committed the action against Sir Garrett but there was a strong possibility of the trail going cold in the time they took following the various trails of investigation they would have to pursue.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sir Garrett tried to ignore the changes to her body but he was finding it to be very difficult. The chest and nipples of a man felt very different for what a woman had and she was starting to wonder if it was normal or part of the enchantment that had been placed upon her. Her nipples had been rubbing against her shirt causing a great deal of pleasure and arousal to the young woman. She had stifled more than one moan of pleasure and thoughts of touching herself were starting to bedevil her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paladin knew her duty but her sweat soaked body craved attention from her hands or maybe those of another. She shook her head to clear the thoughts from her head drawing the attention of Albert as the golden lockets of hair bounced back and forth with the swaying of her breasts from the movement. With great effort Albert turned from the paladin though he couldn\u2019t help taking one last peak before talking to his knight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat should we call you in public?\u201d Albert asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a reasonable question but it annoyed Sir Garrett because it reminded she might be trapped as a woman for a long time, \u201cI suppose Samantha will do for now as I don\u2019t have the equipment for calling myself a noble right now and it will attract less attention if we go as commoners, so I will call you Albert and you should not use any of your titles for right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert nodded but wasn\u2019t sure he agreed with the decision. Attention of the wrong sort was sure to be brought by the new appearance of his master and having her be a nobleperson would perhaps make the people look for easier prey, but he was willing to trust in her thought because of all of his years of experience with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould we start asking questions of the merchants?\u201d Albert asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha shook her head no, \u201cWe are going to take a calculated risk and try to ride her down. We know we are dealing with a woman of expensive tastes who isn\u2019t familiar with the wilderness, so since we suspect I was targeted because they didn\u2019t transform you we should be looking for someone I know. The women I know that fit this description are noblewomen who would be heading towards the capital, because they would be traveling with a large group they should be going slow, so if we hurry we should be able to catch up with them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if you are wrong . . .?\u201d Albert asked with some hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde woman shrugged, \u201cI said it was a calculated risk. There is a chance I could be very wrong, but whoever did this to me didn\u2019t think this out very well because wearing high heels in the woods is not a good idea. I don\u2019t look forward to backtracking if we have to but if we follow the trail to the capital we can seek a cure from the court wizard if we don\u2019t find the culprit. A warrior for justice has to take risks frequently but they should always think through the consequences involved in taking them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am sorry for questioning your judgment.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to question me my squire. I want you to think things through and if I am being honest I do make mistakes at times so putting our minds together should help to prevent my errors. With that out of the way let us be on the way after a little adjustment before we go through the town.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha removed her sweat soaked shirt and put on a fresh one without thinking about the effect of her new form on her young squire. The blush on Albert\u2019s face felt like it would burn right through the other side of his head. Small droplets of sweat beaded on the chest of the paladin as other drops sparkled in the air from the removal of the shirt. Albert pulled his eyes away from the lovely scene out of respect for his master\u2019s modesty suspecting she was going through the habit of changing shirts in front of him as she had done thousands of times before as a man. The young squire decided to not bring up the subject for fear of embarrassing his master, but he worried it was really in the hopes of seeing her naked chest again. Once Samantha was thorough changing she pressed her horse forward at a quick pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert had been looking forward to stopping to rest in the small rest in the village ahead of them but it didn\u2019t look like that would be happening. It looked like cool trail rations were in his future again. The hardship was very small in comparison to the trial his master must be going through. He wondered if he should try to talk to her about it. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It is hard to break the habits of a lifetime in such a short time period and I don\u2019t see a reason to change if we get this solved quickly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth was she agreed with him about some of what he was saying but she didn\u2019t want to admit she had to change her behaviors because it felt like giving into the people who had done this to her. She would quietly try and make better choices like putting on a thicker shirt when they reached the town. Being in the wilderness allowed her to enjoy some of the things happening to her. The heat in the air had caused the shirt to conform to her massive breasts that shook as she rode. She suspected this was distracting her squire but the sensation of the soft wet shirt caressing her nipples was wonderous and made her want to feel other experiences of this new body. A small moan of pleasure escaped her lips surprising Albert who pulled his horse to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster, you must stop this,\u201d Albert commanded. \u201cThis may be part of the transformation if you continue giving in you may not return to your proper form.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman blushed and nodded to his words dropping off the horse and put on a fresh shirt. She felt sensitive to every touch and movement in this body, it could that this body was alien to her but it felt like something more. Albert was right that she should be more careful about giving into the pleasure until she knew more about the curse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we need to stop by some sort of magic user to discover more about your change before we continue this quest,\u201d Albert explained. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how much of your mind has been altered by this magic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Samantha snapped. \u201cWe are so close and their trail grows fresher by the mile.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor how long? We are nearing some of the major roads where their wagon wheels will fade into a dozen others if we can see it at all on stone roads to come. We should stop by the Church of the Fiery Light or see if your friend Malic is in his tower, to stay on this path is foolish.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet us at least follow them until their trail actually ends. I don\u2019t want to give up hope until I have to or would you rather see me stuck like this. You have been staring at me all day with those love sick eyes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hurt was plain on the squire\u2019s face and Samantha regretted her harsh words but she did still want to pursue the culprits even if Albert may have a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen I am sorry I was so harsh,\u201d Samantha apologized. \u201cLet\u2019s . . .\u201d</span></div></div>",

She appreciated that Albert was here but he was still young, it felt wrong to have him correct her. She was his master, teaching him the ways of the order so that one day soon he might become a paladin in his own right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe city of Eagle\u2019s Peak was a hub for many on religious journeys and crafted some of the finest potions and remedies to be found in the Kingdom. Samantha didn\u2019t care for the hate directed towards magic users in the city but she could understand it. An evil undead wizard had held the place under siege for two decades and the memory was still fresh for many of those living in the place. Things were getting better, slowly, but it was the wise spell crafter who hid their appearance as wizards or sorcerers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey passed through two of the gates to get to the temple of the Silver Griffin. Church guards flanked the entrance to the large cathedral. Samantha hadn\u2019t been here very often but it was very likely she would meet someone she recognized here though they weren\u2019t likely to recognize her any longer with her new form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spied her reflection in one of the mirrors and didn\u2019t like what she saw. Despite her time the road and less than proper attire she was still obviously a very beautiful woman with the curves and build more fitting a pleasured woman than a person who belonged to the church especially one as fine as this. Samantha knew she would be welcomed, they welcomed everyone inside but she a paladin of the order and going in like this would be disrespecting the Gods of good the Silver Griffin worked for. Samantha hesitated as she stood in front of the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d Albert asked. \u201cIs there something holding you back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly my attire and appearance,\u201d Samantha responded. \u201cI think I should clean up before I go inside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t listen to that voice, that is just vanity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is more than that, it is about showing respect to this place and the divinity in it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is up to you, what do you want to do?\"</span></div></div>",

He hoped the ride would help to calm her emotions which must be running a mile a minute. Samantha had loved riding for most of her life from childhood in the monastery run by the Order of the Silver Griffin. The squire wondered what life would have been like without his family growing up as an orphan. It was a very personal question and his master tended to avoid those questions and Albert wasn\u2019t one to pry as much as he might want to pry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe long ride was giving Albert too much time to think, so he adjusted his mind to focus on the road ahead. The ride was shaded by the forest allowing it to feel much cooler than it really was. Occasionally small roads leading off to family farms would appear in view before rapidly vanishing in the dust of their horses. It wouldn\u2019t be long before they reached the imperial roads and not long after that they would be able to see the capital city. Worry struck the squire\u2019s heart as he thought of the masses of people the person they were following could vanish into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud scream awakened the squire from his dark thoughts as he saw a woman being thrust into a caged wagon ahead of them. He was about to bring it to the attention of his master but he saw Samantha had already spotted the men up ahead and pressed her horse into a gallop towards the attackers.  Albert pressed his own horse into a gallop worried about how much of her combat skill Samantha retained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is your business with these women?\u201d Samantha asked in a less than friendly tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men grinned at the attractive blonde who appeared before them. They were a little surprised by her drawing of a short sword but they were far from frightened by her or her companion who was drawing up close to her. The five men had experienced combat many times before and weren\u2019t afraid of two novices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCollecting debtors for trade,\u201d a big bearded man laughed. \u201cYou want to join them? A pretty nymph like you would go for quite a bit of money.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSlavery is illegal in the kingdom of Dar,\u201d Samantha retorted. \u201cYour actions are punishable by death. If you free these young woman I will let you go, but I warn you I am very familiar with combat if you chose to fight me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApparently this young woman is not up on the latest news,\u201d A thin man holding a whip loosely in one hand spoke up. \u201cThe King in his infinite wisdom has decided to change that rule, so much debt has been built up by the kingdom they need to make some revenue to keep the nobles at bay. Take your boyfriend and get out of here if you don\u2019t want to end up like the criminals in our cages.\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She realized she was not as strong as she once was so she went after the weakest looking target first to give herself some confidence. Her leap from the horse added the laws of physics to her side causing her blade to slice clean through the small slaver she had targeted ending the threat he had posed, but she didn\u2019t wait to congratulate herself on the success because she knew four opponents remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe momentary stun the slavers had felt at seeing a small woman attack them into action. It would be interesting to see how they chose to divide themselves now. The wisest thing to do would be two against Samantha and two against Albert until they determined the true strength of each opponent because Samantha may have just struck a lucky blow but they shouldn\u2019t take that chance. The paladin watched to see what way the winds would blew the slavers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thin man with the whip began to approach Samantha while the person with a net began to try to flank her which left the man with the maces and a person with a man catcher to attack her squire. It wasn\u2019t a good match up for either of them. The two men the paladin was facing had longer reach weapons than her short sword, but they weren\u2019t likely to have the years of combat experience she had. Samantha was worried about her squire though because these men had a lot more experience then him and he was likely to be worried about how she would perform and try to get over to her when he should be focusing on his own opponents. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Samantha closed the distance to the man with the whip before he could lash out at her properly, her short sword found a home in the man\u2019s chest and spun him his body into the net of the other man as she pulled her blade free from the body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep your focus on your own battle,\u201d Samantha saw Albert looking at how things were going for her. He was dealing with the more dangerous opponents and needed to stay focused. She would help him if when she could but this was a battle he needed to win on his own if he could or at least hold out until help could arrive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will,\u201d Albert responded as he dodged a swing from a mace. He knew she was right but she looked so small and weak now it was hard to not worry even if he had worries of his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man with the maces was the bigger threat and should be dealt with quickly if he could. Albert made sure to not allow the other person to get behind his back and watched for an opening. He blocked both maces with his shield as the large man brought down a double against him nearly knocking the squire to the ground. Albert released his grip on the shield causing the man to go off balance and pressed forward with his longsword with both hands. The slaver cried out in pain as he fell backward, dead. His partner moved forward to attack but the squire had already rolled to safety and pulled a set of daggers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert darted back from the swing of the slaver\u2019s weapon and prepare to throw the daggers. He wasn\u2019t very confident about throwing the weapons but the reach was too great to move in on unless he was very luck and if he distracted the man enough he might be able to collect his sword. His dagger flew through the and struck the man in the shoulder and the second blade scored a direct hit in the man\u2019s heart. The slaver looked stunned for a moment before collapsing to the ground in death. He didn\u2019t give himself a chance to congratulate himself on the victory as he pulled the long sword free and turned to his attention to Lady Samantha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice work,\u201d Samantha said with a smile on her face as she stood over the corpse of the final slaver. \u201cLet\u2019s free the citizens and give these criminals slavers a burial.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ladies thank them for their assistance, giving special attention to the handsome young squire who was so brave and skilled with a sword. They let them take the slaver\u2019s wagon and coin to help them start a new life. Sunlight had started to fade from the sky as they finished the burying of the dead. They needed to decide on a course of actions for the continuation of their journey. </span></div></div>",

She eyed their single tent and decided they would be sleeping in shifts again. The paladin had shared shelter with her squire on many occasions before the change but it seemed different now that she was female. She wasn\u2019t sure if it was her squire she didn\u2019t trust or herself. The more she thought about it the more certain it was herself that she didn\u2019t trust because of the feelings inside of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert had been her squire for many years and she trusted him with her life. A change of genders wouldn\u2019t break the trust between them even if Albert was awkward around girls. Samantha, however, was unfamiliar with this form and the urges she was feeling. She didn\u2019t know how deep the changes were. As a man she had been very unfamiliar with women, she had always dealt with them in a professional capacity, not a physical one. She wasn\u2019t sure if the tingles and pleasures of flesh she was feeling were normal and that left her with little confidence or trust in herself. She wished she could talk to Princess Fina though she suspected the conversation would be awkward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want the first shift or the second one?\u201d She asked her squire as he came back with the firewood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face turned red and she remembered that the last time he had been in charge of watching was when she had been transformed. She still trusted him with her life, it was likely he had been put to sleep by magic and even if that wasn\u2019t the case everyone makes mistakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I trust you,\u201d she smiled warmly at him. \u201cMake your choice.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Albert watched the curvy form of his mentor enter the tent and tried to turn away from the enticing images of her stripping her clothing off formed by the firelight. Finally, not having success keeping his eyes from the tent he went to circle the camp to perhaps set an animal trap so they could have some fresh meat for the next day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was late at night and the light was nearly gone from the sky so it was much more difficult to work and set them properly along game trails but he was doing it more to keep his mind busy. He didn\u2019t want to take advantage of the form his mentor had. The squire had been around beautiful women before but it had always been formal occasions and they certainly had not stripped naked near him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContent that he no longer heard Lady Samantha moving around he moved back to the campfire and listened to her gentle breathing before going to sit down. He started whittling to pass the time like he had been taught by his Father years before. It was one of the few fond memories he had of the man who had destroyed the family fortune and reputation. A knight started to form under the guidance of his skilled cutting even as his anger tried to make his work sloppy. His Father\u2019s actions meant he could no longer marry for love if he wanted to keep his family estates running. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time it came to wake Samantha he had two knights and a couple pawns for a chess set. He thought about trying to stay awake for the rest of the night so Samantha wouldn\u2019t have to do a shift but he realized that would be just as much a failure as falling asleep. If he stayed up he would be of diminished ability the next day so he moved over to the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is your shift mistress,\u201d Albert called to Samantha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d the sleepy voice of Samantha responded. She exited the tent and stood up with her breasts jiggling as she rubbed the sleep from her eyes before putting on her top. Her face suddenly turned red as she realized what she had done and Albert pretended to have been looking in another direction. He suspected she knew that he had seen her magnificent bosom as his face felt like it was on fire but they both decided to pretend nothing had happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you in the morning,\u201d Albert said as he crawled into the tent where her warm and lovely body had recently been. The squire curled up under a blanket and hoped he would be able to get some sleep this night considering the images he had just seen.</span></div></div>",

Samantha was cooking up some of the salted meat they had which reminded the young squire of his traps. He was still a little embarrassed about the events of the night before so he did a circle around the camp making sure to set off any of the small traps that hadn\u2019t gone off so no animals were hurt after they had left. Like he had expected the traps were empty until he came to the last one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wondered if it was going to be a rabbit or a squirrel but instead, he found a tiny glowing woman with translucent wings. Albert lifted the rock from her and carried her back to camp, he eyed her closely and it appeared that she was breathing so he was hopeful that she was alright. Fairies tended to avoid humans so this was the first time he had seen one and certainly the closest he had been to one. Lady Samantha frowned when she saw what her squire had brought back to camp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suggest you bind the wound on the head and leave her here,\u201d she said as she examined the wound. \u201cThe injury is minor and the Fae always recover quickly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should stay with her until she wakes or take her with us until she rouses,\u201d Albert responded. \u201cIt is my fault she got hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand your feeling but the Fae are nothing but trouble. She will either be angry with you or thankful for your actions and both of those can be deadly.

Now, eat up before it gets cold.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert couldn\u2019t help having a big smile as he gobbled down breakfast and started breaking down camp. He could tell his mentor wasn\u2019t happy to be doing this but the young squire couldn\u2019t help being excited about the prospect of the tiny fairy. She seemed so fragile and helpless but she might be extremely dangerous, with powers feared by entire kingdoms. The Fae kept to themselves so most of what humans knew about them was old myths and legends handed down for over a hundred years. The paladin in training was curious to learn more about them and there was no better than one of them. He was worried she would wake before they left and he would have to leave her behind before they got a chance to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey rode in silence away from their campsite with Samantha unhappy about the new addition to their party and Albert checking to see if the fairy was alright every thirty seconds. Albert wasn\u2019t sure if her breathing was normal, fast or slow. Albert was going to ask to stop at a healer when the stopped for lunch if the fairy hadn\u2019t awakened by that time and as the time approached the tiny female started to rouse herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature was humanoid in shape but very different in appearance. She had bright blue eyes that glowed but had no pupils and long pointed ears like an elf. Her hair was silver done up in an intricate pattern that shined in the sun and her translucent wings sparkled as they fluttered to life as she backed away from the giant human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you and where are you taking me?\u201d The fairy demanded of them with no fear in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Lady Samantha and this is Albert, my squire,\u201d Samantha responded as she pulled her horse to a stop. \u201cWe have a quest to complete so we brought you with us until you woke up to keep you safe because it was our fault you got hurt. You fell into the trap set by my squire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe listened carefully to the human\u2019s words and leaped a spinning jump into the air looking ecstatic about something she had heard. Suddenly remembering she had an audience she put on a guise of proper royal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Princess Noellene and I accept your apology,\u201d Noellene spoke in the formal tones nobles often used on official occasions. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be proper if I didn\u2019t demand something in return for the wrong you have done to me.

She was not a being who was used to being told no and it was an unacceptable answer as she had need of their assistance if she was to get what she wanted. Perhaps she could make some sort of bargain with the humans for treasure, humans were greedy simple creatures that had an endless interest in the metal called gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert was just as stunned by the behavior of his knight, he had never known her to be so rude, especially to a creature in need of their assistance. Did Lady Samantha carry some sort of grudge against the Fae? He coaxed his horse to catch up so he could ask why they weren\u2019t going to a place that wasn\u2019t far from off of where their journey was taking them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have access to gold that I can give you in exchange for your services human,\u201d Noellene fluttered over and land on Thunder\u2019s head in front of the paladin. \u201cI suggest you take my most generous offer before you earn my ire.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have access to gold,\u201d Samantha leaned in close to the fairy. \u201cYou will have to offer me something more substantial than gold in order for me to assist you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA red aura filled the air around the small creature as she was overwhelmed by anger. Noellene stomped her foot but the horse seemed to take no note of the angry gesture. She glared hard at the paladin who met the gaze with a rather bored look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have done wrong by injuring me,\u201d Noellene snapped. \u201cYou owe a debt to me for what you have done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are the one who fell into a trap design for a dumb animal,\u201d the fairy\u2019s cheeks grew red with embarrassment instead of anger. \u201cI wonder what your brethren would have to say about that. We protected you from any danger while you were knocked out and have carried you much closer to your destination so if there was any debt it has been more than repaid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magical creature opened her mouth to argue with Samantha but found the human\u2019s logic frustratingly correct. This human had even made a threat of telling others of her foolishness, something she could never live down if it was spread in the royal could. She would have to bargain with this ruthless human. The thought drew a smile to her face at meeting a human who knew some of the ways of her and her ilk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have vexed me human with the truth of your words,\u201d Noellene met the watchful gaze of the paladin carefully. \u201cSince gold is not of an interest to you perhaps I could offer you some of the wonders available to a princess of the Winter Court.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou might be able to interest me,\u201d Lady Samantha said softly. \u201cWhat do you have to offer?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Once it takes place fairy law says she must accept him but until that happens I have been assigned someone to watch over me and they are very likely to not be happy with my escape. Mother is certain to punish them if I get married because she won\u2019t be able to punish my husband and she loves me so her wrath will have to go somewhere. Oh, it was a great trick, I bet it took hours for them to figure out I wasn\u2019t there anymore. I left behind my magic in the dummy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou left your magic behind!?!

Her short sword slid through the chest of her attacker causing him to fall backwards in pain, but the whip of her other attacker yanked Samantha away from her fallen opponent. She fell on the ground choking as she was dragged along by the slaver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster, No!\u201d Albert screamed as he witnessed his witnessed his master being dragged by the enemy across the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs blackness fought to send Samantha to the world of slumber as she prayed her squire had the sense to focus on his opponents rather than trying to come to her aid, because things would be much worse if he let down his guard. Samantha quickly planted her feet quickly to push herself into the air briefly and spin around slashing through the whip that was strangling her allowing her breathing to become more relax. The thin man smiled at the paladin\u2019s victory, clapping slightly before drawing a pair of metal batons to use against his Samantha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately Albert hadn\u2019t been following the advice of his master and took his eyes off the enemy when his master was injured, and the enemy took advantage of his inattention. He was yanked backwards as the man catcher closed around his throat bringing him back into the focus of the battle but it was already too late. Mace blows from the man\u2019s partner struck hard and fast knocking the young warrior out. His body was allowed to slump to the ground as the slavers approached their companion to assist him against Samantha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha struck fought furiously against the metal baton skills of the slaver beginning to win ground against him as small cuts he had received started to drain him of his life, but the paladin didn\u2019t notice the extra two targets drawing in close to her behind. The man catcher slammed shut on the throat of the young woman locking her in its metal grip as her blade sliced a death blow into the neck of her opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must compliment you on your skill,\u201d the large man laughed. \u201cYou certainly difficult to deal with but I think you will be compliant for now because if you aren\u2019t your friend will be taking a permanent dirt nap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing she was trapped for now Samantha complied by tossing her short sword away from her body and allowed her to be led to the cage. Another opportunity would be certain to appear in time if she was watchful, but she knew it would be difficult as her jailers searched and removed items of possible danger from both her and her squire. She was a little surprised the slavers didn\u2019t touch her body more as they searched her body, but they seemed only interested in looking for possible danger to themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the slaying of our companions young lady,\u201d The large man spoke as he set the wagon into motion. \u201cYou just made our profits higher. Now, sit back and enjoy the ride because we have a bit of a trip ahead of us.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you taking us if I may be so bold to ask,\u201d Samantha said. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The slavers were very watchful of Albert and her, making sure they were kept back from the door whenever they were given food. After several days in the cramped quarters a large stone walled compound came into view. The paladin wasn\u2019t sure they had crossed the border, but this certainly part of the frontier. She almost wished for a raid by orcs or goblins to give them a chance to escape. The humanoids were far less diligent on guard duty but the treatment of their prisoners was far worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant reinforced gate creaked open for them as many crossbowmen watched closely for any surprise attacks from the distant woods. As soon as there was room the wagon rolled inside the compound pulling to a halt in front of a large stone building where a large man with a whip waited eagerly for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinal stop ladies,\u201d one of the slavers growled. \u201cYou sir have a little further to go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert was signaled to not fight at this point by his mistress, because it would have been a pointless death that would save none of them. Too many eyes, and ranged weapons watched them looking for any sign of rebellion. The future might hold some hope for either Albert or Samantha and if one of them could escape they could rescue the other one, so Samantha followed her fellow slaves out of the wagon to stand in a row with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch the curvy blonde she can be dangerous,\u201d the thin slaver said before starting up his beast of burden to go outside the gate. The man with the whip nodded at the slaver\u2019s words but made no threat or violence against Samantha, but his eyes watched her closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer squire gave a wave to Samantha before the gate slammed shut blocking her view of him and she was left to wonder if he saw her return wave. She shut down her emotions and set her mind to escape. The walls were tall, the guards many and she was a long way from friendly territory but escape might be possible. She would keep her head down and obey orders for the moment but when a chance presented itself she would make the most of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Bartok,\u201d the man with the whip said smoothly almost sweetly. \u201cI don\u2019t care what you were before you came here, because you are now slaves. I will be training you over the coming weeks so you have some actual value. Obey and all will go well for you but if you disobey or try to escape you will find that I can be most creative with my punishments. I suggest if you feel you must escape the life of a slave that you do it after you have left here because you are surrounded by hostile territory where there are beings who will do far worse to you then I plan to do. Let\u2019s get started.\u201d </span></div></div>",

From the look of her, she was a commoner, most likely a merchant\u2019s daughter. Lifting himself slowly from the ground he saw a wagon with a large man looking at him with more than a little impatience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see Molly, he is fine, let\u2019s get going!\u201d the man yelled. \u201cThis product isn\u2019t going to stay good forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is hurt, we have to take him with us,\u201d Molly responded. \u201cWhat is your name and what happened to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can talk and move at the same time. Get moving stranger if you are coming with us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chestnut haired girl helped the squire to his feet and walked with him over to the wagon keeping his arm over her shoulders. She smelled like the wildflowers near his manor Albert decided as they reached the wagon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Albert,\u201d he hesitated to tell them too much, unsure if he should let them know about the condition Sir Garrett was under. \u201cI was fighting some slavers and they took the companion I was traveling with. I have to follow them and rescue her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course we will help you,\u201d Molly promised. \u201cMy father was a great fighter in the army of the King and I am sure we can rescue your wife.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeak for yourself girl, I am done with battle and adventure,\u201d the older man growled. \u201cIt means little more than an empty purse and little sleep. I am a merchant now and as my daughter, you would do well to learn the business.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Dad,\u201d Molly begged. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to take up the title of Nick the Blade again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNames cause nothing but trouble,\u201d Nick snorted. \u201cPeople always feel the need to challenge the reputation that goes with such a name.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe lady was just my friend,\u201d Albert explained. \u201cIf you would let me ride with you until the path of the slavers splits from your own that will be more than enough, I can\u2019t ask you to put your lives at risk for my friend.\u201d</span></div></div>",

The guards walking the walls had stopped their movement and were all watching the new slaves, for the joy of their naked flesh or to back up the ruler of this place she wasn\u2019t sure but no victory but a moral one was going to be won by starting a fight so she started to remove her clothing without a word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could see a woman next to him, a petite blond, was on the verge of breaking down in tears and was making no effort to obey the command so Samantha took hold of her and whispered some words of comfort to her though she wasn\u2019t sure if she believed the words. She pulled the top of the dress off the woman revealing a pair of small, and firm breasts drawing some whistling and hooting from the watching men. She could feel the woman heat up in embarrassment, turning bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen,\u201d Samantha whispered sternly. \u201cBartok is looking to make an example of someone, don\u2019t give him the satisfaction of showing you are afraid or embarrassed even if you are afraid. All of us are afraid but I will do my best to save all of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl nodded, \u201cThank you, my name is Lily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Samantha, hurry inside he is beginning to look impatient,\u201d Samantha responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paladin stripped her remaining clothing, feeling the stares of the men nearly burning a hole through her body. She started to follow after the others but the whip of the slave trainer came to a rest against her throat holding her from continuing forward. Samantha turned her eyes, unsure if she had permission to move, to gaze a Bartok, questioning him what he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was a good thing you did for that girl back there,\u201d Bartok explained. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you are smart and realize getting with the program is the smartest thing or if you are stupid and plotting a long-term escape plan. I think you are stupid, you have that look about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand reached out and squeezed her breasts hard causing a mixture of pleasure and pain. Cheers came from the voyeurs on the walls but she refused to cry out in pain. There was no winning this situation so she endured until he released her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, definitely stupid,\u201d Bartok smiled. \u201cI can see the defiance in your eyes but you don\u2019t need to worry pretty lady, I will make you smart. I have a long career of correcting the stupid thinking of women and making them more intelligent. Now, get inside and wash up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladly moving away from the man felt great to young blond as she entered the bath house. She was worried about the attention she was going to get from the man but there was nothing she could do about that. His suspicion had already been raised by the slaver and her body was not one that most men would ignore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweet aromas filled the air as the woman used soaps to wash their bodies. Six women besides herself massaged their bodies clean taking a few moments of relief from the fact that they were slaves. All of these naked women were a fantasy to the dreams of most men but to her frustration, they held little interest to her in her new form. Deciding to not dwell on it so she got started washing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHot water and soap felt wonderful on her body after so many days of hard traveling. She managed to stifle a moan as she caressed her large breasts but just barely. This was her first time getting a good look and feel for her body. She had promised to be chaste until she was married but did the vow to not take advantage of a woman still apply when the woman was herself? Samantha wanted to go further with the pleasures of this body but she was cautious with all of these other people around. She didn\u2019t want them to think that she was some sort of lust filled sex fiend. The paladin needed to convince the others that she was in control of herself so they would trust her with their fates when the time came. Trust needed to be earned quickly because she didn\u2019t know when the chance for freedom would come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome out ladies and learn your fates,\u201d Bartok called to them. \u201cYour future careers are at hand.\u201d</span></div></div>",

The humiliation didn\u2019t end there as the slave trainer went down the line pausing a moment to grope the naked flesh of each of the women. Samantha bit down hard on her tongue to distract herself as he arrived at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTruly the gods gave with both hands with you,\u201d Aelios spoke crudely. His hands were oiled and glided over her sensitive skin. Heat welled within her from the oil causing a tiny moan to escape. \u201cThere is no need to fight. Cry out if you are enjoying yourself. I see no reason at all why anyone of you shouldn\u2019t enjoy your new lot in life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha promised herself she wouldn\u2019t give him the satisfaction but doubts were starting to creep in as his skilled hands probed further. Slowly the hands parted the petals of her flow causing her legs to quake and with a tiny tweak further, the battle was lost. An orgasm like she had never experienced burst out of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo sensitive and a virgin to boot,\u201d a smile of satisfaction formed on the man\u2019s face. \u201cYou are going to fetch some serious coin. My only regret is I shall not be the one to pluck you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFree me,\u201d Samantha managed to whimper out as she swayed trying to regain footing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I intend to just not in the way you are hoping. All of you are about to become creatures of pleasure. Living to ignite the minds of men and burn with a passion you have never known. All of the women here will be able to please the lowliest stinking peasant to the highest perfumed prince with equal glee. It makes me sad to think of the years you wasted on your mind when you have a body so readied and primed for heavenly delights. Don\u2019t worry, I will turn you into a masterpiece.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paladin held strong despite the thought of losing all that she had been pecking at her mind. They would have to sleep sometime and she would set to work when they did. She clung to that hope as something primal chirped that she should give in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tiny brunette burst from their line in a doomed bid for freedom. Bartok\u2019s whip caught her ankle before she got ten feet. The big man laughed as he dragged back across the soft sands of the compound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thank you for allowing me to demonstrate how futile escape is,\u201d he yanked the slave from her feet as if she was only a child. \u201cGet cleaned up or you will know what else my whip can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman rushed to obey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that entertainment is over it is time for lessons to begin,\u201d Aelios announced. \u201cWe shall start with . . .\u201d </span></div></div>",

There was an area with pillows and stage at one end of the room. One wall had boxes of props and outfits from the embarrassing to the truly demeaning. At the other end of the room was a mirrored wall with a bar to hold onto. The final wall was a glass running down the length for outsiders to observe the ladies within. A few men in smiles gave leering looks to the ladies of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is far more to sex than sticking a cock into a hole,\u201d he explained as he motioned to all of the aspects of the room. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to be common whores to be bought for a few coppers. All of you shall be creatures of legendary pleasure for your masters and this room is but the first step. I have a reputation to uphold and we will start with moving your bodies. You there!

I asked for you to sway your ass for your master.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crack of the whip sent her scurrying for the stage. Tears welled in her eyes as she jerked her body about like a fish on dry land struggling for life. She flinched when the man leaped upon the stage next to her expecting a beating for her failure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is your name child?\u201d his voice was sweet as the finest sugar and his words as gentle as a tranquil pond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWendy Meadows sir,\u201d the woman started to relax as he gently took her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrom now on your name is Blaze because you have a fiery passion within you. I shall teach you to ignite it so even a eunuch shall rise to the occasion. Now close your eyes and move your body so your master knows you are a creature of fire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movements had greatly improved. Blaze had slow rolls of her hips and caresses of her breasts that could light the passions. It was not perfect but it was a vast improvement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell done Blaze,\u201d Aelios jumped down and stalked close to them. \u201cYou are slaves now. There is nothing I can do about that or even want to do about that. What I want is to do is to make the finest sex slaves of you. It is admittedly a selfish goal as the better job I do the more profits I make but it is one you should share with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused a moment in front of Samantha and still see the fight clearly in the icy blue stare. She was aware of cult practices to remove their victims to gain control and she intended to fight him every step of the way. The hate was clear to him but he just smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can turn you into goddesses descended to earth who your masters shall worship. You will decide if he is spent before he even touches you. If you fight me and make no mistake you will lose your fate could be bad. I can turn you into a mindless automaton that is little more than a sex doll or I can turn you over to the Pits. A place where you could live up to a year if you are unlucky. Any way you like it I still make a profit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to Samantha, \u201cYour name shall be . . .\u201d</span></div></div>",

You will break before you even realize it is happening.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fist struck with her fury as her mind tried to tell it to stop. The man slapped it aside spinning her around. She attempted to squirm free as he pulled her close to his body, painfully close. His lip gently touched her shoulder and she cursed her body for feeling a tingle. The paladin slammed her heel into the man\u2019s foot which brought the release she desired. Aelios pulled back as he watched for further attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps I should have called you Kitten instead because you certainly have claws,\u201d the slaver eyed her. \u201cWhoever your people were they did you a grave disservice.

The suffering of another is a different story for you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man lifted a small ball no larger than a marble from a pouch. He rolled it around his fingers as a red powder swirled and trembled within. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know I made a bet I could break you without any magical substances like the Succubus Lotus,\u201d a shiver went down the paladin\u2019s spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Crystal,\u201d pleading was in her voice. \u201cWhat do you wish for me to do master?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it is a little too late for that. Which do you think would make you suffer more, me choosing the victim or you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal looked up and down the line of girls. None of them knew what it contained but all of them knew it was something to dread. </span></div></div>",

It is best all of you forget any past lives you might have had so we are sending you to the incense room. You may wonder why I am telling you all of this, it is because the more you fight the quicker you succumb to the effects of the flowers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were cries and pleadings as they were led to a building covered with elaborate murals of flowers and plants from around the known world. Samantha recognized many of them from her travel and training as things to be avoided. The Leethee flower stood out as what the man was talking about, with the proper training clerics and healers could use it to help ease a troubled mind but it had many darker uses. It was used by many to hide secrets or craft slaves and Samantha was not looking forward to finding out how successful it would be. There was a very real danger they would lose everything about themselves and become practically mindless. The plant was outlawed in most lands because the leaders feared it being used against themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha allowed herself to be lead into the room watching for an opportunity to escape but they were watching them closely and she heard the whip crack a few times before everyone was forced inside. The room was warm and vent holes lined the walls preventing any attempt to block all of them. Where they entered from was the only way out of the place and the door was of heavy wood construction and was barred from the outside. The walls caused a blush to form on the face of Samantha as she gazed upon the fornicating women in the murals servicing men with wanton abandon and she felt certain the men intended to have them join those women very soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if confirming her fears she saw the smoke starting to enter the room that she was sure was the dreaded fumes from the flower and several of the girls drew back in terror from the smoke. Samantha was surprised to discover it was only coming out two sides of the building and not all four sides. It must be expensive to use the flower and they were trying to save some money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, I want some of you to get as high up as you can by the door and other to get down on the floor,\u201d Samantha commanded the woman. \u201cI don\u2019t know how this gas works but we need to find out who will be affected the most so we know how best to counter it in the future. Some of us are going to suffer some memory loss but they will need to dose us multiple times for them to get us in the condition they want. We will beat them, this is only the first battle of the war.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words helped to calm the group and they quickly organized and started clustering at different spots around the room and made a mental note of where people picked for use later and hoped that she would remember after she suffered the effect of the gases. She picked her spot after all of the others had chosen theirs and tried to remember what she could about the flower but she had never had much of an interest in plants.  </span></div></div>",

She had seen trained soldiers show less courage in the face of danger and she was very proud of them but she suspected she wouldn\u2019t even remember in a short period of time. Samantha would try to keep busy in the meantime fighting the effects of the drug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Sir Garrett of the Order of the Silver Griffin,\u201d Samantha started speaking her history so the others could hear and remember. She could hear others doing the same. \u201cI was an orphan and was raised in a monastery. I love Princess Fina and plan to marry her. I believe in justice and good and will give my life to help others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head was starting to feel foggy but it wasn\u2019t an unpleasant feeling and she started to giggle. Several of the others started laughing as well, Samantha tried to take an assessment of the room but it was getting harder to remain focused. The golden-haired beauty couldn\u2019t remember what she had been so worried about as she allowed herself slide down to the floor underneath the waves of gas streaming into the room. Fear was obvious on the faces of some of the others standing high on the walls but she was filled with only joy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she tried to remember things they would start to come into focus but then a fog would roll over them and they would vanish. The first time she had held a sword, the first monster she had slain and even the first tender kiss she had shared with Princess Fina were stripped from her mind but there was no sadness to it only a bliss filled ignorance as she became aroused by the feeling of her body as that became her whole world.  </span></div></div>",

A frown formed on her face as the thought of a husband didn\u2019t sound right, wasn\u2019t she supposed to have a bride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tweaked a nipple drawing a moan of pleasure from herself to remind herself she was a woman. Women got married to men and she needed to do all that she could to keep her man happy so she listened intently to her instructions in pleasuring a man and then she had a class on cooking before the day drew to a close and she allowed to rejoin the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir Garrett, are you okay?\u201d a woman whispered to her after the guards left.

Her companion's words were starting to affect her dreams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a woman in the finest garments waiting for a man called Sir Garrett.

He exploded inside of her and she knew that her stomach would soon swell with the first of many children. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe picture changed to a handsome man who looked familiar to her. His armor and horse were ones she had known for many years. A part of her wondered if she was seeing a vision of her future but this felt more like her past.

She didn\u2019t bother pretending to be uncertain of who he wanted, his eyes made it clear he was looking for any sign of defiance. If she could she would lull him into a false sense of security.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true he had been warned about her but there was little reason for him to fear the gorgeous creature before him. Her ample assets were tempting and dangerous in their own way but hers was hardly the shape to combat a trained and armed warrior easily twice her size. The paladin walked towards him being careful to not exaggerate her sway, this man had likely faced attempts at seduction by at least a thousand different women and considering he was still here he was good at resisting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she came close he put his back towards her and walked towards a large stone building with heavy metal bars over the windows. Tantalizingly close was a dagger on the large man\u2019s belt, she could have it in an instant placing it in his back but it was trap she could easily pass on. The careful motion of the man\u2019s arms told her he was not so unguarded as he first appeared. Besides he was but one, there were men with crossbows awaiting any mistake on her part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether you are very smart or very dumb,\u201d he spoke at last as they reached a small room with a bathtub filled with steaming water. \u201cWe will find out soon, strip.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t difficult to obey, there wasn\u2019t much that she had on in the first place but still the red rose in her cheeks. He stalked around her as if she was an animal to be assessed before purchase. He lifted first one breast with his coiled whip allowing it to drop and the second one he pressed into her chest with the end of the whip before nodding in approval. Bartok\u2019s hand slipped down her back before cupped her butt cheek hard making her bite her lip to prevent a squeak from escaping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are a rare prize indeed,\u201d he suddenly shoved into the water causing her to lift out with a glare on her face. \u201cNormally we get farm girls who have been worked hard in the fields or city girls who no one would miss. What is your story?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing a chance she lied, or at least a half-truth because she could get the money, \u201cMy Father is a wealthy noble and I can have the ransom paid if you allow me to write him a letter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven your voice has a seductive tone, and you know how to write, I almost believe you. Well, it doesn\u2019t matter if you are telling the truth because you will be sold so get used to the idea. I have found nobles aren\u2019t forgiving to those who enslave their daughters and I plan to work here for many years to come.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere will be men looking for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet them look they will not come inside these walls to find you unless there is an army with them. You are going to be sold the question is where to sell you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo I have any say in the matter?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe only choice you have is whether you wash up or get a beating?

With a little attitude adjustment, something this place specializes in, you will be a fine wife to Gregor. Those hips will allow you to produce at least a dozen offspring, he has promised a bonus for each child his bride gives birth to.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had heard of Gregor and even met him a time or two. The eldest son of King Emeril, he was a warrior to be feared and a masterful general. He was often at the farthest reaches of the Kingdom quashing a rebellion or putting down an invasion force of a potential invader. Most viewed him as a bloodthirsty monster, to such an extent there was doubt he would inherit the throne but not Samantha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregor was haunted by acting as the executioner\u2019s ax for his father. The one to take the blame for all of the evils his father felt were needed. His desire for a docile wife was born likely out of a wish for peace than wanting an obedient slave girl as a partner. He would treat his well but she certainly wasn\u2019t looking for a husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it is only fair to warn you I have no attention to be a bride,\u201d she doubted he would back off on this goal but she decided to take the shot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you want to make this fun for me do you?\u201d the man laughed. \u201cDo you think you are somehow unique my soon to be, princess? Have you been in some tower away from the world to be so foolish? You are not the first woman with a little spine to come here. I have some ways to deal with you.

Or if you have grown to enjoy my company you can stay with me, the master trainer. To help entice you into making that choice I shall start wearing the master key to this place around my neck.

The other men looked like they wanted to finish off her apprentice but they only made moves to be on their way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may be able to get out of those ropes in time but not before we have put a great deal of distance between us,\u201d another of the said as they passed the unconscious form of Albert. \u201cBut I hope you find us because I would like a rematch with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha said a prayer to the gods to protect her squire while they were separated, because he had never fought on his own. This would be a harsh lesson for him that he would be the better for experiencing but there were real dangers of him not surviving. She had no ideas about how sever the injuries he had experience were, and she didn\u2019t dare ask the slavers because with the mood they were in they would likely injure him more if she asked about him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt naked without any weapon, she had always had some sort weapon with her since her childhood in the the halls of the Order of the Griffin. The paladin gave a slight laugh as she realized she was nearly naked already with her sweat from the combat soaking her clothing making much of it transparent. She was thankful the weather was warm here, but the night was likely to be unpleasant for her as she realized no one had any blankets, so she set her mind to escape from the cage. There was little to work with but she would find a way out of this threat to her freedom in time. Albert would come for in time if she failed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be at least two nights until they were outside of the kingdom at the rate they were traveling, she thought as she watched closely the ways they were traveling. These were certainly back roads that were in serious danger of monster or bandit attacks, but they were likely trying to avoid any guards of the kingdom, so their activities were not entirely sanctioned despite what they said about being legal debt collectors. If they saw someone on the road they might be able to get some help though Samantha wanted to make certain she didn\u2019t put any innocent people at risk because these slavers had already shone themselves to be dangerous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly as she could at the back of the cage Samantha tore a piece of her shirt off and wrote a message calling for help on it to be used if she saw a chance. The guards seemed to not notice what she was up to, or more likely they didn\u2019t care what she up to at the back of the cage as long as she wasn\u2019t near the lock. They knew there was little she could do to escape or threaten them, so why not leave her alone as long as she left them alone. The slavers had searched her for weapons and lock picks she remembered with a blush. Their hands had probed her body and crevices with a practiced touch from years of experience.</span></div></div>",

The slavers seemed amused by the suffering of their captives and she would make sure they paid the price for their crimes. As the days passed she was losing bits of clothing to drop messages but if her captors noticed they paid her no mind. They likely felt safer as they cross the border from the kingdom of Dar into the territorial lands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither the Empire or Dar claimed the lands though both would like to eventually, they were too far from the controlled parts of either land. It was a no man\u2019s land of danger and evil ruled by petty warlords feeding on the suffering. Dire Woods appeared to be their destination by the markers that he saw of animals and people staked along the road side. It was ruled by a self-proclaimed King called Eroc. His slave markets brought people from many nations around the world, the thought of being sent to somewhere she could never return from was more than a little frightening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmall homes for stood just outside of the fabled triple walls of Dire Woods. The first was a great spike-covered earthen wall with a moat in front of it. Archers paced the walls watching the small wagon of slaves enter the gates but made no attempt to stop them, the night was when the real dangers came out to hunt. Great wooden timbers taken from the nearby primordial forest formed the second wall, one of the slavers raised his hand in some sort of signal and the gates were opened for them allowing them to come to the final wall. Stone walls that were over fifty feet height and thick enough that even the strength of giants would break against them stood as the final protection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one knew who had built this grand metropolis though the dwarves laid claim to it as they did most fine works of stone. Eroc\u2019s ancestor had found it while trying to hide from some army that didn\u2019t take kindly to the banditry he had been committing. He had formed a small place for him and like-minded criminals but most of the stone buildings inside of the walls remained empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived at a market filled with men and women in chains lined stages as slave owners tried to sell them to crowds jostling for position. The wagon pulled to a halt and people quickly gathered to examine the new arrival with eager interest. Samantha and the other girls were left alone by the slavers who vanished into a shop.

There was a blood thirst to the crowd that told them they would only get violence for any pleas for help. Slowly they moved towards the stage as people were sold like it was a cattle auction as the paladin\u2019s eyes searched for an opportunity to escape. The keys were close and she wished that she had the skills of a thief to take them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA roar shook all of the people who were present drawing all eyes to the sky as a red object grew larger. Crowds of men shoved and rushed to get under cover as Samantha took her chance pulling the blade from a passing man and planted it in slaver with the keys. Her face felt like it might burn off as a great inferno of fire struck the street and melt many of the guards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to ignore the deadly creature but she tried to do her best as she focused on freeing herself and the other slaves. The desire to run was clear in their eyes but it was important to get the chains off first. It was hard to run very far with chains on your legs especially in a city of slavers. Arrows bounced harmlessly off the scales of the dragon but it wasn\u2019t willing to ignore the insult and it leveled a great fireball at them causing a group of men to vanish from the earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paladin kept a wary eye on the creature trying to assess what was happening. It was large but not one of the ancient ones. It had likely been driven from its home and was looking to take this place or at least vent some rage at the loss. There was a nasty barely healed wound on the side of the red dragon that suggested the possible attack of another large predator.</span></div></div>",

Samantha grabbed a bow from a lifeless corpse and started the work of assisting the dragon down. She took a deep breath and allow her mind to slow the events transpiring around her to come up with the best targets. The dragon was having no problems with the archers but the ballista and any spellcasters could prove to be trouble for it. Her eyes didn\u2019t spy anyone using magic so she focused on the large siege weapons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been training since she was a child with the bow and the skill was proving useful now. A crew was working to get their aim right because they knew a miss meant almost certain death and they never notice the barrage of arrows that brought death upon them until they started falling. Samantha took a few moments to unlock the chains with the keys from the death slaver and spared an extra moment to spit upon the corpse before rushing to the ballista. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe defenses of the city were formidable to even the might of a dragon and they were starting to activate. A group of fearsome hills giants started to pour into the streets heedless of the smaller people they trampled. The dim creatures were better equipped with a padded armor emblazoned with the symbol of the city, a set of chains with manacles. They carried spears with them that they started to fling at the flying reptile while others flung whatever was at hand at their enemy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long for a spear to pierce a wing of the dragon sending it into an awkward tumble out of the sky but not before a torrent of flames left one of the offenders and his companion dead. The creature scrambled for cover but another giant was preparing a lethal throw when it grunted in pain. A ballista bolt stuck out of his chest and he dropped dead to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giants stood dumbfounded for a few moments as they tried to process what had just happened while Samantha ran from the siege weapon to try and take control of another. It wouldn\u2019t be a good idea to get stuck try to move one of the bolts and even though hill giants were stupid they would figure out where the attack had come from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha had thought that the chaos would decrease as the guards of the city got deployed but things were only getting worse. Slaves were attempting to either make their escape or get revenge against those who had enslaved them. Slavers were rushing to flee the city bottlenecking things or they were attempting to recapture their goods. The general criminals of the cities saw the opportunity and were trying to steal anything they could while the guards fighting with all of the groups at once and quickly becoming overwhelmed. </span></div></div>",

They were the leaders of groups of people and at this point, there was much more to deal with than the dragon at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking careful aim with a crossbow Samantha saw a wizard trying to calm the crowds with magic and the efforts were ended with a bolt to the heart. Ducking for cover she quickly wound the string back and loaded another bolt. It wasn\u2019t hard to spot those with magic even in the chaos because they were guarded by other and often wore arcane symbols because they took such pride in their differences from most others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully peeking over the edge she saw another mage blasting crowds away from large doors that were the entrance for a holding pen for slaves. More people on the streets would help a lot so she took the shot. The man cried out in pain as his arm was struck and the freed rushed forward to finish the job Samantha had started but the paladin didn\u2019t have a chance to dwell on the success as she heard metal boots stomping up the stairs behind her. Guards were coming to take back the ballista.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing forward with an ax she swung with all she could muster and chopped most of the way through the siege weapon\u2019s rope and turned to run from this place. The distance to the neighboring roof was short enough that she hoped she could make it so she dropped all but her sword and made the leap landing in a painful jolting stop as she barely made it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop!\u201d A guard screamed but she didn\u2019t bother to turn to see if they were ranged weapons on her as she ran. An arrow snapped in front of her just before she hid behind cover. \"You, men, go after her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paladin turned to see what she was dealing with so she could take the best course of action and catch her breath. It didn't appear that the men had any attention to follow her in jumps across as three guards headed back to the stairs which meant she had some time but an archer was watching closely for a target. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Samantha knew the dragon would need back up against the forces of the city if it was going to do the damage she needed it to win the day. The fighting men of the arena were her best chance, they were also a serious danger. Even with the chaos of a dragon, people looting in the streets, and a few slaves making their escape attempts from the city they would not be unguarded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA water barrel allowed her a chance to stop and collect herself, the liquid was warm and stale but it was a blessing all the same. She sucked deeply from it uncertain when her next chance to refuel herself would be. The closer she went to the arena the more things called down, troops were still moving towards the main market and the dragon so she was certain it wasn\u2019t dead yet. From the bodies of the dead she had managed to collect some coins if she needed them for a disguise but she avoided shops for the moment, she didn\u2019t trust her tongue to the deceptive arts, she had little practice in them. The time for her to come up with a plan was fast approaching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe great gates of the arena stood a short distance away from her with past champions carved into the side of the great stone walls. Two men stood in front of the doors large enough to give a giant easy headroom. Heavy armor covered the features of the men and they made no movements as if they were made of the same stone behind them. Her cheap blade was unlikely to do the trick, these hardened warriors who were set to keep battle-tested warriors in chains, there might be the possibility to ambush one of them but certainly not both of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany ideas came to her, she could try to climb inside or break the lock on another door, she wasn\u2019t certain how many guards would be inside there. Perhaps she could get a sultry outfit to wear and pretend to be a prize to one of the fighters. Getting some of the other slaves to assist her but she was almost certain that many of the people she recruited would die in the battles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIdeas about how to get inside were easy for her but she was certain the execution of any of the plans would be a lot more difficult. Samantha took a moment to observe the area as best she could from the ground, there didn\u2019t appear to be any archers on the rooftops, most of the buildings appeared to be shops, none of them appeared to be weapons or armor related. A decision came to mind. </span></div></div>",

Eventually, long after the light had faded from the sky, one the slavers tossed them a water skin and a loaf of bread. All of them took an equal portion of the bread even though they were all hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much for the women?\u201d A figure in black armor stepped into the light of the fire causing the slavers to quickly grab their weapons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am afraid the ladies are spoken for,\u201d the leader watched the man carefully but kept his tone calm. \u201cYou might purchase one for the night if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha watched carefully as the man seemed to ponder the offer.

Samantha had never keep a close watch on the blood sports because she found the pitting of humans against each for entertainment disgusting, so she wasn\u2019t sure of the man\u2019s identity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no interest in haggling,\u201d angry started to enter the gladiator\u2019s voice. \u201cName your price.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps if we knew what you wanted the girls . . .\u201d one of the slavers spoke up trying to buy time as he slid a small crossbow to the ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am not looking to become friends, name your price or make your attempt to kill me.

I will turn over three of you to them and if they don\u2019t deal with me I will make sure they regret that decision at that time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha looked at the girls, the fear was obvious on their faces, but she might need to ask more of them. If she could be freed soon she might be able to get the assistance of Sir Simon who was likely to be nearby, chasing after the cult. This man was not listening to reason and she needed to get more help, so she rode up to the other slaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I can get some help for us but it would require me being free to leave here with the rest of you being taken to the cult,\u201d Samantha whispered to the others. \u201cThe only way I will do this is if you agreed to it. I could give a message to one of you to take to Sir Simon and remain here, so one of you can go free. If any of you have other ideas I am open to them as well. I don\u2019t think that we have much time to make a decision because we are closing in on where the cult is supposed to meet him, he is checking his map a lot. There may even be cultist watching us, so we need to make our move and quickly.\u201d  </span></div></div>",

He rolled backward and back onto his feet laughing the entire time. The man lifted his hand and called upon his magic, the world started to blur for Samantha but she fought the power\u2019s influence on her and charged the man smashing his nose breaking it.

It would be sacrilege to dishonor our word. You shall have your reward if you are successful and to prove it I shall place a sacred oath upon myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA doorway opened in the cliff face as the man started to chant a prayer binding him to his words on penalty of death and banishment from the realm of his God for all eternity. Samantha was surprised at the dedication of the man to such a foul being as these cultists worshiped. Depictions of grand hunts decorated the walls they passed some with the people surviving and being rewarded grand treasure but far more with the people being hunted down and slain like animals whose form had been thrust upon them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went as she was directed to the center the room on a large platform and removed her clothing so it wouldn\u2019t be destroyed when she was changed. The ceiling opened to reveal the light of the moon which illuminated her beautiful naked form. She started to feel a bit of a chill from the cool of the night air as the chanting of the cultist started but heat started to fill her body as the chanting grew more fervent causing sweat start forming on her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain lanced her body dropping her to the cold stone below her, struggling to her knees so that she might show she was stronger than the pain. Black fur started to coat her body as she got to her knees, she knew she didn\u2019t have long before the change would stop walking erect so she lifted herself to her feet. Samantha cried out in pain as two legs grew out of her body but it didn\u2019t end there, two tentacles grew from her back with sharp spikes on them but she didn\u2019t fall on back to the ground. Finally, biology won the fight against her will as bones shifted and stretched as she took on a more panther like shape. Powerful jaws replaced the soft features of her feminine face and there was no more a lovely woman but a powerful monster feared by many. Her roared echoed through the chamber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn the third rise of the moon, you will have claimed victory and will be welcomed to return here to become human once again. You shall be hunted until that time comes by us, the servants of Basha, I pray that you and we honor him with this great hunt. We will give you one hour to flee, hide or make peace with the death we bring. I hope you have the fight within you that I have seen in you. I shall pray that you are victorious over the hunters and prove the spirit of the wild is still strong inside of humans, that we have not forgotten what it is to kill to survive.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Going deeper into the woods would slow the horses of the men who followed her and confuse many of the men who sought to track her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had read about their hunting style before, they would work in small packs of men with many styles of hunting from horseback to using animals to track and kill the prey. Having seen the large number here she would have to be prepared for just about anything over the coming days. Most of the hunters weren\u2019t likely to chase her in the dark so she decided she would test some of her new abilities. Samantha located a small stream and eyed the fish in the water with hunger. The spiked tentacle smashed the water scattering the fish, a miss, but the strike of her second tentacle it. She swallowed the small creature glad to have the food. Moving through the water slowly to test how stealthy she could be and force anyone following her trail to look up and down a river for it to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing her strength she leaped into the air onto a thick branch ten feet in the air slamming into wood shaking the tree. A tentacle instinctively wrapped up around a higher branch and pulled her up solidly on the branch. She jumped from tree to tree getting better and more confident as she went but she still preferred to have her feet on the ground so she dropped to the ground moving quickly through the woods glad her eyes made the world daylight even in the low lights of the forest at night. She had a good sprint she found but she wasn\u2019t an endurance animal. It was as she suspected because the displacer beast was an ambush predator it didn\u2019t need a lot of endurance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paladin selected a large grove of trees near a river to act as a base of operations for time being and curled up high in a tree to rest until morning. She would decide if she should change plans at that point. The waiting was part of the torture of this terrible game, she would never know when they were coming for her or from what direction. </span></div></div>",

Perhaps, doing some hunting of them would change the minds of other about what they were doing. Samantha was getting used to traveling in the tree tops so moved a distance away from her temporary home before hopping to the ground. She moved slowly to keep her energy for when she needed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe forest was very different from being human with her enhanced senses of a displacer beast. The racing heart of a rabbit was in a hole under a nearby tree and several squirrels watched her with caution but they didn\u2019t need to be afraid because she was hunting larger prey. The sound of a breaking branch drew her attention causing her to smelled prey that walked on two feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn elf traveled ahead of her party so the others wouldn\u2019t disturb her tracking. The prey was learning quickly how to handle her new body and that thrilled her. Usually, the prey on these hunts were usually stupid and cowardly creature that was little more exciting than a deer hunt, but she knew Samantha was different when she saw the use of the river and the testing of movement. This was going to be a good hunt she thought as the spikes of the tentacle smashed into her skull ending any further thoughts. Samantha laid the body down gently to diminish the noise and quietly jumped into the tree hoping the other hunters wouldn\u2019t suspect she was watching from above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s dead,\u201d a halfling said to the others as he examined the body a few minutes later. The others cautiously moved forward looking for signs of their prey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunters didn\u2019t notice her high above them in the tree examining those hunting her to determine if they were vulnerable. A half-orc shaman was looking at the corpse trying to see if anything could be done as the male halfling circled the area to try and find the monster. The final target made her the most nervous, it was a dwarf in heavy armor watching his cleric companion\u2019s back, it would be hard to find a vulnerable spot on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is nothing I can do without us losing hours on a ritual,\u201d the shaman grumbled to the others. </span></div></div>",

There were spider webs below her that indicated the sublevels were not visited very often and she could see a couple tunnels so it wasn\u2019t just a giant pit around her. It gave her an idea of the creature for her to become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis temple in the mountain bore great carvings of hunts of the past and even a few of them held victory for those who were hunted giving her some hope of success. Samantha watched as the ceiling opened above her and the symbols lit up below her. Her body froze for a moment as she felt something beckon her to pick a new form and she did, she would play their sick game and make them pay the price for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body started to convulse as the change started to happen to her, Slime started to ooze from her body as it swelled dropping her to the ground. The clothing she was wearing popped off of her body as she grew over nine feet with her legs vanishing as they merged into her body. Her eyes swelled becoming far more sensitive to light. Small legs sprouted from her body far more than a human should have as paralytic tentacles sprouted from her face as part of the deadly arsenal of the carrion crawler she was becoming. An underground dwelling creature feared by adventurers as they traveled through the dangers of dungeons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha took some tentative steps with her new feet as the people stared at the strange creature stood before them. Many had likely never even heard of such a creature existing and had no idea of the dangers it would present to them, only the most foolhardy of people went below the earth seeking adventure, the drow, mind flayers and even fouler things lurked within the halls of the Underdark. She hoped to teach them a few lessons on the dangers of dungeons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held her breath as she went over the side of the pedestal, crawlers could move across even the most slippery of ceilings with ease but she had never been known to walk on walls when she was an armored paladin. To her delight, she found she could move with ease across the stone and dashed down into the darkness which was as clear as day to her new eyes. Her large body allowed her to easily reach across the span to the hallway and moved passed the webs into the unknown beyond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe high priest clapped his hands together with glee, \u201cI knew she was given to us by our god! What a blessing by Basta! A chance to properly explore his great halls! Let the hunt begin in one hour!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord quickly spread and dozens of hunters entered the temple eager to add another trophy to their walls.</span></div></div>",

Her hands were bound but it only hindered her riding a small amount as she charged the cultists at the entrance to the valley. They pulled out a net to fling at her but she had been watching for the attempt and jerked her horse out of the path of the attack and into a couple of the enemy knocking them to ground. Samantha hoped they broke some bones but she couldn\u2019t spare a glance if she hoped to be free of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent show!\u201d the high priest yelled. \u201cI wish you luck, don\u2019t worry I shall find you and reward you if you manage to escape our clutches!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha heard the sound of several crossbow bolts slamming into the trees near her as she weaved through the forest hoping to put some distance between her and those with projectile weapons. Her horse cried in pain as an arrow struck it but the horse managed to stay in motion. The sounds of the hunters faded as the horse and rider sped away from them but she was certain they would still be on her trail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paladin pulled to a stop near a small stream so she could take care of things. She let her horse rest as she cut herself free from her bindings with a sharp rock. The arrow in the horse didn\u2019t look good, it would certainly slow the animal even after she had tended to the injury. She called upon a prayer of healing and the wound looked much better but it still looked a little sore. The territory around here wasn\u2019t very familiar especially after all of the weaving through the forest she had done but Samantha would do her best to find someone to help the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would likely be too late to help the others but she had to try. Perhaps they would hunt her down until they found her instead of starting another hunt so any time she wasted would help but she didn\u2019t know enough about the working of the cult to be certain what their actions would be other than hunt her down. The paladin wondered what escaping the hunt meant, was there some sort of time limit or distance to it? If she knew she would do her best to achieve it but for the time being escape was her best bet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eyed the horse and wondered how good the trackers following her would be. If she sent the horse separate from her it would likely confuse the hunting party especially if she traveled down the creek to hide her tracks. These men were known to hunt animals but would they notice the loss of her weight? The loss of the horse would greatly hamper her speed which she might need if the cultists found her though right now she didn\u2019t even know where here was. Perhaps she should take some extra time to figure out where she was. </span></div></div>",

It was hard to track while on horses and it would take time to get hunting animals on her trail. She pulled to stop when the light was fading from the sky and more importantly when she found a road. The road would hide her trail as it faded with those of many others so she got off the animal and walked beside of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hoped there was a city near her so she could get some clothing and a warm meal but she expected to have sore feet before she stopped for the night. There was a good chance that some of the cultists found the road and came this way and as a buxom blond with impressive curves people were sure to remember her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked the path she checked the saddle bags to see what she had to work with and it wasn\u2019t much. If she sold most of the goods she wasn\u2019t likely to make more than a few silver and certainly no gold. There was at least some food and a few water bags so she wasn\u2019t going to lose out on fuel for a while but she would need money if she was going to get home. The thing that worried her most was the lack of weapons so she couldn\u2019t fight off enemies or even hunt for food. Unless she encountered a friend or particularly generous soul, she would need to work and with her new form, it wasn\u2019t likely she would be offered a job as a warrior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light had faded from the sky but the moon was nice and large this night giving her plenty of light to travel by when she came to the crossroads. She felt a lot better about how things would go after she had picked a path from the crossroad because it would split the cultists following her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonal was a fearsome mining town where she wouldn\u2019t be expected to because it was a dead end without anything for miles around. There would be a lot of money flowing through the town which would give her a good chance for earning the money she needed but there was a lot of bad men in such towns. People who were greedy for money and the pleasures that it could bring and they don\u2019t care what they have to do to take it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreen Fields was a farming community in the direction she wanted to head but there wasn\u2019t much work to be found there besides farm labor that didn\u2019t pay much. There was an off chance that she would be able to find a job at the Inn as a waitress but it likely didn\u2019t pay much thought there was the chance that she could meet someone from her estate that she could convince of who she really was and they would help her back to home where she could make further plans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpiral Corner was the last direction and it was in the opposite direction that she wanted to head. The cultists were not likely to think that she headed that way and it offered a powerful motive in the magic school on the grounds. She didn\u2019t have the money to pay them but sometimes the school was willing to take a test subject in for the experience of the students which may let her transform back into a man. There was plenty of work in the marks selling goods and it was possible you could even get a commission on what you sold if you worked for a certain merchant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha let herself have a few minutes to think about the path she was going to take but the sound of phantom hoof beats echoed in her head of the cultists giving chase. Few targets ever escape one of their hunts so she would need to make the decision quickly and hoped she was right because she wanted to go back for the other as soon as possible. </span></div></div>",

She wondered if they would even be able to recognize her after she got cleaned up. It was tempting to spend some of the little she got on the superior baths in the city but it was better to save it because it was likely the work she got would pay for her to get a bath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noise of loud obnoxious music could be heard long before she arrived at the gates at the bottom of the mountain. Guards could see his approach from over a hundred yards off as the forest had been cleared and the place was illuminated with magical fairy light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is your business?\u201d A half asleep guard said behind the safety of the gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am looking for work,\u201d Samantha answered. \u201cI would also like to sell my goods.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked her over before waving another guard to open the gate, \u201cI am sure you will find plenty of buyers for your goods.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ignored the under current of the comment and walked her horse inside the gate, glad to have the walls between the cultists and her even if she knew they only had to hide the symbols of their dark master to gain entry. Samantha saw not much had changed for the town in the time since she had last been here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours stood between her and dawn but there was still heavy activity in the town that never slept. There were people celebrating fortunes they had won at the casinos and heart broken people who had lost fortunes trying to drown their losses. Predators watched from the shadows to take from both groups. She didn\u2019t want to get rid of the horse but she needed to because she couldn\u2019t afford to keep it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would like to sell my horse,\u201d She stopped at Lucian\u2019s Stables, run by an elf who was always up for business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it stolen?\u201d Samantha knew that wasn\u2019t a deal breaker for the elf<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t but I would like it to not be here in a short period of time. I would be willing be willing to throw in the saddle and bridle for the promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI accept the deal. This is a fine animal, I will give you fifty gold for my promise of silence and seventy-five if I am allowed to take bribes for those looking for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was more money than she had hoped for and it might be enough to get her home, \u201cI will take fifty gold and wish you a good day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlways a pleasure doing business,\u201d Lucian took hold of the horse. \u201cIf you have future business please stop by.\u201d </span></div></div>",

Samantha went to the shops and looked for simple clothing to replace the torn and dirty clothing she had been wearing. Thankfully a few of the shops had simple clothing, most likely for the miners at very reasonable prices. She bought that would hide most of her curves and a hood to cover her hair and face. Most people would think she was on a pilgrimage in this outfit and it would hide her appearance from anyone who would be looking for her new form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing she felt she had to do was to take advantage of a bathhouse. She loved the heated baths that the furnaces of the smelters made possible. When she had been in the area previously she took advantage of the luxury baths but she didn\u2019t have the money for that right now, not if she wanted to take a carriage home, so she picked one of the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha dropped her clothing in the trash of New Day Spa, glad to be rid of them before sliding into the warm waters of her private bath. It wasn\u2019t a very big tube but at least it was clean and there was soap to wash away the grime and dirt of many days of travel. Her breasts felt wonderful as she caressed them, telling herself she was just getting clean. She slipped beneath the water as she orgasmed to keep the other patrons from hearing her cries of pleasure as her hand rubbed her vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrying her body with a rough towel was not nearly as pleasant as the bath, she smiled at the thought. Her nipples were still erect from the experience hoping for more attention but she had places to be. </span></div></div>",

She sighed as she prepared to put on the rough clothing she had purchased earlier when the curtain was pulled wide open to reveal a man holding a dagger on her. Samantha looked at the man to see if this was a cultist or something else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are coming with me and don\u2019t give me any trouble or you get the blade,\u201d the man quietly hissed at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Samantha stepped back from the blade as if she was afraid, but she was moving towards a dagger. \u201cIs it okay if I get dressed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man paused in thought as he looked around for witnesses and nodded as he realized that walking through town with a naked woman might be noticed. Samantha was certain the man hadn\u2019t seen her dagger at the back of the tub yet but he would notice soon after she grabbed it so she slowly bent down to put on the dress. The man was clearly nervous, she looked but she didn\u2019t see any signs of the cultists she was fleeing and the man\u2019s head jerked down the hall at the sound of someone yelling at the temperature of his water giving Samantha the chance to grab the dagger and rushed the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widen as he turned back to her but her blade had already entered his throat before he could react. A good evening was ruined by this intruder and if she wasn\u2019t careful he could ruin the rest of her life. The man didn\u2019t look familiar to her but she hadn\u2019t gotten a good look at most of the cultists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could try to contact the authorities about what happened but that might draw unwanted attention to herself, and she didn\u2019t know if she had time to check the body to see if there were markings or a note to identify the person or the group he belonged to. It would certainly look incriminating if she was caught with the body of a dead man. Her final thought was that she could run for it but there was a good chance there were others outside waiting for their companion. Someone was going to finish their bath soon and notice the body decorating the wall so a decision needed to be made. </span></div></div>",

Samantha stepped from the bathhouse to the chill of the night air and saw two men by a covered wagon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men pretended to not notice her but she could see their glances as they whispered to each other and it made her want to go back inside to grab the short sword to protect herself with. She kept herself on her path away from the men and listened closely for footsteps behind her and to her dismay, she heard the men had started down the road after her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha moved quickly as soon as she turned the corner and was out of sight of the men. They could be innocent but she doubted it. The town was filled with life but few of them were in this part of town at this time of the night, they would be seeking the pleasures of the flesh in the red light district. Spying a small alcove in a garden she ducked in and crouched in the shadows waiting for the men to pass. This felt like cowardice but it would be foolish to confront them when she didn\u2019t know if they were even enemies and she would need surprise if she was going to take them out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did she go?\u201d the mustached man asked. \u201cShe can\u2019t have gone far, she was only out of sight you a few moments.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you even know this is the girl Garn spoke about?\u201d his bearded companion complained. \u201cIf we don\u2019t find here I say we head to the Red Lady and enjoy the rest of the night.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t find her and take her in we aren\u2019t going to have any money for the Red Lady.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bearded man shrugged, \u201cI don\u2019t want to spend all night looking for a girl who may have the guards looking for us. Let\u2019s check on Garn and go to the Flea\u2019s Nest and pray we don\u2019t go blind from their liquor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would much rather have a lady to curl up in my lap lovingly and not those hags the Flea has working for him. I sometimes wonder if he held a contest to find the most hideous wretched beings in the land.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey won\u2019t look half so bad after you have had some rot gut in your belly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, but we have to hear what Garn says first before we go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other man nodded in agreement and the paladin watched as they left and breathed a sigh of relief. </span></div></div>",

Samantha tried to tell herself that she wasn\u2019t being foolish that the men wouldn\u2019t suspect she was following them but she knew to learn more that she would have to get close to them and they would know who she was in these clothes. If she was going to go to the Flea\u2019s Nest she knew the sort of outfit she would need. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hoped the man named Garn hadn\u2019t given the others too many details about her appearance because they were going to get a clear view of her figure tonight. Samantha moved into a clothing shop where the clerk looked surprised to see someone in such conservative clothing enter. Much of the clothing was transparent or seemed so tiny that she wondered how anyone managed to fit in the stuff much less go out in public wearing it. This was starting to seem like an even worse idea but she had to know if they were trafficking in people, she couldn\u2019t let innocent people suffer because she was a little embarrassed to wear an outfit from this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man working the shop\u2019s eyes nearly popped out of his head when he saw a gorgeous blonde emerge from the hood and he rushed over to got her measurements which she allowed to get this over as quickly as possible. His hands often strayed over her curves, gripping more tightly than she thought was proper and the fingers drifted over parts of her body that she was certain he wasn\u2019t measuring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you have done enough \u201cmeasuring,\u201d\u2019 Samantha drew her dagger for emphasis and he took the hint and grabbed a few outfits. She could tell that this wasn\u2019t the first blade to be drawn on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI apologize for my behavior with a discount to any of your purchases,\u201d the man felt slimier than any ooze she had seen in her adventures but she needed the discount so she accepted. With the discount, she was able to purchase a couple of outfits and went into the dressing room to put one on, making sure to check for peeping holes and plugging them before changing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue dress she wore was cut and followed her curves with close scrutiny. She left the shop to the pleased leer of the shop worker and headed towards the Flea\u2019s Nest. Samantha took the long way to the bar because she had to get used to the looks she was getting and the attentions of men as best she could before she got to the bar. Pressing her arms tight to help fight the chill in the air just served to enhance her already impressive bust. The crowds of people started to grow as she closed the distance to the Flea\u2019s Nest. </span></div></div>",

The kiss was crushing and verged on painful as the man pressed her lips against his with the aid of his other hand on the back of her head. The grip quickly loosened as Samantha connected her knee with the man\u2019s groin. Laughter filled the crowd at the pain the man was feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suggest you keep your body parts to yourself if you don\u2019t want to lose them,\u201d Samantha yelled at the crumpled figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was just a kiss you bitch!\u201d the man grabbed at her leg but she was ready for this and jumped aside before slamming a foot into his other hand and grinding it into the ground. His screams of pain drew no sympathy for the man only cheers of celebration as people started betting on the contest between the miner and the woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man stood over a foot taller than her and his body was layered with muscles from years of hard labor but the beautiful blond appeared to have experience with combat, Samantha moved with the experience of a seasoned warrior keeping her distance from the superior reach of her opponent waiting for for a chance to strike. Many of the people were trying to determine who this newcomer was so they could decide on the odds. People were suggesting she was a dancer or a whore and debating the advantages and disadvantages of each. Samantha tried to keep her focus on the man in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha didn\u2019t like all of the attention she was getting on this because it was going to make observing the men she was after harder but she had hurt this man\u2019s pride too much she could see. He was not someone who would let a loss go especially a humiliating one. The man was a brawler, he could take a beating but he was undisciplined and wild with rage. The paladin felt naked without armor, as a matter of fact, she felt just plain naked considering her outfit but at least there wasn\u2019t enough of the outfit to hinder her movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrawing her dagger she dropped her bag aside so it wouldn\u2019t be in the way, \u201cI am good with this blade, I suggest you back down.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doubted the threat would work but she needed every advantage she could get. The crowd had formed a ring around the pair and it was expanding in size as more pressed in to see the blood sport. Samantha had a small hope that the guards would intervene but she doubted they came to this section of town and for all, she knew they might be the people taking the bets. There would be no running from this fight as people were already jostling for any small space to witness the fight to come. </span></div></div>",

She was going to take apart this man piece by piece if that was what it took to win. The man was wary of the dagger keeping all of his focus on it which was a mistake as she held it wide and high and darted in low and kicked with all her force into the man\u2019s already sensitive genitals. She straddled his writhing body and pressed her dagger to his throat before he could recover. Cheers of victory and cries of defeat waved over the crowd but she ignored them as she leaned in close to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis can be over in one of two ways,\u201d Samantha growled into his ear. \u201cDeath or life, which do you choose?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHate still filled the eyes but defeat was there as well, \u201cLife.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was barely a groan but it was clear so the paladin stood and started walking with a confidence she hadn\u2019t felt in awhile. Samantha held her dagger firm as she started walking through the crowd because she didn\u2019t mind a pat on the back for congratulations, she strongly suspected there would be many slaps on her butt if she didn\u2019t present herself as still a threat.

It might be nice to have some company to give Bartok sometime to realize attacking her again might be a bad idea on the other hand. Many people were pressing in upon her trying to gain her attention with offers that were far less appealing to her than that offered by the elf and the dwarf. She imagined that some of them were just trying to get a rise out of her because they felt safe in the crowd but if they came too close they would discover how wrong they were. </span></div></div>",

Her outfit was not exactly fancy or appropriate for such a place and she was already blushing in embarrassment without trying to get in the place past the guards.

The tiny creatures glowed a vibrant array of colors and as one color would fade they would quickly light up in another color. Their dance was aided by a small band of musicians playing gentle music that felt relaxing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha felt ill at ease in this place but Vaeril gently pushed her forward by placing his hand on the small of her back and gave her a gentle smile. A server led them to a table in a private room in the back. The plates and utensils were the expensive elven craft with silver and gold inlaid into them. The menus had rare and exotic dishes and the wine list was the finest she had ever seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will treat you to anything that you desire,\u201d Vaeril offered. \u201cI will start with some wine from my personal stock if you would like to join me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt you earned close to half enough to cover the price of this meal or the wine,\u201d Samantha wondered what he was up to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is the victory I crave not the money earned that was so precious to me,\u201d Vaeril answered. \u201cA lady like yourself is also of interest to me because you are at odds with your appearance. You wear the clothing of a common streetwalker yet your beauty would not be out of place in the finest brothel in the land. Your body is soft curves and gentleness that tells me you have lived a life of ease but your skills and victory with ease over a man over twice your size and power tells me something else. I wish to find the answer to these mysteries, I thank you for offering this challenge to me so soon after my first encounter with me. A king\u2019s ransom would be a small price to pay to have such joys in my life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are a strange one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat might be but you are as well so we make a fine pair. I hope that I have frightened you from my side because you still have mysteries and wonders that I wish to explore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I am not frightened, I have met many strange and different people in my travels through these lands. You are different than many others but that is not always a bad thing but you are still very much a stranger to me so I think I will keep my secrets to myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do so love a challenge.\u201d</span></div></div>",

This was someone who could help her out a lot on her journey but she had to be careful. The rich often had high prices for the assistance that they offered to people that and those prices were frequently higher than money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaeril smiled as she took a sip of the wine and she could soon tell why. A wonderous warmth swept over her body in a magical journey drawing a smile on her face that was hard to fight against. She gave the wine a sniff and wildflowers danced through her senses as the lush sense of a newly born spring filled her mind. Samantha had heard of magical wines before but she had never had tasted one before, she was not surprised these exquisite sensations were sought after by the wealthy and powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive your wine a swirl and taste it again,\u201d the beautiful elf suggested gently to her. She hesitated for only a moment before complying with the request. The emerald green liquid swirled around a few times before she saw what he had been seeking occurred. A brilliant glowing gold emerged before her eyes replacing the previous color. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took another sip of the liquid and her entire body felt hot as if the summer sun was beating down on her. Samantha was certain she felt sweat trickling down her body as the sensations surged through her body. The paladin half wondered if she would be overwhelmed by the sensations but finally, she emerged from the feeling like stepping into the cool water on a hot summer day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Wine of Seasons is one of my favorites,\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cI do hope you enjoyed it. Perhaps the wine has loosened your tongue enough to give me some idea of where you are heading. You need not tell me the why or the exact location of who you wish to see but at least give me a taste of where this beautiful enigma would go next.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha swirled her wine transforming it into a rich burgundy and decided to talk to him, \u201cI am not sure what I seek at this point. I must get home or seek aid in the capital because I am in a lot of danger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDanger? I do hope that my own life might be at risk this very moment for dining with you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body shuddered with pleasure as autumn cool breeze tickled her flesh and ignited her desires. She could feel her nipples swelled out against the fabric she wore arousing her. Samantha was enjoying the wine so much she failed to notice how inebriated she was feeling or how loose her tongue was starting to get. Never in her life had she been one for deception or secrets so it felt natural to tell even this stranger at least some of the truth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA cult is after me, they have members everywhere so I can\u2019t be sure where is safe or who I can trust. This wine is superb. Superb, I like that word, superb.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is indeed a fine word young lady,\u201d Vaeril took another sip of his wine. \u201cA cult is after you, most interesting, is it a cult I might know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paladin nodded wildly causing her hair to fly about through the air, \u201cThe cult of the hunt. I thought I had lost them but I encountered one in town who I killed but the guy had at least two buddies in town at the Flea\u2019s Nest so I need to hide until the hunt is over or get help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaeril laughed, \u201cYou are truly facing a formidable enemy and I would not be much of a thrill seeker if I left you to face this terrible danger alone. This is still your task but I wish to travel with you and offer any assistance I can. I can escort you to your home, I can hide you out at my estate or, and this is my favorite idea, we can start hunting them.\u201d</span></div></div>",

This man had been very kind to her and she would feel safer with someone to watch on her in this state. Samantha gave her head a nodded but put her hands on her cheeks to steady her dizzy feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf smiled warmly and waved the staff to action and they rushed to obey. He took her arm to lead her outside and steady her. It felt good to have his warmth near her and to keep her upright. They stepped out into the moonlight as an ornate carriage arrived to take them away. The seats were soft and allowed her to sink in and relax she kicked off her shoes into Vaeril who laughed as she ran her toes through the rug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI apologize in advance if I vomit on your fine carriage,\u201d Samantha gave a lopsided teasing smile as she curled into the comfort of the transport looking about ready to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is always good to find work for the servants, I would hate to have to fire one for lack of need,\u201d He eyed the slow swelling and falling of his companion's chest as she fell into slumber. Vaeril pulled a blanket out and covered the strange young woman and pulled a book to read while she took in much-needed rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind needed to ponder things to decide on his next course of action with this woman. He was certainly amused by her but he wondered if she might be a trap set by one of his enemies. They had certainly sent a good one if they had. Vaeril had been sent away from his family for his interest in humans and this human was exactly why he was interested in them. Her beautiful curves called to him as did her behavior. She was gentle as well as strong and he looked forward to learning more about her so he could woo her into a more than friendly relationship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gates opened at the approach of his carriage and lead the way to his mansion. Vaeril missed the fine elven craftsmen\u2019s skill but he didn\u2019t the lack of comfort that came with the society. The beauty of the elves was often accompanied by a lack of softness. His servants rushed to meet their master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake the lady to a guest room,\u201d Vaeril told his head maid. \u201cDispose of these garments and see that she has some elegant clothing as well as some adventurer attire available to her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded and rushed to obey leaving the elf to wonder what attire the lady would be wearing when she showed up for breakfast in the morning.</span></div></div>",

It would give her time to think and decide how to attack the problem she was faced with. The hunters who were after her would hesitate to attack a lady who looked defenseless but the problem was how to put all of it on. There were layers and garments she had never dealt with before when she was a man. Cautiously she made her way to the door and peered into the hallway to find a maid waiting for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPardon me miss, could you assist me with getting dressed,\u201d Samantha requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course madam,\u201d the beautiful maid rushed to obey. Emily was well paid to obey her master and she had been placed at the disposal of this strange woman. She had worked at this job long enough to know her master cared about hard work, obedience, and to not question his orders, if you could follow those desires his wages were five times better than any other servants in the area and she was happy to do it so she kept her questions about the woman to herself. The less she knew, the less she would question about the orders to obey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha was amazing that her breasts could look any large but the tight fitting and low cut outfit managed it. It gave her a new respect for what the women in the ballroom went through. Finally, ready she went down to the breakfast. A long table was covered with plates of fine food arrange in beautiful displays to entice the palate. The eyes of Vaeril widen as the beautiful woman entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou amaze and surprise me again,\u201d the elf spoke after collecting himself. \u201cI thought for sure that you would wear the outfit of an adventurer. Please sit and enjoy some breakfast and tell me your plans for us to strike out against this cult.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made a plate for herself and sat down before speaking, \u201cI think we should go near the area outfitted as a noble on a trade mission or perhaps a vacation. I know it would be calling on a lot of your resources but it would be an excellent cover and a great chance for an ambush.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so exciting, I am happy to make my resources available to you.\u201d </span></div></div>",

If we were mercenaries they would be very watchful, we will have a couple of guards of course but the rest should be disguised as servants, most amusing.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe might present a tempting target to them if we only have a couple of guards and they will likely outnumber us,\u201d Samantha explained. \u201cIt will be hard to hide proper armor and weapons in servant outfits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou underestimate us elves, we have a long history of making fancy garb load with protection and weapons but I am afraid you have a challenge ahead of you. You must pretend to be my wife or lover.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe froze as she was about to take a sip of her tea, she could feel the heat rise in her cheeks, it certainly made logical sense. Why would a human woman travel with an elf noble who was on vacation others as some sort of lover? She wasn\u2019t certain she could pull it off but what other option did they have? Vaeril was being of little help as he was amused by her frustrations and she felt her cheeks heat up a great deal more with a far different emotion than embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t find this amusing at all,\u201d Samantha stood and slammed her hands down on the table but the intimidation failed as his eyes were focused on the bountiful shaking in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we should do some practice before we go in public,\u201d He came around the table and leaned in close to her so close she could feel his body warmth and take in his scent. \u201cBut only if you want to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice became almost a whisper but it echoed through her head. She would be helping the mission and this was the chance of a lifetime, it would only pretend, they could stop before they did anything too serious, something that couldn\u2019t be taken back. Their lips were so close, all she would have to do was twitch and they would touch. It was obvious he was waiting for her to make the choice.</span></div></div>",

She made the decision gently pressing her lips against his, it didn\u2019t feel bad so she deepened it enjoying the warm feeling coming over her as she pressed close to him. Her chest swelled as she pressed close to him, just as he was falling into the sensations and started to caress her curves, Samantha grabbed his balls, squeezing them painfully causing him to step back falling into a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was for playing with me,\u201d she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed, it was musical, light and beautiful, \u201cI shall endeavor to be more careful in the future my dear, though if you have more of such kisses it might well be worth the risk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed a burning red, \u201cWe should get ready for the trip.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you wish to travel together, I honestly do think having you act as my wife on this journey is the best option but I will let you take the lead on this one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I could act like your wife.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words surprised him and pleased him, the elf\u2019s mind wondered how best to get close to her on the journey ahead. He wanted to know more about her, both mentally and physically, it was clear he mustn\u2019t rush things with her. She was timid as if she was new to all of the feeling she was an experience but not averse to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen we shall have to get you a ring my dearest bride,\u201d Vaeril smiled. \u201cI shall have my attendants prepare anything you may desire for the journey if you would be so kind as to make a list for them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you are being very kind,\u201d she knew he had been very helpful and she wanted to express gratitude, words didn\u2019t seem like enough and a kiss seemed like too much at least at the moment. She wrapped her around him in a strong hug releasing quickly running off to make her list for him, hoping he hadn\u2019t noticed her blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to admit the hug had gone a long way to thank him and encouraged him his plans in conquest would not be in vain. Vaeril needed to plot out his next move, some sort of gift might be the next best move. A door slid open and he went through a series of passages into his treasury looking over the options he had on hand. She didn\u2019t appear to be interested in jewelry, she gave off the vibe of a warrior so perhaps some sort of a weapon or armor, he wanted to go another route if he thought it would work, something softer that would bring out her more feminine side. </span></div></div>",

Vaeril went over to the weapons, giving her something she could kill him with would show a level of trust, he thought with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaggers and knives were twirled in his fingers as he tried to see if any called to them, no they were not the right weapon for her. The elf was certain a sword was more her style, he carefully perused his selection of swords and picked a long sword as the weapon. His preference for himself was a rapier and short sword but instinct told him it was the weapon for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer size and strength wouldn\u2019t allow many blades of that size to be used but one of elven design could work. Crusader had been designed for an elf woman, Samantha had the curves no elf had but she was certainly close to the same height. The blade had a silvery blue glow to it, the only problem was the weapon could be a bit choosy about who it allowed to be the wielder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo my good friend are you willing to take up the cause of justice with a new master?\u201d He asked the blade uncertain if he would even get a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe shall see if they are worthy,\u201d The voice soft but there was steel to it that told him there would be no negotiation, if it didn\u2019t find them worthy they would not be <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny chance you could let me know the criteria you are looking for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI shall find out if the wielder is worthy when she takes hold of me, you are unworthy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for reminding me, I don\u2019t know how I could have forgotten after you have told me over a thousand times.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrusader ignored the sarcasm and went silent awaiting Samantha so it could determine if she was worthy of it. Vaeril smiled and carried the weapon out with him if it didn\u2019t approve of her he had many other gifts, it would give him the chance to wing it on the fly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha was waiting for him a full suit of chain mail, she was testing her movements so she didn\u2019t notice him move in and watch her. Vaeril saw she was awkward but adapting quickly as if something had changed or was different, did she lose weight recently or was it just because it was a different style of armor? It was tempting to use magic to get some answers but that would ruin the fun of investigating on his own, it was obvious she was an expert at fighting in armor, his people hadn\u2019t found a woman who fit her description so this might be a disguise or a curse? Could she have been a man!?! It would explain a lot though it would certainly be disappointing to him if she wanted to turn back before he could explore all of those magnificent peaks and valleys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI might have a gift for you,\u201d Vaeril interrupted her exercises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean might?\u201d she wiped some sweat off her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt all depends on you, my dear. This weapon can be a little finicky, to say the least, but if it likes you, you might never find a better ally against the forces of darkness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed her Crusader and awaited the results. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even when she got off of the wagon there would still be some traveling to do for her because her home was still a distance from the closest carriage stop. Which is good because she suspected there might be agents around her home waiting to ambush her but they would be in for a big surprise when she came out of her keep to meet them with her men at arms. It was a comforting thought after all of the trouble she had in recent days as she fell into slumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dream came to her of a wedding she could hear the orchestral music playing from the other side of a large ornate double door. She had often imagined to what it would like to have a wedding to Princess Fina but as she moved her arm to push the door open this would not be like the others. Long white gloves covered her ladylike arms and her cleavage removed all doubts that she was a woman in this dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the chapel rose at her entrance and she could see many familiar faces lining the benches. Heroes and knights, wizards and clerics stood in there finest to see married off. At the front of the church, she saw the Princess waiting for her in a lacy white gown. She wondered if Fina would actually wear something like that or if the Royals had something different for when a princess was wed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had started to research weddings of the nobles as she had grown closer to Princess Fina but she had never been to a wedding, at least not one between nobles. The few weddings she had managed to attend were rather wild affairs filled with adventurers who rarely cared about fine attire or formal affairs. It was a lot of fun but not something that she could imagine King Emeril allowing for his daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she drew closer to the front of the church she saw Princess fade away and reappear on the bride\u2019s side as the maid of honor with a lovely green dress holding the bridal bouquet. A groom started to take shape, a handsome man wearing a fine white suit covered in an array of awards and metals on a red sash over his chest. As the image of the man became more clear she realized that it was Lord Richard the brother of Lady Melody. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was seen as a brilliant leader who had taken down many an enemy of the kingdom over the years. Samantha had briefly seen his sister romantically but things had quickly fizzled out when she realized that Lady Melody collected men like trophies to line her home and was rarely dating less than four men. Samantha didn\u2019t want that kind of relationship because she desired to have a committed lifelong companion to share life with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe few occasions she had dealt with the Lord he had been pleasant and friendly but often very distracted. It was a trait she had often noticed with magic users as their minds often had to ponder a lot of things in order to not screw up. She wondered why she would be dreaming about marrying him. It wasn\u2019t like she knew him very well but here he was suddenly leaning in for a kiss to cement their marriage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to fight what was happening but she felt like a passenger in her own body as she leaned as well to press her soft lips against his. Her whole body tingle with pleasure as her mind fought the thought of being together with a man. </span></div></div>",

Richard dropped the clothing from his body on the bedroom floor in front of her. A fire warmed the room as he took a step towards his new bride taking a gentle hold of her hands pulling the gloves off of her hands allowing the silken gloves to gently slide off her body. The bride started to unhook the back of her dress allowing it to fall away from her body revealing her sexy lingerie underneath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands had long hours of practice with the delicate motions of magic crafting and he used those skills to call forth the pleasure from her body as if casting a spell. Her body wanted more, needed more from him so she pulled down his underwear revealing his erect penis ready to pound her body into submission. Her breasts bounce free of her bra as he tossed it aside before gently lowering her unto the bed. His mouth swallowed her engorged nipple, teasing and tickling it with her tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond woman sank into the bed as he started to slowly slide in and out of her body starting to quicken his pace into a wild frenzy. Her cries shook the glass as her husband claimed her as his own. She wondered if she would become pregnant this night, would his cum make a woman of her forever? Samantha wanted to feel the swelling of her belly as a new life formed within her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard sucked at her nipples drawing another cry of pleasure to fill the room. He felt so powerful and in control of her as he screwed her. It was right to have the man control her and she would make him so happy as his wife. Every night could be like this she could wake him in the more but wrapping her lips around the beautiful organ that marked him as a man. She would make such a sweet an obedient wife and in return, he would unload his sperm into her waiting womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are so beautiful,\u201d Lord Richard. \u201cI am going to come for you every night until you belong to me and no one else. You will forget about everything but being my wife and the mother of my children. I bet that when these swell with milk you can feed an army.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pinched her nipple pulling it out causing a whimpering as the jolts of electricity coursed through her body. A voice was trying to call out to her to remind her of the paladin she had once been, of the man she had once been. It was hard to connect back to who she had been, it seemed like so long ago that she had been the other. She could almost feel herself changing into someone new. No longer was she the harden warrior fighting for good and justice, she was a person who lived for pleasure and giving new life the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe woke to a jolting of the carriage coming to a halt. The city of Mason\u2019s Quarry surrounded them with the sound of early morning work starting. The light was just starting to take the first gentle steps towards coming over the horizon. Samantha blushed as she thought back on the dream she had, the garments she wore were still damp from it. It had felt so real that she had started to lose herself to it but back in reality she had work to do so she tried to put it out of her thoughts. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Samantha tried to contain her anger because she knew it would do no good to blame herself or her squire for what had happened to them. There was always risk in battle even when you had a heavy advantage in a fight the trick was going after every chance you got. An opportunity to escape was likely to appear if she watched for it, and it was very important because once they got to the wizard things would become much more difficult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paladin wasn\u2019t sure what plans the slavers had in store from them at the wizard\u2019s place but she was sure she didn\u2019t want to find out, because there were many tricks a magic user could use to enforce compliance. She shuddered at the thought of being under the control of the slave collars she had seen in her travels to other countries. Breaking the control would of them would be nearly impossible and even if one of her friends was able to free her from the collar it often took years of healing before the person was able to be truly free of the effects of the collar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert was up and moving though very battered and bruised from his confrontation with the slavers. He was trying to comfort the three women who resided in the cage with them. Samantha left him to the task of getting them into a better state of mind to try and escape while she searched the cage for vulnerabilities. She had always felt more comfortable fighting enemies than dealing with people. She wished she was better with other people but she wouldn\u2019t dwell on it when people were depending on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was good question about who the wizard was because that would likely tell what the fate for them was going to be. Samantha debated trying to figure out who it was later in order to bring them to justice. She looked at the fear on the faces of her companions and decided she could only depend on Albert because he was the only trained fighter in the cage. She moved to the back of the cage and waved Albert over to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill they be able to run when the time comes?\u201d Samantha asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think so but I don\u2019t think they will scatter like we would want them to,\u201d Albert explained. \u201cThey feel safer as a group. Did you discover any weaknesses or weapons we can use?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha shook her head.\u201d Our best weapons are the chains and they are awkward to use. I think our best bet is for you to slam the door open and I will jump on the big guy and distract him and with your help we will finish him off. The girls will run causing the second guy to case them and we will take him out when we are done with the big guy. I want to be clear to you that it is not likely we will be successful at an escape but it is something I think we have to try.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert nodded glumly. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Samantha watched as the wagon came to a stop near a stereotypical wizard\u2019s tower. Smoke streamed from a small cabin next to the tower. The thing that worried the paladin was the fact she didn\u2019t recognize the building, because it meant the wizard wasn\u2019t registered by the kingdom. Was this an intruder to Dar or something worse? Did the King have a secret wizard doing dark deeds for him? How long had the King been making slaves of his own citizens? If she got out of here and that was a big if she would make sure the King answered some tough questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath and relaxed her body as she waited for the guards to circle around the wagon. Samantha watched as the smaller man unlocked the door out of the corner of her eye and launched herself through the air as she heard the lock clicked open. He had positioned himself poorly as the gate slammed into his nose crushing it sending him swearing in pain to the ground. Samantha swore herself as she saw the girls were cowering in the corner instead of making an escape. Albert jumped at the larger man but he quickly side stepped the attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle was going poorly and the paladin knew it but she was never one to surrender when the odds were against her. She would have to hope her apprentice could hold out against the larger slaver until she could help. Samantha slammed her shackled wrists against the smaller man\u2019s head with a passion of hate for the man\u2019s work.  The movements of the man quickly ceased under the assault of the warrior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert fought hard against the large man making sure to take advantage of his superior speed. He knew he couldn\u2019t make the mistake of losing focus again. The slaver was stronger than him but he wasn\u2019t as well trained or fast and he could win with that fact. It was a battle of inches that he fought and if he made a mistake it would be all over for the squire in one powerful blow from the slaver\u2019s weapons and there were people counting on him for their freedom, so he made sure to make small safe attacks when he saw the opportunities. The smashing of the toes of the slaver was the most important first move as the leg chains slow the squire down so he needed to increase his speed advantage as much as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings finally turned the squire\u2019s way as the girls from the cage had gathered their courage and exited the cage to assist him. They started throwing stones at the large man and though he was tough his body was not as hard as stone. Bruises started to form over his body and small bleeding wounds were starting to leak his life away. His swings started to become very wild and inaccurate. He started to back away from the attacks on him to decide what to do next but Samantha struck him from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wrapped her chains around the slaver\u2019s neck and squeezed with all of her might. The giant beneath her knew he was in real trouble and needed to get the tiny pest off as soon as possible so he dropped backwards on top of the paladin. The chain around his neck loosened as the female winced in pain, but Albert picked up the slack and leapt with his knees pointed down to strike hard into the slaver\u2019s stomach knocking the air from the slaver\u2019s body. Not to be out done the girls knelt over the man\u2019s body and started smashing rocks into the figure of capture. The united effort soon ended the threat posed by the man permanently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey soon secured the keys and the sound of the locks clicking open were some of the greatest sounds heard by any of them. Freedom was freshly in hand and they were looking to keep it so they quickly started moving the wagon around to head back the way they came. They didn\u2019t know why the slaver had brought them to this magic user but they were sure it was nothing good.  Fighting unprepared slavers was one thing but a wizard at his home was foolish. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She waved the girls to hide in the bushes until they knew who was approaching. A wagon carrying goods came around the bend in the road, but the worrisome sight was the man seated next to the driver because he wore robes with the arcane markings of a magic user and was likely the owner of the home they just left. Samantha cursed for not having hidden herself because free beautiful women were rare in the slave trade which was more than a little male dominated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebating whether or not to place her hand on her sword she decided against it and leapt off the wagon and pretended she was examining something on the wagon while moving around the wagon so she could launch a surprise attack if she need to. The paladin fought back the rush of adrenaline she was feeling so she could keep a cool and calm head. She suspected the wizard would be suspicious because they were unfamiliar faces on the path coming from his house, but she didn\u2019t know if he would feel like attacking them right off. Their best bet was to wait for them to let him get past them and rush away from the place as soon as they got out of hearing range, but it wasn\u2019t a good position to be in because they didn\u2019t know how powerful the spell caster was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert waved at the wizard as he approached trying to appear friendly and not hostile to the wizard. He felt stupid waving because he had never been very good at deception and was certain the man saw right through him. The portly man gave a slight nod to acknowledge him but seemed to take no further notice. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wouldn\u2019t breathe calmly until he had past and they were on their way home. The beads of sweat were starting to soak her shirt causing it to cling to her body and she wished she had something that fit her proper. Maybe she could stop for a little bit in a nearby town to freshen up and get some clean properly fitting clothing.  It seemed like it was taking forever for the other wagon to pass and she was running out of thoughts to distract herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, those clothes fit poorly,\u201d the wizard spoke as his wagon drew to a stop. \u201cThey appear to belong to a man. Allow me to assist you into wearing something far more appropriate.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man waved his hands and spoke some arcane words causing some light to envelop the paladin. Her clothing left her naked for the world to see her raw beauty, but it didn\u2019t last for long as silken clothe wrapped around her breasts in a bright blue lifting the cleavage for the world to view. Translucent silk covered her legs allowing people to view the long smooth skinned legs while a small patch of cloth matching her top wrapped around her groin only barely covering the carnal region from view. Her hair was pulled into fancy ringlets of gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paladin searched to see if her weapons may have dropped on the ground but she found they had vanished with the rest of her clothing. Samantha started to launch herself at the wizard for placing her in a harem girl\u2019s outfit, but decided if this was the worst humiliation her group suffered and he went on his way she could tolerate it. The key thing to do was not to provoke him to any further acts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do to my master?\u201d Albert leapt off the front of the wagon and started heading towards the wizard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you didn\u2019t see,\u201d the wizard responded. \u201cLet me show you some of what happened to your master.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard raised his right hand which shot out a ray striking Albert causing all of his clothing to vanish. Long red tresses grew from his head flowing down past his shoulders and muscles shrank as womanly curves took shape. His rear swelled into a very pleasant cushion and his chest swelled in size to rival his master\u2019s very large breasts. A harem outfit similar to the one Samantha wore form as his penis vanished beneath the folds of a newly formed vagina lips. The green color matched her eyes beautifully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI assume the men who captured you are quite dead,\u201d the magic user laughed. \u201cI guess that means I won\u2019t be paid for turning you into a pleasure slave. I have already used a lot my magic today for the transformation of the young man here but I think I have enough for your companions in the bushes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha tried to stop the evil magic user but found herself frozen in place and was forced to watch as the three women they were trying to protect walked from their hiding spots as if they were zombies. The beautiful women walked in front of the wizard waiting for his judgment. A dark smile formed on the spell caster\u2019s face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat fate should I bestow on you young ladies,\u201d the man gloated over his conquests. \u201cI could make you join your companions as harem girls, or maybe I should transform you into animals to help your friends on the long journey ahead of them. Yes, I have some options.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was helpless to help those in need like when she was a child and failed to save her parents. Her eyes searched for anyway out of the situation something to use against the wizard if he lost control even for a moment. Her blue eyes spied a magic dagger Albert  carried in the dirt on the ground and prayed she would be able to make use of it soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMost important for you is the need for food,\u201d the mage fondled the breasts of the woman with the largest bosom. \u201cI think you will do nicely at helping the group with their needs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy fell free of the entrancement but all that came out was a bleat as she tried to stand up but was unable to as her body morphed. Her already sizable breasts expanded and joined to form an udder as brown and white hairs covered her body. The long brown locks on her head shrank back as her nose and mouth pushed forward. A large goat stood where a once beautiful woman had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear filled the eyes of the two remaining women as they wonder if this was to be their fate as well. The magic user moved slowly towards the next girl delighting in her fear of what was coming. The blonde girl tensed as the man came to a stop in front of her and with a wave of his hand she was naked. She dropped to the ground as the man released her from her magical bindings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, don\u2019t do this to me,\u201d tears well in the woman\u2019s eyes as she begged him to leave her alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid,\u201d the spell caster pretended to comfort the girl. \u201cYou will be big and strong to be able to carry the burden of others.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah froze as she felt herself growing in size but fear took hold of her as she saw brilliant white hairs starting to form on her arms. A loud neigh exited her lips as they took on the shape of a horse.  Long powerful legs replaced her delicate arms as she became a gorgeous white mare who would be the desire of many a horse breeder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLast but certainly not least your little group will need protection,\u201d the last girl in the line felt the air touch her now naked body as the wizard prepared to transform her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle, the last girl fought to have courage as she realized she would soon have the form of an animal. As she was released from her bindings she managed to spit in the mage\u2019s face but it only drew a laugh from the evil man. The woman\u2019s body shook as she tried to fight the changes she felt coming with her force of will but it wasn\u2019t enough. A large canine stood in place of a naked woman shortly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should be ready for your travels now ladies,\u201d violent laughter came from their tormentor but it didn\u2019t last long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe powerful uses of magic had finally allowed the paladin to break free of the magical bindings which and held her and she leaped for the blade on the ground. It took flight through the air with deadly accuracy striking home in the wizard\u2019s throat. He dropped to the ground in disbelief as darkness overtook him ending his career of evil. Samantha turned to the driver but found he had already been the victim of the deadly new teeth of Danielle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will do my best to find a cure for all of us but we have some decisions to make on where we go to do that,\u201d Samantha explained to the group. \u201cWe can search the wizard\u2019s body and home to see if we can find a cure, head to the capital where there are many users of magic, or seek the aid of my order of paladins.

For now they could only travel and hope things didn\u2019t get worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAshley, call me Ashley,\u201d the former Lord Albert spoke. \u201cI figure since you have taken a female name while in this form I should as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is a good decision,\u201d Samantha comforted her. \u201cThe less people who suspect we are enchanted the less people who will take advantage of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt that,\u201d Ashley gestured to our plentiful curves revealed to the world by what we are wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha nodded but didn\u2019t say anything because she didn\u2019t want to dwell on the negative. There was too much dangerous ahead of them and traps they could fall into and one of her greatest allies, the King, might be an enemy. Could he have been behind the original transformation of her into a woman? Did he really want to prevent him from marrying Princess Fina so bad? Why would he betray a loyal warrior and did that mean he wanted Princess Fina to be wed to someone else? Too many questions with too few answers and she had to stay focused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe traffic on the road was starting to grow as they came into view of the road when she realized she was starting to sweat. Droplets of sweat shone enticingly on her chest as she started to breathe heavily and she saw that Ashley was having the same reaction, and the day wasn\u2019t very hot, so there had to be another explanation for the behavior. Samantha turned towards one of the other riders on the road and found a handsome man staring at her and she wondered if he would make a good master. She quickly turned away from the man and realized she was looking for a master to control her and make her a harem slave. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The King had done many dark things to secure the future of these lands but the paladin had let many of them slide because he thought they were for the greater good but she was starting to suspect he had been wrong. She wasn\u2019t sure she could trust the word of the slavers but could they afford not trusting it? If she was wrong about trusting the King she could become a slave for the rest of her life, but if she was right to not trust the King he might be a hurt they went somewhere else for help and that was something Ashley could live with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate to do this but I think we need to use a wizard other then the court magicians,\u201d Lady Samantha responded. \u201cWe could try to use them but not mention how we came to be transformed but it would be risky. There is a wizard in the city who is an enemy to the King but I don\u2019t know if we can trust him because we have fought against each other before and he may hold a grudge.

Lying to one of the palace guards could bring serious consequences for her and she wouldn\u2019t find out much from the King about his recent activities. She needed to be able to give King Emeril a chance to betray her, and if that happened she would likely have to depend on her squire to get out of the trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuard Americk, I am Sir Garrett and I have come to ask for the help of the King in restoring me to true form,\u201d Lady Samantha spoke up in a clear tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard eyed the woman closely trying to determine if this was some sort of trick but it was very unlike the paladin Sir Garrett to make such a joke. He drew his blade and parted her cloak and found there was little for her to hide on her body to use as a weapon. She coughed to indicate he was lingering on her body a little longer than he should. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUntil we determine the truth of your story you will have to wear these magical restraining manacles,\u201d Americk was not going to take chances because it was his butt on the line if something went wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transformed paladin reached out her slender arms to be restrained. She had suspected this would occur she just hoped she would be taken to somewhere she could get help with her condition. It felt strange entering the place like prisoner that she had frequently entered without even being stopped. She wondered how long she would remain a prisoner in the place she had visited her Princess so often. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Fina was likely up studying her magic books in her room far away from where Lady Samantha was likely to be lead. Samantha wondered if she should try and contact the Princess but decided against it as she didn\u2019t want to trouble her. This might be a story they could laugh at one day but thinking she might have to overthrow the Father of the woman she loved wasn\u2019t a cheery thought, so she tried to distract herself by thinking of where she would be taken. The dungeon was the most likely place to be taken as the King was often busy. Her hope was she would be taken to the court wizard to have her story checked directly, but she might be taken to one of the people Sir Garrett was familiar with to try and confirm her story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered when she should confront the King with the information she had been given so she could detect if he was lying to her. There were a lot of bad things that could happen to her when she revealed she suspected him of working in the slave trade. Lady Samantha would be likely to lose her title and more importantly her freedom. She would get a first hand experience in how the slave trade worked as she was placed on the auction block and she didn\u2019t like the thrill of sexual pleasure the thought gave her.</span></div></div>",

Four of the royal guards escorted the King to the front of the cell and the King stood observing the prisoner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou claim to be Sir Garrett?\u201d King Emeril lifted one of his magical rings at the paladin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the compulsion to tell the truth, \u201cI am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow were you transformed into a woman?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magical ring was powerful means to get at the truth and Lady Samantha hated being under the influence of it but she didn\u2019t dare to try and fight it. She had heard rumors of other methods the King had at his disposal that could be far worse, especially when she suspected the King of being involved in selling people into slavery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemove your cloak,\u201d the King smiled as the former man dropped his cloak to the bed revealing her tremendous curves. \u201cHowever you were transformed it certainly did a number on you.

Lead her to my private chambers when you are done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuards quickly got to work on complying with the orders of the King who left with two of the guards. Lady Samantha was wondering why the King wanted to talk to her in his private chambers instead of the throne room, but perhaps it could be he wanted to hide the embarrassing situation for one of his heroes. She rubbed her wrists where the manacles had been as she followed the large guards out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Crimson Tigers were one of the most feared forces in the world and there were far more rumors about them than truth. She had been offered a chance to join their ranks but she was more loyal to the forces of good than to the King. King Emeril had to make a lot of hard choices that she understood but she couldn\u2019t justify some of them. What would she do if the King turned out to be evil? Could she kill him, the man who was Father to the woman he loved, who had helped build a kingdom out of the wilderness that had done a lot of good for the world. There were few kingdoms where any justice could be found and was he willing to throw that into chaos? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Celia was rolling on the ground laughing at Lady Samantha\u2019s situation and it was causing the recently transformed woman to turn red with anger. This had been a mistake and she didn\u2019t want this woman with her as a maid despite her being a friend. She had opened up to her and she was being mocked by the woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d Celia finally curbed her laughter. \u201cOf course I will help you, but you have to admit that having you transformed into a bountiful beauty is a little funny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it was funny enough to be laughing for ten straight minutes,\u201d Samantha retorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was five minutes at the most, but you have to remember that I have felt your hard naked chest. You new assets are many things but hard is not one of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha blushed as she remembered the night she and the ranger had cuddled naked together for warm. Celia had pressed her soft naked form against him and teased him mercilessly with offers of unbridled passion. He had managed to resist the ample temptations but he had certainly thought about giving into the pleasures of the flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wounded my womanly pride by not taking my many embarrassing offers that evening,\u201d Celia chided. \u201cIt is only fair that I get some payback against you now that you are vulnerable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was the first night we had met, I couldn\u2019t do such things with you, it wouldn\u2019t be proper because I didn\u2019t know you,\u201d Samantha explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, but you could have gotten to know me very well, and I would have taught you the proper ways of pleasuring a woman. As things stand now you might be able to teach me things about pleasuring a man.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelia easily dodged the swing she knew was coming towards her and laughed some more. Lady Samantha wasn\u2019t entirely sure this was a good idea but she knew Celia would do her best to protect her like she did all her friends. The ranger had been the daughter of a nobleman who thought his child didn\u2019t belong in the woods but she had proven him wrong by becoming one of the most respected rangers in the land. She knew about polite society and more than a little about fighting if it came to that in the end. The only thing that was worrying her was how excited she was about this, it seemed like she thought of this as a game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a game,\u201d Lady Samantha warned her companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course it is,\u201d she smiled. \u201cIt is the game of life and no one gets out of it alive, so we might as well have fun with things along the way because no one is sure when the end will come.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry not to have too much fun as we have to win over the diplomats of the Empire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you are bringing two heavy hitting negotiators with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose I can prevent you from making fun of me for my new form.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are my friend and I love you, of course, can\u2019t stop me. I am going to take no money from you this journey, just what little joy I can take from the beautifully buxom blonde who is my companion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would rather pay you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you would, I know you would, but I am not that kind of girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile crept across Samantha\u2019s face because she did find the ranger amusing. She couldn\u2019t wait to see her take some of the wind out of Sir Thomas\u2019s sail. This journey did scare her but she was glad to have another friend with her to face the dangers.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lady Samantha was looking forward to getting some much-needed rest as she boarded the ship and headed to her rooms. It had been exhausting recently and all she wanted to do was curl in bed and get some sleep. She stopped by Lady Ashley\u2019s room that was next to her room and entered the open door to say hello before going to her own room. Her eyes widen as she saw Ashley being screwed by Sir Thomas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Thomas was behind the crimson haired beauty pistoning in and out of her to the delighted moans and screams of Samantha\u2019s squire. The warrior's hands caressed the large breasts of Ashley as she held onto the bed for support. Sweat glistened on the bodies of the lovers as they writhed in the passionate embrace. A scream of orgasm filled the air as Ashley\u2019s body collapsed onto the bed from the recent efforts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fighter turned from his recent conquest and noticed the two lovely ladies standing in the doorway and a smile formed on his face. He gathered his pants and slowly put them allowing the women to have a long view of his very long penis. The man appeared to have no embarrassment over being discovered making love to Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWarmest greetings to you ladies,\u201d Sir Thomas stepped towards the pair of ladies still breathing heavy as sweat beaded down his muscular chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow could you take advantage of Ashley?\u201d Lady Samantha asked angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have never taken advantage of a woman. She was curious about the advantages of the female form and I was happy to show her. I would be willing to show the pair of you as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we milady?\u201d Celia teased. \u201cI would like to learn of these pleasures of the flesh he speaks of.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Ashley pushed herself off the bed, \u201cIt was my choice. I didn\u2019t want to be frighted by this form and I wanted to understand it better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat choice is yours,\u201d Lady Samantha responded. \u201cClose the door next time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned a bright red to match her hair as it dawned on her what her master had witnessed. Before Lady Ashley could say more Lady Samantha had exited the room with her maid. Sir Thomas walked over to the door and closed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ready for round two?\u201d Sir Thomas dropped his pants to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha wasn\u2019t happy with her angry words but she would make up with Ashley later. She had felt urges to join her squire in the pleasures of the body of the fighter and she had fought them down with her anger. She didn\u2019t want to admit how close she had been to giving up her virginity to the man. As a paladin, she had never taken part in lovemaking and she didn\u2019t want to give it up just because she had changed forms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really like him,\u201d Celia smiled. \u201cShould we invite him over for tea or other things later?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is going to be a long journey,\u201d Samantha said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Samantha went to her room and dropped on her bed and debated what to do about the heat she was feeling in her body. She needed to find some relief from these urges so she could think more clearly about things. Maybe it was time to explore this body more closely. She eyed Celia as she chuckled to herself and put away clothing and wondered about talking to her. She wasn\u2019t sure she would be serious though so he hesitated to talk to her. Looking down at her body she realized it would be hard to find a man to assist her exploring her body. She debated what to do next.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> The slave goods shopkeeper was a small oily-looking merchant but his speech was oddly precise with an upper-class accent. A nobleman fallen on hard times, perhaps or a disinherited son or a fitz-bastard, there was no way to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A strange request, Milady.\" These -\" his hand gestured to the chastity belts on display in his inner sanctum -- \"are usually worn by slave girls whose owners wish to, ahem, keep chaste for their own reasons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha winced internally as she looked at the evil metal contraptions but kept her face serene. If Ashley was correct Sir Thomas was barely trustworthy when faced with female pulchritude and she wanted, NEEDED some further reassurance in that regard and these devices seemed the best way. They were going to be unpleasant to wear but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed at one belt. \"Is that why they have manacles on the waist strap? I would need them removed before purchase.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, of course Milady. The owners of slave girls do like to keep their property well in hand, so to speak. But they do need to be fitted properly, you understand, especially if they are to be worn for an extended period of time, otherwise... chafing, bruising... damage to the delicate and sensitive tissues they are supposed to protect...\" He shrugged. \"You should try one on to be sure it will be suitable and if you buy it I will have my smith remove the manacles then. If you decided not to buy it I would have damaged goods to repair at my own cost if they were removed beforehand. I'm sure you understand, Milady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Samantha was in a small changing room where a collared slave maid helped her out of the voluminous dress she had spent so much time getting into earlier. The shopkeeper had politely measured her waist, notably keeping his hands to himself while her face turned red, then muttered some calculations - \"allowing for the bodice yes yes, subtract ummm...\" while studying the front of her dress and then handed her one of his display samples. It was heavier than she thought, a solid steel belt and underpiece hinged at the back coming together in a three-way lock at the front. It still had the slim manacles on each side, each connected by a single solid-looking link to the belt. She tried the small key the shopkeeper had given her in the lock, ensuring it worked freely then dismissed the collared slave girl as she stood before the room's mirror in her silken chemise which she tucked up out of the way. The girl had been a great help, more than she realised beforehand. Hiring a maid for the trip would perhaps be a wise decision after all. Ladies of breeding and high station did not normally travel without servants and, thinking cynically, if Sir Thomas had a maid to pester perhaps he wouldn't attempt to force his attentions on herself or Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe metal was cold on her delicate feminine skin, quite unlike any armour she had ever worn before she changed but she had always had a padded arming doublet and trews to provide extra cushioning under the plate and mail she had boasted in her previous existence. She could live with it, she decided as she studied the harsh lines of the obdurate metal guarding her groin. Besides it would probably warm up quite quickly. The belt pieces seemed to fit well so, not without some trepidation, she pushed the ends home in the front lock with a harsh snapping sound that sent a peculiar thrill though her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmmm, how does it fit? She tried stretching and bending, noticing how it dug into her navel but the important part running between her legs gave her no trouble. She rested her fingers lightly on the lower shield  even more aware of the odd anatomy that lay behind it. It had perforations where, she supposed, she could piss when needed although washing properly afterwards would be a chore. She could take it off to do that, assuming she could trust Sir Thomas but... she would decide later but she resigned herself to having to wear the damn thing for the entire trip. At least they would be in a carriage with springs, not riding a horse. The thought of being in a saddle for hours wearing such a device made her wince again. No. Definitely no. She made a mental note to ensure the carriage seats were well equipped with soft cushions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned in front of the mirror to see how it looked, the open manacles swinging across her hip and reminding her they would have to be removed. A naughty thought came to her mind -- she was planning to buy another belt for Ashley since they were of similar stature as they had discovered at the dressmakers being fitted for their formal and walking-out dresses so another like this one would be ideal. What if she, ahem, forgot to have the manacles removed on that one as a jest? She peered down at the one on her left-hand side. It was a slim smooth ring, hinged open with a keyhole. How did it work? Ashley's wrist would fit in like... that and then it would close like... SNAP. Oh. It didn't need the key to lock, it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tugged at the manacle around her left wrist but it didn't spring magically open. Well she didn't expect it would. She was in the back room of a slave goods emporium after all -- the sudden thought brought a chill to her spine. The shopkeeper wouldn't do anything, would he but it was likely he would know slave traders who might... her breath caught in her throat. Get the key, free herself and purchase two of the belts and get out of here NOW. The key, the key... she picked up the belt key and her heart sank as she realised it was much to big to fit the small lock in the tight-fitting manacle around her wrist. The manacles needed a different key... which... she... didn't... have...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The shopkeeper peered at Samantha's cuffed wrist while she grew redder and redder from embarrassment. Calling him into the dressing room had taken all of her courage, she who had faced foemen in battle with nary a qualm (or breasts at that time, of course). Displaying herself to the oily little man while dressed only in a translucent silk chemise and a chastity belt required a different sort of resolve to engaging in combat at arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... see,\" the man said. \"It just happened that the manacle snapped shut around your wrist? How puzzling, milady. I didn't think this model of restraint operated in that manner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it does. Look!\" Samantha held out the other open cuff. The shopkeeper closed the two halves together and let go. They fell open, clinking against the metal waist belt. He tried again with the same result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, perhaps... milady, could you hold your free hand out please?\" He smiled. \"In the interests of satisfying our mutual incomprehension.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did so, puzzled but not knowing what else to do. The shopkeeper fitted the open manacle around her slim feminine wrist and closed it. SNAP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? How...\" Both her wrists were now secured closely to the waist strap of her chastity belt. She jerked as hard as she could but the manacles did not spring open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies, milady.\" His smile seemed less sincere than it had been a few moments ago. \"It had slipped my mind that this particular belt's restraints were a special order from a certain customer who wished them to only lock closed when a female slave's wrists were within their ambit. As such they were imbued with certain magical cantrips and spells to that end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's very interesting but it doesn't solve my problem, does it? Get the key and release me this instant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shopkeeper scratched his balding head. \"If I remember correctly, milady, the locking spell is only supposed to function if the manacle is closed around a SLAVE's wrist. It should not activate if it is closed around a free woman's wrist.\" He looked Samantha's inadequately-dressed figure up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What puzzles me is that the manacles locked around your wrists so readily given their discriminating nature. It leads me to ponder the possibility that you are not necessarily who you presented yourself as when you entered my establishment, a lady of breeding and station within society.\" He tapped his lip with one finger as Samantha stood shocked at his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A slave can wear fine clothes and attempt to pass herself off as a free lady but such impersonation is a crime, not surprisingly.\" He shook his head. \"Such goings-on strike at the heart of our kingdom's way of life. If a slave is caught pretending to be a free woman there is certain punishment of a most hideous nature, especially if she masquerades as a noblewoman.\" He smiled again. \"The courts are, I understand, generous in rewarding anyone who brings such miscreants to their attention though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm not a slave!\" she screamed. \"I'm Lady Samantha, a confidant of the King and due to depart on an important diplomatic...\" She stopped short, not wanting to reveal such confidential information to the shopkeeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Lady Samantha, I'm sure you are. But the manacles say otherwise.\" He scratched his head. \"Are you married perchance? You seem to be of a suitable age and in the position in society you claim to occupy you would be a very desirable matrimonial prospect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I. Am. Not.\" she growled. \"Now release me this instant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pity, a pity. If you had a husband he could easily confirm your status with a word. Your paterfamilias, then? A brother or other close male relation who would identify you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Samantha bit her lip. Her father and her brothers would not recognise her in her new form. She wished to get through these trials and return to her proper male form before her family found out about her transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could my status be confirmed by my squ- by my female companion?\" If she could get a message to Ashley back at the Fallen Oak, she could come and confirm her identity but shopkeeper looked doubtful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sadly milady, if that's who you are, such matters are normally reserved for men to determine and adjudicate. A mere woman naturally cannot swear oaths or make testimonies in legal matters, questions of ownership of property and the like.\" Samantha's heart sank as the man's words struck home. As a man, a paladin of noble breeding his word was his bond, unquestionable. As a woman she was a man's possession, her whole being belonging to her father or brothers or (she shuddered) a future husband. A woman's lesser position in society was not something that had impinged on his consciousness before his dramatic change in shape and status but now it was a real problem for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInspiration struck. \"I was recently captured by slavers but escaped before I could be sold. Could that perhaps have confused the magic in these cuffs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so, milady. I don't know much about how the locking spells might differentiate between a free woman and a female who had been temporarily enslaved.\" He looked her up and down again. \"And, if I might be so bold, you do not have the bearing of a slave, never mind a brand that I can see.\" His comment made her blush again, a reminder of just how much skin she was exposing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why can't you simply release me then? I can reward you handsomely. You have a key, don't you?\" His expression changed. \"You DO have a key...\" she asked, dreading his response. He shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sadly no, milady.\" The promise of a financial reward had changed his suspicious attitude somewhat at least. \"The keys to these particular restraints are elsewhere. I did not expect to need them here in the shop. They are...\"</span></div></div>",

Letting people think that she was a woman looking for a job made more sense, many women came to the castle looking for work and the attractive ones often got sent to the King. It would be easier to convince just one person of who she was especially when she knew the person well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a paladin in the Kingdom of Dar, she had done several secret missions for the King she knew things that only she and the King knew. She took a deep breath before heading towards the guards at the gate. She walked up shrouded in her cloak and she could see the guards getting edgy at the approach of a hooded figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir eyes widened as she pulled back the cloak growing red with revealing her figure to the guards. She almost felt like a stripper at the Pleasure Palace, how Nicolas had convinced her to go she would never know. Samantha felt like she needed to bathe for a week after being in that building. She quickly shut her robe but the image was burned into the brains of the men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am looking for work, is there perhaps some work available as a maid or server,\u201d her voice was nervous and shaky so she went with it. \u201cI thought I could work at one of those places, but I just can\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t even gather my clothing. I really need someplace to stay and work, do you think you can help me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will do all we can for you,\u201d the first guard smiled at her warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am sure that the King would be more than happy to help you,\u201d The man\u2019s partner elbowed him into silencing further comment. \u201cWhat is your name lovely?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSamantha,\u201d she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will take you inside,\u201d the first guard escorted her into the castle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange to be taken through the back halls of the castle through the servant's area. She tried to recall if she had ever been through this path before but it had never occurred. They almost seemed like secret passages and in a way they were. These halls hid the inner workings of the castle from the nobles so they wouldn\u2019t have to see all the dirty work that went in to make their lives possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she was placed in front of the head butler Mr. Martin. His hair had not turned completely to silver but it was well on the way. His figure was fit and well defined. She had met him on a couple of occasions and he was just as calculating and professional as she remembered. His eyes didn\u2019t even linger on her curves that had drawn more than a few stares from people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe I can find work for you,\u201d Mr. Martin said as his eyes turned back to his paperwork. \u201cYou can work . . .\u201d</span></div></div>",

I will find work elsewhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard stepped in front of the door making it very clear she was not free to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think something connected to the lovely golden hair you have would work,\u201d the butler ignored her words. \u201cSnapdragon is a bit too vulgar I think, Black Eyed Susan might work if you step out of line too often, it would be a shame to mark such perfect skin, Daisy is too common for one so fine as you, Zinnia, yes, I think Zinnia will work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Samantha, release me at once, it is against the laws of the kingdom to imprison a free person who has committed no crime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuard, be so kind as to show the lady to the harem, it is best we get her ready as soon as possible, the King is very partial to blondes, and he will want one of her caliber as soon as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnhand me!\u201d the grip was too strong to break, she hated the change so much, she was tempted to go for his blade but decided it was better to wait for a better chance when it was more likely she would get out of the castle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was shoved into another guarded room, one that smelled sweet and had many large brightly colored pillows, many women in various scanty outfits that looked more like a lingerie party. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay hi to Zinnia everyone,\u201d the guard laughed before he slammed the heavy door shut behind him. </span></div></div>",

You know he was engaged to Princess Fina.

It would be a glorious campaign that would be the stuff of legends and who knows who would win but you can believe that most of the kingdom would be the losers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope this treaty he is seeking is worth it because if Sir Garrett comes back early there will be a lot of trouble.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about that. There is a rumor some assassins from the Empire have been sent to kill if not slay the paladin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paladin couldn\u2019t believe that they were talking about such things in public but they most likely didn\u2019t realize that someone was listening to them and they certainly didn\u2019t think that Sir Garrett would be back so soon. Anger and hurt at the betrayal filled her to the point she thought she might explode. She had served the King loyally for years and was furious at her treatment after all of that service, she needed to decide what to do next. </span></div></div>",

Samantha knew her fiancee and she was certain to try and put up a fight over this so the king would force her to a location he could control. The castle didn\u2019t seem like a good location because she had too many allies in the royal guards and the nobles who would visit the castle. Many of the nobles would not be happy with a royal marriage to the Empire, not only because it lessened there chances for more power it also gave the King a powerful ally to use against them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had been a rumor King Emeril wanted to purge some of his political enemies but he was afraid to do it because the nobles held a lot of power. If he had the backing of a Prince from the Empire he could do as he pleased, so where was he hiding the princess?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA compound for the Crimson Tigers could be holding her and they had one that wasn\u2019t very far from the capital. Princess Fina would be safe there and could be retrieved very easily but some of the trainees and people might question why a royal princess would be held against her will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Emeril had a secret pleasure manor he kept while the Queen had been alive for his mistresses. It could be stocked with just those who were loyal to him. It seemed like the most likely location for his beloved Princess to be. It was at least a full day\u2019s travel from the capital. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered if the King would dare to lock away Fina in the dungeons of the castle.

A throwing dagger sliced the instrument of pain to just a handle leaving a shocked look on the face of the group. Samantha held another dagger at the ready to further indicate her threat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said I was tired but I am willing to fight if the need arises,\u201d She spoke in an ice-cold tone. \u201cYou might be able to get me inside that cage but I assure you will be losing at least three of your number, do you want to roll those dice?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were no longer as confident as they had once been as they looked at each other trying to figure out if they were the ones who would survive with all the profit. One of them started to reach for a crossbow but she waved her dagger no and the man stopped his attempt for the weapon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThree hundred,\u201d the big man growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was most likely willing to take less but an attractive woman threatening him had probably wounded his pride. It was a large sum but one she was willing to part with to get this encounter over with because she cared more about the freedom for the slaves and the slaying of humans. As repugnant as she found the men she preferred fighting monsters who had little hope of redemption from their evil ways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I accept,\u201d Samantha handed a bag of gems to Albert. \u201cCount out three hundred worth of gold for these men and toss it to them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still worried about their plans but they were quick to unlock the slaves once they had verified the value of the gems. Samantha watched them fade from view before she made any move to leave. She had no desire to have them know which path they take from this spot. Now that she had secured the freedom of the women she needed to decide what to do with them. </span></div></div>",

The golden strands of hair rippled like waves in air offset nicely by the blue sky. Her squire watched the curvy form of his master, the breasts bounced on her chest of the two new mounds. He wanted to tell her how beautiful she was but he knew she wouldn\u2019t appreciate the compliment because she wanted to return to being a man which seemed a bit of a shame to the squire who thought she was the most beautiful woman he had seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn ogre came crashing out of the forest, gnawing on a leg of a human. The creature turned to face them as they pulled up their horses to avoid running into it. It smashed a fist into Albert\u2019s horse crushing the skull of the animal even as they went for their weapons. Sir Garrett drew a lance with all of her diminished strength and thrust it at the vulnerable throat of it. Roaring in pain from the blow the ogre slapped the lance and Thunder away sending the paladin tumbling to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood poured from the wound in the neck but the slobbering nine-foot creature seemed more interested in slaying the ones who had harmed it than taking care of the wound. It stomped towards the disoriented woman who was backing away from it. She rolled away from the lunging grab of the giant humanoid. Albert raced up behind the creature slashed the back of the leg severing critical muscles. No longer able to support the colossal weight of the ogre, the leg buckled dropping the monster on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started to crawl towards Sir Garrett who lifted her short sword to an attack position at the approach of the monster. The blade was not as familiar to her as her long sword but it was much easier to work and use because of her much smaller form. A powerful arm of the ogre smashed into the ground near her, she darted in and made a quick slash across the brow before moving back out of reach. Fresh blood started to flow into the eyes of the ogre blinding it. Albert leaped upon the back of the monster and drove his sword deep into the chest of it cleaving the heart of the ogre ending its life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett wiped the sweat from her brow and looked around to assess the situation they were in now. Albert\u2019s horse was dead and her horse looked like it was injured to the point she didn\u2019t trust her weight on it much less both of them. Her plans to catch up had certainly taken a hit but she was glad her and Albert were okay. There was a small village about ten miles up the road but she thought she had seen a farm not too far off that might have some horses they could use. </span></div></div>",

I understand you are keeping us to a budget but I am willing to pay and my family is in heavy debt if it means forgoing that foul stuff for even one night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, but I will pay.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou might want to dress differently and come up with a female name if you don\u2019t want to draw unwanted questions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t do much about the clothing, I didn\u2019t come exactly equipped with a female wardrobe.

Being on an equal footing with his master would feel strange but he knew his time as a squire was coming to an end and he needed to get used to seeing Callie as an equal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully it looked like the ogre had bypassed the farm which surprised the paladin. The fields were filled with sheep and cattle yet the ogre hadn\u2019t taken part of the bounty. Instinctively her hand went to her blade, the danger was almost certain to lurk here, she just hoped the person leaned towards good instead of evil. Albert had the same feeling and was looking for people around but there was no one outside though they could see smoke rising from the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me go inside first,\u201d her squire pulled his sword out and headed towards the door but Callie grabbed hold of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should find out if there is trouble before we make trouble,\u201d she told him and knocked on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavy footsteps approached the door and it opened to reveal a handsome muscular man who looked like he was covered in food. The man smiled at them and waved them inside where something was cooking on the stove but it smelled awfully foul and Callie did not expect it to be because the man was working on something alchemy related. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome, I am always happy to have guests though, I can\u2019t attest to how healthy it will be for you to eat it,\u201d the man went back to the pot and took a sip and winced from the taste. \u201cI am Rufus and who might you be travelers?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAdventurers, this is Albert and I am Callie,\u201d the paladin responded. \u201cWe dealt with an ogre on the road a distant back and my friend lost his horse and mine was injured and we hoped we could get fresh ones for some coins here. There was the added bonus of a farm fresh meal but if you don\u2019t mind, I would like to cook it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay the gods bless your mercy on me,\u201d without hesitation the man took the pot outside and dumped the contents for some pigs. \u201cMy kitchen and all of the contents of it are yours milady and I refuse any payment for it as you are doing all the work. Many things in my life I have mastered but cooking has never been one of them no matter how often I try. I suppose it takes a lady\u2019s touch.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallie blushed a little but gave him a warm smile and removed her chainmail to start the work. She had worked many long hours in the kitchen of the orphanage preparing meal and had always loved the work. The people there were grateful for the food that was provided to them. On the road, she didn\u2019t see much use for cooking a grand meal because it took time away from the quest when all you really needed was the energy the food provided but when she got home she loved using the grand kitchen she had designed to make fantastic meals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want I have some lady\u2019s clothing that you can wear,\u201d Rufus offered. \u201cI imagine your clothing was damaged in the ogre attack.</span></div></div>",

You can clean up if you want as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed when she saw his collection. It was obvious he served a large number of ladies of the evening. Thankfully a few of the pieces were far more modest though they weren\u2019t ideal for someone who had once been a man and looked forward to returning to that state of being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt strange to be naked as if she was peeping on a woman. A woman who was desperately in the need of a bath before she wore clean clothes. Callie stepped into a small bath and was surprised it had been enchanted. The warm waters washed over her body revealing lily-white skin. A little smile formed on her lips as she dabbed herself with some perfume before sliding on the summer dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallie had been too embarrassed to put on a bra and panties but as she strode by the mirror she saw the effect it had on her body in a mirror. Rosy red cheeks formed as she saw her nipple becoming aroused at the gentle tickle of the silky fabric. It caused her to debate if she needed to put on more. The feminine dress had already felt like too much for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach step in it reminded her of her new form. The bright canary color fits well with her long flowing locks. The hem floated up to dangerous heights revealing dangerous amounts of leg and whispering at paradise just out of reach. It fluttered showing a lot of her impressive bosom trembling with the vibrations. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She stripped the light dress off easily. It would be best to start with what was easiest to accept the panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were just like the undergarments she had worn when she was a man she told herself. But that was just the point. Panties were different. The material was far less course in her hands. As she slid the garment up her smooth legs the silky fabric gently licked at her skin. Callie didn\u2019t like how pleasant it felt pressed against her skin. It was a constant reminder of what she had lost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA paladin is not their body,\u201d She recited a lesson from her old master. \u201cThey are their soul. No spell, curse, or foul creature can alter the soul unless the paladin loses faith.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words brought comfort as she lifted the bra blushing as it dawned on her again the gigantic size needed to wield her assets. Callie slipped the straps over her slender shoulders. Then it dawned on her she had never seen a woman put on one of these things before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bosom pushed for freedom on all sides as she drew the bra tight. Callie\u2019s delicate fingers fumbled with the hooks and she wished she had another set of hands. A giggle escaped her lips as she thought of all of the men who would want to help her in this situation. At least she was starting to develop a sense of humor about things. Now if she could just get the stupid hooks to work everything would be perfect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cried out at the final success. Albert burst into the room and stared at the nearly naked form of her mistress. His eyes took in the not properly fitted bra. It was clearly at least a size too small and more than a bit of naked flesh swelled out with more than a nipple showing. A part of him knew he should look away but he couldn\u2019t manage it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnless you are going to paint my portrait,\u201d she attempted a growl which was more of a purr. The scowl on her face told Albert he had made a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d he flushed. \u201cI thought you were in trouble and uh . . .\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClose your mouth and get out. I will be out to eat soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallie went over to the mirror and started to cram her breasts into place. After a couple of minutes, she was happy with the results or at least satisfied. Her chest looked like it was about ready to explode free. She bit her lip as she debated getting a larger size but she wasn\u2019t certain she wanted to take the fight against another bra at this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding on the dress she smoothed it into place and exited the room. </span></div></div>",

'That puts you at diminished combat capacity which puts us at great risk.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good logic, and a sound decision,' Sir Garrett said. 'Perhaps a little cautious but that is not always a bad thing.

His strict studies and hard work as a squire prevented much interaction with those of the fairer sex. The large curves were enticing and pleasing to his eyes and though his thoughts were warming his face and he found he couldn't prevent them even as he tried to focus on his work. He wished he had time to perform some of his meditation exercises but they were in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett for her part she had noticed the looks and embarrassment on her young squire's face, but she couldn't blame him. The new form of the paladin was distracting for her as well, certainly more than for the young squire. Breasts jostled around as she moved causing twinges of pleasure as they caressed her nipples. She wanted to scream in frustration, but Sir Garrett stifled the urge to prevent scaring Albert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing through her equipment she selected a short sword and a few small blades to carry while the rest were packed away as likely too heavy for her to properly use in combat. She took a few practice swings so she could adjust to the new weights attached to her chest. The practice swings helped make her almost passable for a novice, but her former strength was proven to be greatly diminished and much of her sword skills seemed to have been robbed from her mind. Sir Garrett decided it was best to mention it to Albert in case it was only a temporary affliction brought on by stress and possibly her new shape being foreign to what she was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPacking the camp didn't take long for the experience travelers and they were soon riding on the road to Summer Dale. The ride through the forest was pleasant with a gentle breeze keeping the insects away from the riders. They spotted the smoke from the home before they topped the crest of the hill and they smelled drew welcome to their hearts and more directly their stomachs from the long days travel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I know we are both hungry and tired but perhaps we should obtain some proper clothing for you before we go to the Inn,' Albert suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I do not intend to remain in this form long enough to need them,' Sir Garrett snapped, but the blushing from her squire made her look down to see the sweat from the ride had soaked the clothing she was wearing making them transparent. 'Perhaps there is some wisdom in what you say.'<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Admitting she should go shopping for woman\u2019s clothing felt a little like giving up his manhood, but that was an immature and foolish thought. She was at enough of a disadvantage with her loss of muscle mass and unfamiliar body and armor might help compensate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are right Albert,\u201d Sir Garrett sighed. \u201cThis attire will not due for a paladin and it would wise to start calling me Lady Gwen for the time being. Small towns can easily be frightened by dark magic and overreact where there is frequently no danger to them. Let us not test their understanding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand Lady Gwen,\u201d Albert responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rusted Shield was a well-stocked armor shop Lady Gwen had frequented in her early days of adventuring. Clanging medal could be heard over the ring of the shop bell as they entered the building. The section for female adventurers was smaller than she would have liked, but there were some fine leather armor and even some imported elven chain mail. The problem was Lady Gwen didn\u2019t carry a great deal of money with her when she started on adventures because if you were properly equipped it just served as extra weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she bought the proper armor she wanted it would leave her awfully low on funds, but she could make some extra money by selling off some of the gear that she couldn\u2019t make much use of with her decreased strength. The extra money might be nice considering he wasn\u2019t sure how much the cure would cost her, but if she managed to get turned back into a man soon she would once again be left with a lot of gear she couldn\u2019t properly use. It was time to make a decision.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She felt like she was parting with friends who had served and saved her on many occasions and they were about to sacrifice themselves one last time for her. Perhaps, she could return them to the fold after she was cured and had access to her gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shopkeeper was an older man with a thick gray beard and eye for someone in desperate need for proper equipment. Lady Gwen was tempted to beat the shopkeeper for taking advantage of someone in need, but at least he didn't ask too many questions about where she had gotten the equipment. It didn't take long to get equipped though the armor didn't fit as well as she would have liked especially in the chest area but it would take several days at least to get it adjusted to her body shape and it was time she preferred to spend looking for a cure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night lamps were being lit as she exited the armor and weapon shop fully equipped and ready for battle, equipment wise at least. Her stomach reminded her it had been a long time since her last meal and she would need to secure lodgings for the evening. The Maple Inn seemed to be the only inn around the town, so Lady Gwen headed towards it with determination the curse laid upon her would be ended sooner rather than later. </span></div></div>",

She was more confident in her ability to defend herself if trouble came along with a lighter set of armor and weapon, but the equipment still felt a bit foreign to her as she hadn\u2019t used a short sword and a small shield since her early days as a squire. Luckily, the movements still seemed to be in her muscle memories as a few practice swings felt smooth and natural. A slight smile crossed her face as she thought about how many hours she had spend practicing the movements with Baron Armstrong, and realized it was only natural she should remember how to use the equipment all these years later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she left the sun fading below the hills she spied Squire Albert waiting patiently with the horses. Was she like Squire Albert at that age? He was tall and thin with the potential to become filled out with muscle and power as he aged into full manhood. His gaze avoided looking directly as he dwelled on his inexperience, and doubts but he had the potential to overcome these and become a great beckon of hope like a paladin should be. He was becoming a handsome man as well, and would likely have beautiful children . . . if he had the right wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flush came to Lady Gwen\u2019s cheeks as she wondered where the romantic thought had come from? Had she just been think about the future of her apprentice or was she thinking about her own possible future? She wanted to deny any interest in men because she had been a man until recently and she had a princess fiancee to think of well, but she was under an unknown spell that may have effects that hadn\u2019t fully unfolded yet. Lady Gwen hated the feeling of doubt about who she was that was beginning to fill her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs something wrong?,\u201d Lord Albert asked peer into Lady Gwen\u2019s blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo . . . Nothing but the journey ahead of us,\u201d it wasn\u2019t a complete lie but it was less truth than the paladin liked to use. Was it better to voice his worries knowing he could be wrong and placing needless worry on his squire or not voice them and possibly succumb to the effects of the nefarious spell she was under.

The Rusty Axe looked as if it had seen better years about three generations ago. The sign was tilted from one of the chains holding it in place having broken leaving it swaying in the wind. The paint was chipped and faded from years of wear and tear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs hard as it was to imagine the smell was much worse on the inside of the inn. The people stopped their drinking to observe the intruders to the inn. Lady Gwen would have liked to say they were farmers in from a day of work but it was very obvious they were bandits. They wore patchy leather armor and carried many weapons of various shapes and sizes. Nasty looking grins filled their dirty and scarred faces as they took in all of the curves of Lady Gwen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome,\u201d The bartender spoke in a growl. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what the slut can do for me,\u201d one of the bandits said drawing laughter from the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, you . . . !\u201d Squire Albert started towards the large man, but Lady Gwen put up her hand to prevent his further action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to start a fight we can avoid,\u201d Lady Gwen whispered into<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert\u2019s ear. \u201cIf words become actions we do something but as yet we don\u2019t know these men are criminals even if they look, and smell like them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Gwen turned to the bartender a half orc with one broken tusk, \u201cWe want meals, rooms for the night and possibly some information.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark green skinned being shrugged at her request, \u201cI can provide the first to with ease but the third depends on what you want to know and all of them cost money.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquire Albert slid some coins towards the large being who quickly snatched them up into his large clawed hands eyeing them closely. He waved a small weasel like man into action at getting them food, \u201cYou can have the large room at the top of the stairs, the first door on the left. Now, what does the young couple desire to know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe want to know if there are any magic users in the area especially those who specialize in healing or curse breaking,\u201d Squire kept his voice low to prevent the other bar patrons from hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bartender seemed to take no mind of the young man\u2019s desire for quiet and loudly replied, \u201cI don\u2019t care much for magical healing myself but I think Mad Marvin or Theresa the Blight are about the only magic users in the area with any real power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMad Marvin, Theresa the Blight?\u201d Squire Albert looked inquisitively at the bartender who responded by tapping the bar for more money and with a sigh Albert placed more money on the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA toothy grin formed the half-orc\u2019s face, \u201cMarin has a habit of combining humans and animals together, and the magic of Theresa always seemed to go wrong. If you have desires for more information I would be happy to help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Albert said half heartedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Gwen and Squire Albert sat down to eat their meals of hearty stew and a roll of bread. They tried to ignore the leering looks of the other customers of the inn, but found it difficult with more than the occasion lewd comment. It didn\u2019t take long for them to decide to head to the room after they finished the meal they found to be surprisingly good to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want some company?\u201d one of the crowd called out a parting shot as they headed up the stairs. </span></div></div>",

It might slow or caused to stumble any intruders that might try to enter the room that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving her chain mail shirt and undershirt felt great to Lady Gwen enjoying the weight being off her body.

Let us forget what has just transpired and go to bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish mistress,\u201d came the reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious that neither of them could forget it as the silence seemed a third guest in an already tightly packed room as the finished up their preparations for bed. Squire Albert pressed tightly to the door as if be as far away from Lady Gwen as he could to try to avoid further humiliation. For her part the Gwen had taken a blanket from her pack and wrapped it tightly around herself. She prayed the young squire didn\u2019t realize she had been aroused by her protege. Turning to the wall she placed a couple fingers to vagina lips to try to ease some of the feelings that had been awakened, but it didn\u2019t help and if she hadn\u2019t pressed her teeth into her lips she was sure a moan of pleasure would have filled the already tense air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was going to be a long night for the paladin and her squire as they not only dealt with the possibility of attack but feelings that were becoming harder and harder to deny. Lady Gwen was becoming more certain her body wasn\u2019t the only thing that had changed, and she was no longer certain she hated the changes, she may even like them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a slight scraping sound as the latch was slowly lifted from the door. Both the Lady Gwen and Squire Albert were wide awake from the earlier awkward incident in the room, but they were alert because they had been expecting this intrusion into their room as well. The truth was they welcomed the interruption to the thoughts keeping them from their slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Gwen decided to give the intruders a chance to back off their dark plans, \u201cWho goes there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause as the potential intruders decided if they were still interested in fighting opponents who were awake. Lady Gwen thought it was likely they would continue the assault as they wouldn\u2019t calculate an attractive young woman and a young man who was likely not out of his teens would pose much of a threat. The paladin knew she shouldn\u2019t hope for an attack but this would be a great chance to test her combat skills against men who wouldn\u2019t present much of a challenge especially with her squire here to back her up in the combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are just looking for a little fun with the blond slut,\u201d a deep voice bellowed. \u201cIf you don\u2019t cause any trouble I promise to pay you for the rental of the girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a small signal the squire stepped aside as the paladin stepped forward with a righteous fury in her eye. She slid the chain shirt on with a practiced ease and stepped towards the door sliding away the equipment blocking the door. Lady Gwen stood ready a few feet from the door, shield and sword in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am all ready boys,\u201d Lady Gwen called to the men outside the door. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come in and show me how you handle your tiny little daggers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA roar of anger filled the air as the door was kicked open and the men charged towards the paladin. Lady Gwen knew speed was important reminded herself as she stepped forward to meet the enemy making a quick jab into the throat of the first opponent. The bandit fell slowed the approach of his companions allowing the short sword of the paladin to find a home in the chest of a second man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Gwen took a step back as the intruders paused at the realization they had lost two of their number in less than a minute. She saw at least five men left standing in the narrow hall and doorway. How many more lurked outside the room? It didn\u2019t matter because they appeared to have decided to find easier prey elsewhere. They grabbed their dead companions and dragged them out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquire Albert walked over to the door and closed it with the end of his blade and smiled at Lady Gwen. Her combat skills hadn\u2019t vanished with the transformation to her body and she was more confident in her chance of success and she was ready to meet any challenge the world that would come at her. The squire and the paladin would try to get a little sleep because the bad guys were not likely to return and if they did they would meet the end of a blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning brought with it the chance to make a decision as what to do next. They could try the local spell casters thought that was likely to be dangerous from the description of them or they could continue on to larger location. Lady Gwen was of the mind to seek out the spell casters because if they were careful they shouldn\u2019t pose much of a threat to the two adventurers. Squire Albert thought they should move on to a larger town and safer magic user, because he was of a more cautious mind. </span></div></div>",

The young man\u2019s body was naked from the waist up; his muscles were firm from all of his training and shined in the moonlight from the small windows at the top of the wall. The image caused the paladin\u2019s pulse to start racing which caused her to blush in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to tell you the truth about my feelings for you,\u201d Squire Albert whispered Lady Gwen. \u201cYour beauty has caused new feelings to well within me for you, and I would regret not telling you that my desire to cure you is diminishing because I want you to remain the way you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Kingdom needs me to be Sir Garrett again,\u201d Gwen responded. \u201cI have responsibilities I have to fulfill.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can do just as much good as Lady Gwen and you could be my wife.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about!?!\u201d Gwen jolted forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe could be wonderful together,\u201d the red headed young man reached out a hand and gently caressed one of Lady Gwen\u2019s nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nipple instantly grew erect as pleasure jolt the woman\u2019s body. She fought to muffle a moan of pleasure, but hiding the sensations she was feeling would have been a complete fool. Her breathing quicken as she wondered what her apprentice would do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me you haven\u2019t been wondering about the pleasures of the woman\u2019s body as much as I have,\u201d Albert slid his hands against the creamy white skin of Gwen\u2019s body slowly moving his hands under her shirt lifting it from her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen\u2019s body ached with pleasure as the shirt rubbed against her nipple on its way off of her body. Her breasts bounced free before settling into place though they seemed to tremble in anticipation of what would happen next as her breathing became heavy. She debated covering her chest with her hands, but she was afraid she might she would start caressing them, or was she hoping her squire would cover her breasts with his calloused hands and pleasure them properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquire Albert had other plans as he grasped the small blond woman by the waist and drew her to him into a passionate kiss. Gwen\u2019s chest pressed against the squire chest feeling the warmth radiating from his body. She allowed herself to return the kiss as the feeling overwhelmed the logic center of her body. Her right hand slowly wandered over his abdomen taking joy in the feeling of the man\u2019s hard abdomen seeking out the large hard object tenting the pants of the squire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Gwen jerked awake from her slumber as her chest pounding in and out from the dream she had been having. Sweat drew the shirt she was wearing tightly to her body revealing swollen nipples with their erect tips to the air. Her head jerked towards the slumbering form of the young squire, and no small part of her desired to wake him and continue the most pleasurable dream she had been have. To her surprise she found her hand had wandered to her nipple and was gently pinching it drawing jolts of pleasure coursing through her body. She quickly jerked her hand away from her body and stared at it as if it was some strange intruder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fear of losing herself further caused her to steel her resolve to find a way to change back to her former male self. Lady Gwen quietly and quickly changed her clothing and got dressed before she made any attempt to awaken her squire. It had been a long night without much rest but she intended to get an early start. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lady Gwen gently nudged her squire awake and quickly backed up from the squire still very disturbed by the dream. It wasn\u2019t something she wanted to discuss with him though she feared she should tell him. Was it simply the feelings of a heterosexual female or was it something more sinister?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet up and get dressed quickly we need to go,\u201d Lady Gwen said curtly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore bandits show up?\u201d Squire Albert yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, we just have to get going and get this cured.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCertainly Mistress, whatever you want,\u201d Albert raised a brow in curiosity at the behavior of his mentor. \u201cDid something happen last night I don\u2019t know about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, nothing\u201d Gwen blushed. \u201cI am just ready to be cured. We will check in with Theresa the Blight and see if she can cure the condition or at least tell the origins of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you want to use Theresa. The bartender\u2019s description of her didn\u2019t sound very promising. We should probably wait until we get back to the capital or the order\u2019s temple at Yaris.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is no reason to wait so long. The bartender told us she was powerful enough to help she just screws up at the more powerful stuff, so if this is just a simple enchantment she may still be able to help besides she will likely be able to point us in the direction of if we need a priest or a wizard would have the easiest time breaking this enchantment that has been placed upon me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish but I still say if she looks at all sketchy we should move on to the next town or village.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Gwen nodded slightly to end the conversation. The truth was she was more than willing to take some risk in order to be cured. She cautiously opened the door but found no one laying in wait only a blood trail leading down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bar was empty except for the bartender who gave them a slight nod. Most likely the bandits were off somewhere sleeping off the booze they had been drinking which would mean Lady Gwen and Squire Albert could get a good head start on them before they noticed they were gone. The good news continued as the found their horses in the stables with two dead bandits who had likely tried to steal the paladin\u2019s horse and found the intelligent animal less than cooperative with their plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunlight shone brightly making everything seem better and allowed Lady Gwen to put her worries to the back of her mind and just enjoy the ride to the spellcaster\u2019s home. A small wooden sign directed them to Theresa\u2019s home. It was a large wooden home connected to a two story greenhouse. A woman with dark brown hair cascading down her back opened the door and walked towards them with a bright smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there something I can help you with?\u201d the lovely young woman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you Theresa?\u201d Lady Gwen decided to leave off the nickname of \u201cthe blight\u201d she couldn\u2019t imagine it was intended as a compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s me. Mistress of magic,\u201d She cheerfully replied. \u201cDo you need something from my vast skill set?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have been turned into a woman by some unknown magic and I want the effects reversed,\u201d Lady Gwen answered. \u201cOr at the very least the origins of the magic and where we can seek further help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will do my best. Come inside and I will see what I can do for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were lead into a room filled with strange containers of various different shapes and sizes. Strange aromas tickled their noses. Lady Gwen was lead into a magic circle which lit up upon her entrance with a gentle blue glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I can help you,\u201d Theresa smiled. \u201cIt appears you have been infected by some nasty magic, but I think I can counter it. Do you want me to give it a go or do you want to seek help elsewhere because I can recommend some people other people if you are more comfortable with that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet us think about it for a little bit,\u201d Squire Albert said. </span></div></div>",

After making a decision she hurriedly demanded, \u201cYou must reverse this at once.  I am of no use to anyone like this.\u201d   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheresa rushed about the grabbing and seizing various items mumbling to herself that she would get it right this time.  She called out to Garrett, \u201cIt will be only a moment.  You will see I will fix you up just right.  Thanks for giving me a chance to redeem myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe all make mistakes.  Please take care to do it right this time.\u201d  Gwen said apprehensively wondering if she was compounding her error trusting this mage with her poor reputation.  Still, the mage seemed genuinely concerned about Gwen's predicament.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheresa said, \u201cOkay, I think I am ready.  Can you hold still for a minute?\u201d  Gwen closed her eyes breathing nervously as she waited. <br>\r\n Theresa began chanting an invocation.  Albert looked on queasy at the prospect of this going wrong as the energy passed through Gwen into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou messed it up again.  I am, I need some cock in me.  This is worse than before.  You need to stop it,\u201d  Garrett\u2019s pants grew heavy as her horniness overwhelmed her reason.  Gigantic breasts blasted forth from her chest.  A sucking noise could be heard as Garrett rapidly lost her penis along with any traces of masculinity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, dear I have made a mess of it again.  It really isn\u2019t my fault I am cursed.  I should never of taken on this task,\u201d Theresa spoke through her heaving sobs.  \u201cI fear that you are worse than when you arrived.  I managed to channel some of the energy while transmuting it into Albert.  It was the best I could do for you.  I will go with you to aid in finding a remedy for yourself and perhaps my own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert\u2019s body matured under the magic.  His now well defined bulky muscles flexed as he sat up rubbing his head.  He asked in his deepened, \u201cDid it work?  I knew we shouldn\u2019t of used her.  You are more feminine than before.  I wouldn\u2019t of believed that possible.\u201d  He eyed Garrett\u2019s extra buxomy form.  His manhood extended in appreciation despite himself.  He quickly covered himself turning away embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm no need to hide that from me.  Gwen knows how to relieve that muscle.  Let me massage it for you.\u201d  Licking her lips Gwen lowered herself uncaring about her time as Sir Garrett.  Her watering mouth at the thought of Albert\u2019s swollen cock inside her.  Theresa shoved her to the ground.  Gwen regained her senses saying, \u201cI am sorry the urges are so hard to resist now.  Theresa do you have any clothes I could wear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI own nothing that would fit you but I can whip something up,\u201d  Theresa spoke as she worked up a spell.  Before any of them could yell no.  A pile clothes appeared before her.  Gwen hurriedly put them on.  Albert grabbed some of Garrett\u2019s old clothes for himself.  Gwen\u2019s new clothes left little to the imagination.  Basically a bra and panties with thin transparent hanging from them.  She smiled at her slutty appearance in a mirror.  Theresa shrugged sheepishly to Albert who looked questioningly at her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert worried about how much of Sir Garrett remained in this tart.  He might be better off leaving the pair of them to seek aid.  It would sit ill with him leaving Garrett now Gwen behind.  He feared her advances to him and any others she might meet.  Theresa the blight created more trouble than she cured.  But if she truly was cursed it was his duty to help her.  She did seem to mean well. Albert pondered what to do next.</span></div></div>",

The squire prayed to any of the gods of good who would listen that he would be able to find the Archmage in time before things got any worse. The look in the eye of Theresa had suggested that she might try to \u201chelp\u201d Gwen more. He tried to not think about that and focus on the path to take to the capital. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a shortcut he had heard about that might cut a day out of his journey but he wasn\u2019t certain of the path and it could end up taking longer than the regular path.

The longer it took to reverse the changes the more likely that his master would lose parts of himself. He arrived at the crossroads and pulled his horse to a stop so it could rest awhile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squire looked at the paths on the map to be sure of which turns to take before making the final decision.

Garrett\u2019s lack of caution and patience led him to became the wanton strumpet he was now.  He admitted to himself that she would prove a fine evenings entertainment but he knew his greater duty to his former teacher.  Honor called for him to attempt to return Gwen to her former state.  He selfishly thought for a moment that with Garrett gone his wealth might just pass on to himself.  With Albert his closest friend and no family known.  Garrett alluded to as much once saying that he had a will to provide for Albert with his passing.  Could Albert be so selfish as to leave his former mentor to a fate of a woman of easy virtue.  Albert\u2019s family desperately needed the money and deserved it too for their long noble heritage and service to the crown.  Garrett lacked noble blood.  Albert tried to rededicate himself to the mission but found himself daydreaming of the repairs he would start with on the family castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheresa busied herself looking through her mystical tomes while Gwen preened herself.  Theresa felt thankful that Gwen\u2019s rampant urges subsided with the removal of male temptation.  Though not restored to her manly attitudes or her former intelligence she could at least hold a conversation.  Theresa convinced herself she could fix this.  She would overcome the curse that restrained her with care and talent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen admired herself in the mirror.  Only faint memories of her former paladin self remained.  The only swordplay she desired now between the sheets.  The joys of physical pleasure called to her.  She wished to leave this place in their pursuit.  Theresa mentioned that she would take her out after she finished up with her studies.  Gwen grew impatient whining, \u201cCan\u2019t we go out yet I am bored.  We should be out finding men not buried in books.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheresa answered, \u201cLet me just try this spell out before we go for a walk.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo alarms came to Gwen\u2019s mind as all of the other spells worked out so well.  This body and a hot outfit what could go wrong.  A question did come to her diminished mind, \u201cWhat is it going to do?  Give me some jewelry to go with my amazing outfit?\u201d As she stood scantly clad before Theresa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the spell she was about to cast she hoped to instill sense into the mind of the young woman before her. If she tackled the magic in bits she wished to slowly break the spell.  Theresa focused on her words as she intoned the spell.  Within minutes of careful wording she released the magic.  \u201cHow are you doing Gwen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling she smiled at Theresa saying, \u201cYou might want to change your clothes if we go out your outfit is looking a bit oversized for you.  Here let me help you with that.  Honestly, I think dress up time is over.  We should get you changed for a stroll in the fresh air.\u201d  She began stripping the shocked magic user.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheresa tried to protest but the words failed.  Then the upward shift of everything about her became apparent.  Dwindling into an infant Gwen lifted her to bounteous bosom that leaked by instinct.  \u201cI thought you might be getting a bit hungry sweety.\u201d  Gwen cooed to the baby as she pulled her top down providing access for the infant. </span></div></div>",

There was a lot of risk in what they were about to try and Albert was worried Lady Gwen was taking too big of a chance to turn back into a man. The squire was a cautious person by nature and he was a lot more comfortable using someone they knew to help reverse the curse that was possibly dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTheresa seems like a very nice person but, she does have the nickname of the blight,\u201d Squire Albert started his argument. \u201cWe should wait until we reach the capital before we reverse this curse. Magic can be dangerous at the best of times so, why not go with someone we know and trust.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish I could wait but I can feel changes starting to affect my mind,\u201d Lady Gwen responded. \u201cBy the time we reach someone we know it maybe too late to return to myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat sort of changes are you experiencing?\u201d Squire Albert asked his mentor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy . . .\u201d She paused for a moment looking for the right words. \u201cPreferences in physical partners are changing, and I feel I am losing some of my fighting spirit and battle skill.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert blushed and took a deep swallow, \u201cCan you control the urges for long enough for us to reach the capital? If something goes wrong with the casting of Theresa the Blight we are still several days travel from the capital and the home of the Order of the Silver Griffin. It could very easily accelerate your changes even faster with no means to make it to a cure in time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t hold them back if I continue traveling with you,\u201d the admission startled the paladin but she knew it to be true. \u201cI am attracted to you and I fear another night spend alone in your company. It isn\u2019t just wanting to turn back into a man again. I am losing the urge to become a warrior of justice. All I want is to become a wife and a mother to children, and that will leave the lands defenseless against many evils.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squire was unsure of how to respond to the feelings of his master. Albert wanted to tell him everything would be alright and she could be turned back into a man by Theresa, but Albert was worried about the consequences of using this unknown magic worker, but was that really the case or did he just want Lady Gwen to remain female for awhile longer? He had to admit having a woman near him, especially one as attractive as Lady Gwen was very appealing, and the news she felt attracted to him as well just increased his desire to have her remain as she was, but that was a selfish thought. He should try to think of her needs and if this is the right thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this really what you want?\u201d Albert asked, \u201cIf something goes wrong are you willing to deal with the consequences?\u201d </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\n\u201cI know it is a great risk but it is one I feel I need to take,\u201d Lady Gwen explained. \u201cI have to think about Princess Fina and the future I am supposed to have with her. If something goes wrong at least it will be settled and I can move on with my life. As things stand right now I am caught between two worlds part of neither. It is a distraction that won\u2019t allow me to complete my quest and I need fulfill my quest if I am to remain true to the code of the paladin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Gwen headed into Theresa\u2019s home with a little fear but a lot of hope. She wondered what the consequences would be if the spell failed to reverse the changes already upon her. Would she continue to become more feminine or would there be a backlash from the magic being used? She was half tempted to ask her squire to leave her to her fate in case the magic were to infect him as well but she wanted his courage beside her when the spell was cast. Albert wasn\u2019t one to abandon someone because of risk anyways, he would have made for a very poor squire if could stand up against danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you decided?\u201d Theresa eyes were bright and eager. It was obvious she wanted to help, and Lady Gwen hoped that the desire would translate into being able to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would like you to try to remove the enchantment placed on me,\u201d Lady Gwen responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoth you and your squire remove any magical gear you may have on to prevent any energies from conflicting,\u201d Theresa began to remove herbs and items from the shelf as she set to work leaving the companions to the task she had set for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Gwen felt the fall and shaking of her chest for perhaps the last time as they slid free from the confines of the chain mail. She resisted the urge to pleasure herself in front of the others but she was a little tempted. It was her last chance in the body of a woman to feel the pleasures of a woman\u2019s body she hoped but this was not the moment to take advantage of her situation. Overall it had not been a bad experience though it wasn\u2019t one she would want to repeat any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the magic circle gave a slight cool feeling to caress to her body as if pressed against by the hand of a masseur. Lady Gwen stifled the moan of pleasure that was trying to rise within her body. She watched as her squire looked on with worry while Therese began her casting to remove the enchantment. She could feel the magic warm her body as it started to press into her flesh to work the changes it was called upon to do. The paladin tried to stay still but she couldn\u2019t keeper her eyes from wandering over her body looking for signs of transformation. Luckily, for the impatient warrior of the Order of the Griffin she didn\u2019t have wait for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuscles began to fill her arms as her body length growing her from her tiny size. Joy filled her heart as the large breasts that covered her chest shrank back as muscled pectorals. It wasn\u2019t long before the vagina transformed into a penis allowing Sir Garrett to once again call himself a man. At last he was free of the curse and could continue his quest, but it was then that things went south.<br>\r\n\u201cOops,\u201d Theresa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops? What does \u2019oops\u2019 mean?\u201d Squire Albert said as he started towards Theresa, worried about his master, but sudden jolt of pleasure dropped him to his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is happening to my squire?\u201d Sir Garrett asked as he tried to exit the magical circle and found he was still locked inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI may have missed some of the protections on the circle and instead of eliminating the magic transformation upon you it reflected it outwards at twice the strength,\u201d Theresa explained. \u201cIt appears there was an element in it to increase the libido of the afflicted person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett disagreed because it was obvious the increase to the libido was quite drastic as he watched his squire desperately pleasuring his naked body. Sweat poured from Albert\u2019s body as he shrank in size into shape of a petite woman with outrageous curves. Fat was soon swelling the squire\u2019s but as his penis shrank into the fold of the lips of a newly formed vagina. The new woman form began to gain mammary glands as her breasts swell to a size threatening to make a cow jealous. Long red hair flowed from her head as her features became far less masculine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long for the transformation to finish for the squire into a luscious ravishing redheaded woman. Crimson hair complemented emerald eyes, but they were still focused on the pleasures of the flesh as she moaned in pleasure. The newly formed woman collapsed to the floor as she reached orgasmic release leaving the other two people in the room wondering what to do next. </span></div></div>",

He grabbed a blanket and wrapped it around the transformed Albert who giggled and tried to kiss him but he lifted her and placed her over his shoulders and started to carry her from the house pushing past the magic user and get on his horse. It was only after he was a good distance away that he allowed himself to stop and dress himself.  He had made many vows to his order of holy knights and murdering someone in anger would have broken many of those promises to the order, but the person he was most angry with was himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was his own selfish desire that had lead to using an incompetent spell caster which had resulted in the transformation of his squire. Sir Garrett promised himself he would make correcting the transformation his top priority, but how to go about it and what to do with his newly bountiful squire were things he had yet to answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you doing Albert?\u201d Sir Garrett asked the squire who was busy admiring herself in a small pond nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is hard to focus. I feel pleasure and desire to such a degree that it is hard to contain it.\u201d Albert explained. \u201cI am finding myself fading in and out and think the gaps are becoming longer. I want to be scared but all I feel is joy. I want to make love to you and bear you at least a dozen children. Call me Ashley or your slave if you want.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAshley will do,\u201d Sir Garrett blushed. \u201cI may have to place you somewhere safe until I have secured a cure for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley\u2019s eyes seemed to glaze as she started to walk towards Sir Garrett dropping the blanket around her, \u201cWho says I want to be transformed back into a scrawny, and shy wimp? I am now a beautiful woman who has confidence in who she is and what she wants. I want you badly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are under a curse that I plan to cure. When you are turned back into Albert you decide you wish to return to your current form I will pay for it, but I won\u2019t let you make an uninformed decision when under an unnatural compulsion,\u201d Sir Garrett explained. \u201cYou have to remember until recently I was under the same curse to a lesser extent. Now we have to decide what to do next.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was definitely more than a handful and there were few men who would deny her and he intended to transform her back into a man still a virgin. It made him feel like a bad man locking her away until he got her help but it was the best of a lot of bad options to the mind of the paladin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley rode contentedly in front of Sir Garrett grinding her rear into his groin and his body was not so willing to let her go as his mind. He had been tempted to let her ride behind him but the thought of her chest being rubbed against him had made him chose this way and now he was regretting it. Thankfully his home came into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere do you want to make love?\u201d Ashley leaned back into him. She hopped off the horse causing her breasts to jiggle. She slipped the little covering she had on her body from her delectable flesh revealing her body to him. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It felt like a betrayal to sleep with his transformed squire, but she smelled wonderful and her body was soft and tender to the touch. He shook his head to clear the dangerous thoughts as he led her to his bedroom. The bed was one of the few luxuries he had and he was tired but he didn\u2019t dare to use it with a temptation so close by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou stay here,\u201d Sir Garrett said. \u201cI will be right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Ashley said to his surprise. \u201cIt is time I get my way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed the door shut so he could not escape her as she dropped all covering from her body and jumped on him causing him to stumble backwards onto the bed. Her lips firmly pressed against his and he felt his will vanishing.  He quickly removed the clothing from his body and rolled her over so he was on top. His mind lost all thought of Princess Fina as entered his penis into the red hair vixen. She moaned in pleasure as an orgasm surged through her body. Sir Garrett didn\u2019t know if it was the curse or if they were well matched to each other but they lasted for hours before they finally collapsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett wanted to feel guilty for what he had done but he only felt joy at the pleasure he felt and love for the beautiful woman, who was coaxing his penis back to life with her mouth.  As good as this felt he needed to make a decision about what to do next. It would be wrong to leave her as she was despite how happy she was right?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He would ask her if she wanted a cure for her condition but he already knew she would say no. For the good of his sense of right and wrong he would have to find someone to remove enough of the curse for him to be sure that was what his former squire wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brushed back a lock of her bright red hair so he could admire her beauty a moment before he sought out what he wanted to do for the wedding. A small affair would likely be best considering the situation but there were still many people to contact and he certainly had to inform Princess Fina he had fallen for another. It was true they had never been formally engaged but he still had an obligation to her. They hadn\u2019t been able to do anything until he had won the approval of her Father, King Emeril. He would still complete the mission he had been given but he might wait until he was married to do it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Ashley wasn\u2019t in the best position after her transformation and if something should happen to him he wanted her future to be secure. He had sent one of his servants to secure a wizard to work his magic on Ashley so he could obtain her consent from Albert. It would be great if the wizard could at least reduce the curse so they could have intelligent conversations. The pleasures of the flesh were wonderful but they would fade with time and he wanted someone he could live a long and happy life with as his companion. The question he had was what he should do next.</span></div></div>",

At the capital there are people I trust to help me with this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert nodded, \u201cI agree. I would rather take something this important to an ally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey headed to their horses and saw that everyone in the bar gave them a wide berth. No one wanted the trouble they had given the others during the night, and Gwen was glad. It had been a waste of life, this land had many dangers, it didn\u2019t need the assistance of one of the civilized races killing each other over a little gold. Would things ever be different?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDwelling on the negative was so she decided to think of her future. Lady Gwen dreamed of a simple home with a family when she was in the orphanage, it had been so simple back then. She had to worry about what would happen to all of the people depending on her if she failed to turn back, but was she right about that fact. Would it be so bad if she was stuck this way? There was nothing in the law that said she couldn\u2019t rule over her land thought it might be difficult to prove her identity it wouldn\u2019t be impossible, especially with the assistance of her squire, Albert. The thought relaxed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat crops should we plant this year?\u201d Lady Gwen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Albert looked at her confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have a long journey ahead of us and I thought it might be nice to talk about something other than me being a woman for a change, so what crops should I plant on my lands? I am thinking of planting a fruit orchard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApples are nice especially if you are raising horses.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think about having bushels of apples for you to eat, Thunder? Yeah, I think that would be a good idea. How goes your quest to pay off your Father\u2019s debts?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert was of a powerful noble family but his Father had squandered the fortune gambling and his son was doing his best to pay off the debt. Lady Gwen had offered to help pay the debt but he wanted to pay it off through his own hard work. She did sneak him some extra shares of the adventures they went on together when she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should be able to pay it off by the end of the year. I have had to sell off some of the antiques from the estates to keep us from losing some of the properties but I sold them to friends and I am hoping to get them back in time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you need me to purchase anything let me know. I have had a good year and I can afford to help you out besides my keep is a little spartan at the moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little!?!\u201d Albert laughed. \u201cI think your housekeeper has more furniture and works of art than you do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Gwen had to laugh at the truth of the statement, but as some excuse she was hardly ever at home, and there was usually some cause that seemed like it needed the money more. She was glad they were they were relaxing on the road, because there was usually so much stress with the worries that adventure brought. When she was married she was going to take a nice long break from adventuring to enjoy life for awhile. There were other heroes who would take up the slack. </span></div></div>",

The truth was he wanted to extend his time with Lady Gwen, so he was going to ask if they could stay at an inn for the night though they still had plenty of daylight for traveling. She would get changed back soon enough after all, so why not enjoy the transformation right now, because she was very lovely to look at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we stay at the Crystal Stallion for the night?\u201d Albert asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Gwen frowned, \u201cWe still have several hours of daylight for us to travel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut there aren\u2019t any nice places to stay for the next several hours so we would have to stay out in the open.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfraid of getting a little dirty?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not, but I prefer a nice meal and a warm bed to trail rations and the hard, cold, ground. Besides we can see if any of our allies are in the area for us to ask help from. Asking the squirrels and deer doesn\u2019t seem to be working.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paladin had no good reason that she wanted to tell for delaying there quest to get her cured. She didn\u2019t want to explain that she was starting to feel attracted to men especially her squire, and she was sure how much longer she could contain her feelings. Their last stop she had gone off to pleasure herself in the woods and the urges to do such things were coming much more frequently and with greater intensity. If this continued there wouldn\u2019t be much of the warrior she had once been, she wondered what her fate would be, but she decided an another night would be fine, as long as they got separate rooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess a nice meal wouldn\u2019t hurt,\u201d Lady Gwen relented. \u201cWe should be able to get two rooms at the inn, because it usually only fills when there is a festival in town.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Crystal Stallion was a favorite of travelers because of the heavy doors with good locks and thick stone walls. It had a strong reputation of safety with it\u2019s own stone wall and guards to protect the guests. It had a long history from long before the kingdom had formed as a bastion against the forces of the wild. Eventually a city had grown around it causing it to lose some of the hard earned reputation, but it was still popular with many. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were in luck to find two rooms next to each other and after which they came down to the lobby to meet up for the evening. Lady Gwen felt a little uncomfortable with the lustful looks she was drawing with her appearance. She wished she had bought something modest to wear for around town instead of just adventuring gear. Her cleavage was displayed for the enjoyment of many in the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince this was your idea, how should we spend the evening?\u201d Lady Gwen asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I think we should . . . \u201c</span></div></div>",

Albert had told him they would need to get her some clothing for her to wear in the capital and after some debate she had to admit he was right. It would have been strange for her to wear her combat gear around the capital, because it would draw unwanted attention from the guards of the town who would have uncomfortable questions that would be hard to answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do I need a gown?\u201d Gwen growled from the dressing room. Albert thought it sounded more like a purr, but he wouldn\u2019t dare say that thought aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn case we go somewhere formal,\u201d Albert offered. He doubted there would be any need for such an outfit, but he want to see that lovely form in a gown. He knew he was having some fun at his mistress\u2019s expense but he didn\u2019t feel too bad about it because Albert had often been teased during his training, so he figured a little payback was only fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, but let\u2019s go to dinner after I purchase this, because I am starting to get hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Gwen\u2019s form was accentuated by the lovely royal blue gown. Her already impressive cleave looked ready to burst form the top and her curves were ready for a deep gaze from the young squire. It took him some time to collect himself enough to respond to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat will do, um, I think we have enough clothing, so let\u2019s go get some food to eat.\u201d Albert forced himself to look away from Gwen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to admit the clothing felt very comfortable compared to her armor and weapons, but she kept a couple of daggers her just in case. Gwen wondered where they were going to eat, and smiled as she realized she now had the clothing for wherever they ended up. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All day she had felt awkward and out of place and decided it was time to give her squire a little payback. Gwen decided on a fancy restaurant because she knew that Albert would feel very awkward at that sort of restaurant. Lord Albert was from an ancient and noble lineage but his family had fallen on hard times so he was heavily in debt. Gwen had taken him on as a squire without charging the usual fees because she could see the desire to good in him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would pay for his meal but this wasn\u2019t just about messing with him, he needed to get used to these places. His family debts were being paid down with the money from adventuring and eventually, the other nobles would invite him to places that were expensive. Gwen wanted him to perform well so that he would be a good example for the rest of the aristocracy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are going to the Celestial Manor tonight,\u201d Gwen could see the color drain from his cheeks at the prospect. There would have been less fear on his face if she had told them there were a thousand dragons outside who wanted to kill them. \u201cI am treating you as thanks for supporting me today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you are treating me as thanks shouldn\u2019t I pick the restaurant?\u201d Albert was starting the groundwork for weaseling his way out of this and she wasn\u2019t going to allow that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a chance, you need to experience some fine dining instead of the cheap rat meat you have been eating. I understand you are trying to save money but none of the nobles are going to be interested in dining at such places.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why I need to meet with other nobles at such places, I can meet them at their homes or my own when I have a few repairs done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA few repairs? Putting that aside, any of the young ladies you court are certain to expect a nice place to eat and you need some experience with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCourt ladies!?!\u201d Albert's face looked about ready to burst into flame with as red as it became. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are planning to carry on your noble line aren\u2019t you? And what about your sisters, perhaps they want to be taken to such places as this from time to time?\u201d Gwen could see him start to nod his head in agreement. \u201cGood, let\u2019s head out in about an hour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the hour had passed Gwen cursed herself for giving such little time. She had never dressed as a lady and it was taking a lot longer than she had expected. The paladin hated to be late but there was nothing to be done as she wanted to give him a proper dating experience and not look like a slob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked nothing like an adventurer as she came down the stairs. The blue gown did wonderful things to an already impressive figure and Albert and the others near the entrance looked a bit slack-jawed at her appearance. The nice thing was that Gwen wasn\u2019t going to catch flak for being late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look nice this evening,\u201d Albert finally managed as they arrived at the restaurant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled, \u201cYou might want to try saying something like that a little sooner. A little-stunned silence is nice but if you do it for too long you come off as weird.\u201d </span></div></div>",

Funds were tight for the young squire so he appreciated the prices the place offered but even he was willing to spare a few more coins if they could get something better. The food was some sort of stew and he was scared to speculate on what animal the meat came from because he hadn\u2019t seen any rats around and this looked like a place that had many rodents. Their beds were simple straw beds that were likely to be little better than sleeping on the ground. Christina frowned at the beds but didn\u2019t make any complaint about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I saw a bathhouse down the street where I can clear away some of the dust from the road,\u201d Christina spoke up. \u201cI will treat you if you want to come.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds good,\u201d Albert responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inn had a bath but after their other experiences, they decided to check out the place down the street. Sweet fragrances filled their noses as they entered the place to a beautiful woman with a bright smile. Steam rolled out of the back rooms seeming to call to the pair and they were quick to move forward to comply with the request. </span></div></div>",

The last road sign I saw was at least twenty miles back and it was for a place I never heard of before and it was a good distance off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frown came off as more of an adorable pout. Her eyes looked uncertainly at the road ahead and darkly at the road behind them. The squire suspected she was in the dark about this area as much as she was. Thankfully a small group of people approached them that might have an answer to there problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey appeared to be a group of peasants with old cobbled together clothing stained in dirt and sweat. Only four in number, all of them were adults with two women on the cart, one of them heavy with child. A bearded man leading the mule who looked about ready to collapse with the effort. The younger man just outside of teen years held a pitchfork and was eyeing them suspiciously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett decided it was better to avoid the word curse for fear it would scare them, \u201cWe are looking for a temple to visit in the area. Do you have any suggestions?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe peasants relaxed because they knew well the need for the gods with all of the problems which befell them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Gothric and this is my family,\u201d he motioned to the others. \u201cThe witches of Dragoor are not fond of temples but there are a few that still defy them.

If they are good they might be of some help and if they are evil we get the chance to smite it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an optimistic attitude but Albert had his doubts about this. His master seemed determined and the would back her play into the abyss because she had always been there for him. She had saved his family when they were on the verge of losing everything to debt collectors and given him a path to redeem his family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tower was crafted of freshly polished stone and the door even smelled of fresh paint. As they reached the door it jerked open. A young maid stepped out to greet them in an outfit that was far from proper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy master welcomes all customers to his tower,\u201d Her curtesy revealed a pair of panties embroidered with a rose. \u201cI am Bunny.

She stood up shaking the feeling off.  Sir Garrett shook Albert wake who shook slightly from the shock.  Albert waited to be admonished but Sir Garrett only sashayed to her horse Thunder to grab some dry rations for breakfast.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert stared at the sway of the hips walking from him.  He could really go for a woman with a figure like that.  Too bad that lush butt belonged to his liege he thought as he got some food too.   He heard Sir Garrett call to him, \u201cCould you help me up on Thunder?\u201d  Albert looked over to see the woman looking plaintively at the young squire.  Albert hurried over to help the beautiful woman on her horse.  She put her dainty foot in his hand as he lifted her light weight with ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett bountiful bust jiggled as she adjusted herself in the saddle.  She saw Albert turn quickly from her to get on his horse.  They remained silent as they journeyed to an old bandit hide out the villains might be practicing dark rituals in.  The trail became clear of vegetation as the pair neared the bandit hideout.  Sir Garrett wanted this done with so she rode in at a gallop unsheathing the short sword figuring that the longsword would be too heavy for her now effeminate arms.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder pounded an alarm to the cultists as the steed passed through a rusted open gate.  Albert kicked up his pace to catch up.  Sir Garrett swung her sword down on the first cultist in reach striking deep into his neck sticking so that Sir Garrett lost hold of his sword.  Thunder continued to gallop on top of a cultist exiting the small cabin in the middle of the piece meal fencing.  Albert pulled his longsword sliding from his horse as he pulled to a stop in front of the only structure in this pitiful compound.  Another cultist in human bone armor left the building with sword drawn.  Albert quickly engaged him while Sir Garrett circled the building on Thunder breasts bouncing almost unrestrained.  Albert did as Sir Garrett be aware of your surroundings but focus on the fight in front of you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert matched blade for blade with the bone knight.  Often sparring with Sir Garrett this man lacked the strength and skill Albert trained against.  Albert\u2019s sword shot forth into the openings in the armor.  Blood flowed freely who cursed at Albert but couldn\u2019t find a way to hurt him.  A quick side step from Albert followed by a jab to the back of the knee causing the knight to fall to the ground.  The trampled cultist managed to roll over but could only stare glassy eyed at the fight before him.  The bone knight flipped over in time to see the squire Albert driving the end of the blade into neck.  Albert pulled the blade out wishing to face the brunt of the danger with Sir Garrett in a diminished state.  Sir Garrett looked out for him in their time together now it was his turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert opened the wooden door to a fetid smell.  A make shift altar in front of a roaring fire place with a robed priest with an acolyte on either side.  Albert saw upon the altar behind the priest a young woman bound and gagged.  Anger welled inside him as he lunged at the priest stabbing him in the chest.  The priest brought down a nasty looking ornate dagger on Albert.  The dagger pierced his shoulder slightly before Albert shoved the priest into the acolyte on the left pushing the blade into the acolyte.  The other acolyte came behind Albert to stab him in the back when a blade pierced his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt some point chivalry gives way to necessity.  That is another lesson you should know Albert.  Now help me get the young lady free.\u201d Sir Garrett said as she worked the knot loose on the young woman\u2019s gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her gag, free she excitedly said looking at Albert, \u201cOh, thank you Sir knight I am Penelope Lord Glenbury\u2019s daughter.  He will reward you greatly for saving me.  You are so handsome and brave I thank you with all my heart.\u201d   The pretty young girl about Albert\u2019s age stared doe eyed at the squire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert responded, \u201cI am sorry for the confusion but I am squire to Sir Garrett.  I am Lord Albert Maxwell and pleased to meet you.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett said, \u201cHow about you escort Penelope home while I head back to the capital?  I want to get back in a hurry.  I trust you will get Penelope home safe.\u201d <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Sweaty, dirty, and hair a mess she\u2019d pushed hard to get back as fast as she could get back.  With exhaustion, she guided Thunder to a grove by the castle where she met Princess Fina secretly.  Sir Garrett never took liberties with her on their clandestine meetings.  Sir Garrett pulled a small amulet from a secret pocket hidden in her leather saddlebag.  She pulled the silver chain around her slender neck fixing the clasp.  The amulet laid in the valley between her mountains.  The runic symbols on the amulet lit up calling to its twin owned by Princess Fina.  Sir Garrett steeled herself trying to think of what to say of her situation.  She finally said, \u201cPrincess Fina this will be difficult to take but I have fallen victim to a curse.  I find myself in the form of a young women.  I wished to speak with you before speaking to the court wizards to let you know that I have accomplished the mission in the Dread swamp.  We can get married now at your father\u2019s discretion.  I wanted to let you know the good news as soon as I arrived.  I love you and will be with you soon.\u201d  Sir Garrett headed back to Thunder when she heard Fina\u2019s voice speak to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFina\u2019s soft voice spoke clearly through the amulet, \u201cWait there I want to see you.  This is amazing I never saw such a powerful transformation.  I will be over in a minute.\u201d  Fina hurried through the castle halls to a secret passage to meet Sir Garrett.  Guided by her amulets ability to locate its twin headed to Sir Garrett.  She smiled as she drew closer to their secret rendezvous loving the idea of meeting him in that secluded spot.  As much as his male form excited her the idea of observing a fully realized transformation.  Only high level magic users possessed the ability to perform such magic unaided.  She hoped that this might be such a case.  She remained confident that the court wizards held the knowledge to reverse the curse.  It might be fun to have a girlfriend to do some fun stuff with for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett for her part waited nervously waffling between the desire to see Princess Fina and the wish to not have Fina witness her in such a state.  Fina stubbornness would not be dissuaded Sir Garrett told herself so Sir Garrett began to straighten herself the best she could.  Sir Garrett poured the contents of her water sack onto her head to wash some of the dirt and sweat off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFina saw the shapely form that Sir Garrett now held feeling giddy.  She called out to her love, \u201cHello beautiful you look worn out.  How about I get you into a bath so you can really get cleaned up.  I want to examine you more closely.  You can see the court wizards later.\u201d   <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Sir Garrett for her part looked forward to getting properly clean and spending some time alone with Fina.  She also desired to please Fina who eagerly wished to examine the magic binding Sir Garrett\u2019s voluptuous form.  Before Sir Garrett left she signaled to Thunder to go home.  Her servants would take care of him until she returned home.  The servants wouldn\u2019t think anything unusual as Thunder often got sent home when terrain did not permit.  With their bonded link, Sir Garrett, could call if she needed Thunder.  Fina guided her through the shadowy secret passages.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFina pushed aside a mirror to the empty hallways near her room.  She hurried with Sir Garrett to her room.  After she silently shut the door so no one would hear she turned to face Sir Garrett\u2019s jiggling chest.  She kissed a stunned Sir Garrett her tongue probed his mouth.  Sir Garrett pushed Fina off to which Fina frowned saying, \u201cWhy do you want to stop?  We could have a little fun before you get cleaned up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett said, \u201cI hardly wish to have you while I am not myself.  Let me get cleaned up and you can do your examination.  I want to see the court wizards after so I can return to you as your fianc\u00e9e.  But I will wait until you get your tests done because I love you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFina teased posing in a sensual position caressing Sir Garrett\u2019s cheek saying, \u201cWhy not have a little fun right not.  I could teach you a few things about a woman\u2019s body before we marry.  Or do you desire a masculine form to please you now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett stammered, \u201cI\u2026 no of course not.  Let me take a wash up and we will talk more.  I love you and no one else.  I am still me on the inside.\u201d Sir Garrett walked to the luxurious bathroom dwelling on the thought of a man taking her.  She shook her head no she didn\u2019t want some kneading her breasts making her squeal in delight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFina watched Sir Garrett walk away choosing not to tease more.  She refocused herself on preparing some identifying spells to cast on Sir Garrett.  She looked through her potions she stored in an iron storage chest.  She kept the chest open if she needed any of them.  Fina opened her closet looking for an outfit that better fitted Sir Garrett\u2019s new form.  She then snuck into the bathroom to steal Sir Garrett\u2019s clothes.  Fina grabbed the dirty clothes when Sir Garrett ducked under the water.  She dumped the clothes down the laundry chute.  Fina desired to have Sir Garrett compliant as possible.  Fina planned to take her time with Sir Garrett who might push to see the court wizards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett stripped her clothes off dropping in a pile while the ornate tub filled.  She dropped a cleansing bead into the water causing bubbles formed on the surface of the water.  She slid into the warm water letting it soothe her aching muscle.  The cleansing bead did its work washing away the sweat and dirt acquired on her journey.  She dunked under the water her long hair spread out as tendrils in the water.  She surfaced brushing her silky hair out of her face.  She felt tempted to explore her body but the knowledge that Fina stood in the next room prevented her.  She stood up her nipples hardening in the cool air.  She hurriedly wrapped a soft towel around herself.  She looked for her clothes when she couldn\u2019t locate them she called to Fina, \u201cWhat have you done with my clothes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI sent them to be cleaned.  Don\u2019t worry I picked out an outfit for you.  I poured us some wine and ordered some food for us.\u201d  Fina said giggling a little.      <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Underwear lay next to the outfit she looked at Fina who said, \u201cIf you need help putting it on I am here for you.  I can\u2019t have you in the towel when the servant brings the food.  That is how rumors begin.  Though with a body like that it might increase my estimation.  Have you thought about a name I can call you by?  Sir Garrett is hardly becoming is hardly becoming of a lady of your beauty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett shook her chest jiggling slightly with it.  She replied to the young Princess, \u201cI plan to be restored before the need is felt.  But if it still strikes your fancy you can come up with one for me.  I plan this last evening only in this form.\u201d  Sir Garrett dropped the towel displaying her perfect shaped mountains.  Her nipples hardening in the open air she blushing at the sight of her fianc\u00e9e staring in fascination at her nude form.  Sir Garrett pulled the soft panties up her shapely legs.  The bra pinched as it pushed up a valley of cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFina wondered at the power that transformed her fianc\u00e9e.  No masculine sign on the curves of the woman before her.  Remembering herself she said, \u201cA shame we only have one-night.  I will endeavor to convince you for more.  I can learn much from this spell but it will take time.  We will save the convincing for later.  First I think Louise suits you well.  Now I will help you with your dress.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFina fixed the dress up on the newly christened Louise.  She led her to a mirror the visage of two beautiful young stood.  Fina smiled admiring Louise who might be fun to instruct in the pleasures of the female form.  A knock on the door caused Fina to call out, \u201cCome in.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She soon rectified her quiet stillness with rushing into the man\u2019s awaiting arms.  They warmly embraced for a minute before she pulled back saying, \u201cMy father said nothing of your arrival.  How long are you here for?  Please say that it is not only for the night.  Your stays are always so short.  I must say I am being abominably rude not offering introductions.  Edward this is my best friend Louise.  Louise this is my charming cousin Edward.  He is the best of men next to my darling Sir Garrett.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouise took the scene in not knowing how to act as a lady.  She curtsied imitating interactions she had with noble women.  Edward smirked while bowing to her.  She said, \u201cIt is an honor to make your acquaintance.  Fina often talks of you and your letters fondly.\u201d  She decided to play along with Fina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFina said, \u201cWe are about to have dinner dinner would you care to join us?\u201d  She loved her cousin Edward played with her as a child and wrote to her of his life far away.  His family served the Emperor, powerful master of lands exceeding her father\u2019s own.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward responded, \u201cBy far the best offer I had in a long time.  Two beautiful women what sensible man could refuse.  I will bore with my latest mission from the Emperor.  Now may I suggest we take our meal in a place other than your bedchamber as it might tarnish your reputation to have a rogue such as me in it.\u201d    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFina shook her head at that idea saying, \u201cI am afraid that you are to well known to sully any reputations.

Are you just on holiday or to woo some gentlemen caller?\u201d  Edward spoke with a confidant smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouise(Garrett) blushed despite herself trying to come up with some excuse to get the conversation off of himself.  Fina interceded on Louise\u2019s behalf saying, \u201cNone of your nosiness.  She is here for a pleasant visit with me and that is all you need know of her.  Now, if you wish to make conversation with me you can tell of your adventures in the empire.  Surely you can regal us of your romances.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grin formed on Edward\u2019s face as began telling them of the exotic creatures and people.  The time passed quickly with even Louise getting caught up in his eloquence and charm.  He painted a picture of a place wonder and surprises.  Louise knew of the empires insatiable desire for diversion and blood sport.  Fortunes won and lost on the gambling.  Many adventurous souls make their livelihoods delivering creatures and people for the fights.  The empire once feared for its expansionist conquests now reveled in such entertainments.  It interested Louise how a representative saw such a country.  Edward pretended to be dazzled by it all but Louise suspected that he was more of a realist.  His observations carefully worded with clear descriptions but when Garrett paid attention he could tell that Edward left out the seedier more distasteful item. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward\u2019s conversation led to talking of the most beautiful women seen by man excepting his present company he said with a smile.  Louise felt herself slip into the role of imagining herself as one of the beauties pursued by this handsome man.  Physically she felt herself become aroused.  The feeling of her nipples hardening against the silky fabric of her desire Edward\u2019s caressing them.  Louise remembered herself and blushed self consciously.  Edward caught this and smiled in response.  Fina for her part remained oblivious of how the stories effected her.  She pressed for details of the liaisons of cousin, eager for the juicy details.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouise sighed gratefully at the knock on the door.  A couple of servants at Fina\u2019s okay with trays of food.  The quantity proved equal to the extra guest.  With trays piled high with varied delicacies from around the kingdom.  The distraction provided relief to Louise suffered at fantasying of Edward.  With one type of hunger satiated Edward decided to pursue another.  With a mischievous grin he asked, \u201cFina would you be a dear and grab me that book on the fauna of Dar you said that you would loan me?  I was thinking of catching up on my reading.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFina flippantly said, \u201cI can see when I am not wanted.  I will give you both a bit of privacy.\u201d  She giggled as she began to leave the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouise quickly said, \u201cI could come with you.\u201d  A bit afraid of her ability to fend off any advances on her virtue.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward said, \u201cI hardly think the job requires two.  And rest assured that Fina will return to find your reputation in tact.  On my word as a gentlemen.\u201d  A twinkle in his eye along with a hand over his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouise resigned herself to be left in the company of the young man.  She waved Fina on.

Maybe you want a man on them and not me?\u201d  She finished with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett responded, \u201cOh, I think I am still man enough for a kiss.\u201d  Leaning forward for a kiss Fina placed her own soft lips to her fianc\u00e9e\u2019s.  Kiss only momentary held none of the usual magic for Sir Garrett who dismissed it as stress.  Turning she walked to the court wizards\u2019 hall.  An apprentice wizard met her initially who took convincing for her to grab one of the master wizards.  Unfortunately, Mazara the second in command came to see her.  Mazara\u2019s cruel streak worried the paladin who now found herself in her hands.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMazara\u2019s cruel smile sent shivers through Sir Garrett as she said, \u201cIs it possible that the great Sir Garrett stands before me?

Or do you not kiss and tell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett calmed herself before saying, \u201cI am here to get the curse on me removed as is my right as a knight in service to King Emeril.  Cast your magic and I will disturb your studies no more.\u201d  Hoping to stay professional avoiding a fight with Mazara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMazara looked disappointed at Sir Garrett\u2019s tranquil demeanor.

I will give you a careful examine and make an assessment in my own time.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett wondered if Mazara were delaying to make her nervous.  She refused to show it saying, \u201cTake your time by no means would I rush you.  I trust your expertise and thank you for your time.\u201d  She hated trying to placate the evil woman but she was her best means of a cure.

A loose brothel whore, a comely maid, perhaps a noble woman who she could marry off to one of Sir Garrett\u2019s former friends.  A smug smirk on her face sauntered up to the lovely form of the soon to be ex paladin.  She said, \u201cHere you go drink this and your worries about being a female will soon be gone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett eyed the potion replying, \u201cAre you sure this will work?\u201d  Even as she spoke she drank down the potion.  The drowsiness quickly hit her.  Seeing Mazara\u2019s smile turn to laughter the betrayal struck Sir Garrett. She tried to rush Mazara but her legs gave out numb from the potion.  The strength of the potion proved too powerful for Sir Garrett who passed out on the cool floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMazara hurried to make preparations for the series of spells she needed to cast.  She excitedly did the work.  Only a slight sadness that Sir Garrett would never know what Mazara did to her.  With everything set up she began to gesture while chanting the invocation. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Smiling through the blonde tresses she observed only clear smooth skin.  As she fixed up her hair she barely contained her excitement at the prospect of the ball tonight.  Though Lily was only minor nobility, Mazara one of King Emeril\u2019s personal wizards took an interest in her getting her an invitation. Orphaned as a young child Mazara took her in treating with every kindness she could bestow.  An education at the finest finishing school.  Jewelry and beautiful dresses that she would never feel out of place.  Now that she graduated she returned to Mazara who greeted her with an invitation to a royal ball.  Mazara\u2019s attention to her nearly constant, comforted Lily.  Lily told Mazara that she thought of her as a second mother to her.  The grin this brought to Mazara\u2019s brought tears streaming down her face.  Mazara delighted in it expressing a desire to be called mother.  Lily wrapped arms around the slender form of Mazara hugging her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA girl needed a mother to guide her in life.  With Mazara now elevated to that position Lily put her to the task of helping her pick a suitable dress for the ball.  Mazara\u2019s choice struck her as more daring than she would choose for herself.  The delight on Mazara\u2019s face seeing her wear it told her all she needed to know.  She now looked at herself in the mirror the thin fabric rounding the curves of her body leaving little to the imagination.  The neckline plunged down displaying her hefty melons for all to see.  She blushed but Mazara reassured her it would draw many suitors.  Such thoughts deepening the warming blush of her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily finished getting ready and hurried down the stairs into the waiting carriage.  She gossiped with Mazara as they road talking of who was in with King Emeril and who on the outside of his circle.  Hearing that the head court wizard was on the outs shocked her.  Though it boded well for her guardian who stood to gain the position with Arimas out the way.  Lily heartily wished Mazara the best.  Their arrival into a the crowded scene of elegantly dressed nobles exiting their carriages with servants attending their needs.  Stepping out Lily waited for Mazara who waved her on as she saw someone she had business with.  Nervously she walked to the entrance with the invitation in hand.  Lily beauty drew stares from many in the crowd.  A handsome young knight even asked for the honor of her first dance.  She quietly acceded to the request.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat stunned the most was Princess Fina upon witnessing her hurried to her side.  She curtsied to the princess who whispered, \u201cSir Garrett where have you been?  I have been sick with worry and I thought you were going to get cured.  What are you doing here in a dress?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerplexed Lily responded the best she could, \u201cI am at a loss your majesty at what you mean.  My name is Lily I am orphaned noble in the care of Mazara.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess pondered what she heard before saying, \u201cI wish to know you better I have few friends my own age.  Would you honor me by coming for some tea tomorrow and spend the day with me?  Early in the day if you please.  I long to spend time with a charming lady such as yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked it took a minute for Lily to recover herself before saying, \u201cOf course your majesty it would be my honor.\u201d  Curtsying to Princess Fina who left to greet other guests.  As she walked away a flash of seeing the Princess standing in a secluded grove came to her mind.  Odd she never met the Princess before.  Probably a daydream Mazara often told her not to dwell on fantasy\u2019s that didn\u2019t involve men.  They just weren\u2019t worth your time.  </span></div></div>",

Lily couldn\u2019t be more grateful to her guardian.  Randy as she called him and felt about him when he stood near her.  Young handsome rich all of these things along with a sweet nature.  Mothering oodles of children to please him consumed much of her agreeable mind.  She hurried down to await her handsome man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMazara took wicked pleasure in the piece of fluff she called her ward.  A stroke of genius to set up the strumpet with Grand Duke Durius\u2019s son.  With his strength added to King Emeril few would stand in their way.  Through her spies she learned the grand duke\u2019s greatest wish to see his son married with grandchildren to spoil.  Lily would ensure his distraction with plenty of grandchildren the fertility magic Mazara used would ensure that.  She purchased Sir Garrett\u2019s squire Albert\u2019s silence with forgiveness of his family\u2019s debt.  Mazara managed to squeeze out a few tears at Sir Garrett\u2019s funeral.  She smiled at how well she managed it all.  She caught sight of Lily bouncing down the stairs in a dress that displayed her assets admirably.  Ready for a date with Randall no doubt.  Lily called them meetings to arrange their marriage but Mazara knew it to be an excuse to fool around with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock on the door cause Lily to jump but she returned to her seat composing herself.  Mazara waved off a servant as she opened the door to Duke Randall Durius.  Tall and well built he gave a bow and formal greeting to Mazara trying to ingratiate himself with his fiancee\u2019s guardian.  After some formal greetings and pleasantries Lily went with Randall in his ornate carriage.  Watching Randall carefully help Lily in whispering, \u201cI know the perfect secluded spot for us.  It is a grove near the castle.  I have yet to witness any wander the grove.  I long for those luscious lips pressed to mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily giggled excitedly saying, \u201cWhich lips do you mean?  I plan to let you own both.  My body aches for your firm caresses.\u201d Her hand wandered to Randy\u2019s lap massaging his hardening manhood.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandall spoke in a hushed voice as he drove the carriage, \u201cI too eagerly await our marriage that is why I think it best if we wait so that I don\u2019t sully your reputation.  It pains me to resist the passion to be as one.  But I would not risk our marriage for a days pleasure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily pouted slightly , \u201cFear not no one will see us.  I refuse to let worry divide us when my body quivers with desire to belong to you.  I know how to convince to carry on.\u201d  With that she pulled a blanket over Randy\u2019s lap looking about for witnesses.  Catching sight of none she ducking under the blanket she worked her lips over his manhood.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandall drove the horse faster that they might continue.  Lily\u2019s warm tongue convinced him of his weakness to her.  No man could blame him for falling to the lures of such a gifted woman.  In nature and beauty the gods gifted her.  Arriving at the secluded grove the soon to be lovers found a comfortable spot to lay down a blanket upon which they lay as the made out with each other removing their clothes as they continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Fina wandered the grove that once brought joy to her meeting her beloved Sir Garrett.  She worried about his fate.  She knew he went to the court wizards but as the days past she wondered why he didn\u2019t return to her.  Then she Albert reported his death she knew something didn\u2019t fit together.  Sir Garrett returned to her transformed but alive.  He could not of died on his quest as reported.  This smelled of her fathers work.  Mourning came easy to her at the funeral as sorrow filled her not knowing what befell Garrett.  Sound perturbed her pondering Fina followed them to their source.  She found buxom young woman riding atop Duke Randall who she recognized from court.  About to turn away from them when the woman flung her head back crying out in ecstasy revealing her face.  The sight of the face that Garrett wore on the night he disappeared.  The woman fell upon the Duke pressing her large attributes into his muscled chest kissing him passionately.        </span></div></div>",

Randy said such nice things to her she never thought for a minute so ill of him.  No he was a good man he must have an explanation.  Lily worriedly ask, \u201cRandy what is the going on?  I didn\u2019t know that you knew Princess Fina intimately.\u201d  She watched Randy looking for his response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused Randy said, \u201cI am bewildered as you are dear.  I am only formally acquainted with Princess Fina.  I never loved another save you sweetest Lily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFina snapped, \u201cI am talking to you, you little tart.\u201d  Then a realization hit her that the magic to Sir Garrett might of gone further than his body.  She blanched with the color draining from her face.  The tears grew into a torrent between sobs she said, \u201cNo, no I am so sorry.  I made a horrible mistake.\u201d  She collapsed to her knees weeping inconsolably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Lily looked confused at Princess Fina than at Randy who shook his head as baffled as her.

But it isn\u2019t as bad as it seems we are betrothed we just let are basic sides get the better of us.  We love each other so much please if you would be discreet about this.

You had your mind then but you said you were going to the court wizards and I heard nothing from you after that.  You must believe me.  I will keep your secret here please keep mine.

How could they doubt her no one ever spoke of madness in her family?  Lily hated to believe her but inside she felt it to be true.

My father told me King Emeril looked ill on your marriage to the low born paladin despite the prestige he won.  I know the amazing powers of magic and the gods.  I find it hard to this soft beautiful creature a powerful valiant knight of the silver order of the griffin.  I love her so.\u201d  He brought his hand up gently touching Lily\u2019s delicate skin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily teared up putting her hand on his holding it in place.

I don\u2019t want to lose myself but I know how much you must love him.  Sometimes there are no easy solutions are there.  I desire nothing more than to be with Randy for the rest of my life.  But I choose to do what is right.  If restoring me to Sir Garrett will aid in the dethroning of your father.  What say you Randy are you in to save the kingdom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy looked at her amazed.  How selfless of her to sacrifice herself for the kingdom.  He loved her more now than ever.  Hesitantly he said, \u201cI too will join you against the king.  We must be careful who to enlist with us.  I would hardly wish to lose myself as Sir Garrett.  Though I do love who he came to be.\u201d  He took Lily\u2019s hand in his giving it a reassuring squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFina said, \u201cThank you let us meet here tomorrow at one.

I mean this has been a lot to take in.\u201d  Watching her intently he felt himself growing hard.  Knowing that the buxom beauty before him once appeared as a masculine man dampened his arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily responded, \u201cI plan to enjoy this body while I am in charge.  I love you and I plan express that as long as I can.  Please show me how much you love me.\u201d  She proceeded to open her wide hip continuing to play with herself.

Combing out the bits of grass that found their way into her hair.  She smiled at Randy as he helped her into the carriage.  She said, \u201cA lot to absorb today don\u2019t you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy seated himself next to his beloved.  He found it odd to think that a great knight of the realm dwelt inside the angelic beauty before him.  Nothing about her reminded him of Sir Garrett save a good moral compass.  He knew that pursuing this might lead to her being no more.  Still, she insisted on pursuing the restoration of Sir Garrett and challenging King Emeril.  Finally, responding to Lily he said, \u201cYes I am having trouble having trouble wrapping my head around it all.  Are you sure that you wish to defy King Emeril?  You are putting your life in danger in multiple ways if we pursue this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I want to do right by the princess.  I am the man that she loves somewhere inside I couldn\u2019t take that from another woman.  I hate to forego our love but I will enjoy it for the time that we have left.\u201d  She kissed Randy on the cheek.  The carriage pulled to a stop in front of Mazara\u2019s home.  Robert helped her down leading her to the door.  A servant opened the door as Lily went to her room to change her cloths.  Randy lingered asking to speak to the mistress of the house.  Mazara soon arrived leading him into the study to speak privately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMazara smiled, \u201cTo what do I owe this little visit?  You already have my enthusiastic approval of your upcoming marriage to my ward.  Don\u2019t tell me this is to warn me of a bundle of joy on the way.  I understand how these things happen.  I want you know that I will relish being a doting Auntie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy responded gravely, \u201cI fear it is much more serious than that.  Lily now knows that she is Sir Garrett though she doesn\u2019t remember it.  Princess Fia told her as much.  I believe it to be true but I find that I don\u2019t care.  I love Lily as the affectionate caring young woman she is now.  I still wish for her to be my wife.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile faded from Mazara\u2019s face as she considered what Randy said.  \u201cThis is a disappointing development but not entirely unexpected.  I have some preparations in place.  I am happy to aid your love with Lily.  I meant what I said about being a doting Aunt.  I think that you need to work on that.  I have a potion that will aid to that end.  It will help reinforce the Lily personality.  As for Fia I am afraid that I must go to the King on that score but I don\u2019t see why a memory wipe would bother him.  I really think we can solve this in short order.\u201d  Mazara left the room to return with a potion for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo I have to be the one that drugs her?  I hate to be the one that does it.\u201d  Randy asked hesitant to get his hands dirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know the things we do for love.  Yes the potion has a limited duration.  So as close to copulation is best.  Might I suggest a glass of wine.  I think it best to do this quickly so why don\u2019t you visit her in her room right now.  Just tell her that I went out.  It is the truth as I must away to the King to discuss developments.\u201d  Mazara got up and bid him good luck on his task.          </span></div></div>",

The sensitivity in her body must be one of the effects of the curse.  She focused on the thought of defeating whatever dark force laid in the swamp.  Sir Garrett and Albert travelled only to edge of the outskirts of the swamps at a crossroad before the sun began to hang low in the sky.  Sir Garrett decided to have them camp down for the night.  She wanted to be well rested for the task ahead.  With a bit of effort, she swung her leg over Thunder and dropped to the ground.  She grabbed her breasts to settle them from the bouncing.  A shiver of pleasure cascaded down her spine.

Large draft horses pulling a covered wagon with an elderly man driving them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert looked to Sir Garrett who nodded acceptance.  Albert responded, \u201cYou are welcome to join us.  My name is Albert and this is Olivia.  We are just setting up if you have some fresh provisions we would be happy to purchase from you to fix a meal to share.\u201d  Sir Garrett whispered to Albert to take the lead so no one might find out about her condition.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat brings a cute couple such as yourselves out here?  A young couple eloping because your parents don\u2019t understand.  No fear I will say nothing, I believe in love nothing greater.  It\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t wish to tell me I tend to prattle on if people are about.  Normally, I only have my horses to talk to so please have patience with me.  You look honest enough so feel free to look through my wears and if you like something I am sure we can come to an equitable agreement.

A bunch of wooden chests filled the wagon with clothes of all types hanging from one end to the other. She soon found the food and put it in the pot Albert set up over the fire.  She walked over to her saddle fishing out spices to add to the simmering pot.  Sir Garrett often cooked as a squire for other knights of the silver griffin.  She prided her ability to make a fair meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert wanting to avoid talking about himself and Sir Garrett asked, \u201cSo what sort of items do you have in your wagon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerald gave a wicked grin to Albert looking to see that the young woman tended the stew before whispering, \u201cI have an amulet that will make any who you desire fall for you.\u201d  He then said louder, \u201cMy collection has dresses that will fit your female friend better than what she has now.

The cursed amulet did draw the one you desired to you.  The problem is that your masculinity fueled it at a high cost.  Once consummated it worked in earnest leaving a woman with a strong desire for men.  Gerald guessed that an urge for what they lost drove this.  Perfect for a brothel he planned to sell her too.  He started as soon as he discovered the properties of the item.  A quite useful side money maker.  He received a warm welcome from many a Madam knowing they would soon receive an eager worker.  The magic also ensured a pretty young woman.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerald blew sleeping powder on the pair.  Now he could trust that neither would awaken while he got Albert to his wagon.  A shame about the other woman but she would not be easy to control like Albert.  A suggestible fugue would rule over Albert for a few days, after that they easily fell into their new life.  The new life provided men and employment with a roof over their head.  Not a bad life Gerald left them with.  He thought about keeping one for himself but his greed combined with his desire to roam got in the way.  The women left behind remembered a night of passion waking to find themselves abandoned.  Hurt, upset, mad they pursued a man that no longer existed never thinking of Gerald.

Purchasing brushes, perfumes and scented oils his grooming took new levels.  Prancing about in his lingerie desiring to be worthy of it.  Drawing sheer stockings up his smooth legs.  Styling his hair as the ladies of court would.  A traveling dress for the journey home.  The thought of all the shops in the capital exciting him.  Selling off his armor getting him enough for a carriage ride home.  He hated the thought of mussing his dress.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert sent word to those he might receive help from.

He always did best when he worked from a peaceful place, but his mind was out of sorts with the anticipation of marrying the Princess. Riding became a form of meditation when you did it as often as a knight. It felt good to have his piece of mind back because he saw an ogre lumbering out of the woods drawing his travels to a halt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHot drool spilled from the fat lips of the ten foot monster. It paused as it realized it was no longer the sole ruler of the road and rage filled it as the realization of that dawned. The ogre\u2019s feet pounded the ground as it charged the paladin sitting on his mount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder\u2019s years of training were showing as the only indication it took notice of the ogre\u2019s charge was a snort of eager anticipation. He didn\u2019t have long to wait for Sir Garrett had grabbed a lance and set it within moments of the sighting of the ogre. With only a tap of the knight\u2019s foot the horse launched forward with a speed that seemed to ignore the rider and armor on its back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ogre wasn\u2019t prepared for the laws of physics which had always been on its side to betray it so thoroughly. A lance coming at you from a steed charging at thirty miles per hour is not helpful to the survival of a living creature especially when it hits you in the throat. Sir Garrett removed the lance but found it was bent and he didn\u2019t feel he had the time to stop and get it repaired. As it was removing an ogre from the road and covering the body took several hours of thankless work. No one besides Sir Garrett and his steed would likely know a rampaging ogre\u2019s life had been ended with a bent lance to mark the grave, and honestly thinking of the families that would never know the loss he had ever experienced was all the thanks he needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett had reached a crossroads where he would have to decide how he wanted to proceed. The map showed a small trail that he could use to take Thunder with him. He could contact the local lizard people for help or information, and finally he could take the direct path by himself through the swamp sending his horse back to the order\u2019s monastery. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It would be foolish to go without his longtime companion Thunder. Thunder grew more alert as they entered the dense canopy of the swamp and Sir Garrett matched the war horse's roving senses with his own to spot any danger a few seconds earlier which in combat could be the difference between bumps and bruises and mortal wounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small camp fire came into view after an hour of riding. The light of it was easy to spot from a long way off and for a second Sir Garrett considered trying to sneak up to it but whoever was there wasn't afraid of the dangers of the swamp, and hopefully he had an ally to provide further light against the darkness. As he drew closer he saw a figure in the light stirring a pot of something that smelled wonderful to the travel weary paladin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome traveler\", an old woman looked up from her cooking. \"Care to take part of my stew. I always make too much because it is so hard to judge cooking for one even after all these years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps in a minute, I have to see to my horse first,\" Sir Garrett responded. \"What are doing living in the middle of this dark swamp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came here long ago to study ancient civilizations, and the years have gotten away from me,\" the old woman explained. \"I have grown powerful in knowledge, but poor in society. I am not sure it was worth the trade off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any idea what dangers threaten the kingdom?\" Sir Garrett continued to rub down Thunder as he munched away on his feed bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Dark Queen used to rule this area with her necromancy until the Grand Druid Leaf Walker sacrificed herself to call the land to swallow the dark capital, but legend claims the Dark Queen wrapped herself in life draining magic until she could break free of the Grand Druid's spell. If the Queen is breaking free it is best to strike before she can consolidate her power. Now, please have some stew and rest before taking on such a grand task.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the information. I think . . .\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He decided it was best to accept the woman\u2019s kindness especially because enjoying a warm meal while you were traveling without all the work involved in it was always an easy decision. The paladin lifted the spoon to his mouth and took a large swallow and was surprised by the wonderful flavor he encountered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a hearty vegetable stew with my fine herbs for wonderful flavors. Sir Garrett wondered if the vegetables were freshly picked, and decided he would ask the woman in a minute, but for the moment he was enjoying the crackle of the fire and the feeling of a full stomach. His eyes felt heavy as the heat from the fire seemed to call him to slumber but he fought against it because it would be rude to pass out before thanking his host properly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have great stamina to have remained awake for this long young warrior,\u201d a sinister look began to appear on the face of the woman. \u201cI am afraid it will do you no good, because you have already had too much of my magical stew. Do not worry, because I have no intention of killing you. You have too much value, but you are too dangerous as you are currently.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRage filled the paladin at the trick. He wasn\u2019t angry with himself but with her for the betrayal of the trust he placed in her. How many others had fallen for this trap? How many more would fall into it if he didn\u2019t stop this evil magic user? Sir Garrett stumbled to his feet and drew his blade as he moved towards the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear took hold of her face as she realized she was no longer in control of the situation. Her body started to make the motions to run from the enraged warrior before her, but the paladin allowed gravity to speed his movements and fell forward stabbing the woman in the foot ending thoughts of escape as the pain took hold of her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, I can give you an antidote to the stews effects,\u201d the woman pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett would have liked to take her at her word but she had already proven to be untrustworthy, and slumber was beginning to take hold of his mind despite his best efforts. He focused himself for what he felt he must do and a swift and powerful motion he pulled the sword from her foot and severed his enemies head from her shoulder, and collapsed next to her body wondering what other effects the stew would have upon his body by the time he woke up, if there were any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paladin woke to the feeling of his horse nudging him. He checked himself but didn\u2019t feel any different. Had the corpse on ground been lying when she said he would be transformed or was it just delayed? It could be she had planned to add something while he slept that would have caused the transformation. The question was if he should search the magic user\u2019s home for an antidote just in case though he would be risking whatever traps she had set in her home, or risk himself being transformed down his journey at who knows what point and facing what dangers. It was a tough decision and not one he was looking forward to making though it must be done soon, because he had a quest to finish for the King, so he might win the hand of the Princess he loved in marriage.  </span></div></div>",

He thought about burning the house to ash but decided against it, because if something started to happen to him it might be best to take the risk of entering the lair of the slain spell caster. <br>\r\nIf what the woman had told him about the swamp was true he would have to be more careful of strangers in the area in the future. There always seemed to be servants of ancient evils lurking about trying to bring them back to power the paladin thought glumly. The sky seemed to reflect his mood as they rumbled and darkened indicating a storm may be setting in soon, but with no shelter in sight it was simplest to continue and not worry about what the future held for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t want to think about marrying Princess Fina until the day of the ceremony arrived. Sir Garrett suspected the King had sent him on this mission to end his life in the kingdom. He suspected King Emeril of desiring one of his rich noble neighbors for a future bride for his daughter especially since Sir Garrett belonged to the order of the Silver Griffin who had several times thwarted the attempts of the king to gouge his people on taxes or other injustices. With the many heroic feats performed by Sir Garrett and his fellow brethren of the Silver Griffin the King didn\u2019t dare directly denying the paladin his daughter\u2019s hand in marriage for fear the people would revolt against him, but if an accident were to happen to him as he was traveling on dangerous quest it would likely not sadden him too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe holy warrior broke free of his dark thoughts as he realized there was movement up ahead of him. He drew his blade and summoned a prayer of protection around him as he waited for whatever creature would be out with the approaching storm in the sky. If it was an ambush it was not likely to be a good one as the rustling in the woods was loud and easy to hear, so who or whatever was making the noise didn\u2019t care if he was aware of the presence or had yet to notice him. </span></div></div>",

It\u2019s white fur shimmered in the sun and the horn glowed with the magical power held inside of it. Thunder dropped his front legs to honor the magical creature and Sir Garrett got off of his mount to do the same. Unicorns had been hunted to near extinction by selfish being seeking the power contained in their horns. It was a poor excuse for taking the life of a living creature that spread goodness and life to the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garret set his sword on the ground in front of him and bowed before the magnificent animal, and the unicorn turned towards him and bowed in return. It was a surprise when he saw the creature was remaining in his path and not leaving the area.

The paladin was expected to take a griffin as his mount in time, and forbidden riding a unicorn despite the great honor it was offering him. Sir Garrett didn\u2019t know the origin of the ban, but he had always intended to respect it. It seemed like such an easy thing to do considering he was never going to meet one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would be of great help in your fight against the forces of evil.

Considering what he had eaten in the past it wasn\u2019t bad just a little strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t introduced myself to you,\u201d the old woman admitted. \u201cMy name is Isabelle what is yours sir knight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir Garrett,\u201d a slight queasiness unsettled Sir Garrett. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind if I bed down for the night here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would hear of nothing else.

If we are going to be working together we need to have you do a better job than this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuscles and bone groaned as weight and size built the paladin larger into an inhuman shape. Hair sprouted across his body as his clothing lost the battle with his new size. It became apparent to Sir Garrett he was transforming into a horse as he saw what used to be a hand leave a hoof print in the soft earth. The final humiliation came as felt his manhood being withdrawn into his body replaced by a moist slit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou make a lovely mare,\u201d Isabelle said. \u201cI think your horse thinks so too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett turned to see Thunder was moving up behind him and years of working with horses had taught him what that look meant.

A fortune in dark magic if you could find the right buyer, a curse to the uninformed who stumbled upon it, and may the gods forbid some master of evil to find the place. He didn\u2019t have enough room on his horse for all the stuff and he didn\u2019t want to leave anything behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett started gathering the brush from the surrounding area. It wasn\u2019t surprising to find so much deadwood. The spellcrafter had drained the place of life leaving only death in her wake. Soon a lifetime of evil will be burned away by her own doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder snorted a complaint as the flames started to burn but relaxed as Sir Garrett returned to join the animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry old friend,\u201d he patted the large warhorse. \u201cThe fire will soon do its work.

Strange streaks of green, purple, and pink filled the air. He didn\u2019t know what to make of what was happening but if some evil came out of there he planned to put an end to it. Sir Garrett drew closer trying to listen closely to the roaring fire to hear if something was moving in the area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was an explosion. Despite the flaring magic of his shield he was sent him flying backward. Fumes poured towards him as he struggled to get to his feet. Thunder raced over ignoring the hazards to assist his master. Garrett clutched onto his companion leading him away from the destruction. The paladin noticed something strange. </span></div></div>",

It was there home and they were likely to want the threat gone as much as the King did so he was hopeful they would be allies against the dangers. He had met the species on several occasion and they had always been honorable with him. Lizardmen were often recruited by powerful monsters to serve as an army under threat of death or destruction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe village he was looking for was at the edge of the swamp and one of the largest communities of lizard men he knew of. To his surprise, he saw a small wooden barricade had been erected around the village. Several of the lizard men stepped forward with drawn blades at his approach so he got off his horse and walked towards them slowly because it looked like they had already encountered the danger of the swamp and it had made them very nervous about strangers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Sir Garrett of the Kingdom of Dar,\u201d the paladin tried to calm the fears of the lizard men. \u201cI have come to do battle with the evil rising in the swamp. I hope you can supply me with information or help in ending the threat to your people and mine.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding in acknowledgment of his words they opened the gate for him and motioned him through. The larger one waved for him to follow and Sir Garrett complied with the request, keeping his eyes open to what was going on in the village. Many he saw were missing limbs or bandaged and for a race that healed quickly, that was very worrisome. He entered a large hut with many herbs and fragrances filling the air. It appeared he had entered the home of the shaman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appeared the shaman was cooking something over the fire, food or a magical formula he wasn\u2019t sure. The shaman was missing one eye and the scales looked like the color had dulled with time. The creature observed the human entering for a couple of moments before turning to the lizard man who seemed to explain why he was here in their native tongue. He waved the large lizard man off after he was done talking and motion for Sir Garrett to sit. Sir Garrett sat as the shaman reached back to pull out a container of herbs that he offered the paladin. The shaman motioned for him to eat the herbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett hesitated because he suspected they had hallucinating qualities to them and he wanted to keep a clear head if he was going to have to fight some sort of monster. He didn\u2019t want to offend the shaman by not taking it, perhaps he could ask for someone to help him translate so he could be clear about what he was saying and why he was denying the request. He would have to decide soon as the shaman was gesturing again. </span></div></div>",

His horse would find the way with easy as it was smarter than many a man he had met over the years. He dreamed of being back in the arms of his dear Princess Fina and take her as his bride. Trudging through the thick swamp made him glad he had sent Thunder back because this was no place for man or beast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heavy armor sank him further into the mud and soft ground than he would have liked but he tried to be as careful with his steps as he could. The paladin was being to question if his future Father-in-law had sent him here to die. There were many people far better suited for swamp travel and fighting then him yet Sir Garrett who had little experience if any experience in the swamp had been the one King Emeril had sent against the evil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he was optimistic in his thoughts it could be that the enemy he faced was one he was good at dispatching but the rumors of what was lurking out here had been very vague. Even rumors usually gave some hint of what sort of dangers were to be faced like if it was magic or mundane but in his rush to complete the quest he hadn\u2019t bothered to ask vital questions. He reached out with a prayer to see if the gods could guide him in this quest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvil filled his senses but that was to be expected considering where he was. A dark empire had been here thousands of years ago and they had filled the ground with blood and sacrifices. Even all of these centuries later the ground was still stained with the evil. Sir Garrett said a prayer for the dead so they might be at rest, it was something he liked to do every time he came near this place in his travels. Perhaps in time, the evil might even fade from the land. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pile of skulls looked promising to him for what he was looking for. He drew his blade and approached the bones with caution for what might be lurking nearby. This could be something old or new and wouldn\u2019t know until he got closer. Some of the lizard people liked to mark their grounds with the bones of their enemies. If the skulls were mostly of lizardmen it would be a mark but if it was a heavy variety of sentient races it was likely old. All were slaves the Empire of the Titans, beings feared even by the gods. The world had been scarred by the battle that ended the reign of those powerful beings. If one of them was the cause of the trouble it would be a problem beyond the ability of a single paladin to stop. He shuddered at the thought as he approached the marker. </span></div></div>",

The woman spotted him and fell to her knees in thanks to the gods for bringing help to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My town is being attacked by giants,\" the woman pleaded. \"We need your help Sir Knight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett wanted to comfort the woman but he felt awkward with people. His training and duty left him with little time to socialize much less make friends. When he came on scene people were usually at their worst, desperate with fear or anger at the losses that had occurred to them. Sir Garrett avoided comforting people because it was easier and simpler for him to resolve the problem at hand than try to use skills he had never learned. With that thought in mind Sir Garrett spurred Thunder to a gallop and headed in the direction the woman had come from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long to reach the town in question and spotting the twelve to fifteen foot giants was certainly easy. Three giants encircled the town laughing as they toyed with the villagers while a female giant with the garments of a priestess watched in what appeared to be disapproval on a nearby hill. Sir Garrett didn't take time to contemplate things as he drew a lance and launched Thunder into full speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first giant didn't realize the paladin was present until he felt the sting of a lance sending him sprawling to the ground. Pain and disorientation froze the giant as the hero spun his horse and charged and used to end the threat the giant posed. To his delight the other two attacking giants roared in outrage and charged for him which left the villagers with the opportunity to escape. Sir Garrett as he charged with his third and final lance at the closer giant who left himself open in order to strike the puny human struck the behemoth in the heart but not before the giant struck back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paladin was launch through the air by the dying giant\u2019s club. There was no soft landing as Sir Garrett crashed through a roof and floor before having the root cellar\u2019s hard dirt floor break his fall. Time to heal was not a luxury that Sir Garrett had, so with his remaining strength he call upon the god Rabin, god of justice and good to heal him. The warm energy flowed through him allowing him to once again take the field of battle once more. <br>\r\nA search for the giant slayer was underway by the final attacking giant. It muttered curses and threats in giant as it pursued the human who had slain its companions, and to the giant\u2019s shock the human ran from the building where it had land and darted between the giant\u2019s legs and with both hands swung his sword cleaving the Achilles tendon causing the giant to collapse to the paved town streets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI curse you armored fool,\u201d the giant bellowed in common. \u201cI will your villages crushed beneath my feet you insect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNot in your lifetime,\u201d Sir Garrett slashed the giant\u2019s falling fist as he leapt aside from the threat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrecision slices from the master swordsman slew the giant but it was a slow painful work. As the giant succumbed to his wounds Sir Garrett whistled for the Thunder as he prepared to check out the last giant. With reluctance Sir Garrett rode towards the last giant realizing he was about at the end of what his strength and skills would allow him to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess was attractive with gray skin like the stone they claim to be carved from. Her body was shapely and the dress she wore clung to her curves in an appealing manner. To the delight of the weary paladin she made no hostile movement and instead stared at the warrior with fascination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have the spirit of the titans,\u201d She said with admiration. \u201cI need your aid to take the giants from the clutches of my uncle dark rule.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am afraid I have a quest I am on already,\u201d Sir Garrett responded.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If it was some sort of geas upon him and what it would involve, but he found the spell had actually had another purpose. The buildings and people around him started to shrink as he grew to the size of the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have you done to me?\u201d Sir Garrett bellowed at the giantess as he saw his horse was now a tiny figure at his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Lady Brana,\u201d she looked him in the eyes. \u201cI promise to undue what I have done to you but I am desperate for help.

He was thankful his equipment and weapons had grown with him because the equipment of the giants was unfamiliar to him. He had to admit the figure of Lady Brana was pleasing to the eye to look at as she walked ahead of him, but he wanted to be back in the capital with Princess Fina as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA terrible fomorian has come from beneath the earth and is calling on the giants of frost to make war so they can have a kingdom of their own,\u201d Lady Brana told him of the dangers. \u201cHe has dark magic he can call upon that has inspired many in the kingdom to follow him. If you were to challenge him to combat and defeat him his evil would soon leave the kingdom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI fear it is not as simple as that,\u201d Sir Garrett responded. \u201cHe may not accept my challenge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned and looked offended, \u201cHe is a giant in the lands of the frozen tundra. He would be honor bound to accept any challenge made to him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paladin loved honorable combat, but he had experienced enough in his travels to know not all felt the same way as this woman. The fomorian were an evil group of giants who would give much to gain victory over an enemy even if it wasn\u2019t honorable, and who knew what evil entity this creature had bound himself to in order to gain his dark magic. Sir Garrett had fought a fomorian before and many in his group had not long survived the encounter. The dark giants loved curses and often attached death curses to themselves as a last spite against the world. He was not looking forward to facing the creature alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe fomorian do not believe in honor like the giants of ice do,\u201d Sir Garrett explained. \u201cHe will likely try to appoint a champion to fight for him at first, most likely the greatest warrior around who he will have bound to obey him like a slave. If I am victorious he will try to use his evil magic against me in some form or fashion to remain in your lands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe has promised that he respects our ways, surely he won\u2019t betray that trust!?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have yet to hear of a fomorian who wouldn\u2019t betray anything if it got them what they wanted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face looked troubled by this news but their was little he could tell her that would comfort her that would be the truth. Sir Garrett was by no means certain of victory against this monster but he would fight him with everything he could. If this foul creature could gather an army of frost giants thousands could die if he did nothing. He wished he could summon help to assist him but he doubted help would come in time because the longer they waited to stop the fomorian the longer he would have to bind the other giants to his will. </span></div></div>",

It had been a terror to the people of the north with a fearsome appetite for the flesh of frost giants. She remembered shuddering at the tales her Grandmother would tell her, it had been a long time before she could stop herself from racing to obey the commands of her parents when they warned her the Queen of Ice would come for her if she failed to do as they ordered. She had eventually come to the mind that it was a legend from long in the past, but this human was telling her there was a great deal of truth to the legend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou would free my people by having them killed!?!\u201d Brana asked, the fury starting to rise in her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will make a deal with the creature,\u201d Sir Garrett explained. \u201cShe was trapped by my order over a thousand years ago. She may even be dead, but a dragon with that much power doesn\u2019t die quietly in a cave. If she is dead we can collect from her treasury enough money to pay several armies to free your people from the danger they are facing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still very frightened by the idea of the Queen of Ice being freed but she nodded her acceptance of the idea. They could at least look to see what had happened to that creature of legend. She wondered about the treasure the creature had collected over the centuries. It might be possible to collect some long lost artifacts of her people from the dragon\u2019s treasure. If she did it would make her a hero of her people, but dark thoughts enter her head as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen of Ice was an easy target on paper but the truth was likely to be far different. This creature probably had the intelligence and cunning of centuries and dragons were known to grow stronger with age, not weaker. What secrets of magic lurked within the lair of this legendary monster, only the confidence of the paladin helped to calm her fears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was handsome for a human, and he was much kinder and more gentle than the male frost giants she had known who only seemed to be concerned with their battle prowess and not what the good they could do with it. Sir Garrett often talked about the good he wanted to do for his people, and the peaceful future he was working towards. She was afraid she was starting to like him more than she should.   </span></div></div>",

Perhaps you need to find a woman who shares your interest in combating the forces of evil.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe is a lovely woman who sees the beauty in things and hopes for better for the future. She is playful though a little impulsive at times. Fina knows her mind and is difficult to argue against. She has great plans for the Kingdom, and she wants me to be a part of them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frost giant had a little regret asking about the princess because it looked like the paladin was in love with the woman, but she decided it was a foolish and blind love. He needed someone who could travel with him and take more of a hands-on approach to making the world a better place. She would have to think of some way to convince him that he needed to look somewhere else for love. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is good to see you have love,\u201d Brana said after a few minutes of thought. \u201cIt is something I think most beings look for and I hope to have myself one day. The night grows late and we should get some sleep become we have to get up in the morning and go to face the Queen of Ice. We should be at our best when we face a legend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett nodded and curled up on the ground wondering what sort of challenges they would face the next day. He was aware of the location of the feared dragon, but he had little idea of how it was guarded or what bound the dragon to the location. He didn\u2019t want to fail because he was starting to care about Brana and by extension her people. Maybe they could be allies one day. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brana had awakened before Sir Garrett and investigated the spot where she had been the entrance was and started to work on clearing the entrance. Things would be simpler if Princess Fina was a frost giant as well. She could declare her attentions for Sir Garrett and fight her in a form of combat that the Princess chose. Brana was certain she could best the pampered Princess in any challenge the spoiled royal could come up with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking up some sweat felt good and helped relax her mind. A thought came to mind and she came up with a plan on how to win the heart of the paladin. She had made him a giant, why couldn\u2019t she transform into a human when this quest was completed so she could challenge the Princess. It would be unfair to transform the untrained girl into a frost giant to face her so she would take on the awkward form of a human girl to face Princess Fina and still win and earn the even greater honor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are doing some fine work,\u201d Sir Garrett walked up and started moving stones aside. \u201cYou could have woke me up to come help with this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at him, \u201cI know but I am a hard worker and I have already burdened you with so much during this quest, this is the least I could do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about burdening me with this quest because it is a worthy one. Perhaps we will be able to form an alliance between your people and mine.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blush formed on her cheeks as she thought about forming a marriage alliance with him for the good of her people. It made her happy but she shook the thought from her head and got back to work. She wanted to challenge this Princess properly and not just earn his love through the political goals for the future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stopped in their work when they formed a small hole, well small hole for a frost Giant for them to crawl through. Sir Garrett drew his blade and crawled through first but followed closely by Brana who lit the room with a bright white orb that floated in front of them lighting the path. A dull glow of red showed in the many arcane symbols carved into the icy walls indicating magic still worked to entrapped the monster they were about to face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tunnel opened into a gigantic chamber with a large pit in the center of the room filled with golden treasure though more than a small portion of it was covered by a white dragon of legendary size. Shallow breathing could be seen as the chest expanded and shrank as the creature seemed to take little notice of their presence but Sir Garrett wasn\u2019t taking any chances and lifted his shield up into a protective position and slapped his blade against the shield creating an echoing sound through the chamber. An eyelid lifted slowly revealing a glowing white orb that eyed the intruders to its chamber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you come to try and kill me?\u201d the Queen of Ice asked. There was no fear in the voice, only a sense of boredom. \u201cEven in my starved state, I am more than a match for a couple of frost giant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have come to bargain with you wyrm,\u201d Sir Garrett tried to say with confidence. He could feel Brana\u2019s fear drawn from generations of death this creature had inflicted on her people but she managed to contain it to a slight shudder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head of the monster lifted as interest began to fill the dragon, \u201cWhat would you have me do to earn my freedom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrana called out, \u201cI wish you to slay the foul Fomorian who is corrupting my people, do we have a deal?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughter shook the chamber as the beast chuckled at the words of the frost giant. Shards of glass shattered as they hit the floor before a fearsome grin formed on the face of the monster. Sir Garrett wasn\u2019t sure what to make of the creature\u2019s amusement. It had no doubt heard of the evil giant race but what did it think of them? Dragons generally hated giants but maybe it was different for this dragon. He doubted it was afraid because few things scared a dragon of this size the only thing they generally feared was a larger dragon. </span></div></div>",

The paladin decided to test the monster to see if it was serious about what it was saying and make it take a sacred oath on its treasure. Few dragons, even those of the evilest nature would break an oath taken upon their hoard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will not attack the people of the north including the frost giants,\u201d Sir Garrett spoke up. \u201cSwear upon your hoard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am willing if the condition that I have the right to defend myself if I am attacked,\u201d the Queen of Ice responded. \u201cIt is no great sacrifice as humans are too small to be satisfying and frost giants have a terrible aftertaste to them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrana started to protest the taste of frost giants but Sir Garrett waved her down because it seemed like they had gotten what they wanted, there was no need to argue. He suspected the dragon was having some fun at the expense of the Frost Giant. She hesitated a moment but saw the wisdom of holding back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d Sir Garrett answered. \u201cWhy are you so willing to make a deal with us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRevenge is almost as delicious as a treasure to a dragon. Your order deals with holy magic, surely you have noticed the arcane and foul nature of the magic that binds me. This Fomorian may not be the one who has done this to me but I plan for it to be the first of many I devour. The extinction of the race is my next goal in life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is suicidal. They are too many and too powerful for any creature to stand against them,\u201d Brana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor a giant-sized creature you have small ideas,\u201d the dragon retorted. \u201cThey are their own worst enemies. I will be hired to kill many of them before they even realize what is going on and I shall take in treasure that will make what I have like a pittance. The treasure can fund the destruction of the rest of the disgusting creature. It is a simple plan but with my power, it will be most effective.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t say I agree with your motives but I applaud your cause,\u201d Sir Garrett encouraged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho am I to deny you the honor of dying in combat,\u201d Brana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow very kind of you but I intend to make others do the dying so start breaking these enchantments so I can get started,\u201d the Queen of Ice demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett and Brana started their work and debated about how to approach attacking the Fomorian. Thankfully, the work was easy as the enchantment\u2019s powers had faded over the years so they had plenty of time to talk.</span></div></div>",

She hoped she could convince her people to avoid the dragon but the frost giants were always looking for strong opponents to face. The bargain they had made with it was of no great burden on it because her people would happily attack it so they could face an honorable death. She wondered how many of her people would soon be trophies themselves but at least it would be a death of their choosing instead of death as slaves to the Fomorian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is likely you will be made to face the best of my people,\u201dBrana's face showed great concern as she warned the paladin. \u201cHe will likely be enhanced with the dark magic of the Fomorian, I don\u2019t know if you can win and I don\u2019t know if the fight will stop even with the arrival of the dragon. Frost Giants believe strongly in ritual combat and once started, if it is a battle to the death, it will not end until one of you is dead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I will just have to win,\u201d Sir Garrett gave her a warm smile. \u201cWhat shall I challenge them about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will have to be something that challenges the authority of Narzoc, he will likely sense it is a trap but if it is something important he will have to step into it even if he sees the danger you present. You could go for the leadership of the tribe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it would be better if I challenged for your hand in marriage, it would draw a lot more attention to have an outsider to come seeking the hand of a frost giant than one of an endless stream of challengers seeking power. What do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would be okay with you marrying me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paladin could spy the village just ahead so didn\u2019t really hear her words or see the look on her face. She was very pleased with the thought of marrying him, she knew he had a fiancee and his intention was to marry that would but he was a man of honor, if the marriage happened he would be devoted to it and she would show him that he made the right choice. She quickly brushed aside the idea of tricking him into marrying her, it would go against her honor, she wouldn\u2019t want him that way, but she didn\u2019t know how hard she would fight if they were pushed in the direction of marriage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho dares to come to try and enter the village of Frosted Meadows?\u201d a frost giant carrying an intricately designed war hammer stepped towards them when they drew close to the entrance of the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Sir Garrett of the Order of the Silver Griffin and I have come to take up Brana\u2019s hand in marriage,\u201d Sir Garrett lifted Brana\u2019s hand and held it tight. \u201cShe wishes for the Chieftain of your tribe to perform the marriage ceremony.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sneer on the face of the man was instantaneous, \u201cSilver Griffin, that means that you are a human! There is no way we can allow this to stand, Narzoc will have something to say about this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will challenge him and anyone else who dares to deny the love I have for her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore Frost Giants were gathering as his words reached them and most importantly the Fomorian made his appearance. The creature hobbled along clutching a staff with both hands but the paladin knew it was an act, if he were truly that weak he would have been killed long ago. It had hideous purple skin covered in warts and moles, the telltale sign of the Fomorian an oversized yellow eye kept a close watch on the holy warrior, a look filled with hate. These dark creatures knew an enemy when they saw one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo a foul human seeks to pervert the noble lineage of the frost giants, let\u2019s see how strong your love truly is,\u201d Narzoc pointed a gnarled and twisted finger at Sir Garrett.</span></div></div>",

A dark plan had come to the evil creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am fine with you marrying her,\u201d his hand waved the cries of protest to silence. \u201cIf you can beat a champion of my choosing. Said champion will take her hand should you lose.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuy time and keep him busy, Sir Garrett reminded himself, \u201cI would see this champion first because I have heard of the deceptions of the Fomorian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCertainly, I have always kept my word to this noble tribe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe motioned and a giant stepped from the crowd. Brana winced at the appearance of the frost giant. It was clear he was small by frost giant standards and his face looked malformed by something other than combat. The leer on his face was clear as his eyes never her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRunark shall fight you,\u201d Narzoc smile. \u201cHe looks forward to your wedding night Brana. He has been most explicit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI shall fight him,\u201d Sir Garrett\u2019s eyes searched the sky but he could still see nothing. How long did a frost giant wedding last? Because he felt he would make short work of his opponent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA circle started to form as they prepared for battle. They might not be happy about their princess marrying the lodge\u2019s shaman but it was no reason to not enjoy a fight. Betting was heavy with even the Fomorian not missing the chance to place a bet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou appear to be under an enchantment,\u201d Narzoc quickly cast his magic. \u201cWe do want this to be a fair fight.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paladin was dwarfed by the giants a moment later. Even his opponent was nearly three times his size now. Many of the frost giants roared in protest at the Fomorian changing the odds but the monster just laughed at them. He would be pleased with taking their money but Sir Garrett had no intention of giving up this fight. The holy warrior was determined to make his enemy lose a fortune though he wouldn\u2019t be sad if the white dragon arrived before than. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady to die little man?\u201d Runark bellowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can do this,\u201d Brana took off her coin pouch. \u201cSir Garrett to win.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would hate to lose your money,\u201d he smiled warmly at her before dropping his faceplate down. \u201cGuess I am going to have to win.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett prayed, calling upon the gods and they answered him. They were always up for a good fight and he started to glow with their blessing. The crowd roared their approval as he charged forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunark swung his mighty hammer but his accuracy was off by a hair\u2019s breadth. The shock wave sent the paladin into the air. He slashed with divine power to enhance his strike. There was a terrible cry of pain as it cut through to the bone. The arm would be nearly useless but there was no way he was stopping there.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stomp of the foot or a smash could still very easily end him. Sir Garrett charged forward to stab his shield into the foot of his opponent giving the frost giant more to worry about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will crush you!\u201d Runark howled as he danced around trying to crush the paladin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was dangerous around the feet but it was awkward for the frost giant to see him. He slashed carefully because if his blade got stuck he was likely doomed. A few good cuts and a giant could no longer support the massive amount of weight. His chance came as the thick boot came apart. With both feet firmly planted he lunged forward severing the precious tendon. Sir Garrett pulled back from the flailing giant and allowed himself a moment to breathe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant struggled to regain himself but the holy warrior wasn\u2019t about to let that happen. As Runark sat up his gaze came upon Sir Garrett flying through the air towards him. A gush of blood came from the throat from the fatal wound an instant later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir Garrett is the winner!\u201d Brana cheered and many of the other frost giants joined their voices to her. More than a few were happy to have a victory over the Fomorian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sour look had formed on Narzoc\u2019s face though it was hard to tell on the hideous features. He was certain to not let this loss last for wrong. Sir Garrett hoped the dragon would arrive before he had to face a dozen frost giants and in angry Fomorian. </span></div></div>",

He wanted to tell her this was an order from his King but he had never seen a giant look so vulnerable. Perhaps he did have the time to assist her. Improving relations with the frost giants would improve things in the north of the kingdom and if they could get a peace treaty he knew of a lot of communities that would thank him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know how much pride your people have so I know how grand a gesture this is,\u201d Sir Garrett motioned for her to stand. \u201cI will go with you and assist you in whatever way I can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer warm smile made him happy with his choice though he was certain he was likely to regret it later. Frost Giants were powerful warriors who lived for combat and he was less than half their size. A duel with one was likely to be foolish and a battle with more than one became far more dangerous for his health but he did have a few advantages against them. They were arrogant, and would likely underestimate one of his size. Frost giants had rarely encountered knights in armor on a horse so they would be unfamiliar with his style of combat or how deadly the lance could be against them, most would think it was a sharpened stick and laugh at his efforts with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think I can challenge your Uncle to a duel and be done with this with as little bloodshed as possible?\u201d Sir Garrett asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt might be, my Uncle is a coward who hides behind his champion Bruga,\u201d Brana explained. \u201cHe plans to marry me to the brute in exchange for his loyalty but like most of my people, he views humans as weak. He might be willing to fight you to inspire the others to march on your Kingdom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you are right. Things are likely to go very bad if you are wrong. Let\u2019s get started because we have a lot of road ahead of us if your land is where I think it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe live far to the north on the Spiky Peaks Iceberg.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe news got better and better, the place she spoke of was a fortress in the middle of a patch of icy deadly waters. Her clan was known for the ruthless raiders they produced who made life miserable for many a shipping merchant. Sir Garrett had given his word so he was still going to help her but it didn\u2019t make him happy that he was going even further away from the swamps he was supposed to be investigating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat path would you like to take Brana?\u201d Sir Garrett asked. \u201cYou know the path to your home much better than me.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Most giants liked to intimidate those who were smaller than them but she was dealing with him honestly. If he ended up helping her, it was going to take a lot more time because her people were north and he was heading south. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Sir Garrett, who do I have the honor of addressing?\u201d Garrett asked the frost giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrana, high priestess of the Icy Peaks Man Slayers,\u201d Brana answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garrett frowned at the words because the clan had ravaged and destroyed many places along the northern kingdom of Dar but maybe if she was in charge she could change that. He waved goodbye to her and set about continuing his quest for the King. Perhaps he would find there was nothing wrong in the swamps and be able to help her shortly but he doubted it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was growing intense on his metal armor but he pressed on, feeling a new urgency to complete the task. Trees started to grow thicker as he closed the distance to the swamp. He came to the top of a hill and looked over the expanse of the Dread Swamp. The land had reclaimed all of the city that had once been there. Greenery had covered the ruins so only the occasional lump could be seen in the sea of green. Many an adventurer went in to seek their fortune from the remnants of the ancient kingdom but Sir Garrett had heard of few ever returning from the location. Like many places rumored to have a great treasure there was was more death than treasure but the deaths only seemed to grow the legends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast Hope was at the bottom of the hill just before the swamps began in earnest. It was a place where many dangerous beings met to trade. It would be a good place to stop to get the information he needed but his presence was certain to not be welcomed by the residents. He wondered when the last warrior for justice had been here and if they left alive. </span></div></div>",

It would also make travel to the dread swamp faster and certainly safer. The trick would be capturing the animal without causing it harm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGriffins were intelligent animals whose talons and swift flight on eagle wings made them apex predators few people with any sense had any contact with. Training for the animals was a long and difficult process that often took years, and was usually hopeless if it wasn\u2019t raised from a young age by experienced trainers. Thankfully, Sir Garrett could call upon his connection with the heavens to bond him with an adult animal and make it his sacred mount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder had been his sacred mount since he had taken his vows, so it wouldn\u2019t be easy to leave a friend and companion behind who had served him faithfully for years. It felt a bit like a betrayal but Sir Garrett told himself it would allow the horse a retirement to a life of ease and stud service. Sir Garrett smiled at the last thought and wondered if he would be able to retire from being a paladin. It was likely there would always be a mission beckoning him to do good in the world, and Sir Garrett said a small prayer Princess Fina and any children he had would have years of his company before the forces of darkness ended his fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMount Titan was a known roust for griffins, so it was here Sir Garrett had headed in his quest. As the noble warrior reached the base of the mountain he sent Thunder home while saying a small prayer for his safety for griffins had a taste for horse flesh.  There seemed to be two trails up the mountain. The first was larger and likely been built by worshippers of the titans who been locked away by the gods long ago, and the second was a smaller perilous trail which was likely used by locals to collect bird eggs. Finally, Sir Garrett had brought mountain climbing equipment which he could use to scale the mountain directly. It didn\u2019t take long for the paladin to decide what path to use.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had climbed many trees as a child but falling from ten feet and falling from over a hundred were very different things. The sound of falling stones could be heard clattering against other rocks, mostly they were smaller but a few were more than large enough to crush a man even one in metal armor. The people that worked the mountain truly earned their keep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came around the bend in the trail to discover a small group of guards stepped forward into his path.

But then again, that was something to be expected, right? Sir Garret suddenly realized he was being far, far too foolish, especially against a man he realized meant him no harm and was being particularly friendly and welcoming. The knight blinked a few times before sliding his sword back into it's scabbard and pulled himself out of his combat stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, was that so hard?\" The man's voice was normal again as he lowered his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies, friend\" Garret said, and he truly meant it, \"My training and the urgency of my quest have left me on edge. I respect your own duties, but I simply must get through!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man frowned for a moment and Garret felt the tension rise once more, before his potential foe smiled and waved his hands to either side of him, his men immediately releasing their grips on their own swords and backing away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, if a knight requests it, so shall it be done! Take heed, however, the path is quite treacherous. Allow me to escort you through the sections of trail we have already cleared out.\" The man raised his hand again. \"My I have your name, friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man's invitation seemed quite civil, and Garret felt no ill-intent behind the words. After all, this man had done nothing to present himself as anything other than friendly. Sir Garret nodded and made his way across the short distance separating him from the group of men, reaching them in moments and extending his armored hand towards the speaker. \"My name is Sir Garret, might I have yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man's hand remained raised as he brought his other up to shake Garret's hand, \"You don't need me to tell you my name, we've been friends for years! Now come, let us journey together, and let me keep you safe before that fool head of yours gets you into trouble\" Again the man's voice shifted and wavered in tone and pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garret blinked a few more times before he felt himself nodding. Of course, this man was a dear friend of his from the heady days of youth, when they'd been but boys in the training yard! A name floated out of the sudden fog that he felt on his mind, Longhack. It was a name the man had earned from the other boys during sword training, Longhack had, on his first try, cut a training dummy in two with a longsword. Oh, Garret felt like such an idiot for forgetting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was just the altitude and the weather, but Garret, even in the company of his old friend, couldn't help feeling overly befuddled at the current chain of events, like the fog in his mind was growing denser with each passing moment. It would be an ill-fitting end to his story if he should take a stray step and end up falling to his death. He nodded to Longhack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, old friend, lead the way.

Little did he know that the man he knew as 'Longhack' was a mage, and a criminal, using ancient magic to twist Garret's mind and memories to his liking whenever the knight asked a inconvenient question or stumbled too close to the truth. And the name Longhack itself was nothing more than an alias, the mage knew far too well that knowing someone's true name gave you absolute power over them. It was tempting to just transform the knight into a busty, addle-brain wench and give her to the hired swords, but then again, someone might have been expecting the knight or would notice him missing. Better to just let him pass and dodge the paladin's questions as best as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the mage's last use of magic had worked well enough to solve any further problems, making Garret confused and air-headed and playing it off as ill-adjustment to high altitude. The questions about why the mage and his hired swords were here stopped, and instead the questions had fallen towards things that were easy enough to answer with lies. How was 'Longhack's family, did he have a woman waiting for him, any children, where was he living, all things that could be explained away with falsehoods. And before long, the two men had reached the far side of the pass, Garret looking at the path below with some trepidation as he suddenly couldn't remember why he was there in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Longhack, friend, can you remind me why I was here, again?\" Garret asked as the mage stepped up beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large part of the mage felt like telling Garret another lie, or forcing him to stay and become part of the mage's small army. The work here was incomplete...Or simply tell the knight that he was, in reality, simply a loving little slave girl. Or just keep the knight entirely confused and let him wander through the world, most likely to a quick and messy end. Or perhaps BE the quick and messy end by pushing the knight from the path and down the mountain. It'd be a believable fate, a knight in armor in rugged terrain falling to his untimely death. But again, the knight might be missed, and the work here on the mountain could not be disturbed. Perhaps he should just release Sir Garret from his spells and let him be on his way...With a convenient charm to forget that the mage was ever here, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mage was forced to answer as Garret's brow furrowed in the silence.

And as Garret's mind retreated, so too did his body. Instead of a knight with an impressive human physique, a stunning jawline and rugged good looks that had made a princess fall for him, now there was simply an eight foot tall behemoth, rippling almost obscenely with muscles from the stubby, off-color ugly head to the bare toes. Any hint that this had once been Garret was gone. The knight's face had been twisted beyond recognition, stretched and flattened against a much larger skull as dim, dark eyes stared out from beneath a enlarged brow. An upturned, stump like nose sat above a slightly ajar mouth that seemed almost too large for George's head, with two half-tusks sticking out from the lower jaw just enough to show his new heritage. The rest of Garret's body was simply muscled stacked on muscle, long arms that flexed like wrapped coils ending in large club-like hands and thick, trunk like legs held aloft by wide feet. Even Garret's clothing changed to suit his new form, the armor melting away and becoming little more than ugly scrap iron that hung off one should, a boiler plate across his chest, two heavy bracers and two kneeplates, all sitting on top of patchwork chainmail and a large, basic tunic that looked more like it belonged to a horse than a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you say, boss?\" 'George' grunted as the intelligence drained out of his brain like water through a sieve. George was grateful to have the job, and he enjoyed it. He was safe from the peasants of town and cities, all of which would see him burned or a head of a pike simply because his Ma had been an Orc and his Da a human. They were both long dead, and George had scrambled his way through life before meeting The Boss, the human in front of him. He was glad to do anything The Boss asked him to do, all in exchange for food and shelter. He didn't even ask to be paid, and George felt like, after all these years, he'd die for the man that had saved him from a horrible fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mage grinned at his handy work. The ancient magic had worked flawlessly once again, and now instead of a troublesome knight, he had a fully loyal and useful servant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said go join the others in the mine, George. We need to continue digging downward, no matter what\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, boss\" George grunted, and made his way back through the mountain pass, through the camp that he called home, and into the mine entrance that had been otherwise hidden from view by one of the larger tents. Ducking low to avoid the heavy beams and low hanging outcroppings of rock, George found his way down to where the rest of the slaves were, most of them not bothering to even look twice at the arrival of the large half-breed. George grabbed a large pick-axe that seemed to be waiting for him, and joined several other larger men, some of which were half-breeds like himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd unknown to him, previous victims of the mage. Back in the familiar confines, George began chipping away at the dense rock of the mountain, finding joy in the simple work.</span></div></div>",

Gone were Garret's eyes, replaced by deep pools of blue, filled with longing and desire. Garret's face, masculine, angular, handsome was replaced by high cheekbones, a cute nose, lips full and red while the tanned and scarred skin that had belonged to Sir Garret was now flawless and pale. Large breasts sat atop a toned torso while the new woman flexed her slender arms and ran them down her wide hips and gorgeous buttocks and down her long legs.

She was the sole member of an extinct noble house, her entire family having passed away around her from some tragedy or another.

Her one true lover that had taken her away from a life of simple whoring and given her true adventure, full of magic and riches that no one else ever knew. And she was stunned by his intelligence, all the languages He knew, his talented tongue...Her slit became moist just thinking about what he could do with that tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, lover\" Enora purred, pushing herself closer to the mage, sliding a small, skilled hand beneath the mage's robes and sliding it around the growing rod in the man's trousers, \"The view from here really is romantic...but I think I'd like to see another mountain now\" She purred, and slid another hand upwards, through the mage's hair, guiding his head down towards hers and enveloping his lips in a passionate kiss. She wanted to have him right now, in the brisk mountain air and to hell with who saw. She moaned as his tongue intertwined with his.</span></div></div>",

Rolls of fat replaced muscle, a ruggedly handsome face swelling up as youthfully chubby cheeks and a splash of freckles replaced scars and masculine jawline. Green eyes that glittered as if they were in on some unknown joke while short cropped hair billowed down in a waterfall of red curls. Strong arms that had once swung longswords with ease now became fit only to cook and clean, and stubby legs that kept Clara from reaching things without a step-stool. A plump midsection sat beneath two large breasts as Sir Garret's armor melted away into a maid uniform, complete with an apron and a bonnet as the sword crumpled in on itself, becoming a basket filled with various foods and seasonings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his mind, Garret found himself falling into a pit of warmth, away from everything else as Clara powered her way into existence. The last conscious thought that he had was that of being surrounded by loaves of sweet smelling bread, lulling him to sleep in front of a bubbling pot and roaring fire. Where there had been a brain that had mastered sword fighting, horse riding, archery, all manner of combat, now there was simply an almost endless knowledge of spices, seasonings, how to cook game in just the right way to make her lord swoon with pleasure. Of how to keep a castle, or in the current case, a camp clean and sanitary, and how to fetch the best prices at market, despite being far from civilization. And her own little secret of, whenever she was asked how she managed to get such rare and delicious ingredients, a coy wink and a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, m'lord!\" Clara asked as the changes finished, her eyes wide with concern over how thin her master looked beneath his robes, \"You look positively famished!

Clara wasted no time in setting up a proper kitchen, and as the smells of something delicious wafted through the camp, the mage knew he'd made the right choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Clara was just satisfied with fulfilling her role in life, a dutiful servant to a generous lord who, if she was secretly honest with herself, clearly did not eat enough.

And they had been successful, crafting a spell powerful enough to manipulate an individual, getting them to forget, or to remember something different, or even change the very essence of who they had been into someone entirely different in body and soul. But the spell had always been intended to be used for one thing at a time, stacking enchantments upon the victim rather than all at once. And the old spellcrafters had learned this lesson the hard way. No one knew what happened to the old spellcrafters, and eventually they had fallen into barely remembered myth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, the mage was about to understand why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magic coursed over the pillar of flesh that had once been Sir Garret, pulling at it in strange contortions as a human body began to take form once more. But instead of a stunning beauty, there was simply an ordinary, slightly mannish looking woman, a long face, dull blonde hair that hung around her shoulders, too many freckles and dull, green eyes above a large nose and thin lips. Her body was plain and thin, a distinct lack of hips or impressive breasts, and layers of fat giving her only the slightest of curves. Her clothing was a strange mix between a maid uniform, silks and armor plating, an ugly ill-fitting collection that seemed poised to fall off the girl's form at the slightest movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind, as well, was a swirling storm. Garret was gone, lost to the maelstrom, shoved aside as half-remembered lessons of how to cook, how to clean, how to make love swam into his place. But there were other thoughts as well, instructions on how to hold a sword, but not on how to swing it. How to shoot a bow, but not how to hold it. Memories of being on a horse but no idea on how to make it move. Thoughts of serving the man in front of her, who was kind enough to give a dullard like herself a chance after she had made a fool out of herself and her family by tripping over her own feet and dousing a noble in leftover soup that had long since turned. She felt tears welling in her eyes as she remembered her father kicking her out for being a failure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut also memories of...a princess? Or maybe she just wanted to be a princess?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, Sophia suddenly realized she was slacking on the job and jerked upright with a yelp, nearly stumbling over her feet and off the cliff, only to be caught by the mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you, m.lord!\" She croaked with a voice that seemed like it had gotten caught halfway to womanhood. Once she had regained what little balance she had, Sophia fell to her knees in front of the mage, who simply stared in horror at what the magic had done.</span></div></div>",

It was hard to believe that just a few eggs could give people the money to survive upon for several months. There were many risks involved including the griffins he was looking for. A giant animal soared high above his head landing on a perch eyeing the intruders to the domain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman didn\u2019t notice the danger she was in as she focused on gathering eggs from the mountain side never seeing the deadly master of the mountain gazing at her with hostile attention. He wanted to yell and warn her but he was afraid to scare the woman so he prayed to the Gods that this was the creature he was looking for and prepared a rope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had trained to lasso an animal many times over the years but as the griffin launched itself into the air he worried that he would fail. The creature was so focused on the target it didn\u2019t notice the rope until it was too late. The creature gave a deafening shriek as it tried to fly away taking the paladin with it and the villager looked on in shock as Sir Garrett soared past her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGusts of wind smashed into the paladin from the powerful animal as he held on for dear life. He wasn\u2019t sure he had the right animal because this seemed more difficult than it should be. When he had found Thunder he had felt a connection and it had been easy. The others in the order had warned him it wouldn\u2019t be as easy with a griffin because they were a far different animal and he would have to prove his worth to it before the creature would accept him. They had never been very specific about how it was done, only that it varied. The creature dropped in the sky so he was hitting the tree tops smashing them as his body was battered. </span></div></div>",

Admittedly, he would have felt much better fighting the monster on solid ground under his feet and his armor protecting his body but even on the creature\u2019s home turf, he was far from helpless. His eyes took greater notice of the mountain as he searched for the best place to do battle from instead of the best way up the mountain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was tempting to throw the dagger but it was better to keep that for if the fighting got close and personal which he planned to do his best to avoid.

It was too difficult to move an army through the narrow hazardous trails in the mountains. Dreze would want to travel by water or over the paved roads of this land to keep his soldiers from worn down from the travel. Two travels could make it through the mountains but even they would have to be careful because of the dangers of the hill giant tribe that stalked the mountains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were slow-witted creatures who were a greedy and gluttonous creature with great physical strength. Hill giants loved picking on creatures smaller than them and at over ten feet tall in height most creatures were dwarfed by them. A tribe of them had recently been preying on those who traveled the trails through the mountain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina wore a lot of clear signs that she was a magic user because the foul smelling creatures fear magic. It was one of the few things they were vulnerable to so they usually tried to avoid any spell caster they encountered but on occasion, they tried to crush them with rocks from a distance. These mountains certainly had enough rocks for them to crush ten thousand magical users. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ghost Mountains were rumored to have been created in a great battle between the Gods and a Titan. All of the stones and boulders on the mountain were said to be the coagulated blood of the slain titan. All of the stones on the mountain were stained a red hue but Marina doubted there was any truth in the stories. She thought all of the violence over the years in the mountains was a more likely cause, perhaps there was a curse on the mountains from the Titan all of those ages ago that caused so many to fight in these mountains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese mountains were named for all the ghosts that haunted the range. She had never understood why so many had fought in these mountains because there was little of value here. No crops to grow, precious metals to mine or valuable gems to collect yet great seas of life had died and washed over these rocks. She didn\u2019t see how it was possible that large armies had done battles on these narrows passes but a rusted helmet or a broken blade reminded her of the truth of the stories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay the Gods grant you passage into the afterlife,\u201d Timothy quietly stopped and whispered to some unseen presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny ghosts I should be worried about?\u201d Marina asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head, \u201cJust some shades that needed help finding the path but we have to be careful because there is a lot of spiritual energy in the air from all of the ghosts. Ghosts are generally harmless but there are things that feed on them that are far from harmless. These lands are ripe for demons or devils stalking the grounds.\u201d</span></div></div>",

The giant carried a club or rather a tree trunk with the branches knocked off swung at Timothy smashing the ground he was standing upon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will have to do better than that,\u201d Timothy\u2019s flail lit up with divine power as he struck the hand of the giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hideous creature cried out in pain releasing his grip on his weapon to suck at the fresh injury, \u201cYou hurt Gorga. Gorga hurt you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was little room to dodge on the mountain. The foot of the giant struck the breastplate slamming the priest into the cliffside. He grunted in pain but was glad to not have been sent flying over the edge. Gorga paused a moment to rub his toe where it had struck the armor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGorga squish you.\u201d the giant howled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would have been hilarious if it weren\u2019t so dangerous. The giant was hopping slowly forward shaking the mountain as he approached with certain death. If the tumbling rocks didn\u2019t kill them all first. Even the giant had to swat away a few. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnytime you could help would be great,\u201d he had prepared himself against undead not giants and had expected Marina to take care of larger threats. A blast of celestial fire halted the approach for a moment but he didn\u2019t have much else to call upon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina had recovered enough to cast a transformation spell.

The Fae were notoriously difficult to trap and the servants were likely already looking for ways to get revenge or break their master free. It wasn\u2019t often done out of love of their cruel masters, spells were placed on servants to force loyalty usually with the servant knowing they were being forced to serve someone that they hated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope your prison for the creature is well made because if it ever gets out you are almost certainly doomed,\u201d Marina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim shrugged, \u201cMost of my enemies are deadly that is why I have vowed to never have a family. It would put too much burden on them. There are too many creatures that want revenge against me that could break free if given millennia of time.

It was usually fine but when you were dealing with an approaching army it was important to get things done when an opportunity presented itself. There wasn\u2019t much time before the foul wizard Dreze made his way through the mountain and there would be little chance to get around him and a direct confrontation with his army would result in a great loss of life that she could do little to prevent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to do this and we don\u2019t have much time when Dreze gets to this side of the mountains he will be able to take control of the river and how do propose to get behind his army to him then?\u201d Marina questioned angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese are fair questions I am asking, an hour spent discussing things can prevent hours or days of delay or dangers but I will go with you and trust your judgment. If you say we need to go, we go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe followed her to the river where she pulled out a small wooden boat and placed it in the river. Timothy resisted the urge to comment about fitting because she had already let him know that it was magical and soon it expanded to the point that it could fit three or four people. He started to load it interested to see how it work. It didn\u2019t appear that the boat actually rested on the water but hovered a few inches above which might allow it to ride over the dangerous rocks in the rapids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long can it stay afloat like that?\u201d Timothy said as he got aboard the boat to start the trip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwelve hours and then I have to recharge it for at least an hour,\u201d Marina answered. \u201cI have several energy stones to use so I don\u2019t have to use my own power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, then what are we waiting for.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride was less than pleasant as the vessel jostled and shook over the rapids but it made no signs that it was going to over turn. The gigantic mountains stood over them on either side of the river shrouding them in darkness. Timothy would be a lot happier when he was on the other side of these mountains because of how foreboding they felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had always hated things that were unfamiliar to him so he had dedicated his life to knowledge. He had seen the destruction the ancient evils that lurked in the world could do so he had searched out the knowledge to stop them and put them where they could never hurt anyone again. The sound of singing came to his ears and he wondered who could be out there with such a beautiful melody. </span></div></div>",

There were rumors that a few of the rich and powerful kept the creatures as pets, pleasure slaves or guardians she couldn\u2019t be certain her to wish she had studied aquatic creatures more but she had never had a desire to take any sea voyage. The song they were singing had an enchanting tone to it that made her want to relax which she quickly fought against as it felt like a form of magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to Timothy to give him further warning to cover his ears but she saw that he was already under deeper than she was. He stepped from the boat and disappeared into the water to her horror.  Whatever mermaids were they appeared to be hostile and she would have to stop them but first, she had to focus on countering their magic or she would have no way to help her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimothy knew he shouldn\u2019t be listening to the call that was beckoning him from the boat but he hadn\u2019t been expecting danger from the water, he had been expecting a threat from above but the waters here were so turbulent he had never suspected that anything dangerous could be living down there, it had been a mistake he would berate a rookie over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water was close to freezing, fresh mountain meltwater but it was surprisingly clear as he saw several mermaids swimming towards him. He had heard they were beautiful but he had never imagined them to be so colorful. They were like the tropical fish that he had seen during his studies with brilliant colors like golden scales or crimson hair. The creatures smiled warmly as the approached, the beautiful song they were singing was even more clear under the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew that he should be worried about the struggle for air but he could only enjoy the song. Before Timothy\u2019s situation became dire the golden scaled beauty swam up to him and gave him a passionate kiss. Her tongue wandered his mouth as pleasure filled his body even with her clamped on his mouth he suddenly found himself able to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other women started to strip his armor and clothing from his body allowing them to drop to the bottom of the river bed. He was no longer chilled by water and felt more at ease and aroused by the situation. His hands wandered her naked form gently rubbing her breasts enjoying the feeling. Timothy started to shrink in size as his muscles vanished and a webbing formed between his toes. The bliss of the kiss blinded him to the changes as he started to take on the shape of a mermaid. All signs of his manhood were gone soon gone and a beautiful pink haired mermaid with a large chest floated in the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina didn\u2019t know how long it took her to block the spell but she knew she had a limited time left to save her friend she needed to do something fast. </span></div></div>",

The bright golden gem on her ring of transformation flared to a blinding light before it burned out to a cold black never to be used again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo of the mermaids flew back from the boat as their bodies warped with the transformation. Their bikini tops fell away as they shrank revealing spectacular breasts for a brief moment before scales coated them. Hair dropped into the water below sinking beneath the surface as their heads stretched into those of simple fish losing all intelligence from the eyes. Finally, the magic released them done with the work the pair of mermaids were fish off to breed under the swift currents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer vision was clearing as she turned to face the last mermaid in the boat and her as her lips started the words that would end the threat they were matched by the cold wet lips of the water creature. The kiss started to warm up to an intense heat she had never experienced before. Marina tried to shove the mermaid off of her but slid off of her wet form. The claws of the monster tore open the robes of the wizard and started rubbing her breasts. Her chest started to swell as she squealed with joy as her body changed under the power of the mermaid\u2019s kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina knew she was changing but the feelings were so intense she ignored the danger she was facing.

The distinctive odor of wolf scent markings warned the primitive part of her brain that she was entering the territory of a hostile predator. Marina's civilized brain forced the fear to the back of her mind because she was on a mission was more important than avoiding every potential danger that could lurk in the woods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until Marina had heard the snapping of a twig from a young wolf did she realize the danger was very real. It was one to study the food chain and understand it, but quite another to become part of it.

Marina toughened the hide so arrows and most other weapons wouldn\u2019t pierce the hide of the creature and gave it the scent trail of the supply train before releasing it from her magic. There was likely be consequences for her actions but it was worth it if she could end the rule of Dreze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard was crafting monsters that might terrorize these lands for years to come if they weren\u2019t slain but she vowed she would clean up the dangers she was creating this day once the land was freed from the rule of her former master. Even in her short time here she could see that a great deal of dark and forbidden magic he had used. Slave collars, life drainers, and dread rings were just a few of the items used by the man. She would do what she needed to and spend the rest of her life ending the evils he had filled the world with but she needed more dangers to draw him out of his shielded layer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe animals would cause some danger but they wouldn\u2019t be enough. They were creatures that acted on instincts alone and wouldn\u2019t generally seek out the soldiers of Dreze to do battle. She would need creatures that had minds that she could direct towards her desire. It was a dangerous road she was walking but she promised herself that anyone she convinced to help her would have to be willing to undergo the changes she would make to them. She needed lines she wouldn\u2019t cross or she would be no better than Dreze. </span></div></div>",

Many trolls mutated into deadlier forms on their own without any help from outside forces developing extra heads or limbs. Their minds tended to be simple things obsessed with killing and eating but they could be directed. The creatures wouldn\u2019t be very hard to find, all you had to do was follow the smell. The creatures were immune to poisons, and diseases and often ate rancid meat and left hunks lying around ripening to suit there tastes around the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving around in the form of a wolf allowed her to cover great distances and observe things even farther than her eyes could see. The forests were alive with life but she avoided the humans and other creatures she smelled and heard seeking out what she wanted. Trolls were not exactly welcomed creatures in a kingdom and were hunted down so it wasn\u2019t a surprise that it took her many hours to find one that was lurking far from civilization. The creature was a runt for its kind, it barely stood four foot and it appeared to be surviving on mountain goats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shifted back to human form and approached the camp with caution and more importantly magical defenses up. The creature sniffed the air and turned in her direction ready to fight as she appeared out of the woods. It growled at her but didn\u2019t approach her as she moved towards it being careful to stay out of reach of the fearsome green creature. Even at this size, the troll could overpower many a full-sized warrior if given the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have come to make a deal with you,\u201d Marina said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you offer Grot, human\u201d the creature asked using a tone that suggested it considered being human an insult. It didn\u2019t bother her because most things that were civilized were hated by the creatures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have powerful magic that I can offer you to make you bigger and stronger. I ask that you attack and destroy the forces of Dreze in return. You may keep any loot you take.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDreze is powerful, his army is strong prove you can make me able to fight them and we will see if we have a deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrot started to swell in size as the rags he was wearing tore as he doubled in height standing over eight feet tall with powerful muscles that could snap bones with ease. His claws sharpened and strengthened until they could cut metal. The creature eyed the changes in disbelief at what had happened but the pleasure was obvious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like your deal, I accept,\u201d Grot was already walking away towards civilized lands to test his new strength. The creature had the bonus of being able to regenerate but she had left it vulnerable to fire in case it needed to be put down later. </span></div></div>",

Orc Den was a fort of the fearsome orcs who worked under the flag of Dreze and they had refused to accept him into service and even humiliated him for long hours so he had become a pariah to his own community with no hopes of finding a mate or a war band but all of that had changed for him. His dreams had grown just as large as his size, he would soon be the leader of his own war band leading them to victory over others. Destroying this fort would earn him the respect and fear he had craved for years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTorches lit the grounds around the fort as orcs snorted and grunted on their night patrols. The creatures were being noisy and chatting with each other in their guttural language. Grot had always hated the language, it didn\u2019t have the power of his native language that he shared with the Giants. They could easily be avoided but he had no desire to do that now that he had the advantage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle pigs, I have come to hear you squeal!\u201d He charged the group of three and ripped the axe from the grip of the first and buried it in the head of the second one. His clawed his tore the flesh from the throat of the first one and watched as the third finally collected himself and pulled out his short sword and stabbed it into Grot\u2019s exposed belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was little pain for the troll who smiled as he pulled the weapon from his body. The wound was already healing before the sword had fully exited his body. Grot could see his green-skinned enemy struggle to fight the turn of the blade but the troll felt no difficulty in turning the weapon against its master. With a powerful thrust, he planted the blade in the belly of the orc warrior and left him to die as he went to invade the fort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fort did not seem as impressive as it once had, the walls were in wood but they were in poor repair and the keep within still had signs of a siege weapon damage from years ago. Climbing over the wall was easy as he landed on the muddy ground that was filled with tents. </span></div></div>",

Now, he would take his place as the greatest warrior. More than a little drool rolled down his face as he thought of the tasty orc flesh to come. A warrior\u2019s heart was just the thing to curb the hunger growing in his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orcs snapped to awareness but they made no rush to fight the troll. They were a warrior species but one who depended on numbers for bravery. Despite being tougher and stronger than humans no single orc would face the lesser creatures much less the meat grinder like a troll. Cautiously they covered themselves in armor and weapons preparing for battle none of them hoped to fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho dares invade Blood Spear lands?\u201d Grot chuckled quietly at the brusque words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chieftain covered in trophies of many victories approached with a band of at least ten bodyguards in front of him. His approach was announced by the jangle of dozens of his victim\u2019s teeth and skulls but it did little to hide the fear. He was committing one of the gravest sins of an orc, he was getting old. The many scars of battle couldn\u2019t hide the wrinkles starting to form. Only a shaman was allowed to reach such a time. He must be cunning indeed to avoid sharpened blades of younger generations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Grot,\u201d he announced himself. \u201cI seek to join a war band to raid the humans. To prove my worth I will fight one of yours to the death.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo only the best will do,\u201d a nasty grin formed on the Chieftain\u2019s face. \u201cI, Argug Chief of the Blood Spears, will think on this. Betraying Dreze is a great risk. You must prove yourself worthy of such a risk by taking on my two most powerful Barug and Dul in a fight to the death.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo orcs stepped forward to the roar of the bloodthirsty crowd but their eyes didn\u2019t leave the chief. Why get rid of one rival for power when you could get rid of two?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGladly,\u201d Grot stretched his fingers so the pair would get a good look at his long flesh-tearing nails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair spared a glance filled with daggers at each other as they squared off against the troll. Death for two or three was likely no matter who came out victorious. Dul a powerful brute even by orc standards charged forward swinging his battle-ax. Grot did not attempt to avoid the attack. He stepped into it embracing the pain as it cleaved through flesh and bone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorror dawned on the orc as it dawned on him this was no death blow. Instead, the teeth of a carnivore bit deeply into the soft flesh of the throat. Grot turned to away from the dying enemy pulling free the ax so his body could heal properly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet me a torch!\u201d Barug demanded. He leaped out of the way of his gigantic opponent. The bright green blood of Grot made the ground slick. A torch was being brought to Barug but Argug made no motion for the lesser orc to hurry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic was seizing the rival to the chief as Grot played with him. The troll was enjoying bating him around. A slash here or there and the leather armor he wore was little better than rags. Finally, the torch was arriving meaning his fun was over. It wouldn\u2019t save his opponent at this point but it would be a long time to heal. A powerful blow brought the heart free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrot savored the taste as the crowds cheered at the show. They had lost two of their number but gained someone more powerful than the pair. There was no word for sentiment in the orc tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have done well mighty warrior,\u201d Argug cautiously drew close. \u201cEnjoy the night and tomorrow we will make our move.\u201d </span></div></div>",

Marina looked out on to the road and located a group of scouts on the road moving further into the Kingdom. There was caution to their movement as they eyed the woods and grounds for enemies. The three scouts held crossbows at the ready causing the mage to back into the woods in case they decided they wanted some fresh meat tonight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing how scared they looked she decided to test them and smashed her hooves into a tree shaking the tree with the force causing branches to break and filling the woods with noise. Two of the scouts pulled their crossbows in a panic sending wild shots off harmlessly in the woods. The third man shook his head at the other two and headed towards the woods to investigate the sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarn, you stay here,\u201d the leader said. \u201cGeorge, you reload your weapon and come with me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn\u2019t wear the uniforms of the army of Dreze but they had forgotten to hide their tattoos marking them as servants to the dark ruler of their land. She wondered what their story would be if they came across a superior force, most likely that they had escaped from the slave armies of the man. Marina moved to the road and circled to the front of Marn and approached the man distracted by his loading of his weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed her, surprised a deer would come so close but it was just a harmless animal so he went back to work. Marina leaped forward, knocking the man to the ground and processed to stomp him into oblivion. She quickly bounded into the woods as the men came back to investigate the sound of their dying friend. It had been a good opportunity but it would be much more difficult to take out the rest in this form. If she took out the scouts it could slow the army down as they tried to figure out what was happening but these scouts were not the real danger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer nostrils flared as they caught a whiff of smoke and she knew something big was burning in the distance. She raced through the woods as she thought of the border town of Golden Gate which was nearby and it might be burning to the ground by the armies of Dreze. She would make the man pay if he had torched the town. </span></div></div>",

The real trouble would come when she came close to the dark wizard\u2019s main came. He was notorious for being paranoid and she doubted even an ant would make it into his camp without being noticed, so she would have to come up with some sort of distraction to use against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard the sound of something approaching but she resisted the urge to run until she knew what it was. Relief filled her as she saw it was a buck approaching her and she went back to contemplating her problem quickly forgetting the animal of the forest, but the buck didn\u2019t forget about her.  The tongue reached out and licked her genital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnimal arousal took over her body as her body called on her to receive this powerful buck\u2019s seed inside of her. She hadn\u2019t taken a close enough look at her body to realize it was in heat and now she was paying for it. The instincts of her body to mate were too difficult to fight for her distracted mind. The male animal didn\u2019t need a formal invite and mounted her and pounded her body before releasing sperm inside her receptive body.  Once he had spent his load he left without out so much as a thank you. Marina\u2019s body told her she needed fuel to feed her future young so she started to eat the foliage around her starting to forget about her mission and the lives that were depending on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was becoming harder to keep her human mind intact, but if she turned back into a human here she was likely to be detected. Perhaps she could change into another animal or she could give in to the feelings she was having and become a doe because she had a good start. She might already be pregnant and if she wasn\u2019t she was sure the buck was willing to service her again. It had certainly felt very good and it had been a long time since she had the pleasures of the flesh. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The work was worth it to prevent others from using the portal for evil purposes. It surprised her to see her fellow council member Ari and Ari's apprentice Hector. They were dressed and equipped for combat not ceremony which surprised and worried Marina more than she cared to admit. Their presence likely meant they were going to try and prevent her from using the portal because they were allied with the enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't let you go,\" Ari eyes almost looked pleading. \"You're my friend but I will do everything in my power to stop you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can understand Hector's betrayal because that weasel would sell out his own mother, but you have always been a true believer in the cause, so I ask you why you are doing this.\" Marina asked her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has my family,\" tears welled in Ari's eyes. \"He won't harm them if we stop you from leaving so please just don't go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we work together we could easily save them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't take that chance,\" Ari threw a freeze spell at Marina but a barrier spell prevented it from taking effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn,\" An evil grin covered Hector's face. A spell lashed out at Marina with great force shattering her barrier striking her with great force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe change called to her to relent to its beckoning but it was quickly countered by her amulet of protection. Before the spell dissipated Marina gathered it up and shot it back at Hector with great joy. Shock covered Hector's face as his own spell overwhelmed him. The heat became overwhelming and he quickly through his robes to the ground. Hate filled his eyes as he realized he would soon be the buxom, horny wench he had intended Marina to become. Long blonde locks grew on his head as his chest heaved him forward with the weight of two large mounds which called gravity down upon him. His manhood was gone in a flash as new feelings began to fill his mind what little of it was left of her new mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serves you right for trying to do such a terrible thing. Now, for you my friend,\" Marina's voice had turned icier than Ari's freeze spell. Marina drained to of her energy containing rings to make sure her spell broke through. The ancient words flowed from her lips and soon her will gave life to them. \"I shall change you back when I return, but take this time to reflect on the consequences your actions could have had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAri wanted to scream in frustration as the spell shattered her defenses and struck her but she found herself frozen in place as her muscles stiffened in place. She grew in size within moments ripping clothing leaving her naked but she didn't feel cold because the sun warmed her body. The skin on Ari's body began to get rough as it stiffened into bark. Her arms stretched to sky as they called out for life giving sunlight as leaves sprouted from the branches which had once been fingers. Soon she was robbed of her sight and left with her thoughts and the gentle breeze in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears welled in Marina as she saw her friend turned into a tree but she repressed them because she had a job to do. She cast a small spell to guide the naked woman to the village safely and didn't bother dressing her because she wouldn't keep them on for long anyways. It would be amusing to see the villager's reaction to a naked woman walking into the village but she didn't have the time. The real question is how should she proceed with her journey? Marina had severly depleted her magic and she would be jumping into the heart of enemy territory, but if she used the portal she wouldn't have to fight through an army of Dreze's minions, and she didn't know how far Ari's deal with Dreze went. He could be planning to use the portal to bring his armies through so should she destroy it to be safe. It would be a tough choice.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It would be a shame to destroy what had taken so long to build and she felt it was worth a little risk. She overcharged a ring if her gamble proved foolish and stepped through the shimmering surface and into a new place filled with darkness. No light met her eyes and she was worried that she had gotten the wrong location. Most portals were placed in the sun where they could draw power from the sun. Marina drew power from the ring and lit the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wished there was more information about this portal but Dreze had destroyed so many records of ages past in his quest to be the only one with knowledge about his lands. Marina wasn\u2019t sure who had built this portal but runes started to illuminate the room revealing fine stone craftsmanship. The room looked like it had just been cleaned without a spot of dust or web in sight but she was sure it had been many years since anyone had touched this room. Dreze had performed a purge of all the dwarves who were too strong of will to fall to his mind control. Her former master not only wanted obedience to his commands but he wanted a facade of love for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDreze had always had a great ego and she had often manipulated him by stroking it to get access to new spells or magic items. She often wondered how much he believed or if he even cared that she was lying to him. It would have been nice if she could believe he had been corrupted by the Azara Stone but the stone had no influence over the user, the only evil of the stone was what the person used it for. It had given her master the ability to take command of the land and she wondered if Dreze had slain the royal family or if they were locked away somewhere as nearly mindless playthings for him when it amused him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously walking around the room she looked for warnings of dangers in the runes in case traps had been left by the dwarfs. They tended to be protective of their secrets and it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if they had placed a trap for an outsider using their portal. The good thing about dwarves is they liked to be consistent with their language so even over great time and distances they could be read. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese were the Halls of the Keepers of Stone who would do what needed to be done to protect their secrets, she read. Marina had heard of them but they were supposed to have vanished over a thousand years ago. Questions swirled in her mind about how she had gotten the access to this place, the information on the portal had not suggested it was a place this old or fabled. Had it been just an accident or was there more at work here?</span></div></div>",

If the enemy did have access to the portal they would find a nasty surprise waiting for them. She had set up a trap for anyone accessing that portal that would give his forces an explosive surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have to find another way to travel since she thought using the portal was too much risk. The fortunate news, fresh from a traveler, was that the armies of Dreze had suffered a recent setback when they tried to use a shortcut through the mountains. Unfortunately for them, they had disturbed the fire goddess of the mountain as she liked to be titled Keahi was a fearsome fire dragon and instead of paying her tribute they had tried to slay her. This did not please the ancient dragon who ruled the territory. The armies had suffered heavy losses from the battle and the stubborn nature of the Dreze wouldn\u2019t allow him to leave the battle and find an easier path for invasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDreze was likely to win in the end but he was likely to lose a large part of his forces in the effort because he wouldn\u2019t want to risk himself in combat. It was likely to even turn back the army if the red dragon could hold out long enough. The thought assisting the dragon was one idea for her next move but the creature was likely to want some sort of tribute from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she bought some supplies for the trip and wondered if she should try to gather a mercenary company in the south to assist her. Attacking the army from the back with the dragon at the front of them would lead to great results. It would be a large expenditure of money but she was likely to get a large reward from the King that should more than cover it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final plan that occurred to her was the most dangerous one to risk. Some of the mountains carried molten rock that could melt even the strongest metals. If she were to dig a tunnel, she could pour the lava down through the pass that most of the army was taking ending the threat of invasion but there were a lot of problems with the plan. It wasn\u2019t just the dragon that was likely to oppose her plan as she would have to travel through monster filled lands by herself and the work was likely to be noticed by the creatures of the Underdark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was starting to feel better with a plan in hand to allow her to focus and her only wish as she sat at the Inn for a warm meal was that the town had better magical supplies. The herb shops goods were poor at best so she would have to look for things along the way which would delay her when she wasn\u2019t sure how much time she had left. </span></div></div>",

They had already gotten through to this side, it was no stretch of the imagination that there would be many more servants on the other side. Many years of labor and magical power had gone into the making of this portal and she was going to destroy the portal in one day. She set magical explosive charges and moved back to a safe distance so she could watch the end. A giant explosion of blue flames flew up to light up the sky but the magic user\u2019s spell held preventing damage to the surrounding forest. A tear dropped down her cheek as she felt the magic fade and started walking past the rubble towards the army of Dreze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had worked on this portal with Ari and her master who had passed away years ago. It was like losing a part of her master that she could never get back. As for Ari, she would save her friend\u2019s family despite her actions. Marina wished her friend had trusted her but she would deal with that later. There would need to be serious consequences for betraying the council, and she couldn\u2019t protect her friend from that threat. It was likely going to be a stripping her of magic for betraying them to work for Dreze, whatever the reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kingdom of Dar was one of the few places magic was accepted and allowed to be practiced openly with only reasonable restrictions. Even necromancy was allowed with some supervision. Most kingdoms were afraid of magic users with very good reasons, because most people had no protection against magic, so the council of magic users in Dar was very careful to see they had no reason to fear magic. The punishments were harsh but they needed to calm the fears of the people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAri had been a fool to trust Dreze would keep his word that he would free her family. The man wouldn\u2019t release his hold on a powerful spell caster. The man ruled with fear and power over his people. No one was allowed to become powerful in his kingdom without being bound to him. She shuddered at the thought of having one of his slave collars around her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would need to make a decision on her next course of action. If his forces had been gathering around the portal striking his front lines might have a devastating effect, and allow the army\u2019s of King Emeril to push forward, or she could seek out the leader to cut off the head of the snake who was likely hiding behind the walls of his palace but her heart called for her to help the family of her friend first. It might not be the best choice because she had no idea where they were. There were several prisons or slave camps he could be keeping them at, but it would at least feel good to free the prisoners and she might get aid from them or be able to start a resistance.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marina decided she wanted to help out Ari, so she would feel like she was doing some good. Fighting soldiers who were often under threat of Dreze as well didn\u2019t sit well with her. A rescue mission would help to inspire her to take down Dreze, and she would likely need help to do that and what better people than the ones he had wrongly imprisoned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were three prisons controlled by the dread wizard, and she would need to decide which one to attack first. Perhaps if the prison breaks inspired enough people a revolt could form, and picking the right one was critical for that. She wanted to go straight for Ari\u2019s family but she wasn\u2019t sure that was the best idea as it wouldn\u2019t take long for the wizards working for Dreze to figure out that the portal wasn\u2019t working, and they would know that Ari had been defeated, so they may suspect that Marina was going to be coming for her friend\u2019s family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleak Towers was likely the location the family was imprisoned with other political prisoners who spoke out against Dreze or those the wizard used to blackmail others to do his bidding. Most of the people were not threats in combat, but their words or actions had drawn the anger of the ruler of the lands. They were usually imprisoned there until their final fate was decided, usually when Dreze wanted to make an example of someone or because their usefulness had come to an end. It was in a remote region at the top of a mountain with numerous towers guarding the path, but she could likely get in easily in the form of a flying creature. The prisoners might not be able to fight but they could certainly spread the word and inspire others to fight back against the dread wizard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Asylum was probably the most well protected of the prisons as it held enemy spellcasters and warriors. They would be the best to have in a fight, but the defenses were fearsome and there was a garrison nearby and anti-magic fields around the building. She would need to get help to take the place and free the people from the control of Dreze. No one had ever escaped from the place, so she had no idea what to expect on the inside in the way of defenses, and that scared her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleasure Palace was the last prison, and in many ways, it was the worst of them all. The prisoners were transformed into sex slaves to serve the pleasures of the elites of the land. She would need a lot of countermagic if she went there. Marina wished there was some sort of spell to heal the mental suffering that had occurred while the people were enslaved. As there were elites from the kingdom at the place meant there would likely to be bodyguards as well as the usual guards, but not as many as at the other locations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had decided she would make the proper preparations, so her plan would have a good chance of success. Marina was frightened at the prospect of failure when she felt so many people were depending on her success. The armies of King Emeril would have a much better chance of success if she could divide the attention of Dreze, so he would have to split his armies, and it might draw the man out of his fortified palace so she could take a good strike against the man. She said a silent prayer for her success and made her decision.</span></div></div>",

She decided on taking the form of an eagle because it would give her weapons to use if she needed to and allow her to go unnoticed by the guards as just another animal part of the natural order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleak Tower was on a plateau with high cliffs on all sides with only a single bridge able to access the prison. Large towers loomed over either side of the bridge with archers ready to shoot down any escaping prisoners. High winds made trying to climb the walls, either up or down deadly at the best of times but for an eagle, it made flying easy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina loved being a bird soaring high above the world especially in such fantastic conditions. Her keen eyes saw that most of the guards were putting in half-hearted efforts into their work. Many were on the verge of sleep if they weren\u2019t outright snoring. They were likely bored and thought they were invulnerable to an attack but the mage intended to prove them wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe landed on top of a tower and looked down at the prisoners in the center of the walls of the prison. The masses of people huddled together for warmth against the chill of the mountain and chilling winds. To her delight she didn\u2019t see many guards, there didn\u2019t appear to be any large barracks. Dreze had not spent much on guards for this prison but to be fair there wasn\u2019t much need for defense. A few archers and high walls could handle any attempt at escape. The clothing the prisoners were wearing wouldn\u2019t allow them to survive in the much harsher winds outside the prison walls. She decided on a plan of an attack and executed it. </span></div></div>",

The man worked long hours doing boring work so they weren\u2019t particularly alert but they noticed her because an eagle was about the only thing to view in this cold miserable place. She ignored them as she took note of their positions and decided her next course of action. A change was in order if she was going to stay out here for longer because it was getting cold for this form but she could think of another that wouldn\u2019t be bothered by the arctic winds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrake hated guard duty in this place of nightmares but the consequences of disobeying orders were terrifying. He saw the creature climb off of the tower and the horror of it froze him for a moment, a yeti. The man eating monstrosity was feared in every cold mountainous region in the world. Their hunger was never satisfied and even frost giant feared to fight the creatures one on one. He rushed to the alarm bell slamming the door behind him praying it would be enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to be careful to not lose herself to the urges especially in a creature so primal. Two guards had been slain before the alarm sounded. A direct assault would draw the attention away from the prisoners she thought as she smacked a couple to them to their deaths on the hard courtyard below to give the prisoners something to work with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors were designed to keep out human intruders but the thick wooden doors shattered under her pounding fists. Five guards charged her but their blades only made small scratches in her thick hide. Metal bent and bones broke under her assault leaving her surrounded by corpses. Her stomach rumbled in hunger and she tore off a few pieces to eat. It disturbed her to eat humans but until she was done fighting it was best to fill her belly with food to prevent her having to fight the instincts of the form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoaring with rage she charged the archers pelting her with arrows. Her powerful legs carried to them and started batting them around sending them flying from the walls. As her jaws closed on the final one she realized she was starting to lose control over the body. It might be better to return to human form especially since most of the guards were likely dead but she could remain as she was and dominate any enemy she came across. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt so good to be so powerful, even after slaying over a dozen and taking on so many attacks she was still ready for more. Marina stomped down the stairs looking for the office of the warden determined to devour his tender flesh in her jaws. She growled at the metal door protecting the ruler of this place but her kind couldn\u2019t be kept out by such things. It hurt her fists bashing in the door but it started to obey her demands as it bent inwards. Her thoughts were becoming less clear as hunger started to fill her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man inside cowered behind his table pleading in a language she didn\u2019t understand, at least not anymore. Fighting the dark thoughts in her head, she froze in place as the man started to run past. Her claws lashed out instinctively slaying the warden and with a twist of the ring on her finger she was human once again, it had been close this time, too close. She\u2019d have to figure out what went wrong later, her current problem was how to get the people past the guard towers. </span></div></div>",

She would have to be careful because this would drain most of her magical power and leave her vulnerable. Marina tried to ignore the carnage as she moved to the doors to release the prisoners but it was hard. The doors opened to the chill in the air and she walked out and opened the locked gate with warden\u2019s keys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prisoners stared in astonishment at the stranger walking into the courtyard. She didn\u2019t wear the garb of one of the guards but they didn\u2019t trust that this wasn\u2019t some sort of trick. The guards liked to play games with them that often resulted in death but as their gazes turned towards the walls and towers they couldn\u2019t see anyone watching them or their movements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have slain the guards in the main prison,\u201d Marina explained the gathering crowd. \u201cThe towers along the path to freedom are still manned but I have a plan to get you past them. I am a powerful wizard and I will be able to transform all of you into animals to escape from this place and when we get to safety I will change you back. Some may know my name of Marina of the Enlightened Circle and the good I have done in the world. We must decide on what animal to transform everyone into.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if we chose not to risk the change?\u201d a voice shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour options are limited, the cold will kill you if exit without the proper attire that only the guards in the outside towers have and they aren\u2019t going to part with it willingly and they will shoot you on sight if they see you.  You could stay here and remain, prisoners, where you will likely be executed for the deaths of guards in front of large crowds or rot for the rest of your days. I don\u2019t see many other options for you but if you think of one let me know.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let them huddle together and discuss with themselves so they could come to the same conclusions she had. Marina eyed the sky and wondered when the guards in the tower would signal the alarm and contact the rest of Dreze\u2019s forces. They needed to be out of here by morning before the guards missed their morning meal but it was possible there needed to be signals at certain hours during the night. The sooner they all got out of here the better off they all would be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you use your magic to slay the rest of the guards or transform them instead?\u201d a woman asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina shook her head no, \u201cI am not a combat mage and they would be able to raise the alarm before we got out of here and the forces would soon be upon us. They are too spread out to change at once and unwilling targets are much more difficult to change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I guess you are right about our choices,\u201d a gray-haired woman said. \u201cWhat are our options to be changed into?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are three good options I can think of but they all have some risk and danger,\u201d Marina answered. \u201cA rabbit would go unnoticed especially at night but you would be defenseless and vulnerable to predators, becoming wolves would give you defenses but you will be more likely to be spotted and humans often take a dim view of the animals, and finally a bird, this would allow you to fly out of here unseen and let us get far from here before the fact that you are missing gets noticed, you would leave no trail to follow but it is also the most dangerous. Fly is not the easiest thing to master under the best of conditions and these are not the best of conditions and you have never been a bird before. Which path should we follow?\u201d</span></div></div>",

It was a nice sentiment but only time would show if they were right or wrong. Marina started crafting the ritual circle infusing it with the magic that would be needed. She could already feel her strength draining from her body. Transforming so many would leave her without her precious power for longer than she would like. When she spent magic like she was doing this day it left her feeling naked. It was unnatural to be without it. She was tempted to call on the extra energy she had stored in her items but it was a dangerous practice. It was important to let magic come back on its own. It was her suspicion that Dreze had called on the magic too many times and it had warped him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no time to worry about that now as she activated the magic causing the shifting and changing of the people. For the first time in who knew how long the prisoners felt warm as fur-coated there bodies. Old bodies and weak bodies became strong again as they became young vibrant wolves in an array of colors. The lush fur of silver, black, and even auburn filled the grounds as Marina cracked the door to freedom open and allowed her own body to shift into a wolf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a powerful wolf with a beautiful gray coat ready to lead her pack into the night. Marina could hear the group yipping and barking in excitement eager to face the world but she gave a stern look calling for silence. There was a small chance that she could get them out of here in secret under the gaze of the archers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing into shadows of the towers she guided the others in the way to avoid detection. To use the guard toward for cover. Worry filled her heart as they followed her example but there were so many that it was unlikely they would go unnoticed. She sent those with the best-camouflaged fur first hoping they wouldn\u2019t be spotted.</span></div></div>",

A large clearing was between them and freedom and it was well lit unless the guards were completely blind or asleep they were certain to be spotted but at least it was the last pair of towers, most of them would escape unscathed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina debated being the last to run or the first but it didn\u2019t take long for her to decide she needed to be first, she knew the way out of this land. She moved quickly across the snowy ground and wasn\u2019t surprised when she wasn\u2019t shot at. A single wolf wouldn\u2019t invoke interest from the guards other than some novelty but multiple of them would certainly attract a response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she reached the would and took cover she turned back to see what the others were up to. Her gaze turned to the towers where the guards were waiting for enemies to attack. As the prisoners raced across the clearing the guards started to ring the bells and draw their bows for an attack on the dozens of wolves fleeing from the place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards had no idea what they were dealing with but they were certain it wasn\u2019t natural and worse was the fact no one inside the prison was responding to their alarms. They would be blamed for this when the master of this land found out about this and there would be no saving themselves even if they stopped this prison break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalik dropped his bow,\u201d Stop the alarm we need to get out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarna stopped the alarm so he could talk, \u201cWhen Dreze hears about this . . .\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t run now none of us is going to survive!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alarms went silent and the others heard his words but he didn\u2019t care. He had a family to protect. He needed to get them to safety before the monster discovered what had happened here. If no one reported this there was a chance no one would discover what happened for over a week. They weren\u2019t getting a delivery for another twelve days, he prayed that it would be enough time. The others could do what they wanted but he was getting out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of the guards started to leave their towers and realized the threat they were under and chose to run. They had many tales of people getting away from the master of this country and if they could get away far enough perhaps they could be one of those stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina could feel relief pour over her as all of the prisoners made it to the woods safely. Freedom was theirs at least for a brief moment and it felt very good. It appeared that the guards had decided run and she felt it was the best idea for them and the chaos was for the best for her group of people. There was a long distance from where she would feel safe changing them back to human because of the cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey would have to be careful to avoid patrols because they were certain to realize that something was up with such a large pack but she wanted to make sure they were human before she allowed them to split into smaller groups. They could make the proper plans in human form to help take down the forces of Dreze from within his own kingdom. </span></div></div>",

She wished they understood the danger they were facing. A maniac like Dreze was always paranoid even in the heart of his territory. There would be patrols lurking all around searching for strange things to investigate. They were certain to have a quota of incidents to solve or risk the wrath of their higher-ups and a giant pack of wolves would serve nicely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer muscles were starting to call for a break as she raced ahead to a rise in the land to spy ahead.

If there is more than one child you best race back here so I can protect you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man flushed in anger at the teasing, \u201cDid you forget we are at war!?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you forget the front lines are about a hundred miles from here runt?\u201d the large man sneered. \u201cWe are here to look pretty and make sure the fine citizens never forget their duty to Dreze. Even rebels wouldn\u2019t be stupid enough to be out on a day like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina had to admit there was truth to his words. The wind was blistering to bare skin and the cold could shake a man apart. A wolf could easily handle the chill of this frosty realm. Especially when they were huddled all together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight growl drew her attention and she realized a few of the others had climbed up for a look. Marina smacked the offender with her tail and shook her head before turning back to see how much damage had been done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d the rookie trotted his horse out of line to the bottom of the hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large man joined him, \u201cYour yapping has disturbed some local canine. Quick! You had better go after it and teach it the proper respect for the Black Flames of Dreze.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked uncertain about what to do as the group laughed. The soldiers had stopped for the moment but none of them made their way over to help him. Still, his eyes scanned the top of the crest looking for an excuse to charge up there. It was clear he was tired of the abuses of superior and didn\u2019t want to be the but of any further humiliation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard was just as uncertain. If any of them came to the top of the hill they were certain to be spotted but there was a chance they come up here. If they got into a fight they were more likely to be detected but it was better to start one than wait for the enemy to be ready for them. </span></div></div>",

Marina, could still remember it, though hazily, the thoughts of her 'training' and the simple needs of breeding, eating, loyalty clouded her remaining human thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had gone wrong right from the start. The prisoners were ill-suited for their animals forms and though she had tried her best to keep them quiet, they had lacked anything resembling organization. They had been clumsy on their new four feet, stumbling into objects, getting distracted by their heightened senses, too excited to stay silent as they made their way through the complex. And so it was that the remaining guards had descended upon them with swords, bows and nets. Many of the prisoners had died, including the old man who had spoke up for the change into wolves. Marina herself had been knocked out in the ambush and when she had awoke, she found herself muzzled and bound, still in her canine form along with all the other prisoners, living and dead. She had, along with the survivors, had been forced to watch the guards collect the bodies of the slain and laugh about how they'd make fine cloaks, and then suffer the humiliation of being carried away to the depths of the fortress they had sought to escape from before being roughly deposited in heavy steel cages like the animals they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDays passed and hunger, dehydration, the oppressive dark and dampness of the dungeon took their toll on Marina and the other prisoners before they saw their captors again. Among the entourage of humans was a mage, who took one look at Marina, locked in her cage, and chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's the source of the charm. It is good you left them bound and muzzled, she would have no doubt cast the counter spell and you'd have another riot on your hands. But fret not, I have the perfect spell in mind to end your problems...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina's changed eyes went wide when the mage began speaking an incantation, and with a wave of his waves and a flash of blue light, Marina felt her own magic diminish until it was little more than a slight tingle in the back of her mind. She had been cut off! Without access to her magic she'd never be able to cancel her own spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe, and all the other prisoners, were stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was soon after that her life was made infinitely worse. The prisoners, not realizing the predicament that they were in, whimpered and pawed as best as they could at the guards, especially when bowls of food and water were produced. One by one the prisoners were released; those still defiant were slain, and those that followed basic commands were allowed to eat and drink. Those that were especially submissive were fitted with leather collars and leashes and led out of the dungeon. Those that resisted the collar were bound, muzzled, and placed once more into their cages. Marina was never released, and as the guards left her and the others in darkness once more, she was overcome with fear and hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she could only guess as two days later the guards returned and repeated the routine. This time, all of the prisoners submitted to being collared and led away, while the guards and the mage that had locked her away from her magic carefully and slowly unbound Marina and removed the muzzle, looking for any sign of resistance, though Marina was so weak from hunger and dehydration that she could barely lift herself to her feet. The mage chuckled as he had watched her stagger towards the offered food and water, her mind clouded beyond anything other than survival. She never even felt the collar and leash find their way slipped around her canine neck. When she was finished feeding, and the horrid aches of near death began to lessen, she had cast a single look around the now empty cages, and to the smirking guards. Then she felt a slight pull at her neck, and Marina found herself pulled towards the large doorway that all the other prisoners disappeared down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the moment that Marina had surrendered to her fate. From there it was an endless routine of obedience training, those that failed were quickly made into cloaks or decoration, and Marina and her pack soon learned to obey any and all commands given by the Houndmaster. After ensuring their new pets were broken, the guards began training them to hunt for them, and it was soon apparent that their still human minds made them incredible hunters and guard animals. Soon the pack's numbers decreased even further as several of the guards took to selling them for a bag or two of coin to passing nobles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina and the handful of other female prisoners were forced to become breeding stock as the guards forced the male wolves upon them again and again to replenish the kennel numbers. Giving birth to litters of wolf pups, sired by one of the many anonymous males, had been humiliating and painful, and the pups themselves showed no sign of being anything more than animals. But they were trainable as well, and the prison become known across the kingdom as the Wolfhound Kennels, the only place in the land to buy full blooded wolf pups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus was her fate. Marina, what was left of her human personality, uttered a silent mental curse at herself for feeling compassion for the idiots that had doomed her to this humiliating existence, and for a moment she felt a tingle of magic, for years long forgotten, flare back to life. But then the door to the kennel swung open and in marched the servants, their arms full of food and water bowls, and Marina forgot whatever she was thinking about as her instincts to feed took over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a playful grunt as one of the servants set two bowls down in fron of her pen, Marina's thoughts drifted back into the foggy recesses of her brain, and she waited, like a good girl, for one of her human masters to unlock the gate so that she could feed, and maybe later, breed once more.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Faster still was the portal but it would create magical echoes which Dreze might use to locate the portal, and that would have devastating consequences, so she had chosen the magical carpet instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe land seemed to blur beneath her as she traveled over the land and it wasn\u2019t long before she crossed the disputed territory into the land claimed by Dreze. She had grown up in these now ravaged lands back when Count Senmark had ruled them and Dreze had served as loyal vizier until he discovered the Gems of Clu and he used them to betray the Count and conquer the kingdom. Marina made a silent prayer to any god that would listen that she would have the strength to defeat Dreze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sum faded from the sky she noticed the camp fires of the invading armies on the ground below. Marina wasn\u2019t sure the armies of Dar could stand against Dreze because they were so divided with the troubles in the north and south. It was tempting to attack the army and cause them to be distracted and divided. She had the Orb of Change and if she used it's full charge she could take a sizable force, but she would lose the use of it and she had been counting on it for an emergency situation. Her second option was to sneak down there and use her magic to take command of the traveling and pack animals and have them scatter, but it was dangerous because she would have to land to be close enough to use the magic. Finally, Marina could ignore the forces below her and keep focused on the task of taking out Dreze, The option would be the easiest and the hardest one to make. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had been pushing his forces hard and though his power was great it was not infinite. There were those in his lands that were sure to seek to replace him and they would see his failure as weakness so she dropped the magical orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was tempted to stick around and see the result of the chaos she had crafted but it was best if she was far from here. Dreze would be certain to see a powerful force against the culprit who had ruined the advance of his forces and she wanted to be elsewhere creating more trouble for them to the point that they would have too many fires to put out to worry about her. She hoped to finish things with Dreze soon but there were many ways to destroy someone and it was likely the direct assault wouldn\u2019t be wise against someone so well defended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBirwick saw the strange orb fall from the sky and land near him. It appeared to have come from some passing wizard on a carpet and he had seen that anything involving magic users was trouble. His raised hand drew his men to an instant halt. He was about to call over one of the mages to investigate when the magical object unleashed its fury upon the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA powerful blast of energy struck Commander Birwick who dropped to the ground. Pain filled his body as it swelled out of his armor. The straps couldn\u2019t contain his freshly scaled skin as a new coat of armor took the place of the old one. His eyes opened to see other who had been under his command suffering their own changes. Some were sprouting fur while others started to ooze slime or growing new appendages. Men who had once called him comrade drew back in horror as they watched what was happening in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey drew weapons as magic users rushed to examine what was happening. A panicked soldier lets an arrow fly striking Birwick but it did no harm as it bounced off the steel like scales. Rage filled the newly formed wyvern at the attack. He swung his tail with deadly accuracy into the enemy from instinct his stinger sticking out the other side of the guard. Roaring in triumph he continued his assault with a quick clamping shut of his jaws on a shock mage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA battle the army had not expected was soon raging across the grounds as monsters fought men bringing death and destruction to the army. They had been prepared to fight men, not the strange beasts that were tearing through their ranks. A drake spits acid into the group of spell crafters blinding them while a giant hairy monster ripped and tore through the ranks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBirwick was savoring the flesh of a mighty war elephant when he came back to who he was. The great first legion of Dreze was in ruins. He had no idea how much time had passed since the change but the sun was much lower in the sky. His human shape showed no sign of returning, he was a giant winged beast who had just helped destroyed his own army. He would have felt more guilt it if he didn\u2019t know they were on a path of destruction that Dreze had forced upon them. Perhaps it was time to go on the hunt for Dreze or a cure from the wizard who had caused this. </span></div></div>",

Stealth was not her best ability she thought as she stumbled over a log and fell head first into some mud. Marina, the great and powerful magic user, hated being so clumsy in the woods. She was so used to being an animal in the woods that being in human shape felt awkward and weird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had never been graceful as a child but she had been able to become graceful. Transforming into a deer was wonderful as she danced through the trees or becoming a falcon, soaring through the sky as a master of the air.

She reminded herself that she was going to save a lot of lives with what she was doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching out from the edge of the woods she could feel the minds of the simple animals pulling the wagons. Taking command of a beast of burden was easy but she was trying to control an entire wagon train strained her mind.

Marina felt herself reaching her limit so she commanded the animals to break loose and run free before releasing control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head ached as she heard the animals breaking free to the cries of frustration from the wagon drivers.

His hand made quick motions in the air and he flew from the wagon as it went tumbling from the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFreck where are you?\u201d he called for his apprentice but he was disoriented, the young man wasn\u2019t at the head of the wagon thankfully because the driver\u2019s corpse was rolling down the hill. Too many of the animals were going wild at once, this was the work of a spell caster. His apprentice would have to fend for himself because he needed to stop the caster before they did more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put up a magical barrier around him because he would need to search for the caster. His pinky ring flared blue before becoming a dead black but the enemy flared up in his vision and he studied her. She was leaving, heading behind their lines, likely to cause more trouble. The cries of his men as they fought with the animals were not unheard but that was just a symptom, he planned to deal with the real problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe master mage closed quickly on the woman but his hopes for a quick win were thwarted as tree branches shot up from the forest striking his shielded. It sparked and flared holding against the attack but the animated forest was undeterred and started to probe and search for an entrance keeping constant pressure on his defenses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he stayed on the defense he would surely lose, a shattering quake of force when down the trees causing them to explode. Splinters of wood flew in thousands of different directions and he hoped more than a few of them struck his enemy but he wasn\u2019t about to depend on that a fireball started to grow in his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice trick but you will have to do better to stop me,\u201d Alzan searched for his target but she had dispelled his marking magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about this for a trick?\u201d an incredibly loud voice spoke behind him. Alzan spun around to see Marina was a giantess taller than many of the trees. Her fist smashed him to the ground easily shattering the remaining power of his shield, his spell fizzled out as he struck the ground, losing his concentration. He started to call forth lighting, power and light started to crackle in the air but the sixty-foot woman slipped off her shoe with a smile on her face and knocked him to the ground with her big toe. She planted in on his chest and pressed him into the ground. \u201cThat kind of tickles. I don\u2019t suppose you want to give up.\u201d </span></div></div>",

They were the best ones to counter her and the readiest to fight her but they were likely to be followed by the supply train which would be much more vulnerable. Her Order of the Enlightened Circle was against the killing of people but she had always viewed herself that the prevention of death was the most important thing. An opportunity to create a lot of problems for the army showed itself but she knew that many would die. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit of sorrow hit her as she landed and prepared to rain down the destruction of a lot of people. Most of the people that were down their had never taken a life, many had never held a sword but she was about to be throwing down boulders down on them in this narrow mountain path. By destroying them she would be ending the advance of the army. An army that could not feed itself was an army that couldn\u2019t fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe called upon her magic to start the change to herself and instantly felt herself swelling in size. Her robes changed to accommodate her becoming a tight dress more appropriate for the storm giant she was becoming. They were the largest of the giants and the most powerful. It was a worry that using this much magic would prevent her access to her magic for at least a day but not even dragons were eager to take on an adult storm giantess. Her breasts swelled over the boundary of the dress top giving an enticing view to any who observed her.

Horror filled their faces as they saw an angry giant above them start to throw rocks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people scrambled but there was no escape Marina had seen to it that most of the column was now trapped be behind large piles of rocks. She pounded the ground beneath her and drew the desired result as a tidal wave of rocks flooded over the men and animals causing them to vanish as if by some sort of magic trick. A few people struggle to flee and run from her as she came down the mountain to finish off any stragglers she would find. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one bothered to try and fight her causing her to have such a great feeling of power and dominance over the little people.

She would create a transformation plague that would infect all of the servants of Dreze. The foolish wizard marked all of his servants and it would make it easy for the magical plague to distinguish between the innocent and the guilty with the lands the plague would cover. Creating the plague posed a few problems such as some of the ingredients were difficult and dangerous to get and casting it would require draining much of her magic for several days, but it would eliminate the threat of the army of Dreze and make the wizard a minor threat without the loss of any lives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the most difficult pieces to get would be the unicorn hairs because they had many magical defenses to protect them and though good they had many poor experiences with wizards which made them extremely paranoid of any wizards coming for favors. The hairs were essential but dealing with a creature of good limited her options on what she would feel right doing. Marina would have to make a deal and she hoped she would be able to pay the price. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second ingredient was mimic blood which was difficult to find at the best of times and they were dangerous to find at the best of times and they were certainly very dangerous because of the many forms they took when they lay in wait to ambush prey. Luckily she had a lead on where to find one. Marina was only worried what she would happen once she found it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps the most dangerous were the waters from the spring inside the temple of Basta. Basta was an evil god of the hunt and animals. The priests frequently used the waters from the spring of change within the temple to turn people into animals to hunt for blood sport in honor of their god.

They could become very dangerous if they were attacking something they viewed as evil. Dealing with a unicorn would help her to decide if what she was doing was right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDepending on what she transformed Dreze\u2019s army into she might be taking away the human lives of the people for the rest of their existence. Was she justified in what she was planning to do? Her code was not as strict as that of the holy unicorn but it was certain that she had doubts and discussing it with a creature that had a firm moral code would help her sort her own feelings. Dreze and his forces were far worse than the kingdom of Dar but that didn\u2019t mean King Emeril\u2019s people were all saints. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny unicorn would be found far from civilization because they were often hunted by the sentient races for their horns. The horn of the unicorn could heal any wound or disease and could even give life to the dead with the magic stored inside. She had seen black market unicorn horns before, they turned black with the foulness of slaying such creatures of good. Only once had Marina seen the brilliant white glow of a horn that had been given to someone the man had kept it in his store and was unwilling to part with it at any price. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she could convince the unicorn her plan was justified she could secure the gift of a shed horn. Once every one hundred years, a unicorn shed it\u2019s horn but they only gave them out to the most worthy of people or those who had given them a great favor. With that in hand, she wouldn\u2019t need the other ingredients to complete her work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina looked out in all directions and could not even see a fire from where she was. It was a good place to start looking for a unicorn. Great waves of green forest rolled and shook in the wind drawing a smile to her face from the beauty.

Sighing, she set out to do her work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowders soon formed magical symbols and her circle of protection was formed that would ignite like a beacon to any creature sensitive to magic out here like a unicorn who was certain to come investigate. Arcane magic users were weak against unicorns who could easily shatter even some of the most powerful magical barriers which, is why magic users hired hunters to do their dirty work for them.

The guards of the temple were dangerous as they were usually some of the most powerful servants, not the cannon fodder of hunt mad freaks that were often encountered. Some would have magic that would rival her own, skills and power that would challenge her abilities to the limits of what she had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina didn\u2019t like the fear she felt as she gathered her equipment for the journey but it would be needed to allow her to be aware enough to survive. She had been hunted by the order before and come out on top and what scared her most was the head priest who had placed the spell upon her so many years ago because he had invited her to come back, to attempt to destroy the temple because he would like to hunt her again when she was even more powerful to honor his dark god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be a pleasure to hunt them down and end their dark pleasures forever. She wasn\u2019t deluded enough to think destroying the temple would end the cult but it would certainly hamper their efforts. Marina hoped the priest was long dead by now but something in her told her that he was still presiding over the hunts even though more than a decade had passed. She told herself that she could just sneak into the temple and collect what she would need and vanish before she would be noticed but the rage she felt against the man might demand revenge against him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing forced into the form of an animal had made her focus on the art of transformation magic with a passion she had never had before, Marina would never be trapped in another shape again. They had hunted her over the course of three nights before her victory and she was changed back. The priest had laughed at her threats and welcomed her return, she hoped she would be able to make him eat those words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long for civilization to vanish from view, even her tower vanished from view after a few hills. She liked the seclusion normally but it made her feel very alone at this moment against a sea of troubles. The cult of Basta had many followers in rural areas far from the protections of the civilized world. Basta provided protection to those left to the cruelties of fate by the nobles who were supposed to protect them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobles were quick to demand the taxes they felt were owed to them but slow to provide the protection that was needed to produce the money and goods that would pay those taxes. Monsters and bandits ruled the land around here so anyone who would help was welcomed no matter what they offered in return. The hunters of Basta provided protection and only required a few sacrifices which the villagers were willing to give. Travelers in small towns needed to be very careful they weren\u2019t offered up as those sacrifices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she drew closer to the temple she knew the numbers of the followers would be growing, the eyes of the cult would be everywhere. Marina had worn a heavy cloak to hide identity as a magic user but it might not be enough to prevent her discovery as a magic user. She looked at the woods and debated if she should try to sneak through as an animal but that also had dangers all its own. </span></div></div>",

If anyone could find out about the strange sightings, mysterious disappearances and mutilate corpses without getting caught it was Seras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part Seras cared very little about the King\u2019s thoughts or feelings because she was only interested in getting paid. She usually wore a disguise when meeting clients but the King\u2019s wizards would likely detect the magic which would make the already nervous King Emeril downright paranoid, not that he didn\u2019t have reason to be scared. A lifetime of conquering and combat had produced many enemies, and with his advancing years he found the children who should have been taking the burdens from his shoulders busy fighting each other over potential inheritance, so he had his hands full preventing bloodshed between his brood. The King was now forced to call upon the insane to do the dirty work of the kingdom, namely adventurers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe title adventurer appealed to Seras since childhood as someone who went places and going places was just what she wanted to do. She had earned the title many years ago and it brought with it money, thrills and more enjoyments she thought was possible. People usually became adventurers to earn the big score, and retire or to genuinely try to do some good for the world. A few like Seras were thrill seekers who would adventure until the day the price of their thrills caught up with them. Seras told herself it was the money but she lied a lot, so she would gladly help the King for the money he offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question left for Seras was where to start.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her large chest made aiming a little awkward but she had done plenty of practicing to counter her more voluptuous new figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer crossbow and daggers started to draw the attention of the bandits as she whittled their numbers down quickly, not caring that the others saw her deadly speed or accuracy. They started to gather for a run against her causing a dark smile of joy on her face. The explosive orb sent out flames as it shattered to the entire group causing them to scatter and fall as the flames ate away at their flesh. Seras could feel the eyes of the bandits focusing on her with hate, but more than a little fear. She had lived a hard and deadly life, it would take more than a band of bandits to stop her when she was properly armed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bandit climbed up behind her to fall backward as a stiletto was planted in his heart. They were fools to try and take her on this wagon that creaked and swayed with every slight breeze letting her know when she was being attacked and from where. A couple tried to shoot her from a distance but they found she would reward them with deadly counter fire as she easily dodged their poorly aimed attacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pounding of hooves came closer to her, riding along the side of the wagon for cover but she was ready with a dagger and short sword as the net attempted to cover her it was easily knocked aside by her blade. She leaped onto the galloping mount and rapidly stabbed the man in the side six times before allowing the bandit to fall from the saddle. She wished this body had some of her lean but powerful muscles of her real form but her skill was proving enough as the few remaining bandits started to flee despite their leader\u2019s command. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeras watched the bandit leader closely as he glowered at the woman who had stolen the victory from him this day, and turned slowly from the caravan cheering their victory over the bandits. Unfortunately for the man Seras was vindictive and had no desire to face an attack on her return to these lands. The blow dart struck the man in the back of the neck causing him to slap at the wound likely thinking it was a biting insect before the paralyzing poison did its work causing him to fall from his horse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thief reloaded her crossbow as she rode over to the man, debating what to do with him. There had been no loyal men left as far as her sharp eyes could see because she saw none of the bandits in the vicinity. She could interrogate him and see if he had anything of value for her to spare his life, kill him and be done with him or turn him over to the caravan who would no doubt be very hungry for the blood of the man who had taken the lives of so many. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe removed his mask to reveal the rather ugly face of a half-orc. The half-orc was trying to determine what his fate was going to be by looking at the attractive woman standing over him toying with a blade.

Seras let loose a deadly bolt from her crossbow toppling one of the scarier and more sober looking riders to the ground. She hoped by picking off a few of the leaders or tougher riders the others would be scared and run. She wished she had her trusty short swords if the attackers managed to break the formation and get close but a lot of people recognized her distinctive blades. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple more of the bolts struck home with deadly results but it appeared the fighting was going to get a lot closer than she wanted. She silently cursed the guards for being terrible shots and the drunken bandits for being too stupid to realize their numbers were quickly dropping. The throwing daggers were much faster to throw but not as easy to pierce armor with. Seras would have to take careful aim for unprotected spots but luckily most of these fools had nod taken time to put on proper armor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding under the cover of her wagon she started to take some shots at the bandits entering the wagon area making sure to hit anyone approaching her wagon. Helping the guards was her second priority as they could actually fight, well at least better than the other people in the wagon train. Screams from a woman attracted her attention and she saw a woman being dragged away by on of the criminals she struck the man with a dagger to the back of the neck ending any bad plans he might have had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were looking too close to call even with her assistance, and she was running out of daggers. Seras could try and hide out in the hopes even if the remaining bandits won their numbers wouldn\u2019t be enough to take much with them. She could press her attack and hope the tide would turn in her favor. Gambling wasn\u2019t some thing she liked to do unless she controlled the out com. It would look better if she hid and the guards won but if she didn\u2019t do something soon there wouldn\u2019t be many guards left and there was still a lot of road to travel. There was certainly a temptation to grab her most important gear and take off on one of her horses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bandit had gotten the edge on one of the guards and was about to slay him but Seras\u2019s dagger struck home first as she continued to wonder what her next course of action should be and with only five daggers left she would have to make the decision quickly.</span></div></div>",

The cage door slammed shut behind her and she took a moment to eye the lock and saw it would be a simple job to break with the tools she had pocketed in her mouth, she just hoped it would be soon enough to escape her final destination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her fellow occupants in the cage and didn\u2019t hold out much help from that direction because they were two young kids that had been allowed to keep their clothing and an attractive woman just out of her teens who was huddled whimpering in the corner. It would be better if everyone escaped so the attention of everyone would be taken in many directions, but these prisoners weren\u2019t likely to get far. Eyeing the number of bandits she decided if she could get back to her wagon she could kill all of them. The only one she felt might give her trouble was the hooded figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man carried himself with the skill of a practiced warrior so she would need to deal with him first. It frustrated her that she likely wouldn\u2019t be able to interrogate him because of the risk involved, perhaps when she saw his face he would be familiar to her. She had learned of the faces of most of the Crimson Tigers the personal guards of the King and that was a likely target for who she was dealing with. If she could discover the identity it would give her a trail to follow.</span></div></div>",

Seras\u2019s anger filled her enough warmth against the chill of the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavy hoofs pounded the ground as a rider arrived at the camp, and the man was immediately recognized by Seras.

There was little doubt in the mind of the thief that this person had come for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Stone got off his horse and waited for the commander of the camp to approach him, and Seras couldn\u2019t help but smile at how uncomfortable the man was making the entire camp. This was a man who carried with him the authority of the King of the land and they were criminals breaking the laws of the land. The head of the camp came out and showed no fear as he approached the much larger and very dangerous man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBring the girl over, and a horse so I can be on my way,\u201d Sir Stone ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think things have changed,\u201d the bandit leader said. </span></div></div>",

If there was any worry in the man at the many crossbows pointed at him that was not the feeling that was exuded from him. There was no anger even at the threat only a quiet curiosity. The man\u2019s giant mace was firmly against the ground as if it was a simple walking stick but Seras had heard of the destruction it could cause when put to use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have business to conduct for the King,\u201d Sir Stone said after several moments of waiting. \u201cIf you must attack, attack but I am leaving here with that woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have heard of the reputation of the Crimson Tigers,\u201d the masked leader of the bandits growled. \u201cYour King is due for a fall and I am going to start with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou dare to threaten the King!\u201d Sir Stone launched himself forward into a barrage of crossbow bolts, but even as the bolts shattered harmlessly off his armor his mace struck home crushing skulls and bones leaving lifeless corpses in his wake as he marched for the leader. \u201cI will bring death to you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerror started to fill the men as this monster pushed forward as their blades and weapons were harmlessly deflected off his magical armor. Seras watched with a careful eye for weakness that she could exploit later. This man was famed for being a walking wall but every wall had a weakness and she could find it given enough time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered if this was the time to stick around because with all the chaos this was a perfect chance to escape. This Crimson Tiger was determined to slay all of the bandits before he turned his attention back to her. The man was slow but he would chase her to ends of the world but by the time he caught up to her she could have a trap ready for him. She took a moment to look at the other slaves and debated if she should free them first. They could add to the distraction but it would take precious time to free them and it looked like Sir Stone was making short work of the remaining bandits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roar of Sir Stone filled the air as he approached the leader of the bandits, his armor stained with the blood of his many victims.</span></div></div>",

The gods of good were always promising great rewards in the afterlife if you did good deeds. It was time to earn off some of the bad shit she had done over the years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully the bandits were terrible with knots and it was quick work to free the other slaves and it gave her some chance to watch the Crimson Tiger fight. The members of the bandits were vanishing quickly under the onslaught of a massive warrior but the hooded leader was doing a good job of darting in and out avoiding the deadly strikes of his opponent. Eventually, blood started to leak out from the many strikes Sir Stone had received but it only seemed to slow the giant man down a little bit. The hooded man looked like he might have a chance for victory when Sir Stone\u2019s mace struck home crushing the ribs of the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you see the greatness of my King,\u201d Sir Stone gloated as his opponent got to his knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe abyss take you and your King,\u201d the man spat out blood on the Crimson Tiger and was rewarded for his defiance with the huge mace pulping his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeras watched next to a horse that she had secured for a chance to escape. She had been surprised by the dedication of the bandits, King Emeril must have wronged many of them for them to be so determined to slay a Crimson Tiger but the few remaining were scattering to the winds leaving the field to the blood and gore covered knight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made a tempting target even in her altered form because she wasn\u2019t likely to get a better chance than this but she was ready to ride away on her horse and find a good place to ambush him. A thought occurred to her. Sir Stone wasn\u2019t known for being very bright. Perhaps he didn\u2019t know she was in an altered form. She might be able to trick him and learn more about what was going on and why the King wanted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a lot of risks but there was a lot of rewards if she could succeed. She watched as Sir Stone suddenly realized he had been distracted from his original quest and he decided to return to his orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle mouse, little mouse,\u201d He called out the hated nickname the Crimson Tigers had for her. \u201cWhere are you little mouse?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Seras moved quietly but quickly through the carnage collecting weapons and equipment while avoiding the gaze of Sir Stone. She wished she could transform back to her natural state but you can\u2019t have everything in combat when an opportunity presents itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dagger flew into the damaged knee joint on his armor severing important muscles and damaging bone. A small grunt of pain came unbidden from the lips of the giant man but he continued moving towards the source of the attack. Several rocks bounced harmlessly off his armor before he spotted the little mouse he was seeking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe little mouse knows how to bite,\u201d Sir Stone growled. \u201cIf the little mouse isn\u2019t careful I may pull off a limb or two, King Emeril didn\u2019t say I had to bring back all of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe might be angry but the thief wasn\u2019t about to fight stupid against such a dangerous opponent who could take her out with just one hit. The trick was to get him to fight stupid and work every advantage she could. With skillful precision, she struck the man in the head with another rock disorienting him with the noise and making the Crimson Tiger angry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like games,\u201d the warrior tossed a large log in her direction as she dove behind a tent. \u201cIf you give up I promise I won\u2019t even bruise you but the offer is going away quickly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem to be slowing up,\u201d Seras responded as she caught her breath hidden behind cover. \u201cAre your wounds finally catching up to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am still well enough to take care of you, little mouse. Come out of hiding, you wouldn\u2019t want me to fail my duty to the King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy does the King want me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are welcome to ask him when I bring you to him. I only follow orders, I don\u2019t care about the reason why.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed the tent she had been hiding behind and pulled it through the air but the thief followed it using the cover to leap into the face of the warrior using both hands to slam the dirk into an eye of the servant of the king. Seras could hear the blade strike the back of the helmet but she was already putting distance between her and Sir Stone because books were filled with tales of people dying when they thought they had taken down the Crimson Tiger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man howled in pain as he stumbled after the thief but the effort was only impressive because of his continuing movement after such grievous wounds. Seras was easily able to keep a safe distance from the dying man. She wondered what had been done to the man to enable him to still be able to move. This spoke of dark magic to her but even magic had limits as the man collapsed into his final throes of life leaving Seras alone on the field of battle. </span></div></div>",

She started by stripping the armor from the man\u2019s horse so it would be less recognizable when she got to town. There was a small wagon she could pile some stuff in but nothing like the larger wagon she had recently had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeras stared for several minutes at the prone form of the giant man debating taking the armor. Even in the damaged condition, it would more than makeup for her losses but there would be many people who would know this armor and come looking for the one who sold it. She lifted the mask to look at the face of the man hidden behind the mask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath the metal face plate was a desiccated corpse with black smoke pouring from the body. Evil magic had been used to give this warrior his strength. Looking closer it appeared that the armor truly did make the man as the magic of the armor drained life from the person inside the armor until nothing was left. What was left of the body collapsed into dust leaving her wondering how many \u201cStones\u201d she had met over the years. It was a foul thing that made monstrous slaves for the king to use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had encountered something like this once before in the ruins of an ancient kingdom. The book had reeked of evil with a spine and cover made of human bone and pages inked with the blood of many sentient races. It was something she had hoped to never encounter in life, the book had bothered her so much she had never sold it and only told one other of the existence of the thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it possible another copy of the book existed or had her trust been betrayed? This was more worrisome to her than King Emeril being after her. Nobility could be counted to turn on you if it was in their interest or if they just had a whim to be cruel and vindictive. She wondered if she should alter her plans because of this new information and check to see if she had been betrayed. </span></div></div>",

Adventure, if you planned it right, came with a proper payday but she would go after the book. Leaving the book out in the world would create a lot more risk for her work. She should have destroyed it when she got it but it had seemed like too much trouble. Locking it away had seemed like enough because who could find it where she hid it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus was a bookworm of the first order and the only other person she had told about the book. He was going to have a lot to answer for if the book was missing. The rogue took her time looting the camp because she wasn\u2019t sure when she would get back this way and the vultures were already starting to circle. In the distance, she could see the girls she had freed running but decided to leave them to their fates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of it was even for their own safety because there was sure to be hunters out to look for all involved in the death of Sir Stone and it was better they have little connection to Seras as they could. King Emeril had come after her and he certainly wasn\u2019t going to stop and he would be looking for revenge against anyone who might be an ally of her\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClothing that didn\u2019t make her look like a lady ready for the slave market was in short supply so she made the best of it and made sure she had more than a few weapons visible.

She wasn\u2019t going to try and head back to the caravan on the off chance her stuff hadn\u2019t been looted or destroyed. In order to turn back to her natural state, she would have to hit one of her caches or buy some new magic with the haul she was taking away this day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe covered her face with a blue silk because this cover identity\u2019s appearance had been blown.

Seras spun towards her wagon making sure to keep out of arms reach. She recognized the man as one of the guards on the caravan and wondered how many of the passengers he had tried to take advantage of in the darkness. His reign of terror was coming to an end this night with a special cocktail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was completely oblivious to the danger he was facing, convinced of his own value how could he doubt any gorgeous woman would want him? When they tried to fight him off they were only playing hard to get and wanted it rough. Seras hated the man with a passion but she still had to be cautious because even filth like him often had friends so she watched carefully for any witness but saw all was quiet around her wagon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFriends seemed like a stretch because it was more likely a gang that worked together on various crimes. They protected their fellow members so if they got in trouble they would be abandoned but guards often disappeared on long trips like these. Herrick the guard would not be found anywhere in camp by the time she was done with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady or not I am coming for you,\u201d the wagon shook as the large man jumped on and peered in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis should warm you up,\u201d Seras offered the man a flask which he snatched and proceeded to suck down the contents to the last drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little sweet for my tastes but not as sweet as you are going to be. Let\u2019s see if you can suck on the beast like I did your drink. Afterward, I am going to make you scream so loud and often you are going to keep the entire caravan up all night.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerrick dropped his pants to reveal the \u201cbeast\u201d and she had to admit that it was larger than average but a smile formed on her face as she saw it becoming far less impressive. He took a step forward but she could see he was already feeling the effects of the potion as he had to grab hold of a trunk to stay upright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it hot in here or is it just me?\u201d Muscles vanished from Herrick\u2019s body as he flapped his shirt trying to cool down his sweaty body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you better lay down sweet cheeks,\u201d Seras grabbed an engorged nipple and gave it a hard twist causing a cry of pleasure as Herrick dropped back onto the cot. \u201cHerrick doesn\u2019t seem like a very good for such a lovely lady, how about Fawn?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfusion formed on the face of Fawn as she tried to understand the words, \u201cLady?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d the rogue pulled the now way oversized shirt from the woman\u2019s shoulder\u2019s dropping it down to her waist revealing spectacular breasts. \u201cYou would have to be an awfully fat man to have breasts that size little one.

She darted between hiding spots following the man who had been after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t cover for you much longer, people are going to come back from the party and hear you screaming you idiot!\u201d a guard snapped at the brute. \u201cYour money won\u2019t be worth anything if the people hang me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well we will both hang if she isn\u2019t found because I am not going to go down alone so help me search.\u201d the brute was scanning the darkness, never suspecting how close she really was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like things were getting more serious, could this be the problem the King was talking about. If the guards of caravans were helping to make people disappear that would be a big problem for trade. She might need to investigate further and not just take care of the brute but she really wanted to be done with him tonight but not knowing who they were and how much they were actually up to might destroy her mission if they were just cogs in a larger machine. </span></div></div>",

She slipped behind the guard for a brief moment before following the brute, she lifted a dagger and the coin purse from the man before easing away, it was only right he pay her back for some of the trouble he had caused her this night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the man proved to be easy in the soft dirt and his grumbling only made the job easier, he paused a moment to look around for observers as he exited the circle of wagons but failed to notice the golden-haired beauty hidden in the shadows. She was tempted to sneak back to her wagon to gather more equipment, she decided to continue the pursuit at least to see if he was alone if it was a group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was too much open area for her comfort but as soon as the man went over the crest of the hill she darted across the earth only slowing her pace when she reached the top of the hill. Her chest was far from being designed for crawling but she made the best of it, silently cursing the man who had designed this form, she might have to find him and make the man take the shape to see how well he enjoyed moving around with breasts the size of the finest melons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes caught sight of a small encampment of bandits talking in quiet tones to the brute she had been following. Only five could be seen, certainly not enough to overtake the entire caravan but they were clearly up for making some trouble. A couple of people were bound to a stake in the ground and it appeared they had an empty wagon ready to take any spoils they might be able to secure.

There was a lot of trouble along the path to the south so you had to be desperate, greedy or foolish to take the risk. Seras was greedy for the reward the King would give her if she succeeded but she needed to know more about the others with her not so she could trust them, there were few she ever trusted, but she needed to know them so she could know how they would react and what they would do when trouble would occur or when an opportunity presented itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Serpent Outfit was a large group that had many of the wagons on the train. The men working the wagons were some of least trustworthy of men she had ever seen. She recognized several of the men as murderers under penalty of death if they were caught. A large half-orc commanded the bunch and kept them in line. They feared him and with good reason because he seemed to have eyes in the back of his head and more strength and skill in his arms than any four of them. It was easy to see what he wanted, profits, it looked like the man was in line for a promotion in the outfit if he pulled this risky venture off and there were going to be few things that he let stop him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the ones that worried her most was the Andra clan because they had a desperate look to them. It was a family heading south with three wagons filled to the brim with people and junk. They were always sneaking looks in other people\u2019s wagons and observing everyone as if looking for something or someone. They fell into the desperate category and were the most dangerous of the groups because it was always hard to predict what a desperate person would do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer\u2019s Twilight was a band of mercenaries that fell into the foolish category because they had no idea what they were in for. Their confidence was far greater than the skill she had seen from any of them. The real problem she had with them is there seemed to be some sort of bet as to which one of them could bring her to their bed and she didn\u2019t want involvement with any of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThief!\u201d The cry rang out through the night air and Seras almost made a run for it until she realized it wasn\u2019t directed at her. Her speed towards the source of the grew faster as she saw that someone was taking her wagon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively she grabbed a horse and pressed it into a gallop, glad that she had made friends with Cassie Spring from the wagon in front of her. The woman had realized it wasn\u2019t her at the reign of the wagon and she had given Seras the time she needed to prevent the theft. She rode hard to see who had taken her wagon.</span></div></div>",

A little extra assistance wasn't uncalled for, so she decided to ask for the assistance of warrior, Nasty Nick. He had earned the name for surviving the nastiest of fights and combats. He also had the bad habit of leaving pieces of equipment in the bedrooms of his employer's wives which he hadn't been visiting for security checks. Cleaning up after the warrior had earned more than one favor from the usually cash strapped warrior for Seras. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I need your help with a mission,' Seras sat beside the heavily armored warrior in one of the dive bars he frequented when low on cash, or hiding out from irate husbands. Judging by the way he kept his eyes on the doors and back to the wall it was the latter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Your timing couldn't be any better,' Nasty Nick gave a grin. 'I haven't traveled in too long and was afraid my skills were going to go to pot, and here you call upon me for assistance. Now, I get to travel and clear my debts with a friend.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Some of your debts,' Seras corrected Nasty Nick. 'Are you forgetting how I cleared up the mess with your deflowering of the Archmage's daughter? What about leaving your dagger in the bedroom of the wife of the Captain of the Royal Guard?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNasty Nick's smile left his face and he cough, 'Too many hits to the head I suppose. My memory is maybe a little faulty, so I'll let you keep track of things my old friend.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeras let out a heavy sigh and nodded to let it settle matters. Nasty Nick wasn't trying to be dishonest, but he was trying to haggle when Seras held all of the chips. She had saved Nasty Nick from his over active hormones and absent minded brain on, so many occasions if she asked him to fall on sword he had better do it, because there were many people who would be willing to assist him onto the sword if given the proper information. Seras liked the man despite the trouble he had caused her over the years, but she wouldn't sell him up the river though she often contemplated how much she could get if she sold him out to his enemies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Come on my noble knight,' Seras teased. 'The sooner we get started the sooner you will be back drinking good beer instead of this mule piss.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Never have I heard such a fine enticement for a quest,' the handsome fighter smiled. 'It will be my pleasure to assist such a fine lady with whatever she desires.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeras laughed, 'So I have heard.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair laughed as they rode off into the distant night. Nighttime was more comfortable for these two who were so comfortable with combat enshrouded inside of darkness. Many dangers could be encountered on their journey, but shadows and darkness were as much allies with them as anything that lurked within the darkness.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nick would have to take care of himself for the time being but she could see him still moving with the glance she was able to spare him. A group of figures stepped out into the moonlight laughing at the suffering of there targets and feeling certainty of their victory. The drow had earned the right for some arrogance for their mastering of the killing arts because the ones they often trained against were each other and if someone died it only served to make them better as a species to their view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeras and Nick were at a disadvantage because of them being outnumbered by the drow and night fighting was a mastered skill by those who lived in eternal darkness so she wasn\u2019t going to hold anything back if she intended to survive. It cost her a month\u2019s pay but she tossed the last resort item at them and rolled behind a tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA pebble!?!\u201d One of the drow mocked her. \u201cIs that the best you can do human?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt exploded in a shower of gas enveloping all four of the drow who were not amused by it, \u201cDon\u2019t you know that we are masters of poison. Your little gas cloud won\u2019t stop us but it has assured that you will be tortured for many years to come as our slave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could understand mistaking the gas as a poison because one of the ingredients did have stun properties if mixed with certain other items but this wasn\u2019t the purpose of the item at all as they were soon to discover. Nick had managed to roll into some nearby bushes and was pulling his sword preparing for the attack but she motioned for him to wait as the drow slowly edged forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaris didn\u2019t like the fact that there was no begging, pleading, or even threats, there was only silence. Either they were frozen with fear which she doubted with the quick reaction time of the female or they felt they had some sort of advantage. The gas had smelled like stun powder but could it have been something else? She adjusted her grip for the second time in a minute of her familiar blade but it still didn\u2019t feel entirely right, it felt larger somehow. A dawning knowledge that something was very wrong took over as she saw the others playing with their equipment as well. Her mind searched for what could be causing this and how to fix it she felt a sudden tingle as her armor slide from her shoulders revealing her breasts to the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sister Lara stumbled out of her boots as their servant Veldrin dropped his blade as it became too large for his tiny hands to hold. Dira held tightly her robes as she shrank within the growing folds of the spider silk, fear was clear on the face of the young priestess. This was her first foray into the surface world and it might be her last. Lara tried to rush the humans before she became too small to be a threat to them but her movements were awkward as her breasts shook without proper support and her protective armor now slowed her with extra weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRun!\u201d Lara called to the others. \u201cI will try to hold them off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn\u2019t altruism, she needed someone to escape so they could come to free her if she was captured or avenge her if she was killed. She had some hope the others would get away from these humans because the night and their new size would hide them well but their survival further than that was doubtful and their fate, if they got back to the other drow, might be even worse. The human male strode forward like a giant and easily knocked aside her weapon. Lara was lifted free from her clothing by the human who smiled lustfully at his shrinking prize even as she squirmed to be free. </span></div></div>",

Here take her too, I will catch the rest of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was happy to take hold of another squirming form. His hands easily wrapped around their figures feeling the wonder curves of their feminine form. It was dangerous to get this close to a drow normally but they had no weapons and it this size they could cause little trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy brethren are nearby!\u201d Lara tried to force the fingers apart but it was a fruitless effort. \u201cIf you don\u2019t release me at once your torture will last a year!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least you didn\u2019t offer to spare my life little mouse,\u201d Nick laughed. \u201cI would have been certain you were lying with those words I am almost certain you are lying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gently placed Dira in the cage but he dropped Lara from a couple of feet up. The trained warrior managed to absorb the pain of the fall with a tumble. Her face turned lethal to Nick as she heard his clapping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will have great fun in dissecting you piece by piece,\u201d she snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can come off of it already, there is no help coming for you,\u201d Nick slapped the cage shut. \u201cIf there had been you wouldn\u2019t announce it. You would have just adopted a superior look to your face and waited for them to come. I bet you are a raiding party looking for some slaves. Rather ironic that you may become ones. There is a market for shrunken women and I imagine drow would be worth extra. You do tend to piss people off with all of the murder and slavery.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara wanted to come up with a reply to put the man in his place beneath her heel but nothing came to mind. She hated to admit a lot of what he said was likely right unless she or one of her companions could do something. To that end, she examined the wooden cage but the lock was on the top where they couldn\u2019t reach it. This new decorative prison was beautiful with dark wood with a lovely grain but it would not be easily broken. It was made of stone wood which even metal weapons would break upon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have any ideas?\u201d Lara doubted the young priestess could help but there was a chance and it beat hitting the bars until her fists were bloody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVeldrin might be able to unlock the cage with his skills, I could send him a message,\u201d Dira responded. </span></div></div>",

He knew he was getting into trouble yet he did nothing to stop himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thief knew there was little chance of changing the behavior of the man at this point so she didn\u2019t try. Besides, she had work to do in Port Haven and Nasty Nick could be a distraction at the best of times. There was a stench to the air in this port city from the processing of whales, very little of the creatures were allowed to go to waste because there was a profit in all of it but the price the city paid for the prosperity was forever having the foul stench of death and rotting from the air. The rich had the best of it, as the usually did, up in there mansions on the surrounding hills but even they were forced to constantly burn incense and scented candles to fight back the stomach-turning odors which had brought them their profits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Emeril had told her that his enemies had been going missing in this city which would normally not displease a ruler but the talk of revolt was becoming more than idle talk and his son Prince Wesley was doing little to quell the sentiments. Seras imagined the main problem for the King was that only the small fish were being taken leaving the big fish in the area to gather power and form rebellion in earnest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer travels had never brought her here before but she had been to places like this before. It was newly conquered territory where some of the old guards were left in place so that the profits would not stop coming in but as time went on that old guard became more hindrance than a help. If they were smart they would realize this and get out, make themselves indispensable or try and get rid of the new rulers. It appeared they had chosen rebellion, it wasn\u2019t surprising the nobility chose bloodshed, why shouldn\u2019t they, it was rarely their blood that got shed. There was a lot of profit in war and a lot of new positions of power that would open up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeras doubted the King would even mind some bloodshed but he didn\u2019t want it to get in the way of the profits the Port was bringing him and it looked like the Prince might be in league with the those who desired rebellion.

Which was founded by the family of Gunderson, near the coal and iron mines of Gunderson and with the Gunderson river flowing next to it making the trading of iron and the likes a breeze. Of course, the acting authority in the city was count Gunderson, like his father before him and his father before that. That said not all Gundersons were direct descendants and only the main line were eligible as heirs to the title of count, the rest had to settle for more mediocre professions and lives. A lot of people in the city carried the name Gunderson and many more were far nephews and cousins from the family, carrying their father's name instead of their mothers. But aside from the strangeness of how much children the family had had in the early centuries, they haven't been the weirdest bunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mines haven't been producing as much as of late however, some blame the miners slacking off, others say they stumbled upon some ruins deep underground of the old dwarves of Gunderson and their automatons have flooded the narrow passages. There is a small bounty for whoever can figure it out, but nobody in the city made an effort for it yet, though some first signs of economic decline have become visible in the outer ring of the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe city is quite famous for its blacksmith district, it able to supply a quarter of the metal needed to arm the entire king's army on its own, while still having room for private requests. Some of the best craftsmen in the kingdom even live there, perhaps able to forge some great gear for the two travelers on a quest to help the kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA most unsettling occurrence these days, however, is the absence of government. Since the start of the week, the private estate in the middle of the city has gone dark, the gates are shut tight and nobody outside knows what count Gunderson is doing behind those bars. The guards outside of the premise haven't seen a coin in their pockets for many days and none of the guards inside respond, nor any of the other staff for that matter. Which is quite troubling since the gate only opens from the inside and nobody dares climb over the 4 meter high wall built around the estate.</span></div></div>",

After a quick check for traps, she turned the knob and swung the door open to beautiful marble floors within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad you could join me, did you stop off to have a drink?\u201d Seras teased which drew a rude gesture from her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would like to see you carry heavy metal armor and all of this muscle over a giant wall,\u201d Nasty Nick complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have done a fine job carrying you all of our years together. Now, how about you do your job and get to work meat shield.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grumbled but went in first, providing cover as she scanned for threats and signs of what had happened in this place. If no one had answered the bell the odds were something very bad had happened here but was the danger still a threat to the warrior and the thief. It didn\u2019t look like any of the expensive furnishings had been taken so it wasn\u2019t likely they were dealing with simple burglary. No one had reported any strange noise from the place so whatever had happened occurred very quickly and took out the entire house. She sniffed the air but didn\u2019t detect any scents of poison in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were rumors that Count Gunderson and his family had dealt in dark magic to get their wealth and power. Dark magic often had consequences and price that came back to bite the user in the rear. Magic would answer many of the questions about what had happened to this place especially if it was the culmination of generations of dark rituals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eyed the distant gate and wondered if she should get the guards or if she should continue to investigate the place with Nasty Nick. </span></div></div>",

The warehouse was an innocuous looking front which hid a den of some of the kingdom's greatest thieves. It was the closest thing to a family and home in her life, and as she spotted Rick the Rat she remembered that many families didn't like one another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick casually picked his nails with a dagger, 'What brings the lady of the night to grace us with her presence?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't hurt that pea you call a brain with talking, 'Seras responded. 'You will only get yourself in trouble. I'm looking for information about current events on what is going on in the South.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Word is that trade is limited, so pickings are slim but lucrative,' Nick the Fence answered. 'Don't know what's causing the trouble but a lot of people are going missing.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Strange animal monsters have been spotted,' Jack the Falcon said. 'Not the usual werewolves and other shape shifters.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Strong indications the cult of Basha is involved my people say,' Karen the Broker explained. 'I would back out of whatever you have yourself involved with my friend.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasha was an animal god who called for the sacrifice living creatures usually in the form of a hunting of the target. The religion was banned after it was discovered they weren't content with lower animals but frequently hunted humans or other sentient races. The King had given her a truly dangerous mission the question was it worth the risk. What should you do next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rogue remembers how much her reward would be if she was successful and weighed it against the risks she was taking. Basha was an old cult that appeared to reward anyone successful on their little hunting trips so maybe she could reward herself with there treasure. She wondered briefly about where they got the loot from but it didn\u2019t matter as long as they had it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravel was the worst part of a trip for her because there was little to do but wait. She couldn\u2019t plan on her strike because she didn\u2019t know the layout or even where their base of operations was. All she could really do was wait and worry about things she had no control over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe arrived at the sand-filled town of Siren\u2019s Grave and headed for the closest bar where the prices of water rivaled that of fine wines. Seras wondered who had the \u201cwisdom\u201d to build out in this hell hole. A poster on the wall called for hunters of monsters which reeked of a trap but could be worth checking out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe locals didn\u2019t even bother to hide their stares at the stranger invading their space and she pretended to be uninterested in them but scanned the room for likely sources of information. A small group of men whispered to each other and took a quick glance at the various people around the room, close examination showed they all had the markings of snakes on them. It could be that they were snake cultists or a gang, either way, it might be nice to pit them against the servants of Basha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grizzled old dwarf missing his left arm pounded down swigs of what was sure to be rotgut alcohol. The tools he wore signaled him to be a miner which could be a good source of information but the heavy drinking, even by dwarf standards was a worry for how reliable he would be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBartenders were usually good sources of information which was both a good thing and a bad thing. Sure you could find out a lot from them but your information was usually passed on just as readily as the information you got from them. Seras wanted any enemies to have as little information on her as possible. This bartender had a couple of crossbows cocked and loaded behind the bar at the ready. She had the look of a dangerous woman who had a hard life and was ready to strike first and worry about the consequences later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person who intrigued her the most was the elf in the corner. It was the first time she had seen one of her people in the desert, they did so love their homes lush and green so was she an outsider like herself or was she a resident of this place. Her clothing suggested local as it was desert gear. The book she was reading was covered in arcane symbols and strongly suggested she was dealing with a magic user. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA final person drew her interest, a heavily metal-clad warrior sat in a corner dragging a dagger across the table but if the bartender minded she didn\u2019t say anything. The faceless warrior was not someone who belonged in this scorching land which made them very interesting. All eyes whipped away from the being with a hint of fear when they looked in the direction of this metal monster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a lot here to investigate but which path would bring her to the results she wanted or better ones. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Seras wanted no part of the mission any longer because there was no profit to be had and a lot of danger involved. This was not good to induce her interest in a mission. Cultists were not likely to have a lot of money because they were usually fanatics who would die for their cause and gave everything to the cult. At the main temple, there might be a lot of treasure if they didn\u2019t spend it on decorations that were hard to move or sell. She had once secured a golden statue and been forced to use a lot of time and effort in melting it down because no one wanted the strange multilegged figure whole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cults like the one of Basha were especially bad because they were in many places and they would hunt her down for the rest of her life. Being forced to look over your shoulders for the rest of your life was not a healthy or happy way to live. Seras knew of a fence who was still attacked on occasion by cultists who worshiped some sort of aquatic being because he had only sold an object precious to them twenty years ago. The cult of Basha was much larger and competent than they were. Most cults were filled with clueless clods who were stupid at best and were more likely a hindrance. Basha cultists were trained hunters and tracks for whom hunting down and killing things was part of their worship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hired a messenger to return the offered wages for the job and her politest apology for being unable to complete the job. Seras knew the King would be than unhappy that she had denied completing a job he had requested but she was more afraid of the cultist than she was of the King. Emeril was a smart man but he had a hot temper. In time his anger would cool off but it might be better to not be around for a few weeks in case he hired an assassin for her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a vacation didn\u2019t seem like such a bad idea, she could spend some the hard earned loot she had taken in over the years. There was the safe house she had built in Curiosity Cove on the pirate haven of San Maria or she could work on creating a new identity with a clean history to it because she had lost one recently in a raid to some guards. It was fun going down the prison and seeing how many wanted posters there were for her. </span></div></div>",

It wasn\u2019t long before Lady Lillian Von Wulfhund was showing up at the spas of Burnuna and the tropical sun. It was fun to go to the small set of islands, she had been there before on the islands and knew them well through all of the previous times had been business and this would hopefully be a lot more pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one questioned her status as a noble, has a large fortune helped remove any questions from the minds of people. All they wondered about was how to get more of the money that she let flow. Lillian was very generous with the fortune of her family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian was instantly welcomed to all of the finest parties and social events. A beautiful woman with long chestnut hair and a pleasing figure was always welcomed to the island and one who had a lot of money was fawned upon. Instinctively she knew that the vast majority of the people just wanted things from her, mostly her money but she loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of her life she had been the ugly duckling not desired by anyone but the guards. The violence of the streets and a starving childhood had robbed her of much of the beauty she might have had so being desired by so many was pleasing to her especially from the handsome prince. She vaguely remembered the stories of a noble marrying the poor servant girl told to her by her Mother before she passed away leaving her alone in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrince Ludwig was rich and powerful noble of the Empire who was more than a little handsome and was more than a little interested in the mysterious noblewoman who had arrived here. It wasn\u2019t long before she was talking about marriage with him and he was happy to move the talk forward into a reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had never thought a vacation could changer her life so much and it wasn\u2019t long before Lillian had a grand wedding she had never dreamed of. The former rogue thought about telling her husband the truth but decided a little mystery was important in life. It wasn\u2019t hard for her to settle into the noble class because it turned out she had been preparing for it all of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of her life she had spent pretending to be other people and nobles were really just better-dressed thieves. Lillian proved that she was more than a trophy for her husband. She knew how to spot when the books were cooked, where to find bandits and pirates and how to spot liars. Those assets and many others proved to the Emperor his son had chosen very well in his bride, he knew the truth of the woman and soon no longer cared. More than one traitor to his empire was taken down thanks to her he efforts and with no hesitation, he handed over the reins of his empire to the pair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmperor Ludwig and Empress Lillian ruled for many years together and produced five children, three boys, and a girl. Under their rule, the Empire expanded its border even taking over a kingdom called Dar. The people prospered and became safer than they had ever been before with the Empress having a very special interest in the welfare of the orphaned children of the lands. It wasn\u2019t a bad accomplishment for a woman who had grown up on the streets.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Colleen Flynn was a beauty with long bright red hair neatly styled to be out of the way so she could work hard at her shop. The rumor was she had a great deal of debt built up by her father that she had to pay back under penalty of pain if she missed a payment. She was tiny, barely more than five feet in height and slim with none of the large curves many a man enjoyed but she was not a woman to be mistreated because she had a quick mind and a fiery temper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with the story Seras looked over the towns to start up her trading post in. The background of having a crippling debt would encourage people to try making black market deals with her so she could pay down the money she owed. People liked it when they had something they could hold over someone, it made them worry less about their own dark secrets. There was a delicate balance in being pretty but not too pretty because men liked to talk to an attractive woman but she didn\u2019t want anyone getting too many ideas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe narrowed down her choices to three, Lover\u2019s Bluff was a great defensible position with only one way up to it that didn\u2019t involve almost certain death from falling. It was on the edge of the wilderness with many hostile tribes and species that caused it to have to be closed off for long periods of time but war was always a source of great profits for those willing to take risks. Selling weapons could quickly earn her another fortune. She would have to be careful as the King had been cracking down on those who sold weapons and his men were likely to be watching the activity of a place so close to the border with the eyes of a hawk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarter\u2019s Corner was a small nothing of a town, few people, few buildings and it was dominated by the Lord Mayor like it was his own personal kingdom but it had a great deal of potential. There were a lot of natural resources nearby, a river that could easily be converted to transporting goods and a nice central location that could make it a trade capital in no time. The main problem was all of the time and efforts it would require to make it something that would turn a profit. It was tempting to build a lasting future there but it would mean investing most of the money she had laid away over the years. It was a big risk that she wasn\u2019t certain she wanted to risk and the Lord Mayor was going to be a problem because he was strangling the life from the place. He would certainly try to strangle the profits away from any business she built and she wasn\u2019t going to let that happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet Cove was her final pick, a small fishing village along the coast that would make a great place to start a smuggling operation. The sheltered cove was perfect for bringing in goods and sending them out. Her major problem with it was how into each other's business everyone was. There was a creeping nature to the town that suggested the possibility of a cult. Another problem would be dealing with the pirates because they weren\u2019t known for their good nature and many of them could be spotted by their wanted posters more than once the notoriety of a pirate had blown the cover a good alter ego. The good part of dealing with pirates was the money, they were very loose with it because they didn\u2019t have the time to haggle usually as they were on the run from someone. </span></div></div>",

Whatever the reason there was no point in arousing his anger at the moment. It was best to be friendly until she knew if he was an enemy or an ally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t much choice for me, unfortunately,\u201d she responded watching for hints of truth from the man. \u201cThis is the last property my father didn\u2019t gamble away to a bill collector. Likely because the drunken ass forgot he owned it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man nodded grimly, \u201cDo as you must but I can\u2019t spare any of my men to patrol your property. It is outside of the city gates with foul savages nearby. You should see too hiring guards and making sure the walls are in good order.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for the advice. I will certainly do as you suggest.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thief was happy to see the man go, so she was able to get to the property before the sun faded from the sky. Visiting the town was a necessary evil because they would likely grow suspicious of lights from the nearby cliffs. She would do a little business with the town to keep up appearances but her real trade would come from the \u201csavages\u201d at night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer horse rode up to the warm fairy lanterns being turned on. They were more expensive than standard oil lanterns to start. The magical lights lasted far longer than oil and were brighter so she could see potential customers from a long way off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have done well Onyx,\u201d Colleen complemented the half-orc. \u201cHow goes the tunnel building?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe goblins are slow and lazy,\u201d he snorted. \u201cI wish we could hire dwarfs for the work.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo do I but when dwarfs go missing after the work is done someone comes looking for them. Maybe you or I could pretend to be a dragon in disguise and upgrade to kobolds. Those little fanatics are at least loyal and trustworthy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like working with fanatics. They are too untrustworthy because they don\u2019t value money.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo true.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had found the Onyx several years back enslaved to his own tribe. The thief had freed him and gotten a loyal worker who was happy to learn the business of making money. He had been instrumental in getting this outpost set up. Soon they would be able to receive the pirate trade in a cave which only opened under cover of darkness with a secret tunnel connected to her trading post. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch out for Warden Narius,\u201d Colleen suggested. \u201cI suggest he isn\u2019t too fond of orcs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood because I wasn\u2019t planning to try and bed the bastard,\u201d Onyx joked. </span></div></div>",

Cultist were fanatics who would spend the rest of their pathetic lives hunting you if you harmed their group and Basha was one of the worst groups to go against. Not only were many of the members' skilled hunters and trackers but dark bargains were often made to increase powers or give magic. The god they served could be very generous as long as their hunts pleased him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shuddered at the thought of being part of their hunts. Sentient beings turned into animals and hunted to amuse a sadistic god was not her idea of fun but she had reasons to go after them and not least of which was the fact they had a lot of loot that could set her up for the rest of her life. Seras would have to decide somewhere to retire far from these lands and the cultists. It would involve a new identity but she actually enjoyed creating them at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutnumbered, out magicked and they had a god on their side, a tall order for even a thief of her caliber, she would need to get more information before she committed to this mission by the King. It wouldn\u2019t surprise her if this was a death trap set up by King Emeril for her, she knew a lot more secrets about the running of the kingdom and some of the horrifying decisions that had been made over the years than a ruler would be comfortable with her having. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a chill in the air as she went lower and lower into the sewers to find a source of information she trusted. It was a maze that few would ever be able to find their way out of but she had grown up here in the not very forgiving bosom of the goddess of thieves. When she was a child she had found the shrine but she rarely visited it. Having any of the celestials in your life was troublesome than it was worth to her mind but she would need all of the help she could get because the other side had a god on their side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA series of locked doors blocked her path, she could no longer go down the path she had taken as a child but she had no problem with the locks but it delayed her longer than she wanted. The less time spent here the better, she could feel the eyes of Nanara upon her constantly judging her just like all of her childhood. The room was lined with amazing treasure that could step up a room full of people for a dozen lifetimes. Each one was the traps or cursed in some way by the goddess sometimes with more than one deadly protection upon them. There were rumors that some had gotten treasures out without consequences to retire to the life of luxury but those tales were long on rumor and short on truth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood in front of the statue and set down her offering before speaking. </span></div></div>",

The band she had formed was really a loose collection of allies who agreed to not harm each other, but when a wealthy King was involved Seras suspected that all bets were off. Luckily most members disappeared for a few weeks at a time occasionally, so her absence wouldn't be noticed. The only thing that worried her was if anyone had noticed her visiting the King because thieves were notoriously curious and would investigate what her dealings with the King were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rumors of abominations in the south were so vague it was tantalizing. Normal villagers weren't exactly very well informed about the things that resided in the world so many times things were placed under one label like a goblin could actually be a kobold, some types of fae, or some type of ghost. If King Emeril was willing to bring one of the most notorious thieves in the land to his castle to hire her to investigate, chances were the enemy was powerful, and where there is power more often than not there is money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeras bought an expensive durack, a giant lizard, to use for her travel to the south because they were wonderful in hot climates and would help provide protection if she was attacked. The large teeth and gigantic claws caused many people to prefer horses because they were intimidated by them, but they were normally quite gentle. Seras had paid extra money to get a durack trained to guard and protect its master. The one problem with them was they ate meat which could be hard to find at times in the desert where they were usually free to roam to eat carrion. Thankfully they could gorge on meat and be satisfied for weeks at a time, so Seras fed it until it was full though with the amount of food that went into it Seras thought it should double in size, and she set out for the south wondering what dangers she would meet on her travels.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sharp eyes of the thief spotted the gnolls and spurred her mount to some rocks for cover. From the entourage behind them, it looked like they were slavers and she had no desire to join the ranks. Gnolls slaves were some of the most unfortunate creatures on the earth as gnolls often ate parts of their slaves during their roaming and made no effort to ensure the survival of their commodity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t sure if she had been spotted but it wouldn\u2019t take much effort to discover the trail of her riding lizard and if they were hungry they were likely to try hunting it down. If they weren\u2019t hungry which seemed likely as it appeared they still had slaves left alive they might avoid the creature as duracks didn\u2019t go down easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeras observed that they were twenty in number with no young among them. There were no elderly in gnoll society as they were all killed and eaten before they reached the age one would call old in another society. Some sages wondered how long a gnoll could live if they weren\u2019t murdered but that was a question only the gods were likely to be able to answer. She swore a curse against the gods of luck as the gnolls turned as they found the trail of the lizard and started to follow it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no use in dwelling on the approach of the foul creatures as it would waste the precious little time she had to prepare for their approach. She removed the bridle from her riding lizard so it would have full use of its jaws in the coming battle and started to load crossbows and gather weapons in case they started to get clever which she doubted. They were single-minded monsters who believed in the direct brutal dominance of opponents they felt were weaker than they were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bolt struck the lead gnoll in the eye socket dropping it in front of the surprised others. A second gnoll dropped and they quickly dropped back behind their slaves for cover on the open desert sands. Seras could almost hear the thinking of the hyena-like humanoids thoughts as she reloaded her crossbows. They were trying to determine how many they faced in combat to see if they would fight or run. She wished she knew which ones were the tracks so she could slay them before they revealed there was likely only one or two people in the hills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeras eyed her gear as she decided on her next move against the enemy. A few good shots might free the slaves as they were only held by a rope which would create chaos and free her to shoot the gnolls who would no longer have cover. She had some explosive fire orbs but they were likely to injure the slaves since they were so close to the gnolls but the expense of them was more on her mind. It seemed like such a waste to use them on simple slavers since she didn\u2019t know what lay ahead on her quest. Her final idea was to wait for them to make a move and try to counter it. They weren\u2019t known to be the best battle planners and she had the durack to back her up. She didn\u2019t need to kill all of them just enough to make them look for easier prey elsewhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had briefly thought about running but it would likely inspire the creatures to chase her after they realized she had disappeared. The real reason for her disinterest in flight was her hate for gnolls. They were truly evil always looking to cause destruction where ever they went. Even slavery was more for cruelty than profit, to please the foul demon who had given them life long ago. If ever there was an intelligent humanoid that should be destroyed to the last one it was the gnoll. She had heard there were gnolls in the world who hadn\u2019t fallen to the worship of demons and did great good for the world but she believed them to be a myth and wishful thinking. Only dead gnolls had merit in her experience, as food for vultures.</span></div></div>",

The gnolls didn\u2019t notice the freedom of their slaves as they started moving towards their prey thinking her shots had gone high. She watched as the slaves started to flee, cutting themselves free with crossbow bolts they quickly made a breakaway. It was a risk waiting on shooting the gnolls but she wanted to give the slaves a chance to run if she could. Finally, she started unloading her arsenal into the band of gnolls causing them to start to turn back to regroup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile formed on her face as they realized their slaves were escaping from their custody. The group hesistated with indecision costing them badly as she hoped. They were barking at each other in there canine-like language under her withering fire, most likely debating what to do. The pile of bodies their companions had formed into a wall was flimsy but Seras left them behind it for the moment as she reloaded her weapons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a drink of water to counter the dehydration of the intense activity, and watched what the group was up to. They appeared to be planning to run after the escaping as they were edging away from her as one kept watch waiting for the chance to run. Seras did a quick count to see how many of them were left and figure there were around a dozen still remaining around. It was a much better number to deal with but still very dangerous if they charged her. Gnolls weren\u2019t very good at ranged combat but they were extremely dangerous at close range with weapons and deadly jaws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gnolls rushed away, seeking the easier target of the weaponless slaves but Seras made sure not all of them would make it. She needed to decide what to do next, she wanted to continue on her journey because she wasn\u2019t being paid for any of this and was expending a lot of valuable resources but it was likely the gnolls would catch up to the slaves if she let things go without interferring. Maybe she could help this once without having it hurt her reputation as a heartless individual too much. Perhaps she could get some money from any loot they were carrying to make it worth her time to act the hero or maybe she could just take joy in the chance to kill some real monsters.</span></div></div>",

They would find a new leader the next day in combat but for now, they would lick their wounds because of that monster of a human girl. There would be many dreams of revenge tonight but it was not something they were likely to pursue because that would mean admitting weakness to the others they would have to go after her. Setting the guards for the night, most of them went to bed grumbling more about the loss of slaves than the loss of their own numbers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gnoll\u2019s nose twitched as it smelled something out of place, something of a recent unpleasant memory but the awareness was cut short as a dagger entered the mind ending the small mind within. Gnolls conquered the darkness but the thief was a lover and friend to it and it was kind in return. She made short work of the remaining guards leaving only slumbering forms left. The foul creatures were never going to escape this camp if she had anything to do with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe liked to pretend she was a person without a past, that she was untouched by the world and what happened in it but even the \u201cheartless\u201d thief was once a little girl who had watched her world burn by torches held by gnolls. Her village was a simple farming town filled with nobodies you could find in thousands of different places but they were her family and none had survived the destruction and chaos of the gnolls except for her and a few others who had been hidden in cellars around town. The fires had scarred her as she tried to reach her Father who fought to keep her hidden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain of the memories hurt to this day and the gnolls would be paid back ten fold for the losses she had suffered that day. She knocked loudly on the log she was sitting upon awakening the remaining to her presence. The lot of them stared in shock at their good fortune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood evening,\u201d she smiled. \u201cYou left our little game for blood and I wasn\u2019t done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started to grab their weapons but sharp pains filled their stomachs as the poison she had given them took effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne vial of antidote to the winner, good luck,\u201d she walked back to her mount as they started to fight each other for the right to survival. Seras laughed that there wouldn\u2019t be survival for any of them. There was no antidote only death for gnolls and the thought filled her with joy as she slowly circled back to the encampment so she could loot the corpses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn\u2019t likely to be a lot of money earned from her activities but every little bit helped. She had taken a lot of joy from what she had done this day and she debated doing it again.</span></div></div>",

The assorted metals shined as she poured them out into her hand playing with them. She loved coins, not just for the value, though that was a large portion of her love, she also liked the history they revealed. They were like a spider\u2019s web connecting all of the world together, she found one that had a very interesting history to it. It belonged to the ancient empire of Isbel, there were rumors the last emperor had gone mad, building a giant dungeon to protect his treasure. Had someone discovered the location?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere seemed to be some etching on the coin, a map, it was worth at least a look but like all things she did she weigh the cost and benefit. She brought over her lizard who started the process of removing the unwanted corpses, duracks were wonderful better than iron-clad stomach even the lingering poison in some of the bodies wouldn\u2019t cause so much as a stomach ache. Her noble steed was taken care of, it could live for a long time from the meal it had this day. Adding the gnoll\u2019s water she had plenty for a side excursion, food was a bit dicier, she wasn\u2019t willing to take what the gnolls would consider food, human corpses were not something she cared to add to her diet but if she was careful with her rations and did some hunting she could afford the risk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt always felt great giving into the beckoning of the adventurous soul in her heart, she remembered the tales of the splendors rumored to lurk within the dungeon. Golden statues with jewels for eyes, the silver coffin overflowing with gems, and silver mirror rumored to have a power jinn trapped inside to grant wishes to those willing to take the risk of entering the dungeon. She had researched the place as a pet project over the years but most of what she found was simply fairy tales to whet the appetites of treasure-hungry adventurers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe believed the mad emperor might still be alive, still ruling over his own empire within the walls of the dungeon. From what she had read about the man, he had been obsessed with trying to extend his life to the detriment of his empire and Seras was aware of there being many methods to extend life, most of them involving foul things such as the sacrificing of people. He would be a fearsome opponent with thousands of years mastering his home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer travel was uneventful through the mesas, buttes, and plateau in a seemingly endless maze. She was careful to keep her eyes out for the limited resources this land would offer her. A couple lizards and a hare helped expand her resources but no water revealed itself to her. </span></div></div>",

A group of robed figures was keeping a good distance from her but they were easy to spot in this desolate land. There was the possibility they were just traveling in the same direction as she was but she dismissed the idea when she took a couple of out of the way side trails and they followed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeras moved to a good vantage point so she could get a good look at them to decide her next course of action. They were traveling on horses which would give them a great deal of speed over her but a poor choice of animal in this dry land. She could get away from them by going over a particularly barren stretch of land and it also gave her hope that the people following her were novices for choosing horses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was always tempting to confront the people following you but they outnumbered her and the lack of knowledge didn\u2019t mean that they weren\u2019t great fighters. For the moment she decided to stay on her path and let them follow. The bright sun allowed her to view them with ease at a great distance but it would also prevent her from sneaking up on them to discover more so she would have to wait until dark to do her investigating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people didn\u2019t have any symbols that she could see through her spyglass so she put it away and continued on her journey. The questions of who they were would plague her mind until she got away from them or got the answers she was looking for. They could be from the King but why would he send them? Could it be a possible rival or one of her guild trying to betray her? Or one of the people she had taken money from over the years trying to take revenge?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one said the life of a thief was easy but if you could make it out you could retire as one of the rich, the trick was picking the right time.

The horses didn\u2019t have the endurance to the heat of the desert sun so she would just have to be careful when she rest because things would soon turn in her favor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving into some rocks she settled down for the night making sure to set a few alarms and traps for unwanted visitors. Seras looked out over the desert but didn\u2019t see any fires or camps in the distant before starting a fire for an evening meal.

Sleep was precious and needed to be taken when you could get it. A jolting sound woke her and she quickly drew her blade. She slid out of her bedroll with practiced experience making sure to leave a lump for any unwanted intruders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeras slung a crossbow over her shoulder and vanished into the shadows. No further sound could be heard so either they had backed off or they were being far more cautious but she was willing to bet her life that she was better in the shadows then they were.

Floxi frog poison was expensive but worth the price as they collapse to the ground.

Many foolish souls came this way in search of the treasures rumored to be hidden in the valley which Seras dismissed as no one had returned yet with a hint of treasure from this desert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCliffs lined the valley leaving easy escape all but impossible to reach the oasis on top to all but the most skilled climbers. Seras considered herself quite talented at scaling places but she had little interest in going to the top if she didn\u2019t have to because of the many loose rocks along the way. A large shadow crossed her sight and she realized there was a gigantic bird soaring over the valley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a roc, a bird with a legendary appetite and more importantly, their eggs could bring in a fortune.

An avalanche of rocks and dirt poured out as if she had burst open a dam. Cautiously she returned to her journey, a little danger had never bothered her and she didn\u2019t she was already close to the top. The rogue slipped to a spot where she could rest in a crack in the cliff and looked out from the darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ride was still where she had tethered it behind enough large rocks to cover its presence. Scanning the land carefully for anyone who had taken notice of her or the noise she had made and she didn\u2019t have long to wait as the giant bird took flight. It was a good sign her climb was not in vain as the beast shrieked a threatening cry as it took flight and searched for possible threats. A roc wouldn\u2019t search for a simple rock slide unless it had a nest to protect.

Moving carefully across the ground darting from hiding spot to another as she made her way to the nest always keeping her eyes and ears on the sky. Seras crawled up the nest to discover two eggs ready and waiting to be collected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeras moved over to the eggs and listened closely to them and heard the sounds of life inside the eggs that were larger than she was. It might be possible for her to move them out of the nests by rolling them but she had a much better idea to do but the question was did she have the time because it wouldn\u2019t take the monstrous bird to check out the valley and return here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shriek of the roc sounded across the valley reminding her that time was limited. She could hide in the nest, it would give her the best chance to get the eggs when the predator left to hunt or in the rocks but depending on the angle the beast came in she would be spotted by the keen sight of the bird or she could try and rush her theft. </span></div></div>",

It also wouldn\u2019t hurt to check out how the airships worked because she was thinking of investing in one. She wasn\u2019t sure if she wanted to use it as a luxury travel vessel, smuggling, or some combination of the two. It wouldn\u2019t be cheap but she had already made a fortune stealing from the people who would be her likely travel companions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn\u2019t do to have a renowned thief travel with nobles, so it would be smart for Seras to take on the noble guise of Lady Temperance Nelson. Forming the guise of a noble wasn\u2019t as difficult as one might think as it only required one thing to do it properly, money. Learning etiquette was easy for someone who committed floor plans to memory. It wasn\u2019t long before she held parties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe parties had been the goal the whole time because though they cost a fortune to put on they were investments into future jobs. What better way to learn where the money from than from the nobles themselves? Nobles were some of the worst gossips or best in Seras\u2019s mind because they were constantly discussing who had spent too much on some jewelry or art and who was struggling and had to sell off some their valuables. It made for easy work for a thief who knew how to listen, and now it was time to take on the guise for travel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScars vanished as Seras\u2019s skin smoothed and became pale, and muscles that were hardened from years of use became delicate and graceful lines as the magic of her ring took effect. Her hair retained the lovely red hue she loved but the locks formed into elaborate curls of a proper noble. An ample bosom swelled into the chest that drew many a stare of lust from men. Changing into the proper dress took more time than Seras cared for and brought many curses from the struggling thief. Lady Nelson had replaced the infamous thief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObtaining the ticket for travel didn\u2019t take long and within a few hours Seras and several other passengers were launched into the air. The sails fluttered as they caught the wind and the magic carried them swiftly across the sky far above the land, but even high in the sky there are many dangers.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The fading sun gave a gentle glow to the landscape below, it almost seemed peaceful but the thief knew the truth of the cruelties of the world below the flying ship. A loud explosion shook the airship drawing her attention but she couldn\u2019t see anything outside her side of the ship to cause the sound. Thankfully, the ship didn\u2019t seem to be crashing to the ground. She saw people gathered around the other side of the ship gasping in horror and she spied what was spreading the fear another ship was approaching with more than a few guns firing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved as quickly as she could to her room but the formal dress wasn\u2019t exactly designed for quick movement so she could get some weapons. Temperance didn\u2019t want to jump ship considering all the valuables she had brought with her, she couldn\u2019t take all of it with her but dealing with pirates who could afford a skyship was risky because of all the skill they had attained in getting that wealth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe defenses of the ship wouldn\u2019t be enough to hold off the attack of the pirates but it was at least a good sign they weren\u2019t blasting the ship to bits. If she was lucky they would drop the passengers off and just take the goods and the ship. Worse case they take the passengers as prisoners as well for slaves or hostages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man stood at the end of the hallway and an evil looking grin formed on his face when he saw her. He approached slowly with his blade drawn, purposely stomping as he walked in an attempt to frighten her. The man looked like an easy target but he would likely have more allies aboard than she could handle so she would have to be careful about her choice. She didn\u2019t like playing a weak woman but it might give her a chance for better treatment or to ambush the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeinting fear Temperance pretended to faint and dropped to the floor keeping a single eyelid partially opened so she could watch the man. The pirate looked stunned at what had happened and paced back and forth debating what to do. He had likely wanted to scare her but was under orders not to hurt anyone so he was debating if he should leave his post or stick around. </span></div></div>",

He leaned over to grab the front of her dress, it looked like he intended to loosen the dress to allow her to breathe but his hands must have gotten lost because they were sure wandering over her breasts a great deal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his attention was elsewhere she slammed the needle into the eye socket and ended the life of one of her enemies. Only a small trickle of blood came from the wound as she removed the instrument of death and wiped it clean on the man\u2019s clothing before leaving his corpse behind as she headed to her her room. Temperance moved her most precious items to hidden compartments and set some traps for any clumsy hands searching through things they shouldn\u2019t be and applied a fresh coat of poison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smashing sound could be heard from her room and she suspected the search was going in earnest now and they would soon discover her. Temperance moved quickly to the door and peered into the hall and an open door at the end of the hall. She debated if she should continue the fight, the more of them she killed the greater the anger they would have the perpetrator but they were unlikely to suspect a lady of noble appearance like herself. Searching for a hidden enemy would make them paranoid and make bad decisions. The thief palmed a couple of throwing daggers and moved down the hallway listening carefully to try and figure out how many enemies she was dealing with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was happy to see that there were only two of them and they were focused on the looting of the room. Temperance suspected all of the success had made them sloppy or they had somehow lucked into a sky ship and she would take advantage of their lack of caution. The daggers flew true into the back of the necks of the pirates silencing them forever. Looking at the pile of treasure they had collected she was tempted to take a few items for herself but decided she needed to get away from all of the bodies piling up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was probably best to join the others as a prisoner so she could fade into the crowd unless she were to change to another form more able to move and strike at the pirates but sticking around was not a good idea because being found these bodies would result in a lot of questions that she didn\u2019t want to answer. If she was quick she might have a chance to get some important gear that would help her later. Cautiously moving from the room she headed in the direction of her room and wondered if leaving the ship with some of the treasure or at least drop it off the ship for later pick up was an option. After all in chaos, there are opportunities. </span></div></div>",

Temperance debated if it was better to hide or go join the others. At least with the others around, she would be treated as part of the group instead of being at the mercy of whatever whim the pirate might have that found her and with this body would draw whims from men that she didn\u2019t want to experience with these filthy pirates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemperance exited the inside of the ship into the bright sunlight to a large crowd of the passengers and crew being forced together. A large man grabbed her arm and squeezed it painfully tight, she tempted to fight but knew they would suspect something was up if she killed one of the pirates so she let out a cry of pain and tried to look the part of a frightened helpless noblewoman but she made certain to memorize the face. She was a big fan of paying back those who hurt you especially when they did it without good reason, the sadistic grin on the man\u2019s face told her that he was enjoying her suffering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook what I caught here boys!\u201d He twisted her arm and yanked her out for the group to see drawing some hoots and hollers from the pirates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough,\u201d the Captain stepped forward with his blade drawn. \u201cYou are getting sloppy, don\u2019t mess with our guests. Young lady, get with the others. The loot might be very good this day but we have taken some losses so I am going to asks our guests to dig deep if they want to make it out of this with their lives and their freedom. Some of you would surely sell very well on the slave market.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand cupped one of Temperance\u2019s breasts, lifting it and letting it drop with an appealing jiggle. She recognized the man as the Skeleton Man, a legendary pirate known for his thin body and long bony fingers. He had numerous close calls with death causing rumors that he was one of the undead, whatever the truth was he wore a skull mask. There was a temptation to use her hidden dagger to test the truth of the rumors but she started to take off her jewels to drop in the bag a pirate was bringing around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I need that dress, I have just the girl back in port who would love it,\u201d the foul-smelling man grinned wickedly in front of her. She paused to see if Skeleton Man would put any halt to this, it was clear he was watching but he made no move to stop it. She dropped low to slide her blade out and did her best to hid it underfoot before she stripped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was easy to blush a bright crimson as she was left in her fancy lingerie in front of all of these leering eyes. No one appeared to notice the weapon, it was easy to see they had other things that their eyes were focused upon. Her swells and curves were enhanced by the undergarments and the hooting and hollering told her the pirates approved of her outfit. Temperance wished she had fought, she hated to be humiliated like this and to feel so powerless. If she got away from them she swore she would hunt them to ends of the earth. </span></div></div>",

It appeared that they were about to be marooned here, her keen eyes had spotted a castle ruin at a distant end of the valley but she didn\u2019t spot any signs of life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are going to leave you fine people here unless some of you wish to join us,\u201d the Skeleton Man leered in Temperance\u2019s direction she responded with a very unladylike gesture. \u201cI didn\u2019t think so. I suggest you chalk this as a bad memory, a bump in the road because if you cause trouble for us we have ways of reaching you so be smart, chose life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were ushered off of the ship onto the sandy beach next to the lake with some clothing dumped overboard for them and a couple crates of provisions were laid out for them as well. The first mate stopped at the gangplank as it was pulled aboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will inform people of your location so don\u2019t worry about starving,\u201d he waved to them as if they were friends departing each others company. \u201cWe have left you plenty of food for two weeks and you should be well on your way back to civilization by that time.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemperance had already started shifting through the clothing looking for her own or at least something that would fit her reasonably well, it looked like they had just thrown out a random assortment and most ladies didn\u2019t have her figure. She finally found a nightdress that she could wear, at least her lingerie would no longer be visible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pirates were singing and cheering the loot they had scored but she made a vow to herself that she would see the man and his crew dead. She started to circle the lake to determine what she could as the others argued over who would be in charge. The petty squabble over such small things didn\u2019t interest her. This valley was virtually untouched, from the air it had appeared that a rock slide had blocked the entrance to the land. Temperance had never heard of a castle being out here so it was likely long ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had little to do with her time while they waited to be rescued so it was tempting to go check it out, but without any weapons or companions it wasn\u2019t likely to be wise but going back to the squabbling of children seemed distasteful. She noticed something glinting in the lake, a short sword. It was certainly magical, not a mark on it. Temperance leaned in close without touching it. Scenes of battle were etched carefully into the blade. This weapon had been used against those who dwell within the Underdark it seemed, drow being slain marked part of it and the other had the hideous squid-faced mind flayers upon it being killed. </span></div></div>",

Dropping the guise of Temperance made her feel safer especially because she had about five dozen weapons on her body. She could hear the shouting as friends of the men she had killed discovered their bodies. It wouldn\u2019t be right for them to make death\u2019s journey alone she smiles as she slipped out into the hallway with two crossbows in hand. The deadly bolts flew into the shocked bodies of the pirates sending them writhing in death throes on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slammed the door shut behind her and placed an explosive rune on the floor for the rush of people coming to find her. The thief ran to the window and slid it open and jumped into the empty sky towards the pirate ship. It was a nice breeze as she fell through the air sending a grappling hook out to grab hold of the nearly empty ship. Pirates liked to look at loot after a score and it was hard to have even a skeleton crew remain behind to guard a ship, she knew from experience.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem would come when she came across the second in command who was sure to be very dangerous. Captains liked to leave their most trusted person on board the ship who was usually very competent, usually with a blade. She climbed the rope with ease and snuck up behind the man guarding the ropes and slit his throat and dropped him overboard. Moving quickly was essential as she cut the boat free and raced for the helm of the ship. If she could steer the vessel away from the luxury vessel she would have a chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large lizardman in leather armor hissed at her as she approached the wheel drawing two very large swords. Seras didn\u2019t know if this was the second in command or not but it was certainly a hinderance to her plans to take the ship from the pirates. A loud explosion told her the people on the yacht had discovered her little surprise and it would be several minutes before they realized she was no longer aboard the ship so finishing this off quickly would help her a lot but she didn\u2019t think the warrior was going to assist her with that. </span></div></div>",

At the last moment spun aside and throwing a small pellet into the monster\u2019s face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt exploded on contact blinding him and burned at his senses causing him to stumble into the railing. Using leverage she quickly used his weight against him sending the warrior tumbling from the ship on a collision course with the ground. Seras had never seen a lizard fly yet and this was no exception but she had bigger fish to fry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raced to the wheel and pulled away from the luxury sky ship as pirates moved to return to the vessel and stop her theft but they were too late. The only way they were getting the ship back is if they had someone on board still and as if on cue two men stepped out into the open to see what was going on. The first looked questioningly at the throwing knives sticking out of his chest before collapsing dead to the deck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second man looked panicked as he saw his crewmates fading into the distant sky and his only visible ally dead at his feet.

The thief could tell she wasn\u2019t getting full speed out of the ship and it worried her because she could see the luxury ship was turning to follow her. She cursed that she didn\u2019t have more time to experiment with controlling the ship but she wasn\u2019t about to give up her prize without a fight far more costly to them than to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe set the ship heading north back to the Kingdom of Dar and lock it in place. Seras had made sure to do all of the jobs aboard the pirate ship so she was well aware of how to man the guns. The pirates had disabled the guns on the yacht during their attack so she was fighting an unarmed opponent at the moment because once they got aboard this ship they wouldn\u2019t be exactly be welcoming to her for her actions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet back here you bitch!\u201d one of the pirates screamed at her but she had more pressing matters than rude language. Most of the guns were facing out the sides of the ship but she doubted they would oblige her and wait for her to turn broadside to shoot at them so she raced to the back of the vessel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo unloaded guns waited for her but she quickly remedied that and opened the hatches to reveal her target quickly closing the distance to her which made for a much easier target. The canon exploded releasing its deadly shot causing the pirates to drop to the ground but if they had been her target they would already be dead. The crack and splintering of wood soon told them of her real target. The mast held but barely so they quickly threw their ropes to catch hold of the ship and board it before she could fire again but she fired the second shot after a quick adjustment of aim and rushed to meet the potential boarders before seeing if her shot had hit the target. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy filled her heart as the rival vessel started sinking from the sky and screams of fear filled the air. The people aboard should be fine because it was a slow descent but she was more concerned about the men on the ropes attached to her ship. Pirates were climbing quickly up but her blade was more than able to slice their lifelines sending them tumbling much faster to the ground than the airship. With a smug smile, she waved to them as they fell to their deaths and allowed herself a moment to relax before deciding what to do next. The easy thing to do would be to sail far away from here with her profits but there was the potential for other rewards. </span></div></div>",

She set her airship to a slow circle back to the crash site as she raced to load a couple of the cannons. The rogue wanted them to think she was leaving the area so they would be busy. How many people were left and how many down below she could count on to assist her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took some time to rest her muscles and relax knowing she would need them soon enough. Her equipment and skills might allow her to take out two or three in a straight fight but more than that would be a great risk to herself. Of course, she had no intention of making this a fair fight, if you had a fair fight you did poor planning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, you sons of bitches!\u201d Seras screamed at the top of her lungs. She wanted them angry and making some mistakes but she was calm and at peace as she took careful aim at the largest group of them and fired. She didn\u2019t bother to wait to see if her shot hit as she went to the next cannon. Her eyes surveyed the ground for targets as she ran to the next cannon.

Seras didn\u2019t take the time to dwell on the victory as the pirate crew scattered. She debated how much time she would have but she was already throwing lines and ladder over the side and jumping the earth below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bluff, she was about the end of her endurance, the pirates could overtake her if they made a concerted effort, with the loss of their leader she hoped they wouldn\u2019t realize what they were actually facing. The chaos she had created would make them suspect they were facing far more than one rogue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you save me a fortune will be yours,\u201d one of the bound captives called to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSave yourselves,\u201d Seras told the group as she started cutting people free. \u201cOne group loot the dead for weapons to cut others free and protect yourselves and as you get free to start tying off the ship so we can take off. Fire on any of the pirates who try to enter the clearing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last call was another bluff because she could see a few eyes in the woods watching the frantic work of the people rushing to obey her commands. Seras reloaded her crossbow and relaxed knowing she would have to be quick in her climb up to the pirate ship so she needed to rest. Some of the people gave her foul looks as she rested but she easily ignored them. The rich quickly forgot those who saved them but she would make sure they paid if they were going to ride on her ships, no one was going to ride for free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could almost feel the confidence returning to the pirates as they saw they were going to be left in the wilderness with no supplies and no means of escape. The number of eyes watching the group work was growing and she couldn\u2019t wait any longer to try getting out of here. Leaping up she starts to climb out up the ladder to the pirate\u2019s ship. Seras wished she could have asked around about anyone who could help her with the ship but she didn\u2019t dare because she wanted to convey an air of supreme confidence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn arrow struck her arm causing her grip to loosen for a moment but she caught herself and continued the ascent. A roar below revealed a horde of pirates but she didn\u2019t bother looking to see how things were transpiring. She raced to the wheel and pulled for it to fly uncertain of if all of the former passengers had gotten aboard but she figured she had saved those she could. The rogue moved away from the wheel to make sure she didn\u2019t have any pests on board and saw a few had managed to grab hold of the side of the yacht below. </span></div></div>",

She dropped the ladder and held her crossbow at the ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou three can come up but no one else,\u201d the three scurried up at her command but a few others were cautiously edging out of the woods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t leave us behind!\u201d a man screamed. \u201cWe can make it worth your while!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeras was tempted but it would be getting greedy. These were rich and powerful people who would want things done their way once they felt they were in control again. They certainly wouldn\u2019t want to go to a den of robbers and thieves. Perhaps there was a way she could make a profit off of them, a thought occurred to her. Time was running out. Her attacks had sent the pirates away but they would likely be back if the only way to escape the wilds remained in the area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, I will drop you off at Port Elmus.\u201d Seras told the group<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut we were heading to . . .\u201d the passenger protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you have another destination in mind feel free to make other travel arrangements.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral others who were not so picky rushed forward. A cracking of branches in the bushes near the man was enough to change the mind of the man. He pushed his way through the crowd and she knew he would be trouble. It was tempting to make a slight squeeze of the trigger but she didn\u2019t want to scare the others. They were already terrified. Any more and they might snap. Better a reluctant savior than a brutal dictator when you had no enforcers to back you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pirate rushed from the woods and Seras gave him a crossbow bolt as a reward. It was a momentary stall. They needed to get moving. The thief moved over to the wheel to get them out of there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf any of you could start loading some crossbows and start firing that would be great,\u201d she requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stared at her blankly as if she was speaking a foreign language. Of they didn\u2019t know how to use these simple weapons. The rich and their luxury servants were utterly useless when danger happens she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow dare you pull away when I have yet to get aboard!\u201d the last of the passengers she had rescued crawled on the ship. \u201cDon\u2019t you know I am Count Lucian!?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I didn\u2019t,\u201d Seras stalked towards him pulling out her short sword. \u201cI have had a really long day.

Doing a little side business wouldn\u2019t hurt as she was working with the King. She quickly had her stuff put in her rooms, so she could watch the comings and goings on the vessel for things she could exploit, and make sure the King hadn\u2019t put any obvious tail on her. She was almost certain he didn\u2019t know about the truth of this identity, but it never hurt to double check on these things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuke Sebastian came aboard and she couldn\u2019t help but smile at the prospect. He was a notorious flirt who enjoyed flaunting his wealth by giving extravagant gifts to his love interests. Temperance decided she would be one of those ladies to take in some more wealth, and perhaps mix a lit business with pleasure as he was very handsome and the rumors said he was very skilled in the bedroom though that may just be him putting the word out there. Jewels and other expensive gifts bought a lot of goodwill and quiet lips if you weren\u2019t amazing in arts of love. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe we have met,\u201d Duke Sebastian made a direct path to her nearly running over a member of the crew who scurried out of the powerful man\u2019s way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLady Temperance Nelson,\u201d she curtsied very low so he would have a spectacular view of her cleavage. \u201cI am delighted to meet you in person Duke Sebastian of the house of Wilmington.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, call me Sebastian. I do hope you will have dinner with me tonight when the vessel takes flight.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would be my pleasure, and call me Temperance. What takes you on this journey, business or pleasure?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlas, I have business but with you aboard I feel I should have many pleasures on this journey. What brings a lady as lovely as yourself on this journey?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPleasure, I have heard the baths do wonders for the skin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Duke took hold of her hand and caressed the skin, \u201cI can not imagine you have skin softer or more lovely than it already is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gently pressed his lips to her hand giving it a kiss, and she responded with a blush and fanned herself. She had to admit he was the flirt she had hope for, now, she had to wait to see if the gifts would follow. This was certainly going to be an interesting journey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUntil tonight,\u201d Temperance gently pulled her hand away from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooking forward to it,\u201d Sebastian responded with a look like a wolf with plump young sheep in its sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t get too caught up in the romance when there was still a lot to see before they took off the ground. It didn\u2019t look like there was any investigation into what the passengers brought on board the vessel but she strongly suspects some money had been given to the King\u2019s inspectors for them to look the other way. Temperance really wanted to know how much was paid out to the inspectors but she suspected the Captain would have little interest in letting her know the amount. Perhaps during the trip, there would be a break into the offices of the Captain for someone to take a look at the books, but that would have to wait until later in the trip because she had plans tonight. She was careful in the rest of her tour of the boat to stay in public places because there were only so many times you could tell people you were lost. Everything looked good for an interesting and hopefully profitable journey.</span></div></div>",

She had seen many young thieves go in without a plan and end up failing, so she liked to think about her goals and what would help her achieve those goals. Her goal for the evening was to feel out the Duke and see if she was interested in pursuing things further. She selected a bright green formal gown that would allow dancing if she needed to and featured a great deal of cleavage. The Duke had been delighted in staring at her chest, he could barely lift his gaze from them as if they had a magnetic pull. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to selected jewelry for the evening and decided to avoid a necklace because her bright white skin would alert the absence to anyone and she needed to test to see if he was interested in giving her a gift. A new necklace to nestle in her cleavage was just the sort of thing the Duke would want to give her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving applied the makeup, the clothing, and accessories she needed to decide how she was going to approach him. Temperance decided it was best to let him take action and react to his approach. He seemed like a man who enjoyed to be in charge of the situation, so she would let him. She had heard from others that he was a strong belief in plying alcohol to women, so she would watch her intake of the intoxicating liquids so she would remain in charge of her decisions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she was ready as she could be and put a heavy sway to her hips and started towards the dining room for an evening of fun.

Finally, the waiter broke his gaze away from the hypnotic nature of the pillow like mounds and turned bright red as he scurried away from the table. It was a nice feeling to command that attention from the young man but her target for tonight was far more mature and experience. There was a nice view of the ground below and the beautiful night sky to help with the romance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, aren\u2019t you looking lovely this evening,\u201d the honey voice of Duke Sebastian were whispered into her ear before he sat across from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemperance was pleased to see that he had brought a small box with him. She was a little surprised he hadn\u2019t brought a bodyguard with him on board the airship. He was known to be very good with a rapier but powerful people like him often took extra protection with them on business. The person was likely protecting his goods because seducing someone was generally a one on one operation though if the rumors were true the Duke wasn\u2019t adverse to two or three on one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she smiled. \u201cIs that box for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat depends on how well you behave,\u201d he teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrom what I have heard you don\u2019t mind a naughty girl. Would you like to try my wine, it has spectacular flavor.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifted her glass and took a swallow, \u201cDelicious. Open the box and see if my taste is as fine as yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did as requested and discovered an expensive silver necklace with many large and beautiful emeralds. It would look perfect with her appearance but she noticed some symbols on it that could be arcane, she would have to look at her books to be certain of the origins. It looked like he wanted her to wear it and it might insult him if she didn\u2019t wear it but when dealing with magic it was always good to be cautious. It was such an expensive gift that she wondered if it was worth the risk to put it around her neck. Men like him liked the challenge so perhaps she could win more favor by refusing the gift for now.</span></div></div>",

The cool of the metal slid down her chest into the cleavage as Sebastian leaned over her, she had little doubt he was captivated by the impressive valley below. She was surprised how shameless he was but it would make her job easier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey enjoyed the meal and had to admit it was excellent food though she had certainly paid for it in the price of passage.

She would make him pay for what he was doing but she would have to be careful in case this magic item had another level. She didn\u2019t want to end up as a mindless sex slave for this monster so she focused her energies on blocking out the influence of the necklace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man\u2019s room was gaudy with overpriced decorations if something could be made of gold and covered in jewels it was. It was a thief\u2019s dream but the stealing would have to come later but there was no harm in planning the heist while her body was acting like a mindless golem commanded by the \u201cnoble\u201d Duke. She had some magical bags that could fit most of the stuff in making the loot weightless. Temperance would have to leave the ship long before they reached their destination if she hoped to get away with the treasure but she had planned how to do that in case things went poorly during the trip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look so lovely in that dress but I bet you would look better without it,\u201d Sebastian said as he closed the door to the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe responded to the suggest and started to untie her clothing and pulled it off. Temperance wished she could take off the necklace as part of getting naked but the command seemed to ignore that in her quest to become nude. Her bright creamy body came into view as her underwear fell to the floor causing her body quiver in anticipation of the pleasure to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man smiled at her naked body enjoying the power he held over her, \u201cYou may be a noblewoman back home but I can see you are a common trollop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he said those words she noticed the ring on his pinkie light up and she felt compelled to speak, \u201cYes, master, how may this slut service you tonight.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words left a foul taste in her mouth but the ring may hold the key to her escape. It might be the control device for her necklace. If she could get a hold of it, she could turn the table on Duke Sebastian. She wondered what sort of powers it held, she would certainly have to check out its properties before using it but first, she had to get the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gently pushed him back onto the bed hoping to take control of the situation. He likely thought she was just being a loose woman he thought all women were at heart and she planned to let him believe that. She swayed her hips with exaggerated motion and juggled her breasts for the Duke bringing a smile to the man\u2019s face. Temperance snaked her way up the man\u2019s body giving his body a massage from her breast before gently massaging down one arm and then the other with her nimble fingers before sliding down his body and pulling off the man\u2019s pants. The beautiful woman rolled the ring in her fingers and debated her next step.</span></div></div>",

Temperance watched the gigantic bolt smash into one of the gargoyles shattering it to pieces but the others just quickened their pace and scattered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailors frantically fired shots at the magical creatures, unfortunately, most of them bounced off harmlessly. Lady Nelson watched closely and saw the wings were vulnerable because even a little damage to them sent them tumbling to the ground. She had a few throwing daggers on her body that she could use to assist but at least two dozen of the creatures were going to be reaching the ship soon. Her large dress wouldn\u2019t be very good in combat so she needed to change tactics soon. </span></div></div>",

Like most of the civilized world the King had virtually no understanding of the barbarian cultures. Many of the tribes were blood enemies of the wolverine tribe but after years of dealing with civilized people their stupidity and alien logic were to be accepted and you move on with your life. Eric Red Axe had lived inside the lands of Dar traveling its farthest reaches in search of treasure and a memorable death, so far he had become wealthy but death eluded him. He didn't have a strong desire to die but rage and bloodlust coursed through his veins and a settled life was forever denied to him because of the blessing of the wolverine. His loved ones were endangered by him being around for too long of a time not feeding the wolverine's hungers and his one fear was he would hurt them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could travel through his home on the way to investigate the other tribes and he wondered if he should take the time to visit his wife the only person who truly understood him because her own father had been blessed by the wolverine. In her arms Eric felt like a normal human being instead of the barbarian berserker with an insatiable thirst for death and destruction. The wolverine was calling now and he would answer because it was his burden. </span></div></div>",

She was heavy with child and the wind blew her hair dancing through the air. Her bright blue eyes lit up at the sight of Eric. Her arms wrapped tightly around the powerful barbarian and the stress of so many things washed away with the love his wife gave to him. Eric wondered if anyone had ever been freed of the curse. No one in tribal history had managed to carry the curse to old age, so perhaps if he survived to become a tribal elder he would be free of the curse. It was a small hope but one Eric held onto desparately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is good to have you home my loving husband. Do you have time to spend the night?\" Her eyes pleaded for the company she richly deserved but rarely received. Carna may understand the dangers of the curse and what needed to done, but that didn't translate into having to like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric gave her a kiss, \"Of course my mountain nymph. My thoughts are always of you and the children. I carry out a mission for King Emeril which can wait for me to show my love to my family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you keep this up the children are going to go hungry,\" Carna gave a passionate kiss to Eric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric growled as she left to finish dinner, \"Tease!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait until I send the children to stay with my uncle and you will see what tease I am,\" Carna laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarna took her time cooking dinner to give Eric more time to play with his children because after dinner he would be all hers. It was well after dark when the children were sent to spend the night elsewhere.

Tonight\u2019s delights wouldn\u2019t produce such amazing results of that night so many months ago.  He kissed his wife beginning an evening of carnal pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarna loved her husband but his wandering ways both literally and figuratively.  The loot he brought home afforded a luxuries that none other in the village knew.  His kindness and attentiveness while present moved her.  While his constant travels and infidelities when away got to her.  She knew the wolverine spirit that dwelt caused his powerful gluttonous lusts.  With the potion she hoped to fix the issue at the core.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic often came at a price the shaman warned her.  The wolverine spirit could not easily be expelled.  For best results he advised that Eric drink the potion while in a meditative state contemplating his love for his wife at night in the rays of the moon.  He must than remain faithful to the woman he love or the magic would turn on him.  If he followed the steps his would be broken forever more.  She asked the shaman what if he failed to meditate knowing her husband\u2019s distractable nature.  The shaman said the urges that drove him would remain in him during the year making it harder to resist pleasures of the flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the night of being physically pleasured by Eric, Carna turned to face him saying, \u201cYou need to be faithful to me this year.  The shaman warned against you straying.  It might be best for you to remain here as long as you can.\u201d  She laid her head on her muscular comforted by his presence.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric relaxed in the cool darkness considering what his wife told.  A good stable woman not prone to imaginative spells she might be trying to curb his wandering ways.  Still he loved her and it might be best to listen to her.  He kissed her on the head saying, \u201cDo not worry I will return to you.  I will heed your warning and not stray.\u201d  Eric imagined the potion to be snake oil at best.

The muscle were no longer as solid as they should be, instead there was a soft feel to his chest like fat that drew a frown to his face. He took good care of his diet and exercise so he didn\u2019t understand the origin of the muscle loss. The barbarian shrugged off the feeling because he had better things to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifted his wife and carried her to their bed for a long night of pleasure, but he would have to be gentle considering she was heavy with his child. It didn\u2019t really matter to Eric as long as she was shown how much he loved her. Her screams of pleasure filled the air as he showed her the joys of having him around until she finally passed out in exhaustion. Eric reluctantly left the bed to gather his stuff to be on his way. Carna could convince him to stay for a lot longer than he wanted and he needed to complete this mission. It was at this moment that he wished he had the skill for words so he could leave a note to express his feelings to her properly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith great reluctance Eric left the building to continue in the dark of the night and seek out the enemy. He continued far from the village when he felt more tingling and he wondered what had been in the potion. He had been promised cures before but it had always ended in failure so he had taken the potion to please his wife suspecting it was just fruits and juices, but it may have been something more. His gear was starting to feel very heavy and his clothing was starting to feel loose on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barbarian dropped his gear and weapons as his entire body was tingling and changing. He knew he needed to get help to stop what was happening to him but he feared he was already too late. His feet slid out of his boots as he started to make his way back to the village and he saw dainty feet that belonged on a dancing girl not fearsome warrior. Muscles that had taken years to attain were vanishing to become the soft flesh of a young woman. A pair of breasts he would have been most interested in caressing formed on his body as his clothing fell off his tiny naked body. Eric tried to fight back against the change but she couldn\u2019t feel the burning rage of the wolverine in her any longer. The only thing that came to her was the chill of the night which caused her to shiver against the cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a long time since her body had felt this vulnerable to the elements and so uncertain about herself. Her strength and endurance seemed to have vanished from her and she wasn\u2019t sure she could protect herself much less anyone else. Had she suffered from a mental change as well, she wondered. </span></div></div>",

She was the one who had given her the potion so she was likely to know more and besides until she was transformed back she wouldn\u2019t be able to complete her mission. It took all of her effort to drag her great ax off into the woods. She doubted she could lift it off the ground much less swing it with any effectiveness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like leaving a friend behind but she couldn\u2019t hope to carry the weapon home with her. She wasn\u2019t sure it was wise to walk home like this in the dark but the trail was clear to her and familiar. The bear robe kept off a lot of the cold but not enough to stop her shuddering. The robe was designed for someone much larger than herself so it was awkward to move in but she could see she was making slow progress towards home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered if her wife would believe her about what had happened. Eric suspected she would because they had shared a lot together over the years. The children would be hesitant to believe at first because of the drastic difference in form but kids always had a belief in magic that would shine through. Eric tried to remember if the shaman of her village was still around or if he was on one of his quests for greater insight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloating Owl was getting on in years but he was still very sharp of mind. They were not friends with each other because Eric believed in bringing civilization to her people and the shaman wanted them to live off what the land would provide. She hoped the man\u2019s magic would help her obtain her old form. If he didn\u2019t have the answers he might know somewhere they could be found. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smoke from the fires in the homes could be seen as she reached the crest of a hill and she smiled at the quiet village below her. Dawn would be coming soon and she debated waiting here to see the sparkle it would bring to the snow but decided she wanted to home as soon as possible. When she was done with the quest for King Emeril she planned to take a long break and remind his wife how much he loved her. </span></div></div>",

Peering inside she saw her wife making love to another man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man caressed Carna\u2019s breasts with large powerful hands causing her to moan in pleasure as the powerfully built man he tore her dress from her body. Eric found she couldn\u2019t take her eyes off the stranger as he inserted his erect penis into her wife. He pumped into her pregnant body as she screamed in joy. Sunlight was starting to come over the horizon by the time the sweat covered couple parted from each other to set about the chores of the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears stained the cheeks of Eric at what she had seen and wondered what she should do. It felt like her world was collapsing all around her. Carna had always been her rock who gave her the strength to carry out her missions in making the world a better place for their children. Were they her children, had her wife planned to transform her into a woman to get her out of the way? She tried to shake her mind of these thoughts but she didn\u2019t know what to believe anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes watched the man closely trying to determine if she knew him as he left her home but she could place the face as much as she searched her memories. He was a handsome blond man who was even taller than she used to be but not as broad or as powerfully built. She wondered if she should follow him or confront her wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe missed the spirit of the Wolverine and the guidance it had always given her, not having it around was like losing a friend. The silence was disconcerting when she knew it should be roaring within her. Eric was angry with her wife but it was mild compared to her sorrow. She tried to call on her angry but it would melt away under a sea of sadness and without her anger, she wasn\u2019t sure she could be a hero anymore.

She didn\u2019t know what the end of his plans was but he would suffer for the hurt he and caused her family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric wrapped her arms around Carna glad to know she hadn\u2019t betrayed her on purpose, \u201cWas the man the same one who gave you the potion that changed me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think so my beloved,\u201d Carna said as she tried to search her memories but every time she seemed to come close to see the man\u2019s face it faded away like a ghost. \u201cIt is hard to remember, my mind has been altered and blocks have been put in place.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you so much,\u201d Eric attempted to kiss her wife but she drew back in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry but it is strange to see you as a woman.

She needed to prove that she hadn\u2019t just been the spirit all of these years that the good that had been done was her as well.

Bellona moved quickly knowing that soon people would be up and destroy any trail the man had left. She knew the direction the person had headed and hoped she had guessed right about the direction he had headed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man had the appearance of someone foreign to this land. His face had a slight stubble of a man who had forgotten to shave that day and few in these northern lands would ever bother to shave as they saw it as a waste and foolish because it supplied an extra warmth against the bitter cold of the mountains. Her keen eyes had seen that his eyes were a bright green in color that was not known in the barbarian tribes so it made sense that he had come from the south. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the trail to the south was solid packed earth from years of use but there were parts of it were still soft from a recent rain that she was depending upon to find the man. Moving quickly over the hard ground until she found soft patches to check for prints. She hoped the man was traveling nice and slow in a sloppy fashion that would leave a lot of evidence of his passage. To control her wife it was certain he had some magic which usually meant an arrogance, someone who would place little worry on being followed. It didn\u2019t take long to find the tracks she was looking for, the boots of a city dweller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnger twinged at her warming her body, she had thought all of it was gone from her but at least a little of it was left and if she stoked the spark perhaps she could start a fire that would bring the spirit back to her. The anger had come at the thought of what this magic user had done to her and her family. Bellona wondered if she should follow this feeling and confront the man and teach him the danger of messing with a friend of the Wolverine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes caught sight of her swaying chest and her petite curvy form and she realized she might not have the fighting prowess she once had. Worry started to plague her mind as she closed the distance to her target. She had no idea what the path ahead had in store for her and that fear started to grow on her but she took hold of the anger within her. It burned her fear away but the anger was not strong enough yet to destroy all of the fear that dwelled inside of her but it could be once again, she felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man had taken a small trail off the main one that led to a small abandoned tower. It was in very poor condition the last time he had seen it but perhaps the man had done some repairs to it. It was the only thing Bellona could think of that was out here. </span></div></div>",

Her nose caught the musky smell of the man and she had to admit as she got closer to the man it started to grow on her. He cut a very handsome figure in the fading sun with his golden hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were starting to close on the tower and she was starting to think she had read the man wrong. Perhaps he had just been comforting her wife and her own transformation had been an accident. Giving out the wrong potion was entirely possible. Her mind felt cloudy and it was hard to focus or think about anything other than the strange man entering the tower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to head up to him but for some reason, that felt wrong. Something inside her was trying to tell her she was in danger but how could she be in danger when such a kind and caring man was close by. He would protect her from any danger that might come for her and she could spend the night thanking him with her soft feminine form until both of them were exhausted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight would soon be gone from the sky and if she wasn\u2019t careful she would be caught in the cold with few supplies. How had she lost track of so much time? There should still be hours of daylight left yet she could see the sun vanishing over the horizon. Maybe if she asked nicely the man inside the tower would let her stay with him in his nice warm bed. She could think of several ways that she could persuade him with her body. Bellona took a step towards the toward the tower but something was beckoning her to leave this place. Didn\u2019t she have someone far from here who cared about her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thoughts felt like trying to hold onto a dream, they kept fading away before they could be fully seen or realized. Inside the tower was something that was real but there was someone far from here who was real, a woman, how was she connected to her? She eyed her body and tried to remember who she was, even her name didn\u2019t sound right to her. Bellona, a woman gave her that name, who was that woman to her, a mother, a sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill wind reminded her, she had a decision to make and she needed to make it quickly. Camp out here in the elements or she could go to the collapsing tower in front of her. There was danger in the tower from the man inside of it but she wanted him, more than anything she could remember, though that wasn\u2019t much at this point. Perhaps things would be clearer if she searched for a place to stay a distance from him because being close to him confused her mind but she wanted to remain close by so she could watch and observe him. </span></div></div>",

She felt certain that he was behind what had happened to her in her mind but she no longer felt in control of her body. Heat seemed to fill the air around her and she started to strip her clothing as she arrived at the doorway. There was no longer a chill in the air as her weapons and clothing left her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand knocked at the doorway and she waited for the man inside to answer her as she reached her undergarments. She stood dully at the door as it creaked open to reveal the handsome man from before who smiled at the sight of her and motioned for her to enter. The place was not in the collapsing state she had seen from the outside. Everything was in perfect order and not a speck of dust could be seen by her as she stepped forward. A fire blazed brightly in a fireplace warming the room as a sweet aroma filled the air. She was drawn towards the fire barely seeing the rest of the room as her eyes became focused on the swaying flames. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoft hands slid down her back as she drew to a halt in front of the fire, the hands undid the bindings on her undergarments and tossed them aside leaving her naked body to shiver but not from cold. Extasticy filled her as she anticipated what was to come next and the man didn\u2019t disappoint her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are as lovely as I hoped you would be,\u201d the man pressed in close behind her, as his hands pulled her closer to his body she could feel his naked form. Her voice echoed cries of pleasure as his hands teased her nipples and his penis grew erect against her plump bottom. \u201cI will take great pleasure in this, far more than I would with any other woman, barbarian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe word was familiar to her but she didn\u2019t consider herself a barbarian. She didn\u2019t know what she was her soft gentle form and impressive curves were not the sort that those who lived in the harsh conditions of the north had. It was too hard to think about the past, to remember who she was especially when someone was showing her how great it was to be a woman. Bellona ground her bottom against his stiff manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew you would find me in time,\u201d the man squeezed her breasts drawing a gasp from Bellona\u2019s lips. \u201cI plan to take everything from you, your wife, your children, and even your freedom just like I have taken your manhood. I want you to remember what is coming but I know it is hard with all the enchantments on this place. Soon all that you hold dear will be lost forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words only registered dimly as she was lifted into the air and placed on the soft fur rug where she was immediately pierced by his penis. The man plowed into her with force and continued to pump into filling her with a joy she had never known before. The blonde woman held onto his muscled form for dear life as she wondered if she would break apart from the efforts to pleasure her that she was feeling. Hot semen filled her as she was finally allowed to collapse in a panting heap as the multiple orgasms held sway over her. </span></div></div>",

The words the man had spoken called to something deep inside of her that the magic was trying to hold under lock and key but her children and wife needed her. There was still a very protective side for them in her new form and it unlocked the other within her. Bellona\u2019s mind cleared a bit but she didn\u2019t know for how long. The magic was already trying to seep back into her mind and turn her into a mindless pleasure slave for this magic user. She couldn\u2019t allow that to happen if she was going to protect the people that she loved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBellona didn\u2019t know this person or at least she didn\u2019t recognize him and she wasn\u2019t going to take the time to question him because if she wasn\u2019t careful she would be screwing him again. She quietly moved around the tower to locate the man, it was tempting to flee from this place but she wanted to end this threat before it could strike her again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take her long to find the man who was busy working on something in a lab. He had his back turned towards her but she just wanted to walk in there and pull the robe off of his body . . . She fought down the thought. Sweat was starting to bead on her, every droplet running down her naked breasts threatened to ignite her into a sexual frenzy. Each step towards the room was a strain on her crumbling willpower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a large statue in the room of a fertility goddess, It had gigantic breasts and a swollen belly, she could feel the power coming from it. Bellona felt the urge to breed rising in her body and she knew that if she didn\u2019t do something soon she would be lost to it. There was no weapon that she could see that would slay her enemy in one surprise blow but she couldn\u2019t go back down the stairs, the urges were starting to overwhelm her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a broom she swung with all the strength her weakened muscles would allow sending a pile of chemicals and potions into the shocked magic user. The man screamed as he tried to scramble back but he was coated in the stuff, she took a second swing to the back of the man\u2019s head dropping him into a pile of shattered glass and whatever concoctions he had been working with. Bellona dropped the broom and grabbed hold of the table arching her back as an orgasm overtook her. She needed a man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou stupid bitch,\u201d the man started to collect himself. \u201cI will make you pay for what you have done. You have destroyed a fortune and ruined months worth of work. I will bring back your mind just so you can . . .\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lost his words as his body started to shake.  </span></div></div>",

You shall soon fade into oblivion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her protests it was obvious she was changing, the appeal she had for Bellona was quickly fading as she lost her manhood. Her nipples swelled becoming perky pointed breasts but the fat started to swell under them growing them to a marvelous pair. Curves formed on her body that would be able to give birth to many babies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is only a temporary setback,\u201d she insisted. \u201cWith the power, I have collected I shall return to manhood and seek out every last relic of yours and wipe them from the earth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou continue to threaten a goddess mortal, it is foolish and pointless,\u201d the goddess responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new woman dropped her robes and started to walk towards Bellona. She was shrinking with each step even as she tried to fight the divine magic. Her womanly features diminished, disappearing as she took on the form of a child. It was clear that the barbarian she had cursed would soon be carrying her within her womb. The means to fight this started to fade as her mind became that of a baby, she pressed inside of the womb being sucked in by the magic, it had never occurred to her the ancient statue would have this much residual magic left but for the time being her worries were at an end as she joined her own child at the very start of life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBellona moaned in pleasure with the arrival of the new occupant to her belly. She rubbed it gently as it shrank down flat but she knew that it would swell again in time. The idea of being a Mother was very pleasing to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for your blessing great goddess,\u201d she stroked the statue which seemed to grow warm to her touch.

She laid her gear out in front of her after some effort to move some the objects so she could make important decisions. The fire she had started warmed her naked body against the growing cold, the light danced over her curves as she decided what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere would be no way she could carry all that she had once had so it was time to make decisions. Her battleax would have to be left, it felt like abandoning a friend but there was no way she could carry it, her body had jiggled and shook as she yanked it aside under the cover of a tree for retrieval later along with her hide armor, there was no way for it to fit her. Eric found a short sword that she could wield as a two-handed weapon in her new for and a blanket that could supply her with the clothing she would need for the moment, its only protection against the cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA single throwing ax and some of the supplies were about all of the objects left for her to take. Sweating from her efforts she laid down to get a good night\u2019s rest and start the continuing of her quest in the morning.

There was always a direct connection so there was no need to work at it, she never had a need for another spirit as the Wolverine was always willing to work with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes were only greeted by darkness and her ears were only answered with silence.

The woman had fought terrible monsters and beasts over the years but this was the first time she had felt afraid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to call upon the spirit of the wolverine but she could not find the white fury in side of her and it made her feel a little lost. Having the spirit animal inside of her was often a curse but the spirit had been her companion all of her life and with out it she felt lonely. The potion had promised to get rid of the wolverine spirit in her body and it had done the job. It had removed aggressive tendencies from her body and turned her into a creature of softness and pleasure. There were many great warrior women in tribes but Eric would never be one of them because the thought of combat was frightening to her altered mind. She would have to try and make some sort of makeshift clothing for the shapely form and get help from her tribe in the morning when it was warmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire helped a great deal to keep the chill of the night away from her fragile form with the help of her hide armor, but the forest around was scary as she heard sounds of life from the forest like the rustling of leaves and swaying of leaves in the wind. They were nothing she hadn\u2019t heard of thousands of times before but they seemed strange and menacing to her ears and she wondered if she would ever be able to get to sleep. The sound of branches breaking in an approach towards her called her attention to them and she wonder what or who was coming towards her. </span></div></div>",

As much as it pained her she would have to let the man get in close before attacking.

Or are you having trouble walking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric knew she had to provoke action because she couldn\u2019t stand being out in the cold for long. Even with anger heating the blood she could feel her muscles starting to stiffen. If it got much worse she would make a desperate throw of the ax but her opponent still looked alert enough to bat aside the projectile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer opponent approached in a halting movement. He was careful to avoid wait on his bad leg but the blood loss was getting as bad as the damage to the leg. The warrior used started to use the scabbard as a crutch to compensate. Eric backed away waiting for the chance she needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you scared?\u201d sweat beaded on his forehead from the strain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHardly,\u201d she responded as she threw a charred log into the man\u2019s face. His blade easily knocked it aside causing an explosion of sparks blinding him to the ax coming towards him. With all the strength her two hands could muster she brought it down upon the clear neck and leaped backward. I<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a death blow and both of them knew it. He jerked the weapon free howling in pain as he did. His death was hastened but he was determined to go down fighting. The warrior wobbled as he tried to take aim. There was a temptation to get complacent but only a fool allowed a dying enemy to bring you down with them. The throw was wobbly and weak and he finally collapsed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe wolf tribe never travels alone,\u201d he gurgled. \u201cThey will see you collared and chained for what you have done.\u201d</span></div></div>",

It had likely been angered by her taking the potion to end the curse of endless hunger. There had never been a time when she hadn\u2019t felt the appetites within threatening to explode.

Eric held a hand ax tightly in her hands unsure of there intentions but they didn\u2019t look like they had any hostile intentions there gear was not that of combatants and the weapons they had were more of a design for hunting than combat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi miss,\u201d a handsome man who looked to be just starting adulthood spoke. \u201cI hope that we didn\u2019t scare you.

If you travel north along the road for twenty miles you will reach the outpost of the King.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small group looked at each other grimly and Eric suspected they were much further off course than they expected. The civilized men had likely lost their riding animals and were debating about what to do about the long walk ahead of them. They would likely want to go the outpost but it was much further and the men were dressed for a day trip, not long travel in cold and windy land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Prince Alex and these are my companions Baron Wilcox, Earl Bucks, and Viscount Vincent,\u201d Prince Alex introduced himself. \u201cCan we take part in your fire for the night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric smiled at them asking because they had to realize she had no means to prevent them from taking anything they wanted from her. The polite tone she heard was rare from nobles to the barbarians of the northern lands but she didn\u2019t look very much like they would expect one of the \u201csavages\u201d of the north to look.

She found she was frightened they would leave her alone in the dark woods and she didn\u2019t want that. Many civilized men were frightened to lose their manhood over losing their lives as if being a woman was somehow a fate worse than death. The men were eagerly waiting for her answer, so she decided she had no choice but answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am on a mission to help calm the anger of the barbarian tribes,\u201d the truth was always her first instinct and the transformation had at least not changed that. \u201cI am afraid I have been transformed by a potion meant to rid me of a curse. From my gear, you can see I was once a large intimidating barbarian man but I am now a rather lovely young woman. I am in need of assistance as well as you are, so I suggest we assist each other. I will act as a guide for you where ever you wish to go and you help me to be restored to my former self.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men looked stunned at her reply but to their credit, they didn\u2019t run into the night from her and they instead gathered as a group to discuss what they had just heard. She couldn\u2019t hear what they were saying over the sounds of the fire but the Prince drew close to her to examine her weapons and armor. His eyes caught sight of the swell of her naked breasts under the armor and he pushed back to his group with a deep blush on his face. Eric pulled her arms tight over her chest to try and block her nakedness and she wondered why it made her feel so vulnerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrince Alex finally turned back to her,\u201d I think your deal is very reasonable and we accept. We will travel north in the morning to the outpost if that is acceptable to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric gave a slight nod afraid they would see the blush on her cheeks that felt like it would burn her face. </span></div></div>",

Being able to survive on your own is good, but it makes it hard to help the assistance of others. My worry is the tribes will never work together because they only trust their own clans and any insult to honor is seen as a reason to go to war with each other. Fighting is often the first resort up here as it usually what keeps you alive. I went to your Father to see if I could find another way of doing things, but I found a great deal of fighting there as well though it is of a more subtle kind. Even this would be better for us because it usually involves less death, because producing life can be hard up here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou told me you were under some sort of curse, what was it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe curse of the wolverine, the spirit of the wolverine lived within me. Long ago my tribe made a deal that the spirit would lend it\u2019s strength to us in exchange for us providing a warrior\u2019s body for it to reside within to feed it the blood it craves. There was a serious danger I could hurt those I love if I didn\u2019t feed it enough death or if I lost myself to the blood lust.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, your new body is certainly built for things other than fighting,\u201d Baron Wilcox teased causing Eric to blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough, we have heard a long trip in the morning,\u201d Vincent growled. \u201cWe have a long trip in the morning. I suggest everyone get some sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Prince didn\u2019t say anything but he did give a nasty look at the Baron before giving whispering an apology to Eric. Eric pulled her armor over her body and moved a little closer to the fire before curling up to sleep. She wondered if she had really lost the spirit of the wolverine from her body, and where it would go. Would it find another of the tribe to inhabit, she prayed it wouldn\u2019t be one of her children, or had it been insulted and left the tribe completely. The thoughts plagued her as she drifted off to sleep.  </span></div></div>",

The wolverine spirit broke into the clearing with it\u2019s teeth bared growling in anger. It towered over him as no real wolverine in real life would and the rumbling growl was like an approaching storm causing the ground to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough of the theatrics,\u201d Eric growled back at it, glad to be a man once again. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have betrayed me, you are betraying the deal your tribe made long ago,\u201d Wolverine raged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know for sure the potion would work, but I am glad it did work for the sake of my wife and family. No person should have to live under the burden of carrying you within them their entire life. I have served you well for many years, I have brought you more lives than any before me in the time I have carried you within my chest. Is there never enough for the great glutton, must you always be fed!?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe powerful barbarian could feel his body suddenly change to the much smaller woman he was changed into by the potion. She frowned as her body jiggled and shook from the laughter of the great beast spirit before her. Her will and strength seemed to be fading from her body with the change causing her to want to cower before the powerful spirit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill your wife want you back as a weak, little, pleasure girl? Perhaps the tribe will sing songs of all the men you have laid with, your strength came from me. At least your form will now fit the weak spirit within your body. You never understood how much strength I gave you so that you might feed me. If you will not feed me I will feed myself and you may not like who I chose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drew strength from the spirit\u2019s threat, \u201cI will see your totem destroy and you forgotten if you harm a hair on any of family!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo the mouse squeaks in defiance, fine, I respect strength. I will make you an offer, come and take my spirit back into your body within one cycle of the moon at my cave in the north or I shall abandon your tribe forever. Without the strength I provide, your tribe will fall to one it\u2019s many enemy. They are too small to defend themselves even with their allies. I leave you to make your choice, in the coming times ahead for you I am sure you will discover how weak you are without me. You would not pose a threat to a small barbarian child as you are now, how can you hope to defend all that you love without the strength I provide you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spirit of the wolverine vanished in the flash of a bolt of lighting leaving quiet and calm behind it to make her decision. Eric wondered if the words of the spirit were right, was all of her previous strength given to her by the wolverine? </span></div></div>",

The Prince seemed so young to be out here in the bitter wilderness, but Eric had been slaying monsters well before he had seen ten winters. It surprised him that the young man had such a good heart despite growing up in the palace of King Emeril. She hoped he would take over after his Father passed because the kingdom needed more people with good hearts to lead people, too often they were trampled by those with far darker hearts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun peaking over the horizon had awoken the barbarian from her slumber, and she set about crafting something resembling clothing for herself. Eric would have to layer against the cold, and thankfully she had forgotten her sewing skills. Though she was usually sewing up a wound on her body the idea was the same. Getting the blanket from her pack was a little awkward and she hoped no one saw her naked bouncing through the came. She wanted rub her body to warm it but the sooner she got to work the better off she would be. As she got back under the coverings of her hide armor she saw the Prince had turned from her direction and she went flush as she realized he had seen her nudity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric went to work on craft something usable, trying to ignore her humiliation. It didn\u2019t take long for her to get something acceptable ready and she started preparing the camp for breakfast so they could be on their way soon. The outfit was hardly flattering or useful in combat but it would keep her warm on the trip to the outpost where she could have something crafted for her new shape. Thankfully, she had brought enough rations with her to feed the group so they wouldn\u2019t be hungry on the journey to outpost.

They glumly marched on to the outpost and Eric felt the need to provide some comfort to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can learn about them from the outpost,\u201d Eric offered. \u201cIsolated people tend to be very nosy about strangers especially armed ones, and a group of this size will surely have had to camp out a couple of the times in the area. As disciplined as they surely are, they like to have some ale with people, so there is sure to be someone in the outpost who has heard something, or know someone who has. Don\u2019t worry too much about the safety of your kingdom Prince because if they were attacking the kingdom they would have stopped us for questioning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it is our duty to find the nearest bar and drink until we get some answers,\u201d Vincent laughed. \u201cFinally, some questing I can get behind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you aren\u2019t careful your gut will soon be as big as your Father\u2019s,\u201d Earl Bucks teased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChallenge accepted,\u201d Vincent smiled. \u201cFirst round is on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others teased each other and started to race each to the outpost while the Prince stayed behind with Eric. The barbarian felt awkward near him for some reason, she felt she know the answer as to why but she didn\u2019t want to admit it to herself. Her transformed body was responding to the presence of a handsome young man. Her nipples were becoming erect with arousal despite her trying to ignore the feelings in her body.

Eric blushed as she entered the outpost because many of the people were familiar to her, and she felt vulnerable around them as they eyed her clothing which marked her as one of them but her appearance was not one of the tribe. She wanted to be away from them and the questioning looks they had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go into the Golden Goose?\u201d Eric offered. Most barbarians didn\u2019t like to eat at restaurants because it seemed a terrible waste of money, and the Golden Goose was one of the more expensive places. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is an excellent idea though I think you might need a different outfit,\u201d the Prince responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am hungry, so let us get this outfit,\u201d Eric eyed a clothing shop and headed towards it. It would be so much better to have clothing that fit her new shape, so she wouldn\u2019t stick out so much. She was glad the others had gone ahead to the bar, so this would be less embarrassing for her as she would have less people eyeing her as she found the proper clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shop had an amazing collection of colors and fabrics but the place was empty other than a single shop girl which was explained by most of dresses seeming thin for the harsher climates. The owner had likely thought the novelty of the clothing would appeal to the tribes, but most people here were practical or they were dead. A couple of barbarians staring at her and whispering caused her to go into a dressing room, so she could change. She had to admit the fabric felt much nicer against her skin and fit a lot better. The dress was a form fitting black outfit that gave very clear evidence of her new body. She pulled her hair back into a ponytail, and stepped out of the curtained off booth to the wide eyes of the young Prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that dress will certainly get us into the Golden Goose,\u201d Prince Alex shook off the stare, and Eric felt a jolt of joy at him being pleased with her appearance. \u201cI suggest you go by Erica while we are in town and let me get you a coat, because I don\u2019t think that outfit will be enough to keep you warm. Just think of it as pay back for the good service you have done us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be nice,\u201d Erica smiled warmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair exited the should a short time later with Erica\u2019s new outfit covered by a soft and luxurious fur coat. She had to admit the craftsmanship on the coat was excellent though wolverine fur would have kept out the cold better. The other nobles, Viscount Vincent, Earl Bucks and Baron Wilcox looked on surprised when Prince Alex and Erica exit the dress shop, but they followed them to the Golden Goose and went inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Golden Goose was an expensive restaurant placed here to cater to the many nobles in the area when they tired of wild game done by their own cooks at their many fine hunting lodges they owned. Prince Alex drew many looks from the other patrons, but not as many as the stunning blonde in the skin tight black dress. Her cleavage brought much envy from the rest of the restaurant. The waiter quickly escorted the group to a table and pour them some fine wine. For some reason these stares were very pleasing to Erica. </span></div></div>",

She leaned forward to listen, enhancing her cleavage as her breasts pressed against the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI took down the Devil Boar,\u201d Vincent spoke up first. \u201cThe beast had been terrorizing several towns and ran off livestock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt takes a good shot to slay a giant boar, I would love to see your shooting sometime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne little pig and you think he is a master of the bow.

His actions are strange as the fear in the people grows he seems to take no action to comfort them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about your old man,\u201d Erica gently stroked the arm of the Prince causing a blush to rise in the cheeks. \u201cHe probably has some adventurer doing something behind the scenes but if you want we can check things out, it might even have something to do with those dwarfs we saw earlier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for those words of comfort,\u201d Prince Alex said. \u201cYou know we don\u2019t have to part company anytime soon. I think I speak for all of my friends when I say we are enjoying your companionship and if you wish we can follow you on your journey or you can join us on ours. We have no special plans, so why not take up a quest together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe honest truth was she did enjoy having them around especially Prince Alex. She was growing very fond of him. Perhaps she would take them up on the offer.</span></div></div>",

The tribes do. This will give them a target for rage other than the king and give them a source for loot and supplies. It won\u2019t take much convincing because war is already brewing under the failure of the crops and raids by the frost giants. They have received no assistance from the capital so things are bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen we should see about contacting the tribes and see if we can get things going,\u201d the Prince spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe could be heroes for the this,\u201d the Baron stood up or at least tried to as he fell back to his chair and lifted his mug. \u201cTo glory and victory over the armies of Dreze!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis brought cheers from the rest of the restaurant, there was little love for the Warlord and more than a little desire to get his land for their kingdom. The land Dreze ruled over was rich farmland in gentle weather something that was rare in Dar. The small group stumbled out of the restaurant with an entourage of people following them. It looked like they were going to continue the party at the inn and many would want to join them on this quest for glory, profits, and an adventure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica knew this might not be the best way to start a surprise attack but she was enjoying the joy and happiness that filled the crowd. It reminded her of the lodges back in the tribal villages when they were celebrating a festival. As she took on the mantle of the Wolverine she had lost many friendships from her tribe because of the fear the others had for the spirit world. There would be some good to come out of this as word of the quest was certain to get the tribes coming to them right away. For now, it seemed like it was best to go to bed and get some sleep so she could see if this still seemed like a good idea in the morning. </span></div></div>",

Her face and body were warm and she knew that she needed to get to her room before she did something stupid. Prince Alex could see the trouble his companion was having so he rushed over and put his arm around her. Large breasts squeezed against him as he held her up and he hoped that she didn\u2019t notice his growing arousal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like the Prince is going to have melons for dessert,\u201d Bucks teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like she is the mood for sausage,\u201d Wilcox laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you want to share any of that warm, fresh, and oh so delicious pie,\u201d Vincent joked looking more than a little inebriated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled up at him warmly and he was tempted to lift the girl up into his arms but he didn\u2019t want to embarrass her anymore or himself. His friends were already making comments about what was to come in the room up above and he knew his face was burning with embarrassment. Alex knew friends were only teasing like this because they were drunk but they could be disturbing Erica who had recently been transformed into a woman and had no intention of sleeping with a man, the very idea was likely repugnant to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night air was refreshing to Erica as they stepped outside to make a walk to the hotel. She hadn\u2019t been bothered by the words of their friends in the restaurant if anything she was turned on by it. The bawdy talk was something that she was used to and the idea of having sex as a woman seemed natural and more than a little intriguing. The former barbarian had experienced sex as a man many times before but this was her first chance as a woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mischevious grin formed her face as she was led to her room and slid her hand down his pants taking a firm hold of his erect penis. She stroked it giggling at his shocked reaction. Sex was part of the natural order of things and she was just going with what she was feeling and right now she was feeling very horny. Erica danced away from him and pulled her top down to her bouncing breasts to the young prince. </span></div></div>",

He flipped over so he now lay on top of her causing bountiful breasts to shake pleasantly causing her to giggle. Alex could feel the warmth of her body and the enticing aroma of her nearly naked body. He started to pull away from her calling on all of his willpower but she continued the attack. Her soft lips pressed against his mouth teasing them and the promise of more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you want this?\u201d the prince was already removing his clothing as she nodded. She had made her intentions very clear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shimmied out of her dress leaving her naked before his eyes drawing him towards her. Alex lifted her tiny form and pressed it against her body dropping onto the soft bed with her. She quickly rolled him over so she was on top of his hard form. The blond placed herself on his penis and slid done it until it had been fully enveloped cooing with joy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica rode on the pistoning body of the Prince enjoying the bliss of the new experience. Her cries echoed through the room as she was brought to orgasm. The joy of having him pumping into her body was like nothing she had ever experienced before. Lightning seemed to be surging through her entire body as convulsed with the feeling as Alex\u2019s hands rubbed over her body teasing her nipples sending another orgasm coursing into her body. Her breasts bounced as she rode him until she dropped on his body and started to rub the giant melons over his battle harden muscles. Sperm flooding her womb as he released into her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tiny body seemed determined to drain all of the fluids from his body as she coaxes his penis back to life. The soft lips wrapped around the penis sucking at the soft flesh causing it to arise again bringing a smile to her face as he initiated round two by placing her on the bottom this time. This time he would show her the command he had over her body. His mouth wrapped around her nipple gently teasing it causing her to grip the sheets tightly as her body was filled with a fresh dose of ecstasy. He held her down as he rode her until he released into her body again overflowing her body with the milky white substance. Prince Alex had never experienced such joy from a woman before and he hoped they would be able to do this again. </span></div></div>",

The others wanted to set up watch so she let them but she had placed alarms around the camp if anyone arrived. She would let her mind work out the details of what to do the next day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind quickly drifted off to slumber as she searched for the spirit of the Wolverine in the dreaming lands. Normally she could talk directly to the spirit in her own mind but she had lost her connection to it but spirits could be found while dreaming and even if she couldn\u2019t find her own there would be others to guide her to be sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was in front of an unfamiliar temple made of large stones, flowers of an amazing array of colors filled the ground with beauty and pleasant scents. Whoever commanded this place was not of his pantheon and that worried her. Eric had been certain one she knew would be here to great her and guide her but she was determined to not be frightened by this strange place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking slowly up to the steps she realized her steps were echoing through the halls of the place announcing her presence. She looked down and saw she was wearing loose-fitting white silk outfit that threatened to fall off of her breasts and high heels. There was no difficulty in moving in the shoes she realized after taking a few more steps. Never before had Eric worn such shoes so how did she know how to walk in them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSerpha come forward,\u201d words drifted in like they were floating on the breeze. \u201cBe welcomed into my temple.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhose temple is this?\u201d Serpha asked, that was her new name, it had once been Eric but it was now Serpha. She was changing, was it because of the celestial being within? The woman walked into the temple to a brightly lit room with a giant pool in the center. Flowers floated in the steaming bath where a beautiful naked woman lounged at the far end of the pool. The blonde woman smiled at her warmly and waved for her to come over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have many questions,\u201d the woman said as she approached. \u201cThe answer to your first question is . . .\u201d</span></div></div>",

If he could solve the problems with them all of the other tribes would likely fall into line. Hunting was extremely important to them so he needed to find an alternate way to focus that attention. His people had been encouraging the start of mining and it had been going well, the trading was increasing in the tribes and they could easily get the food that was so hard to gain here but it left the hunters with too much time on their hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the long way to the tribe\u2019s territory so that he would be able to prepare himself for battle if he needed to fight and fighting was far from uncommon when rival tribes met up. Eric missed the power he had but he would compensate, he had grown up on combat so adjusting was normal when you faced adverse conditions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is an awfully large ax for such a tiny boy,\u201d a few men from the wolf tribe dropped down and started circling him. \u201cPerhaps I should take it before you hurt yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric let them circle him so that he could determine how much of threat they were, the leader was maybe a decade older than his current form with the others being about five years younger than him but they didn\u2019t have real world or combat under their belts, they left way too many openings. It was time to teach them the dangers of the world. His foot kicked into the back of the leader\u2019s knee dropping the man to the ground in a yelp of surprise. The barbarian smashed the second with the shaft of his hand ax, breaking the nose which the man was clutching as it bled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are going to pay for that!\u201d the third young man made a promise he couldn\u2019t possibly keep. He was drawing his sword but Eric grabbed his shirt with both hands and flung him down the thorn-covered hill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf we are done playing games I would appreciate if you guided me to your chieftain,\u201d Eric told the leader as the man collected himself and decided if he wanted to pursue a round two. \u201cYou and your friends can protect this little \u201cboy\u201d from any dangers I might encounter.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnger flashed in the eyes but he decided against it, \u201cMy name is Lucas, apprentice blacksmith, who are you, stranger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Eric of the Wolverine Tribe,\u201d Lucas and the others looked skeptical at his words but shrugged his shoulders and led the way after they collected his friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife halted in the village and the whispers started as he entered, strangers were rare and always of great interest. Runners quickly brought the chieftain out to greet him, when the man saw the young men a grin formed on his lips. Apparently, these troublemakers were known to him and their humiliation was pleasing to him, it was always nice to start diplomacy on the right foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am glad my people were able to give you a warm welcome,\u201d a smile widened on Chieftain Vortigen\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have come to try and quiet the rumblings in your tribe,\u201d Eric spoke his purpose, he liked being direct. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see you are a man of peace. Shall we retire to my home to talk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would be grateful to you, my travel from the Wolverine tribe has been long.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I am not familiar with my restored body \u2018s renewed youth.  So don\u2019t worry about me.  Most importantly thing I want you to remember is that I love you.\u201d  Eric kissed his wife passionately before leaving her with lingering worry.  While Eric lived in the moment excited at the prospects of the new adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barbarian picked a swift horse from his livestock to swiftly carry him on his journey.  He no felt the wolverine spirits anger drawing him to blood.  Eric visited the trolls cavern a notorious bar that fellow adventurers often frequented.  When one of the patrons bumped him causing his drink to spill Eric accepted the apology instead of busting the young man\u2019s head.  He smiled proudly to himself at his restraint.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice from his past called to him, \u201cEric I don\u2019t know what magic your under but it is working for you.  I wasn\u2019t a fan of your former bulkiness.  As you are now you\u2019ll have greater speed and agility.  They will serve you better in the long run.  Now what brings you back this way.  I thought that you were trying to form some kind of peace with Emeril last I heard.\u201d  A lithe male elf sat down with Eric offering his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric shook the hand say, \u201cI am looking for some companions Eltoar in such a quest. Emeril wants the tribes of the north to settle down.  That means dealing with the wolf tribe.  Their cries are the loudest to make war with Dar.  I don\u2019t know if it will involve fighting but coming to them in a position of strength will certainly help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEltoar laughed, \u201cWhat have you done with my friend?  That sounds like a reasonable plan.  But not rushing in and getting help doesn\u2019t sound like you.  Are you alright?\u201d\u201d  He asked feigning concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric smirked, \u201cI have rid myself of the wolverine spirit and find myself thinking with a clear head.  You up for an excursion?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEltoar considered for a minute before responding, \u201cHow could I resist seeing you with a bit of sense guiding you.  Any idea who else you might bring?  I am a good ranger and can act as scout on the trip but a priest and mage of some sort would make me feel more confidant.  Another meat shield wouldn\u2019t hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric nodded, \u201cLet\u2019s see who we got here that might work.  Tara the moon guided might work though she can be a little spacey.  Jordan over there is a warmage of some ability though young.  There are a number of other sell swords that I am not as familiar with.

Arin Lightfoot was a half-elf bard who had come to the Wolverine tribe in search of stories of the wild people of the frontier, and she found the cursed Eric Red Axe to be a wonderful tragic hero and eagerly sought out his company on many occasions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small log cabin had been built on the edge of civilization and the wilderness as was appropriate of Arin\u2019s dual nature. The lovely woman who could talk and sing about many things both tragic and happy wouldn\u2019t speak of her parents. She had known many years of prejudice from both the elves and humans but forced away from the hatred from her heart. Arin gave Eric hope that humanity was possible even though he was filled with constant rage because she had to have experienced so much hate yet returned a great deal of love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat you up to handsome?\u201d Arin asked of Eric\u2019s approach, her golden hair flowing in the wind as she chopped woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI seek your help discover what force drives the tribes to gather for war,\u201d Eric responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it worries the Great Wolverine it must be important.

More up your road is the combat path where we take the fight to them by attacking the Wolf tribe to display our strength and draw out enemy into the open.

The mention of his wife reminded her that he wasn\u2019t hers for the taking. She had only met him when he was out on the road so she had always pretended he wasn\u2019t attached to anyone but the fantasy would soon be over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was surprised by how quiet the chatter box Arin was being on their journey but perhaps she was making plans so he didn\u2019t want to disturb her thoughts. The path to his village was an easy journey because it was one he had taken many times before as he dropped off the bard. No road was safe in these northern land but it wasn\u2019t usually monsters you had to fear here because even bandits didn\u2019t like coming to this place. It was cold here and the people here were dangerous at the best of times so when someone tried to take what little they had, the barbarians became violent and deadly. Besides, there wasn\u2019t usually much to take. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat made you decide to marry Carna?\u201d Arin broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe village elder,\u201d Eric explained. \u201cThe spirit of the Wolverine wants heirs to host it if something should happen to me. As the most beautiful woman in our tribe, she was given to me to honor my service to the tribe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn arranged marriage?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I have grown fond of her and I hope she feels the same for me but it is hard with my duties carrying me far from home, it is only rare moments I share with her. Large piles of gold are cold comfort on long winter nights.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe half-elf liked that sentiment, it was one of the reasons she had moved away from her family\u2019s palace to wild nature of the north. It had been rebellion at the uptight rules of the nobles that she was expected to follow but in time she had grown to love this land and wouldn\u2019t want to live anywhere else. She had built a home here but she wanted to add a family now. </span></div></div>",

Better I face the danger myself with you to make sure all is done on the honorable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they will want to take your deal,\u201d Erin responded. \u201cThey have the numbers on your tribe but I will do my best to convince them. Any contest they have against you will heavily favor them but if this is what you want to do I will back you up to the end.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barbarian nodded at the bard and the truth of her words. He wondered how many warriors they were likely to make him fight. It was sure to be at least five warrior and likely to be more but the only thing he was worried about was being forced to fight until he could no longer control the spirit inside of him. The more men he had slain the more the Wolverine inside of him would gain more control and it was a glutton for violence and death. He eyed the half-elf and prayed she would be able to bring him down from the rage. She had saved him before with her magical songs but there was a danger to depending on it too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric saw the tribe markers of the Wolf tribe, large statues of wolves carved of stone guarding either side of the trail. The berserker slowed the pace of his animal so anyone watching would get a good long view of him and his companion. Figures started to come from the woods at the appearance of these strangers. The tribal elders appeared ready to confront the member of an enemy tribe coming into their village. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSigns of war were obvious with large piles of weapons and masses of warriors preparing for battle. The numbers were large even for the Wolf tribe and Eric soon became certain it wasn\u2019t just one tribe here. A large troll took a long sniff of Erin and licked his lips trying to scare her but she just sparked a small fire under his nose causing it to whelp in pain and back away. It stared angrily at her as the people around it laugh at its humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have come to challenge my tribe Blood Ax,\u201d an elder said to Eric. It was not a nickname he liked and the man was aware of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish to save the lives of many if I can, your people included,\u201d Eric said loudly so the other in the area could hear. \u201cThe King of these lands will make war if you cause trouble. I have come to prevent that war by challenging you. I shall face those who would challenge me so my blood and theirs may end the needless bloodshed of others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKing Emeril is no ruler of us!\u201d an unseen voice shouted from the crowd drawing the cheers of my present but the shaman waved them to silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe tales of your battle prowess proceed you,\u201d the shaman said. \u201cWe will have many who want to challenge you to earn the honor of slaying one such as you. How many do you propose to face?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow many do you wish to challenge a single warrior with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was better to have the shaman to decide on the number so she couldn\u2019t argue about him denying challenges. She would have to be careful because if she set too many to fight her she would lose a lot of honor. </span></div></div>",

He didn\u2019t like dealing with the spirits despite one residing in him all of his life. The Wolverine was a simple spirit that desired battle and blood and Eric was very willing to offer it a healthy supply but most of the spirits were tricky and manipulative beings. They had a far different understanding of things than mortals and it gave them alien views and desires. The Raven was worse than most but it was also one of the wisest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had done favors for the tribe in the past but it didn\u2019t mean there would be no price to pay for going to the place. The barbarian could hear the Wolverine growl as they approached the territory of the tribe and he agreed with the sentiment. They might not be enemies of the Raven tribe but the group had started wars and death for reasons only they could see in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrightly colored flowers covered the ground as they reached the inner border of the Raven tribe. The odor coming from them was a sickly sweet scent that caused a bit of disorientation, members of the tribe had grown immune to the scent so intruders were the only ones to suffer. Arin covered her mouth with a cloth to diminish the effect but Eric didn\u2019t bother. He had been here often enough that he could compensate for the effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had been watched by the people of these lands since before entering, they watched from cover observing the visitors and assessing them. The barbarian and the bard drew to a halt at a large clearing at the center of the village. Giant trees soared high above their heads and in them, the huts of the villagers could be observed. Eric didn\u2019t bother to call them down or try to go up after them, he had learned from past experience it was better to wait for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir observers seemed to be in no rush to greet their guests so Arin pulled out a flute and started to play to amuse herself. Eric paced angrily as he waited unable to be patient, they enjoyed these games to test people and observe their reactions. Despite being heavily in his debt they still treated him as if they were doing him a favor. The barbarian was close to using his axe to take down the trees when several members of the tribe finally came down to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow may we assist the great Wolverine?\u201d the tribal elder smiled warmly as she came up in her cloak of raven feathers. Ravana was a dark haired beauty who didn\u2019t look affected by the centuries of life she had experienced.</span></div></div>",

It hadn\u2019t been intentional, but he didn\u2019t discourage it because it made many enemies hesitate that those split seconds that were essential for victory. The major problem with it was many groups looked to slay him to take his legend for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive orcs stepped onto the road with a familiarity that spoke to them knowing who they were dealing with. Two of them bore the ritual scarring of the orc god of berserkers, Yagras. Another two of them were obviously whelps on their first hunt, and the final one was an alchemist with a belt full of danger around his waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trick would be to take out at least one of the veterans before the rage took them. Powerful muscles launched Eric into a charge sending him forward before the orcs had prepared themselves. The charge\u2019s momentum carried the great axe of the barbarian through the veteran\u2019s meager defense separating his head from his shoulders and it continued its deadly path to disembowel one of the whelps. <br>\r\nRed filled the eyes of the remaining veteran as rage filled his body controlling his actions. He shoved aside the dying whelp to inflict a flurry of attacks against the enemy. The other whelp roared and circled the barbarian to flank him as the panicked alchemist grabbed a grenade and threw it into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric no longer felt the nicks and cuts the orcs inflicted on him as his body fell under the sway of the rage of the wolverine. The veteran leaned into take a bite out of his opponent only to be head butted crushing his teeth and sending him staggering backwards. Eric whipped around to bury his axe in the remaining whelp and tore the orc\u2019s sword from his hand and threw into the chest of the veteran who swung one final blow which the barbarian easily dodged, but the alchemist\u2019s grenade burst releasing its contents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world began to fade even as Eric\u2019s rage fought to keep him awake. The alchemist laughed and danced with glee at his victory, but it was short lived as a hand axe from Eric claimed his life. It would be easy to submit to the sway of the drug thought Eric as the world darkened. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His ax cleaved the first orcs head from the body and threw it at a second orc trying to grab a weapon ending the effort.  Some of them might be berserkers but they were about to learn the dangers of a real berserker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe roared as another orc moved towards him despite having no weapon he wasn\u2019t worried because the rage gave him an unhealthy lack of fear.  The hand ax of the orc dug into his shoulder but not much as his skin was like armor and his large grabbed hold of the enemy\u2019s head and pressed his fingers into the eyes enjoying how they squished before throwing the orc to the ground. His foot crushed the skull and silenced the screaming as he pulled the hand ax and threw it with deadly accuracy into another enemy ending the charge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBodies and blood covered the encampment by the time he was done, and he collapsed as his rage ended and he finally allowed himself to slumber. His mind was filled with dreams where he saw his village burning as the King laughed and he felt the rage start to build inside of him again.  King Emeril had betrayed him after all of the help he had given him over the years and he was paid back by having his loved ones slain. The nightmare woke him from his dream in a sweat and he needed to decide what to do next. <br>\r\nDreams were important but what did it mean? Was it telling him if he failed to complete his quest the King would destroy all that he loved? Or was it something far more sinister, could the King be planning to take the land of his tribe for himself while the tribe\u2019s greatest warrior was away? It was very much like the mind of a \u201ccivilized\u201d people to betray people when you have given your word especially when you considered the people savages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind was one to take a course and go after it so he narrowed his choices to three. Trust the King, don\u2019t trust him and try to save his tribe and finally he could seek out a shaman to interpret the dream. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A shaman may read more into the dream but a berserker lived more in the real world. Dreams were often just silly random thoughts and images, he had yet to become a purple dragon with yellow spots like he had dreamed about once. He had a mission to do and a reward to get. If the King did betray him he would soon find an ax in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trouble with the tribes was likely to have been caused by the orcs. Orcs were far closer to tribes than the civilized world and they often met on friendly terms for trade and mating but they were known to call for war every chance they got. Yargas was a god loved by many barbarians and was often used to exploit the emotions of the tribe into joining them on violent raids. If he could find the orc war leader he could end this by slaying the being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a signs the gods were not with you when your war leader was slain so Eric would do his best to locate him. Finding the war leader shouldn\u2019t be very hard because they would be calling everyone to them to get them ready for war. The problem would be in getting to the leader because he would be surrounded by bodyguards so he wouldn\u2019t have to fight with every crazy who wanted to challenge him. Depending on how defensive the person was, Eric may have to fight many people before he could challenge the leader to combat. This, of course, depended on the war leader being honorable but if he was wasn\u2019t it was likely the other would leave him especially the worshipers of Yargas if he acted with dishonor. That would be cold comfort to Eric\u2019s loved ones when they were given his corpse if it came to that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrailing the orcs back to where they had come from seemed like the simplest solutions. If he traveled in the open he was more likely to be viewed as either a proper challenger or someone looking to join the war leader. If he traveled with more stealth he could avoid these small pockets of violent enemies. Whatever he did, Eric was sure that the spirit of the Wolverine inside of him would be well fed over the next several days. </span></div></div>",

King Emeril had tried to wipe them from the face of earth and Eric had done his best to help the man. He had witnessed their acts of cannibalism and torture they inflicted on others.

Eric almost thought he was going to back down when the swing fell hard against his shoulder dislocating it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spirit took him over as he leaps onto Brun as he started to pull back for another blow and smashed his skull into the nose of the man crushing it. His fist smashed into the throat of the man before he jumped back from the assault of the warrior\u2019s brother. The swing of the two handed sword cut deep into the ground as Brun struggled to breathe. Eric's leg lashed out into the knee of Tarn crushing it drawing a grunt of pain from the man. He continued the assault by slamming his body into the much larger man separating him from his weapon. The brother could only watch as Tarn fought the furious blows of Eric the Slayer of the tribe of the Dire Bear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrun stumbled forward as he recovered from the blow Eric had given him as he watched his brother\u2019s struggles against the furious pounding of fists slow and finally stop.

There was no time for planting and hunting, you talk of being given scrapes when we used to have to kill for less than a morsel of food.

If they didn\u2019t do something quickly they would lose their army by looking weak. It appeared his companions were lost in what to do.

The feud between the Tribe of the Cave Bear and the Blood Ax was legendary and all were eager to see how it would end. Would the legend finish the genocidal journey he had started or would the Chieftain end the murder spree to win back the honor of his tribe? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarc had tried to call upon the spirit of his tribe before but all he had ever gotten was some angry distant rumbling. Perhaps the shamans of his tribe could explain but they had been slain long ago. He would be doing this battle alone and he intended to end it quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swing of the Chieftain sent Eric tumbling across the ground even with the deflection of the mace. His muscles cried out for rest and time to heal but he refused with being so close to his longtime dream. Eric swung at the man\u2019s legs causing him to jump back from the attack but he was already propelling himself forward for another attack against the smaller figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope started to swell in the Chieftain as the battle continued, his opponent was suffering greatly from his injuries. He was struggling even to defend himself much less return the attack but he didn\u2019t dare slow down his onslaught. It wouldn\u2019t be long before the man took an injury that would doom him but it started to worry him that the man wasn\u2019t getting any slower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain and weakness faded from his body as Eric faded into his element, battle. He was never as at home as when he was fighting for his life or someone else\u2019s life. The Wolverine could be seen by him watching the battle, waiting for him to earn its assistance. With a smile, he accepted the challenge dropping his ax to the shock of the crowd and more importantly his opponent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand shot for the face managing to gouge out one eye as the man turned from the attack. Barc drew back in fear as he could see the ancient animal spirit take hold of the man as it had the day so long ago. Eric let loose a beastly sound that was a mix of animal and man drawing pleased cries from the crowd especially as he kicked aside his weapon but Barc wasn\u2019t about to drop his own and lose his advantage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no more defense in the charge of Eric and he was met by the mace breaking ribs but his hands had already grabbed hold of the larger man and pulled him to his goal. The barbarian\u2019s teeth tore through the flesh of the throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarc was a dead man and all present knew it. Cheers to victory filled the air as the drow and lizardman slunk away to avoid the wrath of the crowd now that they had a new champion. The Chieftan was left alone on the ground to die and join his ancestors as a failure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA champion deserves a prize,\u201d a shaman stepped forward from the crowd. \u201cWe are yours to command. The spirits are honored by your victory, never have I seen one so connected to the world of the spirits. I offer you more than the service of my tribe I offer you a gift. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Leather straps bound the woman\u2019s hands and feet making a jerky movement. Underneath a heavy layer of dirt, a beautiful woman could be seen, her emerald eyes gave him a challenge to him, daring him to act against her will despite her bound situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe has a lot of fight in her, she will produce great warriors for you,\u201d the shaman smiled. \u201cHer tongue is as sharp as any blade.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thank you for such a fine gift,\u201d Eric didn\u2019t want a slave but refusing the woman might start a battle, not something he was interested in after the fight he just had, his body cried at him to find somewhere to curl up for three days to heal. \u201cI would buy a horse to carry my prize home with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jingled his coin purse bringing an immediate rush to bring forth the finest animals, Eric enjoyed complimenting many of the fine specimens he found, giving a little smirk when he saw markings of the army of the kingdom of Dar\u2019s army on more than a few of the animals. After a suitable debate he selected two of the larger animals that could be converted to farm work later if he wanted, they would be more than strong enough to carry his large frame and the tiny burden he had for the time being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish all of you the best but I am heading home for I need no help breaking in such a fine new animal,\u201d the crowd laughed and more than a few offered him lewd suggestions that could make a sailor blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhaustion started to take hold of him by the time he had put a short distance from the encampment, it was tempting to push on but he had grown wise enough to stop and set up camp before he started making bad decisions. He released the girl from the straps binding her to the animal, she lashed out at him with a swing at one of his wounds but he pushed her to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can strap you to a tree, bound and gagged if that tickles your fancy or you can sleep on a soft bedroll, the choice is yours,\u201d he cautious moved to remove the gag to hear her answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t lost so much pride as to share a bed with a savage!\u201d she gave him a deadly glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is no intention to share with such a beast as yourself on my part,\u201d he tossed her a separate bedroll. \u201cI am hungry and tired so I will eat and sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelease me!\u201d she commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, if that is what you want but it would be most unwise to flee this camp.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sharp knife made short work of the straps holding her captive, she rushed forward as soon as she was free to jump on the closest horse but stopped when she saw Eric making no move to stop her, he continued the task of making camp, starting a fire, and making a meal for the evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean it is unwise for me to escape?\u201d she asked cautiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are not far from the great encampment you were just at,\u201d Eric didn\u2019t even bother looking up from his work. \u201cYou have no food, no weapon, no idea where you are, and barbarians all around who would be happy to make a slave of one as pretty as you so go if you want many have made such stupid decisions before and many more will make such stupid decisions in the future.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you propose I do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTravel with me to my tribe and I will give you food, money, and horse so you can get where you want to be in return I get the joy of returning freedom to someone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for helping me, you see I am really . . .\u201d </span></div></div>",

Either way, I will deal with it better in the morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn\u2019t satisfy the buxom blonde who stalked around the barbarian and stared at him. She practically glowed red with rage as the eye of the man slid back open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need your help,\u201d she commanded. The attitude was enough to make Eric suspect she was telling the truth. It took practice to form such an entitled attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were offered freedom from me. What more could you want?\u201d irritation was sneaking into his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe must go immediately to overthrown my father. He is responsible for my current condition and must pay for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing must be done immediately. People and more importantly horses need sleep.

My heroics require payment and I can clearly see you have no coins on your body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body blushed to a beautiful red as she tried to cover her body. Henry pouted at the barbarian\u2019s amused chuckling. A thought suddenly occurred and she started to sway as she approached Eric displaying all of her wonderful curves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is one thing I can pay you with,\u201d she leaned forward giving him a view of perhaps the finest breasts he had seen and he had seen many. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you certain you wish to part with such a gem?\u201d Eric was on his feet in an instant with his battle harden muscles pressed against her soft flesh. She squealed in surprise as she felt his hardened penis against her. \u201cYou were a real ladies man. Do those skills translate?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last words had been whispered softly into her ear with primal hunger. Suddenly she was released for a hard fall to the ground. Blinking in surprise she heard the laughter of the warrior telling her she had been messed with again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t suggest you offer me such a tantalizing prize,\u201d He dropped back under his blanket. \u201cNext time I might just take it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric thanked the gods when he heard her shift under her blanket allowing him to sleep. The fire had faded to nothing but embers when he heard the quiet approach of someone. Dawn was just hinting that it wanted to peek over the horizon but his keen eyes recognized the form of the naked woman. She crawled under the blanket with him. Her engorged nipples just touch his bare torso. </span></div></div>",

He had seen the man betray those who were loyal to him in the past to help his kingdom and there were many reasons to throw aside a barbarian and his tribe. As times became more peaceful civilization liked to push outwards into the wilderness. His land was not fertile ground so there had to be another reason, metal or something else that could be pulled from the earth would give a justification to the slaughtering of a people. Fear grew in him and he found his path turning towards his village. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t have any certainty that he was right but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to check, King Emeril had been very vague about the threat to the north, had it all been a ruse to lead him away from his people. Without men to lead he would be just a lone warrior fighting a lost cause. Most of the warriors would be away from the village this time of year trying to slay mammoths for the approaching winter and they wouldn\u2019t expect an ambush on the way back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body wanted to walk but it kept going faster as the possibility of an attack festered and grew in his mind. Why hadn\u2019t the King slain or caught him in the city if treason was happening, he tried to calm his mind but it did little good. An incident in the city would have spread the news far and wide and there were many who were sympathetic to the barbarians for the assistance they had given Dar over the years, no it would be better for him to die against one of the dangers lurking out in the tribal territories or at least get back too late to find evidence of what had really happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of fire tickled his nose and he knew that he was getting close to people but he couldn\u2019t be sure who they were, he slowed his pace so he could listen and rest for any battle that was to come. Metal clanked and pack animals being prepared for the work of the day could be heard. It was a patrol of the King\u2019s men and they appeared to be on their way to his village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Eric tried to keep the anger from his voice but the men were clearly surprised to see him and they were afraid but a warrior with an ax often inspired fear in others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe distinctive sound of a sword exiting the sheath came from behind him, \u201cThe more important question is who are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barbarian whipped around slapping aside and smashing his fist into the face of the man dropping him to the ground, \u201cDon\u2019t threaten me, I came out here unarmed so we can talk but if you want to fight, I am more than happy to supply you with one.\u201d</span></div></div>",

They appeared to be traders so with more than a little effort he got up to his feet drawing smiles from the people to see that he was still alive. Eric would have been a little happier if they didn\u2019t use a stick to wake him as if he was some sort of animal instead of a human being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up to his full height and was disturbed to discover that he barely reached the shoulders of the men surrounding him. The barbarian was used to towering over other humans so unless he was around a group of giants, he had shrunk. He growled at what the alchemist had done to him but it came out more like a purr and knew that his size was not the only thing that had changed about him or rather her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was a female with large breasts hanging from his chest as long crimson locks spilled into view. The men around her appeared to be leering at the impressive cleavage and she became flush with anger at their behavior but tried to calm herself as she realized she wasn\u2019t carrying a weapon with her at the moment. She stormed away from them to gather her equipment and tried to prevent her hide armor from falling to the ground to reveal her naked body to the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe corpses had fresh spear holes in their bodies, likely to make sure they were dead but thankfully they weren\u2019t picked clean so she was able to collect the hand ax from the body of the alchemist and took the remaining potions and herbs from the body. There was a chance that there was an antidote from the condition she suffering from but she doubted it. Orcs believed those that had accidents should suffer the consequences for their errors but if the orc had more of the potion that transformed Eric might find a path to a cure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened here, young lady?\u201d One of the guards asked her as he leaned on his spear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe orcs wanted to take me as a slave but they found I was unwilling,\u201d Eric gathered the remainder of her weapons though the effort to lift her great ax was a lot more than she was used to.

The Wolf tribe was dedicated to the advancement of the barbarian tribes and that usually meant the destruction of shrines and symbols of the past, and the curse of the wolverine had been around since the dawning of the tribe. Assassination attempts had come early and often against Eric and those sort of things build hate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe path to the Wolf clan was familiar to Eric who had used it many times on blood hunts. Eric decided to use the main road because he had never been particularly good at stealth, not that he had ever needed it. Nearly two hundred barbarians called the village of the Wolf home including the tribal elders who were Eric\u2019s main target, because killing them would end the threat of the tribe as a power struggle for who would take over occurred. Guards from the village spotted him as he drew near the village and rushed to meet him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric swung his battle axe without breaking his stride leaving the guard\u2019s corpses to rot in the sun. Heaving his two-handed battle axe it flew straight into a man as he exited his home ending his life. Roars of rage and hatred arose from the village as they realized they were under attack. Panic set into many as two more screams of impending death filled the air. Eric depended on the terror of the unknown to throw the village into unthinking panic where mistakes would be made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople mostly rushed to get their individual families to safety as the sounds of death filled the air causing many to think a much larger force was attacking.  Eric helped to preserve this thought by using his hand axes and throwing daggers to spread death to various locations within the village. His mind filled with a hyper focus as it always did in combat as the wolverine called out for combat. Life was easy to take for Eric and he accepted the calling of the wolverine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the elders revealed themselves as they tried to calm the village against the threat. They had gathered many of their warriors to protect themselves, but it would do them little good because the bloodlust had claimed Eric. When the bloodlust took over he was no longer Eric Blood Axe, but the Wolverine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is only one man,\u201d called out one elder. \u201cTake the young to the great hall and the warriors should . . .\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words were cut off as the Wolverine launched itself from a nearby roof into the group bringing his clawed fist down crushing the skull of the elder. The Wolverine swung his bladed arm into the back of the neck of one of the warriors as he bit down with his teeth into the throat of a second elder.  The clawed fist lashed out disemboweling a third elder leaving two surviving elders. Two warriors swung blades at the Wolverine who dodge towards one of warriors grabbing it and thrusting it into the fourth elder as he ripped the throat out of the warrior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd was closing around the last elder to protect him from the blood soaked berserker, but he would not be denied and launched himself at the last elder cutting down two of the warriors even as their blades struck home.  Fear filled the eyes of the last elder as the berserker bore down on him, and grabbed him. The elder\u2019s fears were soon realized as the Wolverine smashed his helmet repeatedly into elder\u2019s skull slaying him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strength which had filled him vanished with his accomplished mission. He was once again Eric even though he wondered how much longer he would be with how severe his wounds were and many warriors looming over him with menace in their eyes. Even the strength to keep his eyes open failed him as he blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was with more than a little surprise that Eric woke up with his wounds properly bandaged. He had been strapped to a pole in the village square surrounded by angry members of the Wolf clan. His fate didn't look good as he saw a young man dressed as a shaman approached Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thank you berserker for slaying the elders,\" the Shaman spoke. \"With them dead the clan calls for the old ways and I gain power when I thought I would be exiled. You should be happy because I will make peace with the Wolverine clan and join with them against the invaders from the ring of fire.Unfortunately for you an example must be made of you. The spirits shall decide your punishment though I will assure you that you shall live. The spirits have told me they have no desire for your death.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubmitting to the punishment might be for the best but submitting had never been the strong suit of the barbarian. What should Eric Blood Axe do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Coming off the fresh victory against the wolf clan his legend would grow.  It might mean more challengers which brought a melancholy.  No fear of the challengers only regret at the possible loss of good clan warriors.  The wolverine spirit pushed him too far when he faced opponents.  His ability to stop fighting failed him.  He buried more than his share of honorable clansmen who stood in his path after his berserk rage overtook him.  This fact made even other clansmen leery of him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis fear that others felt about him and his strength would cause them to hesitate if they wished to refuse him.

The ancient stone markers signaled the border.  Warmth entered him as he walked.  The barrier between man and spirit felt thinner on these lands.  The wolverine spirit that dwelt within warmed him as its hunger grew.  He repressed it for now.  Hopefully his will could keep it repressed until he left.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw clans wandering about talking with each other free until they saw him.

Let their judgement fall upon me.\" As his words Eric Blood Axe fell to his knees and prayed for the spirits of clan to watch over his family no matter his fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shaman now spoke.\"I will look after your family if you are unable to after the judgement. Your sacrifice and wisdom will be known to them. Trust in the spirits as they have vision beyond our own.\"<br>\r\nThe words were of small comfort to Eric as he heard the howls of unearthly wolves. Eric's pulse quickened as the air stilled and cooled. Suddenly energy struck him in the chest sending him to his back. All the clothe touching him dissolved leaving Eric naked. The force inside his chest started to pulse throughout his body. Eric clawed at the ground with his fingers as his skin tightened. Bones started shifting inside him diminishing him. Eric's hard earned muscles began dwindling. He could see his chest expanding and developing into a set of very bountiful breasts.<br>\r\n\"No!\" Eric cried in a voice that seemed alien to the low gruff voice he once had, \"What could the spirits mean by this.\" He finally had control of his body again as the changes continued unabated. Eric brought his hands up in front his eyes to witness the the effects of the tingling in them. Callouses and scars from a hard life faded with the tingling. Strong hands that once strangled orcs and pummeled men contract into delicate soft hands. These dainty hands weren't designed for battle. They were made for gentleness.<br>\r\nThe shaman stared in wonderment of the spirits power. Where once laid a powerful warrior a nubile woman seemed to be taking his place. The warrior's trunk like legs dwindled into smooth shapely legs. The shaman spoke calmly,\"The spirits that dwell beside us are wise beyond our knowing. You will see this new journey they have set you on is the right one. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Shaman's effort to reassure Eric Blood Axe failed miserably. He thought about getting but the tightening of his stomach as it narrowed made him nauseous. Eric felt the shifting in his stomach and worried about what was going on. His fear realized with a pulling sensation in his groin. Eric felt his balls being sucked into his body with his shaft being drawn in at the same time. At this he put his hands to his face only to recognize the familiar shifting there.<br>\r\nHair spilled from Eric's head in cascades. As the former slayer of men drew his hands away from his face nothing remained of the gruff figure. The shaman only saw a buxom young maiden before him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wiggling her fertile hips in an enticing display for the man before her. \"What do you think my new name should be? I don't think I look much like an Erik anymore.\" She giggled causing hefty bust to jiggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shaman thought about his duty to this once powerful warrior.

Her lips locked with his as she passionately kissed him. Her hands made their way to Tait's groin and worked to release his engorged manhood. Once freed she impaled herself on it moaning in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeanna rhythmically slid up and down the swollen dick that brought waves of pleasure to her. Tait took control and rolled Leanna onto her back and continued to pump into her. She cried out in ecstasy when he began to massage her enormous breasts. The nipples radiated arousal at the able ministrations. She wrapped her legs around Tait's fit body so that she might pull him even deeper into her body. Her hands clutched at the ground as her body quivered in the grip of an orgasm. Tait drove into the sensual beauty before him. Leanna said, \"Fill me with your seed that I may fulfill my duty to bear you many child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeanna tightened her legs around the young man before her. He tensed up and released numerous waves of semen into her fertile body. She gave a satisfied smile to it and drew him for a loving kiss. They made love into the evening when only hunger and exhaustion broke apart their intertwined bodies. She dutifully cooked dinner for them and waited on Tait. Her new found submissiveness only began to bother her now that she was sexually satisfied. </span></div></div>",

It went against her core nature so she decided to run away.  Leanna would exhaust Tait and wait for him to sleep.  She knew the female spirit in her came up with the idea how.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTait worked up a mixture that would help him commune with spirits.  A few of the ingredients missing but a start of a powerful mixture.  Tomorrow he would send tribal members to retrieve the rest.  Yes, soon the return to honoring spirits must continue.  The rewards already began with Leanna.  His future children leaders of their tribe.  Uniting the tribe to fight their common threats.  Leanna sauntered into the room hips swaying as she knelt before him.  She fished out Tait\u2019s manhood massaging it gently with her smooth hand.  She proceeded to wet her lips before beginning to suck on it.  Her tongue caressing as she squeezed from below trying to draw out the salty juices.  Tait soon spurted into her mouth.

Perhaps the only thing that kept them in check from destroying the surface world that they hated so much was the hate they held for each other. Houses would slay each other on a regular basis. Eric had not had many dealings with the foul creatures but he was certainly interested in stopping any plans they had. He had come across the scars they had placed in the world in the past, death and destruction were their stock and trade. One of their favorite things was poison they used to befoul water sources and turn their already dangerous blades truly deadly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t hard to find an entrance to the Underdark but finding your way back out was much harder to do. Eric entered the cave that would lead him into the dark world of the underground with little fear because he had fought many enemies over the years and always came out on top.

The barbarian could hear some voices coming towards the entrance, they sounded like goblins but he couldn\u2019t understand the language but the spirit of the Wolverine within him could smell the fear from them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir footsteps were cautious as they enter the cave and Eric listened closely for the number and he was glad there was no sound of giant footsteps. This was likely just a small patrol who wouldn\u2019t be missed for a long time. Goblins were not the most organized creatures and fire giants considered them too far beneath them to keep good track of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first goblin turned the corner with his blade drawn and Eric's foot kicked him to the ground before stomping on his skull ending the life of the creature as he plowed forward into the armed group. His hand axes cleaved into skulls of a pair of the goblins ending them and let loose his grip on the weapons to continue the attack before the surprise left the monsters. His hands twisted head around of another goblin snapping the neck of another and his elbow whipped back to smash in the face of a goblin. He seethed with the bloodlust calling for more violence, he wanted more death but the enemies were all dead. Perhaps he should go out and see if there were more out there to kill. </span></div></div>",

It wasn\u2019t in his nature to not focus on the job at hand and finish the work before him. What was or wasn\u2019t out there would have to wait or wade through the corpses he left behind him because he was going to destroy this place. The longer he delayed, the more that he fought, the more likely he was to be stopped in his task. Sweat poured down his face as he reached the furnaces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire giants liked things hot to the point most creature would be miserable but the barbarian was not only familiar with the cold he had faced creatures who liked fire and the heat. He smashed open the exit to the tunnel that had rusted shut with time. Dust and cobwebs filled the room and to his surprise, a four-foot spider dropped on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe threw the monster from his body but it quickly recovered to shoot a spray of webbing at his body. The warrior used his axe as a shield against the attack and it was soon coated in webbing before he sidestepped and brought it down with deadly intent slaying the arachnid. Pressing through the webbing he came upon a rock slide that hid the room from the rest of this place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing slowly over the loose rocks he could peer down a long hallway that had several doors but it looked poorly cleaned and maintained. It was likely the slave quarters, likely none of them knew that freedom lay just a short distance from them and they were probably prey for the spider he had just slain, they would be too weak to defend themselves after long days of work as slaves.</span></div></div>",

The fire giant patrol with precision as would be expected of the militaristic creatures but he was surprised to see him here, usually lesser beings were put in charge of the slaves but things were bound to go wrong in any quest so it was best to deal with it than to ponder why it had occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis keen eyes looked for weakness or flaw in the armor to strike at with surprise but it was well built as was most fire giant wares when it came to weapons and armor. This would be an involved fight with an experienced fighter which was sure to cause a lot of noise, Eric hadn\u2019t seen any others guards and hoped he could finish the fight before they were interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand ax shattered the horn on the wall as Eric stepped into the open, \u201cI don\u2019t wish to be interrupted but if you wish to feel free to run to your Mommy\u2019s apron strings to ask for help.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jab to the pride had the effect he desired, \u201cI need no one to help me with pest control. Come forward ant and be squashed like a good little bug!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of the warriors waited for their opponent and the pair charge at each other with the giant swinging his hammer at the barbarian striking the stone floor sending shards of stone into the air. A burst of speed had saved the life of Eric and he sought to use his good fortune with a strike against the side of the knee. The armor bent in slightly from the hit but the ax shook in his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was tempting to back away from the stomping feet but the giant had too much of a reach advantage to back away so Eric tossed his giant ax aside and switched to his hand axes in this close quarters taking strikes when he could. Finally, he heard what he wanted as a cry came from the giant as blood burst from a fresh wound. The creature of fire dropped to the ground as it lost the use of his legs allowing the barbarian to roll away and grab his ax to finish the job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy brothers and sisters shall avenge my death,\u201d the fire giant proclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey will have to do it from beyond the grave if my plan works,\u201d Eric\u2019s ax cleaved deeply into the much more accessible throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe keys were located easily and he was soon setting the stunned slaves free to their stunned delight. Eric could see the joy on the faces of the men but the work to remain free was a long way from being done and they looked about ready to drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am afraid your freedom may be short-lived,\u201d Eric explained as he continued unchaining the haggard looking people. \u201cYou may yet earn the freedom of the grave as the way I came in is likely watched and to fight our way out may be folly but I have a plan to make things hot for the giants with their own furnaces. In the chaos, it creates you can get out of the tunnel to freedom.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople started to head the way of the tunnel but a few of the stronger people stayed behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf we are to die we wish to help you,\u201d a dwarf with a burn over half his face stepped forward. \u201cWe know the furnaces better than anyone and if you are to succeed you will need help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad to have it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wished he had some weapons to give them but for now, they would just have to trust to luck.</span></div></div>",

He had worked for King Emeril on many occasions supplying him with an eager volunteer for suicide missions. Fear was always a distant thought from Karas\u2019s mind because it was only a job with more danger than most but the rewards were far greater and he had the skills to complete the jobs offered to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe King smiled at Karas\u2019s approach, \u201cGreetings to you. I have more work that a needs to be done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes the Duke of Xon need another lesson in manners,\u201d Karas mentioned the ruler a land long at odds with Dar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing so simple,\u201d the King responded. \u201cA knight of the Black Circle is harassing the village of Green Vale. I want you to eliminate the threat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs long as the money is gold the job will be done,\u201d Karas said and even as he spoke the King had tossed him a bag of coins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaras gave the King a brief bow and left the room. The knights of the Black Circle were dangerous with their fearsome training and dark enchantments but nothing that he would have to reequip for.  It was surprising the King had brought such a minor task to Karas but with the troubles his children had been causing for him of late it wasn\u2019t really surprising. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching as he traveled to the edges of civilization Karas wondered how many lives had been lost fighting back the wilderness. How much tragedy had the first people of Dar seen before they were able to not see doom lurking around every corner? Of course, when didn\u2019t doom lurk around every corner? Karas lived his life for the moment because you never knew when your personal doom would come to claim you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to emphasize this he spotted the signs of large group of goblin in the area. Goblins loved to ambush unsuspecting prey but they weren\u2019t very good at hiding the signs of their movements, so if you knew what to look for you could spot them long before they saw you. Karas tied his mount to a tree and pulled a crossbow from his mount and vanished into the woods. Goblins admired shinning objects as much as Karas and he wanted see if they had any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Karas wasn\u2019t versed in goblin so he didn\u2019t know what the group of about twenty goblins was saying. They had a large pile of contraband which was promising and the war leader was arguing with the shaman and that meant they were distracted which meant they were vulnerable. Karas wondered if he should use his crossbow to take out the war leader, or shaman, or should he avoid the trouble altogether and continue with his quest.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Confusion reigned as Karas launched himself into the mob with two short swords. The light quick blades made quick work of a half dozen of the little green men before they were able to counter attack. They howled in fury at the death of their leaders and pressed the attack against the outnumbered human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human gave ground to the goblins but always for the price of one or two goblins. Outnumbering the human had given the goblins courage was quickly diminishing and with it goblins were thinking about survival rather than revenge. It was at this moment when the shaman blasts the human with a hex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaras saw lights dart from the fingertips and he knew he was in trouble. The world blurred and his head became fuzzy as he continued to fight the remaining goblins. The trick would be to outlast the spell or counter act the effects of the spell. Karas the nicks and cuts of the goblin blades to allow his mind to compensate and he was soon rewarded. The effect wasn't completely eliminated but at least the goblins had started to die again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human had somehow survived and was killing the last of the raiding party to the dismay of the shaman. He hated to use the potion the Sage had given to him but he was desperate. The fierce warrior instinctively struck the projectile shattering it causing him to be covered with the liquid as he slew the last of the goblin attackers leaving only him and the shaman alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaras lurched towards the shaman when an overwhelming heat over took his body. He had to strip the stifling armor from his body but he found it wasn't enough to relieve the fire that was raging within him. His muscles vanished as they were devoured to supply the energy for the change. Curves formed as his waist shrank and butt expanded. Bright blonde spilled from his head as he looked on in horror as his penis vanished into his body. Before he could think about his loss for too long as two giant breasts grew on his chest blocking his view. The last thing Karas saw before the strain of the transformation caused him to black out was the shocked expression on the shaman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwareness was slow in returning to Karas and to his dismay he found he hadn't just been dreaming about turning into a woman. He was or rather she was now dressed in a crudely made dress which did little to hide her new assets. Karas was chained to the floor and as she stood her breasts swayed altering her normal movements. This would be trouble if she had to fight any time soon. It was at this moment he heard the shaman he had fought earlier talking to someone about his fate.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Karas quivered with warmth between his legs at the examination of his vagina.  Karas began to wonder if more than his appearance had changed.  Since the transformation he felt a great deal more fear than he was used to.  He wasn't repulsed by the examination like he should be.  As the rough fingers traced the lips of his new sex he bit his lip to prevent what might of been a moan.  Then the fingers pulled away to Karas's relief and frustration.  Benthos stood up and whispered in Kara,\"An unbroken one I will get an excellant price for you.  Follow me.\"  Karas took a second to realize that he was no longer chained.  He resisted the urge to examine his nether region which still quivered with a desire to be touched.  Karas shuffled after Benthos. When Karas reached the end of the cave his stomach dropped when he saw the slave wagons with several guards around them.  Karas used his perception to determine a path of escape into the woods.  Benthos wasn't looking at him and the guards didn't seem to be paying attention.  He figured he could pull off the sack he was wearing and make run into the woods.  From there he could probably lose them.  They wouldn't want to leave their slaves for long and would probably leave without him.

The guards stood stunned at the sight of a beautiful voluptuous figure running across the field. Benthos stared with lust at the vision before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaras didn't look back focusing on the control of his alien body. Each stride sent pleasure down his spine. He wondered about looks he was no doubt drawing. The thought of men leering at him filled him with warmth. She almost turned back to give them a real show but then he caught himself and shook it off. He'd lost it for a moment and thought of himself as a woman. Karas had no time to dwell on his fragile mental state as he broke the forest line. He slowed down when entered taking care with his steps. He wanted to leave as small a trail as possible figuring the guards would be poor trackers.<br>\r\nThe call from Benthos to his guards didn't go out until Karas had reached the forest. Benthos had been lost in lust after the bouncing form before him. The guards were slow to react enchanted by the nymph bounding into the forest. But they soon rushed the forest imagining themselves getting a hold of the busty beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her hardened nipple calling out to be rubbed the woman who used to be the warrior Karas thought about what to do next as she massaged boobs. A new sexual personality gained control of this nubile body. Kelosa it called itself as one of her delicate hands drifted down her curvy body to pleasure the growing wetness between her legs. Kelosa bit her lip to stifle the moan her body desired to make. If she cried out the slavers might find her.<br>\r\nThe thought of being used as a sexual slave pleased her. But these men would no doubt keep her pure till they reached some market. And she did not want to wait to be used. Kelosa's body was built for sex. She could let Karas take over again. He could lead this body to civilisation where she could have her choice of sexual partners. Karas would no doubt lose to Kelosa again when the base urges of sex presented themselves to her again. As her ministrations brought her to orgasm she decided what to do.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Light came in through the leaves and space between the trees.  She tried to ignore the bouncing of her buxom chest as she hurried keeping an eye out for any dangers that might lurk amongst the trees.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe village of Shadowbrook  got it's name from the large trees that lined the river and cast their shapes over it.  A wooden wall surrounded it to protect from the predations of the local goblin population.  The villagers themselves were known to be friendly but hardened people.  They worked with the land to make their livelihood.  Hurrying through the forest and found the Chapel river named after an ancient church which is by the source of the river.   Karas knew she was a long way from that but Shadowbrook shouldn't be much further.  After he got some clothes and supplies he could try to make it to the church where they might remove this curse.  Karas didn't trust wizards whose motives were often inscrutable.  Priests works for the will of their gods.  If you understood their god you understood their motivations.  That is why Karas liked to go to good aligned priests they were altruistic and wouldn't double cross you.  They might preach at you a little but Karas could ignore that.  It might cost a bit of gold that she could pick up from one of her stashes along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaras paused for a minute to think of how she wanted to proceed.  She could try to tell the truth but villagers might be superstitious.   She might get run out of town or worse.  Telling them that she got attacked by goblins might be the best bet.  Karas thought about it and decided to risk telling the truth.  Lies had a way of coming back at you.  With the truth you don't have to keep straight the mistruths you told.  Karas continued on her feet sore and body aching from the journey.  This new body didn't have the endurance her old one had.  Karas missed the strength and familiarity.  The new body seemed to be in a constant state of arousal.  Just thinking of a man taking her sent shivers down his spine.  Nipples hardened with moisture forming between her legs.  Karas shook her head not giving into the desire of self pleasuring.  Focus on the mission at hand get to the village.  Than acquire clothing, a weapon and some food than you can get to the church north of hear so your curse or enchantment can be removed.  Hours passed and the sun began to lower in the sky, with a little more travel she could make the village. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Or perhaps a memorial to a long forgotten battle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaras made his way after his cache of gear and treasure ignoring his companion.  Mary realizing his absence hurried after him asking about his knowledge of the stone.  He shrugged saying, \u201cIt says \u2018crystal gardens\u2019.  Now follow me and I need your help lifting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary frowned her curiosity unquenched asked, \u201cCrystal gardens what does that mean?  Why was it put there?  What is the history?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeppered with the questions Karas did an about face his long blonde hair twirling with the motion.  Karas said, \u201cThey don\u2019t know who marked that stone or the reason behind it.  The closest dwarven settlement only know of legends.  They say that dwarves and fae lived together here.  The dwarves grew crystals that the fae imbued with magic.  Some say their was an unknown disaster that killed them all.  Others that it exists till this day.  I have never dwelt on it.  Why chase after stories when real money is available.\u201d  Karas hoped but didn\u2019t believe this would put the matter to rest.  He needed Mary\u2019s help but seemed to be a daydreamer.  Her good nature made her able to be trusted.  That was worth a hefty amount of gold.  He hoped not to alienate her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary found strangeness in Kara\u2019s lack of imagination.  Though a little girl in body Kara remained the cold mercenary.  Maybe this experience will inspire his better nature.  Perhaps with the lenses of youth she would see the excitement of the world.  Mary looked on with excitement as Kara arrived at stone which she pulled aside a sheet of grass revealing a metal storage box.  With a metal combination lock that Kara soon opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lid opened with a creak of lack of care.  Inside an organized array of weapons in one half and leather sacks in trays on the other.  Karas grabbed small weapons from the box leaving the large ones alone.  Then she tried to heft one of the sacks but lacked the strength.  Mary grabbed it feeling the heavy weight she dropped it beside the weapons causing the top to come open revealing the golden contents.  Karas pushed aside his frustration at his lack of strength and opened another sack fishing out several jewels.  With that Karas resealed and locked the box.  He then hid it again and had Mary carry the items back to the wagon.  Karas said, \u201cWe will fill out any items we need in town.  I believe I have sufficient money to get a cure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary asked, \u201cAfter that want to see if we can find the crystal garden?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaras responded, \u201cI thank you again for all the aid that you are providing but I have no desire to chase legends.  Here take these gems.  You should be able to hire your own adventuring party but I have no desire for such things.\u201d     </span></div></div>",

Karas thanked,  \"Mary for her offer but save the potion for later in case they needed it.  I will take your kind offer as a travel companion.  I think I am ill suited to make this journey by myself in this form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary smiled, \"I would be happy to go with you, it gets a might lonely with my son being gone so often.  A real adventure would suit me nicely.  I will write my son a note that I will be gone for a spell.  Than I think I will drop by the Kemptons they have a girl about your size and I will borrow a dress.  You rest up and we will head out in the morning after you get some of your strength back.  You can use the guest bedroom while I step out and run a few errands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thank you for your continued assistance.\"  Karas spoke grateful that she could finally get some rest.  Karas made his way to the bedroom thinking about the prospect of wearing a dress tomorrow.  She shrugged her shoulders, it would hardly be her worst experience in the last few days.  Sliding into the comfy bed she finally began to feel the aches and pains from pushing her body so far.  The full stomach and sheer exhaustion helped her into restful sleep with no worries pressing on her mind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary visited her neighbors she arranged for their son to tend her place while she traveled.  She also procured some clothes for Karas.  After getting her things packed she set out Kara's new clothes.  The dress a simple light blue one with some low heeled walking shoes.   She made a light supper for herself before going to bed.  When she woke in the morning she hurriedly readied herself and made a hearty breakfast for them both.  By the time Karas got out of bed the food was set out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaras wandered out with the dress neatly on her a bit over sized though.  The odd thing that struck Mary was that it looked perfectly sized yesterday when she brought it home. Then it struck her that Karas appeared smaller than the day before.  She'd also put on a dress with no assistance.  She realized that Karas's changes were continuing.     </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mary's natural curiosity took over and she chose to not tell Karas about the changes she now found Karas going through.  This level of magic rarely witnessed by someone of her humble background.  Born to a farmers who saw no need for learning outside their trade.  She grew up with little formal magical training receiving most of it from a wizened woman who lived on the outskirts of Shadowbrook.  In return for doing chores for the woman she would take some time teaching Mary simple magical tricks or potions.  An eager student but her teacher lacked the ability and books to properly train her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena, Mary's teacher failed in her magical apprenticeship.  A subject Helena would never discuss.  She left Mary with great gaps in her knowledge of magic.  Disappearing part way through her training, Mary made due with the few books that Helena left behind in what appeared a hurried departure.  Mary developed a good understanding of plants and herbs which she felt made her a better than fair potion maker.  But her spell casting remained unreliable at best.  She only used it with no one around for safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary hoped on their journey to a bigger city there might be a magic shop that she could obtain tomes to increase her knowledge and fill out her education.  With her son grown and beloved husband passed she felt at leisure to pursue magic again.  Karas's arrival again excited the old passion for it.  Never observing such powerful magic worked on someone she found it fascinating.  She hemmed Karas's dress quickly and got a horse fixed up to her wagon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sturdy wagon hand carved by Mary's son sat mostly unused.  Mary gave it a quick dusting that morning before loading the supplies she thought they might need.  She helped Karas onto the wagon who struggled to get up unsuccessfully.     They set off to Jarren's outpost a bigger town which got its name from an adventurer who settled there more than a century ago.  It now stood as a trading hub for the local villages.  Mary figured they would reach it before nightfall and stay at an inn there. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She seemed oblivious to it, watching the environment with wonder.  No longer a seasoned warrior a starry eyed child sat next to her.  Mary thought that the spell picked up of the desires of those closest to Karas.  For herself she always desired a girl that she could bring up.  She loved her son but she longed for a daughter to dote on.  She imagined that Karas would transform into that image if given time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaras found herself enraptured by the scenery looking to and fro.  She grinned seeing some butterflies floating about some wildflowers.  The wildflowers looked so vibrant she wanted to pick some for Mary.  She tugged at Mary's coat asking, \"Please may we stop so I can get some flowers?\"  Karas got a plaintive look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary smiled, \"You know I thought it might be time for a break and some lunch.  How about you pick some flowers while I spread out lunch.  Make sure to stay in sight though okay?\"  Mary enjoyed watching the little girl in her unspoiled innocence.  She wondered if Karas the warrior would resurface.  The fluctuations between personalities would probably continue until something set her form.  Too long in the same form might be a catalyst for the permanent change.  The spell continued to fascinate her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay thank you.\"  As the cart pulled to a stop Karas struggled down not waiting for Mary's help.  She dropped down and rushed into the field gathering up any flowers that caught her fancy.  She struggled a bit with her dress dragging on the ground not fitting right.  By the time she returned Mary had spread a cloth down for them to picnic on.  Karas gobbled down the food and water making a mess of herself.  Mary wiped her face with a damp cloth too which Karas gave no objection.  Karas gathered up a bouquet of flowers from her collection.  She presented it to Mary blushing slightly and casting her eyes downward, \"For you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary looked at her pleasantly surprised at this gift, \"What a  thoughtful gift thank you.  Now how about you help me pack everything up and we will be on our way.\"  Karas nodded vigorously helping as she could.  With a boost from Mary, Karas got onto her seat on the cart.  Mary got the wagon on its way soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaras climbed into the back of the cart with her remaining collection.  She played with them making wishes on the petals and putting them in her hair.  She crawled back to Mary to show off her flowered hair.  Mary gave her approval stroking a stray hair out of Karas's face.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

If they spent enough time together Karas would be a sweet little girl for Mary to dote on.  Karas no longer a threat to those who didn't have the money to pay his price.  A warrior with no code but a contract for pay.  A child who gave love and sweetness was infinitely superior.  Raised right she could be a force for good.  Wavering Mary wondered if she was trying to convince herself for a selfish reason.  Karas came to her for help and to plot against him was surely wrong.  Watching Karas excitedly point out this sight and that made Mary smile.  She didn't want to lose the small cherub that sat beside her.  It wouldn't be so wrong if she just let the spell run its course.  Yes, she would just let the gods decide Karas's fate.  If they so willed it she would be a loving mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaras eyes narrowed and she began to look around her for dangers instead of flowers.  She saw how the next bend might be a good spot for an ambush but unlikely since no one knew which way they traveled.  Random bandits possibly but they headed toward civilization and these roads often contained soldiers doing regular patrols.  Suddenly memories of her childish behavior intruded on his thoughts.  Shame at her weakness to the spell.  Karas looked at Mary who gave occasional side glances at her and smiled.  Distrust came naturally to Karas but she knew that without a weapon and her lapses of control left her vulnerable to the perils that lay in her path.  So far Mary gave no cause for alarm but still trust remained alien to his nature.  This dependency she found herself in turned her stomach.  Karas promised herself revenge on that goblin even it cost him the rest of his savings.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary realized that Karas regained control of herself when Karas went quiet.  No longer carefree she saw how deliberately Karas searched for danger.  A mixture of relief and sadness filled Mary.  She couldn't be sure which she felt more.  Sadness at the loss of the sweet girl.  Relief that she didn't have the guilt of letting down Karas who came to her for help.  She disliked the silence that they now found themselves in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time passed they arrived at the outskirts of the Jarren's outpost.  The town though larger than shadow brook held only a couple resident priests none of the ability to be a significant help to a spell of this power.  There might be adventures staying there or passing through that might offer assistance.  Mary pondered her next move. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mary decided that she wanted to get Karas and discuss the options Karas had.  Mary chose to wait until they were talking over the evening meal.  She always thought better with a full stomach.  Mary got a room at a simple inn that looked respectable.  She didn't think a fancy inn would suit her.  She liked finery and all but felt she lacked the sophistication.  The travelers rest with its well built structure and attentive staff seemed the perfect place for an evenings rest.  Mary asked for a meal to be sent up to her room that she would share with Karas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaras stared at Mary waiting for her to bring up whatever bothered her.  Karas noticed that Mary kept looking down at her with a furrowed brow.  Karas knew when someone wanted to say something but lacked the nerve to bring it up.  Client she'd had in the past often when they desired a distasteful request that Karas might look down on.  Karas before this only cared about money and difficulty.  Vile acts only required more money.  Morality never used to enter her mind.  Only after the spell and meeting Mary had she questioned the choices she made.  Karas now worried what Mary might say but she owed her the right to say it for all she'd done for Karas.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the beef stew arrived Mary took a few mouthfuls before saying, \"Karas I wish to know what you want if you should lose yourself?  The spell is changing you further and if it finishes before we get to the Temple I want to know what you desire of me?  I don't deny that I have long desired a girl of my own and would care for you if you wished it.  But I don't want that child at the expense of another human if I can help it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaras looked surprised at Mary.  She hadn't given it much thought to not succeeding she rarely did.  Confidence was essential in her former line of work.  Now, doubt crept into her at the prospect of losing herself to this spell.  Karas finally turned to Mary and said, \"I care little for what happens to me if I lose myself to this spell.  I gladly surrender myself to your care if it happens to me.  You deserve that much for all your aid.  If nothing can be done by the priests I accept it.  I have faced down death this I think would be a better deal at least part of me would remain. Let's try and see what comes.\"  Karas went back to eating not waiting for a response.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary looked in wonder at Karas.  She couldn't believe that Karas took it so easily.  No sadness or fear displayed on Karas's face.  Regret must be an alien concept to Karas.  Mary felt a little jealous of that.  But not of Karas's lack of emotion. Mary loved feeling and experiencing life shutting it out made her pity Karas.     <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Karas realizes she is no longer the master of her own body.  An uncoordinated baby lays on the ground practically swallowed up by her dress.

This might be a gift from them.  Looking down she smiling at an adorable baby she could call her own and no one would question her.

She gathered her clothes and personal items making several trips to the wagon she had readied.  She spied a note left among Karas\u2019s few items.

Lord Armand Werton her husband lands generated a sizable income that he used to further Mary\u2019s mystical studies.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmand distrusted King Emeril whose whims often ruined men and women alike.  He stayed out of the capital if he could.  He desired to remain out of the politics but prepared himself to face down any threats that might disrupt his idyllic existence.  He trained a personal unit of knights loyal to him.  He studied magic alongside his wife equaling her ability.  Though few knew of his talent as the king\u2019s paranoia of magic users was well known.  Armand treated Kara as his daughter raising her with the brood Mary and produced through the years.  Eighteen years saw Kara fill out into a beauty like her mother.  Standing next to each other they appeared more as sisters than parent and child.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara gave glimpses of her former ability with weapons but showed no signs of remembrance of her former life.  Her archery skill surpassed any knight or soldier in her father\u2019s employ.  When she cooked in the kitchen her knife skills impressed all the staff.  Despite these talents no one would mistake her for a manly woman.  She loved sewing and teasing boys her hips swaying enticingly for handsome young men.  Recently she set her eyes on the son of a neighboring noble.  His visits grew frequent with a few well-placed battings of the eyes and smiles.  Only Armand\u2019s watchful eye kept them from a more physical understanding of one another.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary waddled down the hall smiling despite her distended belly and backache.  Any day now she would again birth a child for her husband.  The magic within her aided fertility she held no doubt.  Every year she wound up in the same position pregnant.  Twenty children to her name excited the local gossip that she might be an aspect of Asherah the fertility goddess.  The morning sickness she could live without but she loved all the children running about.  She wished to visit with Kara whose hormones might soon over take her.  The lustful longing looks to Bryant Morland might lead to Mary's current condition if she didn't talk to Kara.  Their marriage first was all she desired.

Karas stopped her moaning session long enough to let out a guttural chuckle as she surveyed the small sea of knocked out goblins and muttered, \"Men.\"  Karas then removed the bindings.  She looked at the many naked male goblins in the room and thought about what could have been.  She had just escaped simple life of nothing but sex and pleasure.  Thinking of this Karas took even greater pleasure in snapping the necks of his enemies on the ground.  Karas smiled as shetook a moment to take in her new body, but knew time was fleeting.  She grabbed one of the sorry excuse for goblin's clothing and put it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaras left the room quickly and quietly.  It wouldn't be long before the goblins noticed the sounds of an orgy were not happening in the room and they would investigate.

Karas let out a battle cry to alert the shaman, the shaman reached for a staff but it was already too late.  Karas sprung across the room and in one swift motion slit the troublesome goblin's throat.  Karas let out a victorious cackle.  He had wiped the goblin fortress of most of it's guards and had gotten revenge on the most troublesome one there.  Even with a feminine foreign body Karas was strong enough to defeat any number of goblins thrown at him.  Although now that the bloodlust had begun to pass he felt a small pang of sadness.  He had defeated his enemies but he was still left with this body.  A body that couldn't wield the same glorious weapons he had always worn with pride.  Each trophy from a  past kill was now just that, a trophy he wouldn't be able to use to it's proper potential.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless...\"  Karas said looking at the goblin shaman's cauldron.  If the shaman he used his magic to turn him into this, surly Karas could figure out a way to reverse the process, or even become strong than ever before.  As thoughts of power came creeping in, a more cautious thought told him that he should just accept his new body as a punishment for letting the shaman get a jump on him and build his life a new.  It would be difficult, after all he had never heard of a goblin warrior of the people let alone a female one, but if there was ever going to be one Karas was certain he could make an even more successful a name for himself.</span></div></div>",

The stunned and curious eyes of goblins stared at the naked woman in stunned silence for several moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMoo!\u201d Karas let loose an involuntary long and deep bellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore goblins started to follow out of their huts at the strange commotion going on outside. Karas got to her feet and tried to figure out what to do next when the next pain hit her body. Sweat poured out of her body as she breathed in a desperate effort to control herself. It appeared that the shaman had gotten his spell off and she could only hope that it didn\u2019t finish its dark work. It was obvious the goblins were scared of what was happening in front of them but they were unable to look away for the transforming human in front of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFur formed on her body as her shape swelled, she tried to shove her swelling breast back into her body as merged and slid down her body. Karas knew it was useless, that it wouldn\u2019t stop the magic but she had to do something, try anything. She noticed the crowd backed away from her as she moved towards them so maybe she had a chance to get away from here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she kept her mind she might be able to return to being a human she thought as she started to move on hooves instead of her hands and knees. As she got used to the new shape she picked up speed and ran from the camp, her new tail swaying behind her. She didn\u2019t dare to look back to see if they were following and prayed they thought the magic was somehow contagious or at least went to check on the shaman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head hurt as horns extended out from her head, the pain was coming to a halt which likely meant the end of her changes. The fighter felt like a giant compared to how she had been as a woman, even as a man she hadn\u2019t had this much weight. The new size helped her shove her way through branches and bushes as she worked to put distance between her and the goblins. </span></div></div>",

Hunger compelled her to start taking some bites of the vegetation and start chewing as she tried to decide what to do next. It wasn\u2019t likely the goblins had followed her this far, and even if they had they would slow their pace a great deal because roads were signs of civilizations that were a great danger to the small creatures. She knew that the bounties on goblins had increased in recent years so she felt a little safer as she found a spot to curl up under cover and wait until dawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes did not have the vision she was used to at night. It was very disorienting getting used to this new body and she had just been plowing through in her attempt to get away that she hadn\u2019t noticed how different she was. The nice thing was that her field of vision was much better but the lack of a lot of depth perception and color was troublesome but they were compensated nicely by the improved sense of smell and hearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t certain what her goal was, she no longer had the ability to speak anything intelligible to any of the sentient races. Karas had tried a couple goes as she slowed down but it was just a series of moos and bellows. Perhaps she would try more in the morning but exhaustion was taking hold for now so she was left to dream about her next step and hopefully not being the steak on someone\u2019s dinner plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a small chance the spell would wear off but if that failed the chances began to get much smaller because how was she supposed to convince someone she was more than a cow and to help her with the problem. </span></div></div>",

She froze as she came to a rise and saw a small village a short distance away. A small wooden fence circled the place and she could see the outlying farms encircling it. Karas walked down to it looking for someone to try and communicate with but she was afraid of what would happen to her, how would they react when a cow proved to be more than a simple animal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFarmers were very cautious by nature, there was so much to be afraid of in life for them that taking chances on magical animals wasn\u2019t likely. Deciding to take the chance she started to walk down to the village, she didn\u2019t want to live the life of a cow when there was a chance she could be human again. Suddenly her body started to shudder, she fought against it and managed to lay down on the grass before she crashed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face shrank, suddenly her colors became clear to her again as her eyes shifted to the front, it appeared the shaman hadn\u2019t managed to cast a permanent transformation. Cow hooves split into hands and she rubbed them against the grass enjoying the sensitivity, she pulled herself undercover as the villagers might not understand a cow transforming into a human. Karas hoped that she would have her manhood return to her but that had been different magic and the growing swells on her chest were very unmasculine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe coughed up some grass as her stomach rumble, unsettled by the diet she had as a cow. The sun felt great on her skin as she headed to the village. Karas smiled as she headed in thinking of the reactions she would draw as she walked in naked. The dirt road hurt her soft feet with tiny pebbles which made her want to head towards the closest farm she saw but it looked like it was abandoned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roof had holes in it and the front door was completely missing, still, someone might have left some clothing or blankets behind. She shoved the gate open deciding a partially clothed woman would cause less of a stir than a naked woman. The fighter grabbed a solid piece of wood before she entered the structure, just because humans had left this place it didn\u2019t mean new nasty residents hadn\u2019t made a home for themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaras was glad for the holes in the roof because they let in a lot of light to the building. She could see that many of the floorboards had rotted with time but she could see some things that she could make <br>\r\nuse of, a short sword was in usable condition and a dust-covered blanket lay over the bed in the corner.</span></div></div>",

It may have been intentional to allow for easy tracking of her with any worgs they had. She shuddered at the thought causing her ample breasts to jiggle like a pleasure girl with a rich client.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the distraction she went out the back of the tent and started to put some distance between her and the goblins. Most of the time she had dealt with goblins she had been the aggressor so she didn\u2019t know how they would react when they tried to track her down but she hoped that would be a long way off. The shaman had tried to have sex with her and she had no idea how long goblin lovemaking took and had no desire to find out but it could determine how much time she had before being discovered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she had put enough distance between her and the goblin community that her actions she took some time to climb a tree to get her bearings. It didn\u2019t look like the village was up in arms which were a good sign but she could see a few campfires in the distance of the direction she had been heading. They were likely new goblins come to witness the great power of the shaman and if they were making campfires that meant she was deep in the territory of the goblins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warrior grabbed a wooden branch from the ground that would make a good weapon because it was likely she wouldn\u2019t be able to avoid an encounter and she would need to be ready. Karas suspected that the goblins wouldn\u2019t be armored so a good club would be very useful against there much smaller bodies. Even in her diminished stature, she was still stronger than a few goblins but the problem with goblins was they never just come in a few in number. A few practice swings before she got too close to the camps to take the noisy action to allow her to get a little used to fighting in this body. The swings told her she should have taken the time to find some restraint for her new growths but it was late for that now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could hear something moving up ahead of her and she took the time to hide behind a bush and waited for the noise maker\u2019s approach. A couple of goblins appeared and were sniffing at things and lifting any that suggested food to their mouths to like. Karas examined the small green creatures for something she could use or take from them to warrant the risk of attacking them. The only weapon she saw was a dagger that was not of goblin construction but was it worth the risk? </span></div></div>",

Slowly she closed the distance knowing the sensitive ears of the creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoblins were preyed upon by virtually every creature of the land which meant they had very good senses of sight, smell, and hearing or they were dead but their main problem was their minds. They could be distracted and predicted. She threw a rock and the creatures whipped their heads towards the sound of it landing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, she was upon them caving in the skull of the one with the knife. It felt wonderful to have a forged blade in her hand again but as soon as it was in her grasp it left into the throat of the second goblin. She rolled past two goblins who shrieked in surprise as she spun around on them to plant the retrieved blade into one of their skulls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot hit a slick mud sent her falling onto the other goblin with her full breast smothering the face of the small creature. It squirmed underneath her as she struggled to wrestle the obsidian daggers the creature tried to stab her with from his hands. Before she could manage the feat the struggles ceased underneath her breast, death by breast was how she would wanted to go if it ever came down to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the knife she took a moment look at it, the blade was in good condition but the goblins had wrapped in some leather that hadn\u2019t been tanned properly causing it to reek powerfully but she doubted she had time to play with it.

The bolt flew straight and true ending whatever threat the shaman might pose as the bolt entered the shaman\u2019s skull. Karas didn\u2019t hesitate to drop his crossbow and launch him from cover screaming to cause confusion among his enemies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfusion was the enemy of survival and the goblins were certainly confused when Karas leapt into their midst slashing with his short swords slaying several. Instinct for survival caused the goblins to flee in all directions except for the leader who started to bark at the others in goblin. The goblin chieftain snarled but held his ground as Karas approached him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaras knew he had to slay the leader before his bravery gave confidence to the others causing them to return. The chieftain took advantage of his small size and agility to dart in and out slashing at the large warrior who pressed his superior skill and strength to close the gap between them. Goblins began to return to the clearing, so Karas took a calculated risk and lunged forward planting one sword in the chieftain\u2019s chest and threw the other into one of the returning goblins. Confidence vanished at the death of their leader and one of the returning goblins and they soon vanished from sight as they fled the scene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing a sigh of relief Karas began to systematically survey of the scene while keeping an eye wary for any returning or new threats in the area. The stop had proved lucrative with a pile of coins and jewelry which were easily transferred into his bag of holding, and there were a few interesting items. A couple of scrolls and a book of magic were among the items that had been stolen by the goblins. Karas wasn\u2019t sure of their value but magic users were always willing to part with things for new magic. A strange orb was on the shaman and he decided to take and possibly investigate it further from the safety of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving collected all of the valuables he needed to decide on his next action. Karas could head directly for his original mission, take evasive action to make sure none of the goblins followed him, or investigate where the goblins had gotten their ill-gotten gains, because the original owners might be very grateful.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Karas guessed that King Emeril wished to avoid direct conflict with the powerful order of the knights.  They looked poorly on those who interfered in their quests for more dark magic.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaras snuck down toward the middle of town using the side alleys where he heard the bellowing of a commanding voice.  The voice said, \u201cOne of you knows where the Artifact is! My patience wears thin and I find your lives to be quite expendable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaras observed a large knight in obsidian colored armor pacing a group of frightened villagers waving his sword around.  Five skeleton warriors stood watch as well controlled by some item of the knight\u2019s.  They patiently awaited their next command.  The skeleton might go berserk if their master died but Karas took careful aim at the knight not caring.  The first head shot struck the target followed by another four shots each hitting home.  The knight stumbled blood streaming out the helm.  Karas pressed the attack loosing arrow after arrow into the black knight\u2019s chest as he approached the fallen knight.  The villagers screamed jumping to their feet and running in every direction.  The skeletons sprang to action raising their blades going after the fleeing villagers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaras dismissed going after the skeletons as the true danger lay in the black knight.  The Knight yelled out, \u201cYou dare attack Argus of the black circle you will pay for your foolishness.  Restoration ring activate.\u201d  The knight stood up with a glowing disintegrating on his hand as the arrows fell out and all wounds vanished.  The holes in the armor with the bloodstains remained.  Karas pulled out a Warhammer walking straight to Argus conserving energy till needed.  Argus drew out a long sword that began to burn when released from the sheathe.  Argus swung the flame sword at Karas but he leapt forward striking with his Warhammer at Argus\u2019s knee.  Karas swung the hammer up and around bringing it down Argus\u2019s head.  Karas dropped on the back of the knight letting go of the hammer pulling a dagger and driving it into the back of Argus\u2019s neck.  He twisted it into the causing blood to spurt up onto Karas.  Argus struggled to get up but Karas held on with his left hand as he stabbed the exposed neck until Argus collapsed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaras finished his job on the neck by ripping the head off. He didn\u2019t plan to leave this to chance not knowing what magic items he might have.  He heard the cries of villagers in the distance but grabbed the flame sword to continue removing the appendages.  There would be no magical resurrections if he could help it.  He used a flame strike to destroy the head of the second-rate knight.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Whatever the artifact it would fetch a handsome price to the right buyer and Karas knew a number of purveyors of magical items.  With a few words to the local gossips and a few coins dropped in the right palms he soon the local legend and got a good idea of where to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stories talked of a legendary warrior whose skill was only surpassed by the strength of his blade.  Where the warrior went wrong according to legend was hatred of women.  He looked down on all of them and killed any he deemed unworthy of life according to his impossible standards.  Cursed by a god or magic user of some form the stories varied on this point.  But the end result was that if his blade spilled female blood he would know of their struggles.  The exact terms of the terms lost to the annals of time.  His tomb was said to be a short way from the village and his coins bought him a likely location.  Karas figured that his sword would lie in rest there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaras felt reassured that he was on the right path as he passed beyond the village graveyard into an older set of crypts and tombs.  The superstition dwelling in the villagers kept them from doing more than pointing out the location.  Fear of what lay beyond their humble graveyard kept them them from seeking the sword themselves.  Karas\u2019s history of battling undead and monsters from the other side left him unafraid of stories.  Besides most of them ended up being exaggerated.  The tomb that confronted him now displayed a warrior statue that looked promising.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst he looked for any signs magical markings and traps.  Seeing none he proceeded to pry open the crypt.  With a heave the stone slab fell to the ground with a loud crash.  In the tomb only one grave lay in the center.  Again searched the area but only found an unadorned tomb.  Opening the coffin proved to be no problem.  In it he found the final remains of a warrior buried with his now decayed armor and sword.  He looked at the blade through the remnants of the scabbard.  The blade still held sharpness that should of fade with age.

The bounty didn\u2019t make it worth the risk to him, so Karas moved on quietly from the area leaving the goblins to their argument of treasure division. He put his horse into a gallop down the trail, no doubt spooking the goblins, which brought a smile to his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe approached the next town as the light was disappearing from the sky and hoped the villagers hadn\u2019t shut their gates for the night. He wouldn\u2019t blame them with all of the dangers lurking in the woods all around them. They were technically under the protection of the king but the king gave them little other than an occasional patrol or a mercenary like him to take care of a particular threat. The villagers were visited far more frequently by tax collectors so they had to take care of their own safety and security. Not having a wall was close to suicide for a community out this far from the capital. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gates were just starting to be closed as he came around the curve, but they halted at his approach. Their crossbows were quickly at the ready at the arrival of a heavily armed stranger, drawing a smile to the fighter\u2019s face as he thought about having a warm feather bed tonight instead of the hard and rocky ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want with the town of Green Vale?\u201d a large man asked in as gruff a tone as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaras flipped a gold piece to the man, \u201cA soft bed, warm food, and cold drink if they can be found.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weapons were quickly lowered as smiles formed on the faces of the men. The fighter loved how much more hospitable people became when they were offered money. One of the men offered to stable his horse which drew a coin from Karas\u2019s pocket. The other went back to closing the gate and Karas made his way through the town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the shops were closed for the night, but he could hear activity at the blacksmith as he walked by and casually thought about if he had any weapons that needed repair, but quickly moved on to the local bar and inn. The noise came to a stop as he entered as the locals took some time to size up the stranger. Ignoring their stares as natural worry, Karas order a room as well as food and a drink with plans to enjoy the evening. It didn\u2019t take long for the conversations and music to start up again as the crowd decided he wasn\u2019t going to commit any acts of violence, at least not until he put some food and drink in his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tavern girl looked like she was having a hard time of things as several of the patrons made grabs at her, drawing laughter when they made her spill something. Karas didn\u2019t want to get involved because the men had been drinking heavily, and would likely want to start a fight. Karas didn\u2019t really want to tangle with him because Karas played for blood and even though he would be on the right the town wasn\u2019t likely to see it that way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaras watched closely as the girl approached his table with food and drink. He saw a man preparing for a powerful pinch to the lady\u2019s rear, drawing snickering from his companions and he could contain himself no longer. The fighter moved with great speed across the room grabbing the man\u2019s head as he passed and slammed it hard into the table, drawing some blood and possibly breaking the nose. <br>\r\nThe room fell silent as everyone waited and wondered what would happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI apologize,\u201d Karas said as he dropped some coins on the table. \u201cThe lady looked like she might spill for . . . some reason, so I came to help and bumped into you. I hope buying your table a round of drink will make up for the . . . accident.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnger at being hit rose in the man but his thoughts changed as the sound of the metal-clad hands of Karas drummed away at his sword grip, waiting for the man\u2019s decision. The man grumbled something and went back to drinking. The lady would be safe for the rest of the night as none in the room had a great desire to take on the heavily armed man. Karas for his part was glad he still had a bed in his future as well as a warm meal. The stew was made from some of the local wild game, and the brew was a nice and heavy imported northern brew. He was careful to keep an eye on the man he had hurt in case the alcohol he was taking in like a fish gave him some liquid courage. </span></div></div>",

Farmers and locals had little use for soldiers or adventurers and gripping about them helped prevent them from doing something stupid. Adventurers might slay a beast or kill an orc raiding party but they usually the opposite of helpful. For every story of help, there was usually five where they seduced a daughter, made unreasonable demands or took a precious child away from the farm to work for them with dreams of high adventure. The fighter had been born upon a farm and been lured away for a life of cold beds, painful wounds, and an empty coin purse most of the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way he was going to pass up a hot meal to satisfy the anger of some drunken assholes. Even a plain stew was better than what he had mastered in cooking on the road. Years had not improved the toxic concoctions he produced leaving him with dry rations.

He wondered which was the better choice or if they were simply different. The rabbit and the deer were different from each other and neither was better, or worse than the other they were only different with their own places in the world. The King of the humans had called for his help and he answered because Sitha was curious why a human who commanded so many would seek the help of one of the lizard people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe castle was the most impressive building of stone Sitha had seen outside of the ominous stone structures in the heart of the swamp which the lizardmen were forbidden to explore, because of the dark bloody history behind it. It didn\u2019t take long for armored men to guide him to the King which wasn\u2019t surprising because a seven foot tall lizardman stood out in a crowd. Light orbs lit the castle in a gentle glow allowing the painting and tapestries to be properly admired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Emeril sat on his throne and waved all of the guards from the room leaving him alone with the large lizard man. The elderly man looked nervous, but Sitha was pleased at the display of trust the King showed by being alone with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI seek your aid in a very delicate matter,\u201d the King said. \u201cIn return I will offer you the Eye of the Lizard Kings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Eye of the Lizard Kings was an extremely important relic from the days of the lizard empire many millennium ago. There was very little any of the lizardmen wouldn\u2019t do to get it back for the tribes of lizardmen everywhere, because it could act as a source of unity for the diverse tribes of lizardmen and prevent the common tribal warfare that existed now. Sitha was more curious than ever as to what great task would be required of him to earn the Eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy son Stephan is gathering a large group of mercanaries to use against me,\u201d King Emeril explained. \u201cI need you to kill him before he throws this kingdom into a civil war with many pointless deaths.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor the Eye I am willing to do this,\u201d Sitha agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for taking on this job. You can find him at the outpost called Travia\u2019s Haven where he and the mercenaries are hidden in one of the valleys nearby. If you can make sure no one observes your action against the prince.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was sorrow in the King\u2019s eyes but Sitha only cared about earning the reward promised to him. He would have a choice to make.  Should he strike the Prince at the outpost, take time to observe his target or set-up an ambush.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The sight of the outpost told him he had made the right choice because it was in poor condition as he approached. Workers tried to patch holes in the walls as others removed rotten wood from the walls. It wouldn\u2019t take long for them to repair the defenses, a few days at most, but until then they would be easy pickings. He would wait for darkness before he started his strikes against them because their sight was poor, but his was excellent under the shroud of night. If things went well he might not have to take many strikes against the location. The Prince was not likely to be one of the men on guard duty, so he would have to be patient to get his target without getting killed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFew torches were lit that night and even fewer men were on guard. The men stank of sweat and hard work indicating the ones he saw working earlier were these same men which bode well for an attack as their strength, and senses would be diminished by a hard day of labor. The jaws of Sitha latched on the throat of a man on guard duty who had made the mistake of falling asleep cutting his life short. The lizardman left him at his post so he would have an exit if he needed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the number of guards was around the number of workers there would be at least twenty men, a daunting number even if they were tired but Sitha was determined to make it work if he could. This outpost was designed for many more men and it was likely reinforcements could be on their way. He moved quickly to strike a second guard along the wall who yelled in startled surprise when he saw Sitha but it changed into a scream as the muscles of the powerful lizardman threw him over the side outside of the outpost to his death or injury as Sitha leaped into the compound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lizard moved to hide in shadows and waited for the cries to draw attention of the camp. He could try and find the location or try and slaughter the unarmed and unarmored men in the barracks. Both had there advantages and disadvantages and he didn\u2019t have much time to make the choice.</span></div></div>",

He didn\u2019t mind killing off humans, they certainly had no problems killing his people, but it was wasted energy to kill the others. Death should serve a purpose and only the death of the Prince would get him paid so he started moving towards the building where two guards had not moved an inch at the alarms sounding. They must be guarding something important and royalty often thought they were the most important thing around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wished he had skill with a bow but though he had tried, the mastery of it eluded him, but he was good with a javelin. The light spear flew the air with deadly accuracy into the unarmored throat of one of the guards holding in upright as the second guard rushed to end the threat of the attacker. Sitha brought his long sword down with incredible force causing the guard to drop back, but the lizardman pressed his attack using his superior strength to his advantage. Humans often had better endurance than lizardmen and Sitha might have to call upon his endurance tonight if things went poorly, so he wanted to finish this quickly if he could. The man grunted in pain as the lizardman dug his blade into his shoulder, but he continued fighting back with a quick slash at the belly of his opponent. Leather armor tore from the sharp blade but the hard scales underneath didn\u2019t give way, the man saw he was doomed and tried to call for help as a last desperate act to try and save his master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo arms! To ar . . .\u201d the blade of the lizardman ended the call for help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humans would turn their attention to him soon if they heard the cries for help, so fleeing would be the safest option but Sitha was so close to victory.  </span></div></div>",

Most of the people in the compound would think they were under attack, not realizing it was an assassin they were dealing with. The wood was old and rotten with time so with a powerful slamming of his shoulder against the door splintered and opened to reveal a man dressing in his armor looking up in surprise. He wore the herald markings of the Prince and he reacted quickly to the intruder lifting his blade to a defensive position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Prince of a more civilized kingdom might not be trained in the proper use of arms, but the Kingdom of Dar needed every fighting hand it could get. A quick slash of the blade drew blood from the lizardman but the warrior prince was careful to not over extend himself. This was going to be a dangerous battle even for the seasoned warrior Sitha. The human was leaving itself open but the creature would not take the bait because it could sense the trap instead the assassin decided to offer a trap of it\u2019s own. Sitha brought the long sword down with both hands driving for the shoulder but leaving his belly open and the man took the bait using his free hand to place a dagger in the belly of the lizardman, but as Sitha winced with pain he made his move and the human realized his error too late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe powerful reptile jaws tore deeply into the soft vulnerable flesh of the human throat. Most humans were used to fighting human and other creatures that were unable to make powerful bite attacks. It was a mistake to leave yourself open to the bite of a lizardman the Prince thought as his blood streamed from his throat even as he tried to stop it. Sitha had stepped back from his opponent to let him die so he could look to his own wound. He bound it as best he could before someone came to check on the Prince but it didn\u2019t look good. He felt sluggish as he struck the head from the shoulders of the corpse in from of him and made his way out of the camp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wished he had observed the area better for likely hideouts where he could hold up and heal after killing the Prince but he had not. The death of Royalty never came without consequences and he was likely to have the rest of the camp chase him and who new how many others. He had some hard choices ahead of him. </span></div></div>",

It would be better to find a location he could hide at while they chased him. He doubted they would find him because they had struck him as military trained soldiers and not tracks but they could very easily find someone to track for them. Finding a good tracker would take time and the longer they took the less people they would have to use against Sitha, as their leader was dead there would soon be many deserters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wound had been bound so there would be no blood trail as he moved to through the forest to his target. He did his best not leave a good trail but he cared more for speed so he could make it to the abandoned village before dawn. It had not been abandoned willingly as the scars of battle still showed after many years. He climbed up the back of a two story building hoping his claw marks looked like the wear of time or battle marks and crawled into an open window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloorboard creaked with his foot steps but they gave no signs of giving way to his weight. The stairway had been barricaded against intruders, and he casually wondered if the people had managed to survive the attack of orcs that had brought this village it\u2019s end. Sleep was calling to him but he wanted to see what, if anything, the other rooms held. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second room gave evidence that the people who had once been here didn\u2019t survive as numerous skeletons and blood stains decorated the room. The windows had been destroyed indicating it had been a likely entry point for the orcs. The final room bore some scorch marks and the stench of magic from the combat long ago. Despite not liking magic he decided this was the best room to stay in as the other rooms had open window entrances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe curled up in a corner hidden behind a desk and allowed slumber to take him. Thankfully lizard men healed much more quickly than humans, and he would be much better in the morning but he would want to stick around for several days to fully heal. The hunting was good around here but he would want to limit that to avoid creating an easy trail for people to follow. Sitha preferred to cook meat but that would be too risky with people likely following him. It was a waiting game to see if they found him, or if he had the time to heal.</span></div></div>",

The warrior pulled out some jerky and tore a large chunk off and started to eat as he decided what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gently touched his wound to get a sense of the healing that had occurred and found it to still be very tender. No heavy efforts should be done until it healed more but he wasn\u2019t comfortable sticking around here with the dead on the move. Ghosts of lizard men were loved and respected for the knowledge, and wisdom they could tell you and were never known to harm the living as they were dead and belonged to that world, but as in many things, humans were different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany tales of the harm ghosts could cause had been told to him in his travels, and it seemed to him that humans were unwilling to give up on the lives they had lived. They were often determined to have revenge even after they had died instead of moving on with the cycle of life as determined by the fates. Sitha could see that it brought many of them great accomplishments that were thought impossible, but it rarely brought them happiness. They never seemed able to settle down and enjoy life, there was always some new goal to achieve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was best not to linger with all of these restless ghosts around searching to undo what had been done to them. He cautiously moved towards the place he had come in and hoped the spirits were just replaying the last tragic moments of their lives. Perhaps with his reward, he could see about the shamans putting these people to rest. They didn\u2019t deserve to spend the rest of time stuck here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he moved to go down the rope a sight at the end of the hall caught his eye. A female ghost with long dark hair was staring at him. She started walking towards him with a purpose and he debated running from this intelligent ghost or trying to talk to it. Either choice had danger involved with it, but he was going to lose the chance to run if he didn\u2019t go soon.</span></div></div>",

The warrior had great experience in fighting the living but none in fighting the dead, and he didn\u2019t want to gain any when he was at such a disadvantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain from his wounds finally called on him to stop and fall into another deep slumber on the soft, moist earth. He knew he should have stopped sooner but he wanted to be as far away from there as possible. The sleep was dreamless, and good for his recovery as the pain from his wound no longer bothered him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a look at the wound he found it had healed and was no longer tender to the touch, but it had no scales over. The flesh looked like the skin of a human, and his size had diminished, he was certain the ghost had done something to him. Tightening his belt he continued on his journey, but he wasn\u2019t looking forward to what likely had to be done. Magic was involved and magic was the likely solution to his problems. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis first thought was to go to the shamans of his tribe but they were far from here and he strongly suspected the changes the ghost was doing to him were not finished with him. The sooner Sitha the easier the solution was likely to be, but the magic of the humans and other creatures were strange to him. One of the holy people might have the answer because they were good with curses and the undead but they had many rules and strange customs. They often mocked him for his \u201cprimitive\u201d ways that were far more in touch with nature and the land. The humans wanted to call on divine beings that were distant and alien to life on earth. They didn\u2019t experience the pains and sufferings of mortals, so how could they be trusted with the care of mortals. The last option was the one that frightened him the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWizards and their ilk were terrifying to him because they dealt in forces that were far beyond their control and understanding yet these beings acted like they were the masters of it. Many would likely have the intelligence and knowledge to help him but there was a danger that they would treat him as an experiment for their own selfish power and gain. There was also the chance they would fail him as they over reached their skills and abilities, few wizards ever doubted their chances of success and their failures often had terrible consequences. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a scary choice to have to make when all he really wanted to do was go and collect his reward for his victory, but this was a problem he needed to take care of first.</span></div></div>",

She didn\u2019t want to travel with the knights in case they didn\u2019t have the noble intentions they claimed, and the longer she traveled with them the more likely they would discover she wasn\u2019t what she appeared to be. Things would be easier if she could see their faces so she could try and read them but all she saw was cold steel masks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had an accident but I am fine now.

My name is Sir Jack.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitha started to protest but the knight had already coaxed his horse into motion. She had been hoping to arrive in town unnoticed but she didn\u2019t think the knight was going to listen to any further arguments. The warrior often wondered how the metal-clad warriors became of how certain of their every decision they were. Was it the heavy armor they wore or some sort of training they received? This knight hadn\u2019t even asked for her name as if all that mattered was his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe garments she was wearing needed to be traded in for something better because her chest was bouncing around like a couple of boulders tumbling down a hill. The knight grabbed hold of her chest crushing her body against his. It stopped much of the jiggling but it upset her because it seemed like he wasn\u2019t doing it for her safety. Several of the other knights were laughing at her plight which caused her face to burn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnger started to swell in her that this person was having fun at her expense and she didn\u2019t like it. A voice whispered inside her mind that she should teach the knight some manners. As the dirt road changed into a cobblestone road and the village came into view she decided she had had enough and leaped off the horse shoving the man\u2019s arm aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitha spun towards Sir Jack and grabbed his foot and jerk it up and over the side of the horse. The force of gravity did the rest and sent the man tumbling to the ground in a loud clattering sound that started to be drowned out by the laughter of his companions. Sir Jack didn\u2019t find it as funny as the rest of the knights as he lifted his mud covered faceplate to reveal a nearly purple with anger face but Sitha had no sympathy for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA knight should act like a knight if I had to guess from your behavior I would say you are an ass,\u201d she said with a cold stare. \u201cIt is rare to see an ass ride a horse but the amusement has worn thin I think I have had enough of your company. I suggest we avoid each other for the rest of our time in the village.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words didn\u2019t seem to be her own and that worried the former lizard-man. Was he losing his mind as well as his body? The thought scared her but she would leave it for later because she had a dangerously angry knight in front of her to deal with. Most of the companions were still laughing at their friend and had failed to notice the deep anger so she doubted she could depend on their assistance in the matter. </span></div></div>",

Sitha was unsure of how to handle the man and was confused by human interactions but she wasn\u2019t so she took charge. This man was a predator of women and needed to be dealt with as such. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBack off before I hurt you,\u201d Emily ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t tell a knight of the realm what to do,\u201d Sir Jack moved close with his hand on his blade. \u201cWe keep order for the lands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t do a very good job of it when you threaten the citizens!\u201d Emily countered. \u201cI suggest you not come any closer to me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr you will do what?\u201d the man took a deliberate step forward with each word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gust of wind struck the man square in his chest as commanded by the beautiful woman and sent him flying several feet back to the ground. Emily glanced carefully around at the man\u2019s companions to see what they were up to. They had pulled their horses back a short distance and looked like they were debating what to do next. It was one thing to mess with a defenseless peasant girl but quite another to harass a female spell caster who may have a great deal of power. As they were thinking up their next actions she was placing magical defenses on herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suggest you find your sport somewhere else before you get burned,\u201d she directed her threat against Sir Jack to help divide him from the group. Emily suspected that the others were not always innocent bystanders but she didn\u2019t want to encourage the others to assist their friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t let you beat me,\u201d Sir Jack got up from the ground as he pulled his blade out and started towards Emily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head at the stupidity but she let loose great cone of flames from her hands shot forth coating the man in fire melting flesh and bone dropping an ash filled, a charred black suit of armor to the ground. She whipped around to face the horrified other members of the group but she was thankful that none of them had pulled their weapons yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suggest you see to your friend and you go looking for whatever you are looking somewhere else because I don\u2019t want any more dealings with you and I am certain you want no more dealings with me,\u201d Emily stated cautiously. </span></div></div>",

She wiped the sweat from her brow, glad that the strain from keeping the magic up was over. The young woman moved quickly into the safety of the village in case the group decided to double back. She wasn\u2019t sure if they really felt she was justified in killing the man or if they just didn\u2019t want to fight her, either way, she was happy to have them gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRustling Leaves was a small village with a large population of elves and humans living in harmony. It was known for the healing herbs and remedies and the people were friendly even to strangers. Emily went to the Golden Goose Inn, a luxury inn, and secured a room. It would be nice to have a warm bath and a soft bed again but the real reason she had splurged on the room with the lizardman\u2019s money was the mirror. A giant lizardman looked at her angrily from the mirror at her and she could understand it, considering what she had done to his body, but she needed to finish her mission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am sorry for what I have done to you but I have a mission I must complete,\u201d Emily explained. \u201cI shall return this body to you once my quest is done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have been dead for many years human,\u201d Sitha growled. \u201cYour mission is no longer of importance.

He had never heard of one of his people returning from the dead but if one had come back then surely it would be for a good reason. She seemed genuinely worried about something and he decided to give her the benefit of the doubt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI shall try to work with you,\u201d Sitha told Emily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelief formed on Emily\u2019s face, \u201cThank you. We can head out in the morning to collect what I left behind. The Order of Dromos is looking to make their master a god which will cause mass destruction the world and we have to put a stop to it. I have an ally nearby who is likely still alive but it is essential we get the gem that holds his essence so we can destroy it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI assume it is not so simple as taking a large hammer to it,\u201d Sitha could sense this was going to be a lot of trouble he had committed to being involved with this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis servants have ways of recapturing his essence available we have to either take it to a temple or perform a ritual to make sure he goes to the Hells where he belongs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lizardfolk nodded before going to sleep for the night trying to process what he had learned and what he should do to keep this over with as soon as possible. Dealing with humans always seemed to create a lot more work than what was planned at the start. They failed to have the single-minded goals of the lizard but perhaps he could use this process to simplify things. Get the gem would be first and after that was accomplished you decided on the next task, why did humans have to make things so complex. It felt awkward going to sleep with these strange extensions on the body but he managed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily didn\u2019t like to have a companion in her body, well, it might not be her body but it felt like her body. It was tempting to try and throw the other spirit out the body so that she wouldn\u2019t have any opposition but Sitha was very ground and attached to the world. She wouldn\u2019t take the body permanently but having to go to a committee for decisions would make her job harder, still, it was better to not have him fight. At least with him in the body, she could wander through the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the body as an anchor she could explore the world as an astral spirit. The forces of Dromos might have detected she left her prison and would certainly come after her. It appeared many years had passed since her death and she hoped that with those years came to the end of the Order of Dromos. Without their master\u2019s guidance, it might have fallen apart and this would be nothing but a short trip but that was too much to hope for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDromos had been born a demigod but he looked to join the pantheon of true celestial beings. He had formed a secret army through the enslavement of others mostly with magic but a few he seduced with offers of pleasure or power. He had started a ritual that was to rise him to the heavens but Emily and a group of others had managed to stop it. Hiding the gem container had taken most of her magical energy and prevent her from protecting herself but she was worried that someone had betrayed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFew people knew where she had gone, all of the group that survived had spread far and wide to hide who had the gem. She hadn\u2019t originally been the one with it, Artus, their leader had it but he secretly met her and put it in her care as an extra safeguard. She had been slain without them ever questioning if she had the gem. This would require some investigation into who had survived and she wasn\u2019t sure Sitha would be up for that.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately being dead had also proved difficult in doing everything she wanted, she had been attached to the world by her unfinished business and to the location of her death but things had changed with getting a living body back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe astral realm didn\u2019t fully look like the real world and there were often more dangers here than there were in the real world. Gods and demons had a greater access to this place and they often looked for stray souls to take and empower them so she would have to be careful and not just rush off after the first line she found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached through the connections she had with others until she found the one she was looking for and stretched out the threads so they became more clear to her. The gem called to her in this realm offering to bring true life back to her but she refused it as she had so many times over the years. Dromos would know and come for her and she would be more vulnerable with the gem attached to her, she would have to remove the enchantments that she had used to hide it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gem wasn\u2019t evil, at least it hadn\u2019t been designed to be evil but some god long ago, she suspected one of trickery or jokes was involved, had crafted the artifact to give people what they desired most if they could fill it with the energy it needs, unfortunately, there were a lot of stupid and evil people out there. It would be best if they could just destroy it but she first wanted to find out what had gone wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thread she found was of Artus and to her surprise, she found out he was alive after all of this time. How had he managed to survive all of these years? The man was a paladin of legend, had the gods blessed him with an extended life for his service or had he fallen? He had been the one to give her the gem so she didn\u2019t think he was the one to betray her, it could be that he was that he was cursed, perhaps a trap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath, well not really as she was in astral form there was no use dwelling on what she didn\u2019t know but focus on what she could learn. Emily traced another thread and found that Lucian was still alive as well but instead of focusing on him she went to the final thread. Mercedes and found her thread was dead and had been dead for a long time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo of her companions were alive which meant if there was a traitor they were likely still alive which meant it was more important than ever to protect the gem. </span></div></div>",

The healing had progressed well but his body was still sore even after stretching but within a day or two, he should be back to full strength. Sitha decided to make sure he had hidden his trail the night before because he couldn\u2019t be sure he had hidden it well while wounded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the trail had been well hidden and was likely to go undiscovered by those who tracked him unless they had tracking animals but he had seen none at the fort. It would take them time if they had to hire trackers with animals, valuable time as his scent faded and that was if the animals had a proper source scent to follow. His blood had likely mingled with the blood of the  Prince and his other kills at the Fort rendering it less useful but he couldn\u2019t depend on it. He would need to plan defenses of this place and have a way to escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSearching the for trails around the place he found them as overgrown as he remembered. Few if any still traveled through this area which suited him fine but there would still be people who would remember stories of this place if they were asked the right questions. He wasn\u2019t certain if he should place traps or not because though he might get a couple of people it would certainly signify to searchers that someone was here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to leave that question until later as he circled the town looking over buildings trying to determine which ones would be safe to enter and which ones might make a tomb over his head if he wasn\u2019t careful. Sitha didn\u2019t like how most of the buildings swayed when he only put forth a little effort into moving them. There were not many places for him to hide in the town but perhaps he could suggest otherwise. Digging in his clawed feet he marked his passage into the various buildings in town to spread confusion to anyone who might check if he got lucky they might even have a building kill a few, at the very least it should give him some time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warrior eyed the remaining buildings and debated searching for the things of interest or if he should do some hunting as his supplies would not last forever. Sitha decided he should head back to his room and continue his plans after dark. His eyes worked better at night than those of the humans who were likely chasing him so working at night would allow him to go unnoticed better if there were any prying eyes around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing to sleep when so much was left undone felt wrong to him but it was best if he was going to stay here awhile but when it got dark he intended to work twice as hard when that time came. For now, he would close his eyes and make plans for tonight while he slept. </span></div></div>",

The ground here was not a swamp like he was familiar with and loved instead it was a forest thick with pine trees with a chill to the air he didn\u2019t like. He would be spending a great deal of time out in the sun basking in its warm rays to make up for the chill he was feeling in his bones. The dark night didn\u2019t help with the cold but it was a friend to him and he often shared its embrace on his hunts in the swamp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitha\u2019s keen eyes and nose soon found prey to hunt, a large stag moved through the woods cautious of dangers like him. The buck ears perked up as it heard something out of place but it wasn\u2019t the lizardman. Sitha wished he had brought his sword with him but he had only brought a few spears with him to travel light. If it were some knights seeking revenge for their fallen master he would have to run or take weapons from those he managed to kill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe aimed a spear at where the deer was looking, no longer concerned about a fresh meal. The deer raced away as the danger approached passing the lizardman who gave it not a glance as he waited for what had frightened the creature. Drow moved through the woods with a disregard for the noise they made as only ones who felt vastly superior to all around them could. They were five in number and armed for war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark elves wore full chain armor save for one, a spell caster by the look of her staff carved with arcane symbols. He wasn\u2019t certain what they were up to but he was very certain he didn\u2019t want to get involved with them. Many things could have brought them to the surface from their dens of evil far beneath the earth, they could be seeking to hunt down their surface-dwelling cousins, hunting down slaves was another option or they could be searching for a foul artifact to add to their collections. None of the options he could think of were good and the lizardman wondered if he could avoid dealing with him as they were heading in his direction. The drow did seem distracted but it wasn\u2019t something he wanted to depend upon. </span></div></div>",

It was likely some sort of poison to paralyze their prey so they could enslave them or torture them to death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir eyes were even keener in the darkness than his but he prayed they were distracted enough to not notice him. The group passed him causing his heart to beat hard in his chest to the point he was almost afraid they would hear it. They were vulnerable to attack, it was a chance he would not get again. He didn\u2019t know if they were going to be back this way but if they did he was likely to lose to them. Sitha lifted his spear to a position to charge if he could take out a couple he might be able to survive this encounter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey barely registered hearing the sound of Sitha\u2019s pounding footstep as he rushed forward and plunged the spear through the spell caster and one of the warriors. He released his grip as soon as the second dark elf was speared and brought his jaws shut on the throat of third, enjoying the flavor of fresh meat in his mouth, as he tore the drow\u2019s sword from his hand to face the last two enemies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA roar of rage filled the air as one of them charged him with a wild swing but the second hesitated in fear at the monster who had already slain three of his companions.

With practiced blind fighting training, the dark elf continued the fight but his opponent was a skilled warrior as well who only took careful slices from his enemy now that he had taken advantage of the drow\u2019s mistake while keeping a careful eye on last dark elf who was slowly backing away from the encounter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRun!

The sharp tip of the spear true and sent the freshly made corpse to the ground allowing the lizardfolk sometime to relax and think about what he wanted to do next but he made sure to keep some distance from the dying drow in front of him because even in the dying state they could be very dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warrior slid to the ground clutching at his stomach, \u201cYou have only served to delay us. Others will come and they will bring armies to crush your world. My people will make boots of you and your kind. You are animals to be used and disposed of at our whim.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly the drow seemed to retain that confidence in their ability after losing to an opponent but Sitha ignored him as he started to search the corpses. He had risked his life to fight them so he should get some reward out of it. As the drow took his time babbling about how superior he was Sitha stripped them of everything of value taking the spellbook that would surely bring a fortune to him. It would go a long way toward achieving his goal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet go of that book you stupid handbag!\u201d fear finally crossed the dying man\u2019s face, something about the spell book was especially important and valuable. \u201cOr I will see that they curse your spirit for all eternity when they awaken my body to find you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am tired of your yammering warm blood,\u201d Sitha stalked towards the man. \u201cYou assume too little of me, you will talk to no one in this life or the next.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were foul ways to make the dead talk but most of them required the skull and he was thankfully still hungry. His jaws ended the noise of the drow and his belly was soon filled with three skulls. He stripped the bodies to make it easier for scavengers to take care of the bodies. The fact that the drow hadn\u2019t called out for others told him that help was far from here so he didn\u2019t need to worry about time but he was uncertain about when their disappearance would be noticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flipped through the book the spell caster had and was surprised to find that it wasn\u2019t in the language of the elves or Underdark, it was a language far more familiar to him, draconic. The language of dragons was well known in mystical circles and by all of the reptilian races. He had learned to read the words in the schools of the humans. Curious as to why a drow would write in draconic he examined the body closer and saw the markings of a warlock, someone who bound themselves to a powerful entity and would have no need for a spell book. A decision would have to be made. </span></div></div>",

Sitha didn\u2019t trust his senses to protect himself from the silent footsteps of the insidious dark elves. It was better to get the jump on them while he still had the chance. Depending on the number he could fight or retreat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved cautiously through the forest. Sitha found the trail easy to follow but why shouldn\u2019t it be? They felt themselves the masters of any land they tread upon. As a child, he had once witnessed a raid by them. The drow fell that day but not before taking more than their number with them. One of his nest mates had died slowly of their poisons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoises of camp life ahead halted the forward movement of the lizardman. It appeared they had slaves with them for the drow would never be this noisy. The heavy footsteps of an armored guard and Sitha rushed to great it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shocked look formed on the human\u2019s face but no cry for help got past the dagger in the throat. Slaying the guard put a clock on his discovery but it left him with a path out of here. Some nearby bushes hid the body well as the lizardman stalked close to the camp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral cages full of slaves had been erected with the men in one cage, woman in another, and the final cage had children in it. They appeared to be of various races leading Sitha to suspect this was a base camp for raiders. He knew of an entrance to the underdark not far from here where they could be moved to or traded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t hard to spot where the drow lurked. At least five guards waited near a series of black tents. A large magic circle was in the center of the camp with a group of robed figures chanting. From a cage, a large human man was dragged and tossed into the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease you can\u2019t do this to me I have a family!\u201d the man pleaded with magic users to no avail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chanting continued and when he tried to exit the circle a magical barrier prevented the escape attempt. Sitha hated the evil magic the people of the \u201ccivilized\u201d races crafted and was tempted to put an end to this ritual. </span></div></div>",

The more problems he caused for them the better, they might close ranks but it would mean the Prince would never get away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitha only went a short distance in the woods before he started to backtrack through the trees, in his hunts he had seen the elves use the trees to great advantage because most species didn\u2019t do a good job of observing the trees, it would allow him to keep close and take advantage of any opportunities that presented themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe strapped himself down and went to sleep resting since he had some time, they wouldn\u2019t be after him until morning unless they were complete fools. Sitha went into a dreamless slumber eager to start the hunt in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warrior was careful to react slowly to the sounds that had awoken him, bits of sunlight were trickling in upon his scales. It would have been a pleasant morning if people weren\u2019t seeking his death. He had the urge to move up into more densely packed branches but it would make too much noise, even the armored warriors clanking through the bushes were certain to notice him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you tell how many there were that attack us last night?\u201d Prince Stephan asked one of the searchers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to secure the help of a ranger sir,\u201d the man hesitated to give his liege bad news. \u201cNone of these men are master trackers, the lizardfolk are good in the wild.

If it was just a single lizard I think I know who it is and it is an assassin sent by my Father. We must know as soon as possible, make sure you find out Captain Helm or all of our heads may be hanging from pikes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Captain nodded and went back to guiding the search but he put in an order for a horse so he could go to hire a ranger.

The tales of the power it held varied from the tribe telling the tale but all seemed to agree that it gave the power to challenge even dragons and that was certainly something that he wanted for his people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvil dragons took advantage of his people and made them slaves to their whims and gluttony for treasure. Sitha wanted to slay some of them to punish them for some of the lizard people who had died in their service and maybe some of the treasure could help build a better life. The simple living in the swamp could be nice but it was a harsh life because they depended on the swamp to provide them with food and it wasn\u2019t always of a giving nature. The lack of protection from all of the predators and hostile forces of the world was the biggest issue. Swamps weren\u2019t exactly prime building grounds but some walls would be nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey to the fort was long but he still refused to take a horse because it felt too much like riding your food, luckily there was a raft that went most of the way to the location and his legs were strong enough to get him the rest of the way to the location.

His kind was not often seen this far north so was it just a fear of the unknown or had they some prejudice from the war with the kingdom over two centuries ago. War could build a lasting hate with many people as he knew of many lizard people still bore grudges against humans from ancestors who were killed by humans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided avoiding the hostility was the best so he quickly grabbed some salted meat and dropped more than enough coins to pain for it and started to head away from the market to continue his journey. Sitha winced as a staff slammed hard into his side causing him to spin around to see the danger he was facing. A group of at least ten villagers had gathered as a mob and the numbers were starting to swell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weapons they carried were mostly tools and farm implements but they could still be dangerous in enough numbers though he would take a lot of them with him especially considering none of them had any armor on them. Anger was making his bloodthirsty at being attacked when he had done nothing wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I need a new lizard skin for the wall,\u201d a portly man holding a hammer took a menacing step towards Sitha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs long as I get to keep the skull,\u201d an unseen person in the crowd called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitha kept backing towards the exit of the town but they kept following him. He could feel a crowd starting to come towards his back and spared a glance and saw he was being surrounded. Several rocks struck him. A man charged forward with a sledgehammer thinking they had the warrior in front of them powerless. The lizardman slammed the man to the ground and pressed his foot on the throat of a man drawing his blade in case the crowd tried to rush him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI only wish to leave,\u201d Sitha hissed at the mob. \u201cI have no desire for bloodshed but I will kill if it means keeping myself safe. I know not what your grudge is but I have done you no wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched as the crowd took a step back from the range of his blade but they made no move to part for him to leave so he didn\u2019t remove his foot from the man\u2019s throat. The crowd was murmuring angrily but he couldn\u2019t determine what they were planning to do yet. Sitha scanned the crowded for weak points to breakthrough if he had to. It did look that several members of the mob were leaving, most likely not wanting to risk the violence the lizardman was threatening but it also meant that those left were likely to not leave unless blood was shed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is going to be no easy escape for you, monster,\u201d a woman holding a large butcher knife threatened. </span></div></div>",

Most beings only understood their own pain, it was better to leave her with her grief and maybe in time she would be able to move past it. He was nearly out of the village when he heard the fast footsteps of someone running him down. The woman held the cleaver at the ready as she charged him but Sitha knew she was no threat to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had butchered animals in her shop but he had butchered men and monsters. His scaly hand easily grabbed her swinging arm and twisted it so the blade fell harmlessly to the ground. Silence had fallen over the villagers as they waited for the lizardman to strike. Sitha wondered if they would attack him if he slew the woman, it didn\u2019t matter he had little interest in killing her. His sharp teeth were shown as he opened his mouth wide giving her a good look at the instruments of death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you wish to die?\u201d Sitha asked. \u201cHow many of your neighbors do you wish to die? I will not go down easily, I was not the one to slay your son and I have no wishes to slay any of the children of this village but I will if I must. Grieve for your loved ones as I do for the ones I lost to humans, find the ones responsible and make them pay if you must but I am weary of blood for blood so don\u2019t make me live by your standard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe freed her and continued on his way sparing a glance occasionally as he vanished from sight but she just sat and stared at him. Sighing with relief he continued until he could bring the keep of the prince into view. </span></div></div>",

Recruiting looked a lot like slavery to the eyes of Sitha but the important thing was knowing where the Prince would be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were no patrols of the forest near the fort at night so he worked at night to avoid notice preparing his ambush of his target. The work would be a lot easier if he could get some of the local villagers who hated the Prince to assist him but how could he know who to trust. Gold commanded the minds of many humans even when it was in their best interest to not listen to the shiny golden medal. Perhaps he could go after the prisoners that the humans had taken and get some assistance but it was likely the Prince would realize he was being targeted and become much more cautious about his actions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyeing the large building far from the fort where the prisoners were kept he realized it was vulnerable. The fencing could be jumped over and there were only three guards at night. If he could slaughter the guards and free the prisoners it would slow the progress on the repairs to the fort and force the properly trained knights to go gathering villagers again leaving the Prince more vulnerable.

Thankfully there were a lot of extra books and equipment in a chest for her that she was able to use.

The value of the stuff was worth several thousand gold pieces but he just waved her off when she tried to deny the gifts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would start with the more expensive and more difficult of the potions because much of the stuff she had seen had been running the last time she was here months ago. He would have shut down the equipment if it was a potion little value. Melis focused on her memory to see if any of the chemicals had started to shift color. One of the beakers that was bubbling had become a brilliant golden color so she took a small sample of the bubbling material and placed it carefully in her own beaker for testing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was tedious work trying to decipher the notes but she picked out the easy words for her to figure out to narrow her search. Worry started to fill her because many of the ingredients were worth thousands of gold by themselves. Whatever was being worked on was certainly worth killing for. Melis eliminated to the possibility of a youth potion, immortality potion or the most dreaded of all, the potion to transform someone into a lich. Undead of the foulest and most dangerous nature, liches require a life in order to make the final transformation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t want to think it was possible that her friend would take that transformation.

The more she thought about it the more of a possibility it seemed. The Archmage always viewed things as an obstacle to overcome and wasn\u2019t death but a challenge to overcome to reach the eternal learning that he desired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe temptation to smash the equipment was great but she wasn\u2019t certain yet and there would be no taking back what she had done if she was wrong. Looking at the information she had it looked like the potion was nearing completion which worried her. She doubted she could stop her friend if she challenged him but he wouldn\u2019t have the time to start the potion again if she were to smash it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps, it was best to test further even though she was reaching the edge of her knowledge. If she was wrong she could be killing her friend by ending whatever potion he was creating. Melis cast a spell to detect evil over the equipment and the stench of it was overwhelming and she had to take a few steps back. The spell was a tool but it wasn\u2019t very precise because certain creatures you use for potions could detect as the evil they used to be. There was some regret in the casting because she now had more worries and concerns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another look at the notes it looked like it was possible that this potion might not even be for the Archmage. King Emeril\u2019s name appeared to have been written several times in the notes but it was hard to tell why. Was he the source of the ingredients or the final recipient of the results of the potion? His children wouldn\u2019t be happy to hear their Father was planning to extend his rule indefinitely which would explain why several of them had been shipped away lately. Melis had thought it was to help stabilize the kingdom now that they were mostly at peace but there could certainly be a much darker motive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dealings with the King were limited but she knew of the terrible acts that were sometimes committed by his most loyal forces the Crimson Tigers. The young cleric had hoped the next generation would disband them. The idea that he wanted to become the eternal ruler of these lands worried her and she wondered what she should do next. </span></div></div>",

There was too much risk in leaving these chemicals unattended. She needed to get rid of them in case there was an evil purpose to what was going on here. Melis tightened her grip on the mace and swung with all of her might. Containers shattered under her blows spilling and splashing chemicals all over the area extinguishing the flames. If she was wrong she had probably done more damage than she could ever hope to repay and ruined a great friendship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held back tears at the sad thought but she still had a quest to complete. Melis would try and explain why she had done it to him and pray he understood. She cleaned up the destruction she had done and put it in the trash, salvaging what she could, which wasn\u2019t much. The cleric sat down and wrote a note in case the Archmage returned while she was gone looking for him. Walking down the stairs she could feel something was off, something wasn\u2019t right. It was possible that it was just her guilt nagging at her but it felt like something more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalling on her magic she detected life outside of the tower. This wasn\u2019t unusual, as many people called on the wizard of the tower for help but she thought that people had been informed of the absence of the wizard. A worry came to mind as she contemplated why the people were here, they could be after the treasures locked away in the tower, the tower that she had unlocked. Going on the defensive she put her shield in place and lifted her mace as she moved to the exit to confront the people outside of the tower. </span></div></div>",

Whispering a couple prayers protection she proceeded with her investigation jumping as a trap spell lashed out at her defenses, but her protective shield held against the attack giving the young cleric a great deal of relief. Gathering herself she continued looking over the shelves of books to see if anything stood out of the ordinary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe books were all well label to make the easy to find, from shrinking, to animal transformation the books covered a variety of topics. Thankfully but disgustingly, cleaning did not appear to be in the wizard\u2019s primary skill set so figuring out what he had been looking at recently was easy. It appeared he had been investigating the legend of a gorgon. It would be a dangerous pastime even for the Archmage to go after a gorgon, but perhaps the treasure of the gorgon\u2019s victims had lured him to its lair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping through the books didn\u2019t take long to discover notes indicating the location of a possible gorgon lair hidden in the sea caves far to the south. It would mean traveling to an unfamiliar lands but her oath to the King loomed large in her head. Information on the gorgon itself was sparse and not knowing your opponent was dangerous. Was it better to head directly to the site, investigate this particular gorgon first, or take some precautions against the gaze of the gorgon?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You avoid looking it in the eyes and destroy the head so no further people would be harmed by the petrification it could cause even after death. Melis had never fought a creature so dangerous before but her friend was in danger and she wanted to help him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Archmage had been like a Father to her ever since she had joined the order as a girl just entering her teens. Her parents lived far from the capital city and couldn\u2019t afford to visit and none of her friends had the aptitude to join the order. It was very lonely those first few months but the Archmage took an interest in her and her studies. They had become close friends over the years and she wanted to repay some of that kindness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe set her horse to a fast pace but nothing that her stallion couldn\u2019t keep up for hours without rest. Melis was tempted to push the speed and just exchange horses at stops along the way but it was a dangerous practice as many station owners tried to trick inexperience people out of fine animals in exchange for inferior stock. She had no desire to waste time haggling with them and besides Starlight had been a gift to her from the King. The rumor was that his bred had been blessed by unicorns with superior intelligence and strength and she had never found him wanting in either of those categories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as she wanted to carry on exhaustion was setting in and sleep was needed if she wanted to make good decisions. The Way Stations provided comfortable beds and exchanges for horses for travelers. They were run by servants of the King and though they were often not as nice as many inns though they were usually of a very reasonable price. In the opinion of the young cleric, they were very good for the commerce of the Kingdom as they often provide a place to sleep safely in uncivilized areas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a familiar lay out with a large clearing around thick wooden walls with a couple of guards on duty all during the night. They likely wouldn\u2019t be able to help anyone if there was any real danger but they made travelers feel a lot safer. </span></div></div>",

The people seemed to go about their business with no notice of the giant staring at them. Melis said a small prayer and was soon granted with being able to see the threads of magic, and the village was covered in a tangle of them that Melis wasn\u2019t able to determine all of their effects. Spells of protection and warding were obvious but she wasn\u2019t sure what a certain spell did, as she leaned to get a closer look a hidden ward struck her sending her flailing backwards to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelis shook her head to clear her thoughts and cursed herself for being, so foolish as to think an Arch mage wouldn't have hidden defenses. Luckily it appeared to be a simple stun spell with an alarm attached to it. Well, that is one way to find the Arch mage Melis thought glumly as she tried to sit up, but she found the weight of her armor was starting to hold her back. With a surge of effort she regained her feet only to stumble forward as she realized her feet had become much smaller. Articles of armor dropped to the floor as Melis met up with the floor once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was several minutes before Melis was able to collect herself to find that she was naked and enveloped in darkness. The netting around her was heavy with some sort of metal above it that made the going slow, but it wasn\u2019t long before she entered into the light and realized how dire her situation was. She was now the size of one of the people from the village surrounded by her armor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo to the village and be judged,\u201d appeared in large letters in the air as a staircase on the table leading to the village formed. Going to the village had untold dangers but it was possible to get some answers. The chemicals on the lab or the books on the shelves could offer a solution to her current situation, or make it worse. Finally, she had a potion that could restore her on her horse outside, but at this size it would be quite a distance and possibly dangerous. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Going to the village would hopefully signal the Archmage who should come to check out what had happened and she would be able to end this mystery. It was embarrassing to walk naked but there was no clothing in sight of her. She tried to cover her generous bosom with one arm as she walked to prevent some of the jigglings as she went up the stairs. As she walked up the stairway the steps vanished behind her, she wasn\u2019t sure if it was an illusion or real but she decided to continue on with her journey and not worry about it. Mages had a habit of messing with reality to scare other people and it was usually best to ignore it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelis arrived at the top of the stairs and saw an amazing array of brightly colored buildings and thankfully there was a set of robes for her to put on. The cloth felt wonderful against her skin as she made her way to open the door to the village. She hesitated as she walked to the door because she suspected once it shut behind her it would not open again. With a heavy sigh she decided if she had gone this far why not a go all the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door hissed as it opened and she stepped through and as she predicted it slammed shut behind her. She walked out into the empty streets wondering if she was the only one here. There seemed to be some sort of countdown clock in the sky above. It looked like there was still an hour until whatever event was going to occur so she might have some time to explore this village. </span></div></div>",

Now, all she needed to decide was how to go about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot for the first time was she frustrated with her large breasts as they jiggled with her movements. Melis didn\u2019t want to be ugly but looking like a royal pleasure woman was frustrating with how she was treated by many of nobles. Clothing was essential for her modesty even if no one was around, so she went to her satchel to look at her scrolls holding her breasts tight to prevent their movement. She hated to loose a scroll but she wanted to cover up, so the sacrifice of a scroll of minor healing. It felt more like wearing a towel, but some support was better than none. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she collected herself and started to head for the stairs she saw a black rat maneuvering towards her. It was easily twice her size and its teeth didn\u2019t look friendly. With a quick prayer a searing holy light flashed from her hand leaving a scorched rat corpse, but to her dismay she saw at least five other rat starting to head her way.  She could try to make a run for the stairs but that would leave her out in the open, or she could make a dash for a hole in the wall where she could fight the rats one at a time, however the hole spoke of untold dangers, and might not lead down the tower.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The reality turned out to be very different than her theory as the rats quickly outpaced her movements and surrounded her and began to edge closer to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick prayer the young priestess summoned forth a a spiritual mace made of holy energy and launched herself at a rat striking a deadly blow on the skull ending it\u2019s life instantly but she only had a moment to plan her next action as the rats launched a counter attack against her. She felt the hot breath of a rat as her training kicked in sending her weapon violently crashing in the neck of the beast snapping it in several place. Melis wanted a few moments to collect herself but they weren\u2019t to be had as one of the final three creatures launched into the air slamming her body to the floor knocking her head against the causing her to lose the concentration on maintaining her spiritual weapon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear began to enter her mind as the danger grew as she watched her weapon fade from reality.

Hope swelled in her that she might be able to call forth lightning to end the lives of the remaining rats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rodents were scrambling to their feet faster than the priestess would have liked, but she paid no attention as the spell she was summoning required complete focus. Evan as the incisors of a rat dug into her thigh her concentration held. The air crackled as lightning slid through the air striking home against the rats ending their lives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelis wanted to collapse in exhaustion but many dangers lurked in this tower and certainly more now that she was tiny. She eyed the small of wound on her leg and wondered if she should use a minor or major healing spell on it. Rodents were know for carrying diseases much less what one from a wizard\u2019s tower could be carrying, but the combat had exhausted a lot of her magic and at her size she couldn\u2019t use any of her items to compensate for the loss of magic and strength.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A small pray made the bite vanish without even leaving a scar. She quickly moved to the stair case which would lead to the removal of the condition she was under. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no easy way down the stairs for someone who was only six inches tall. A straight drop caused her breasts to jiggle mercilessly. The second step down wasn\u2019t much better as she slid down with her chest pressed against the cold stop. After a few more steps she paused her descent to decide if there was a better way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thigh began to itch and she began to scratch it mindlessly as she contemplated if she should risk more magic to ease the journey down the stairs, but before she could make a decision she felt a heat begin to spread through her body. It was pleasant at first but it was unnatural, it was likely an indicator of the activation of a magical spell. Melis began to say the greater healing spell but all that came out was, \u201cSqueek!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain crackled through her body causing her to fall to the ground on her hands and knee. Melis yanked the scrap of scroll from her body leaving her naked. Every attempt to utter the spell was interrupted by further painful transformation. A long tail sprouted from her body, followed by her jaws extending as sharp incisors started to form in her mouth, and fur began to cover her naked body. Breasts that had once drawn the stares of many men shrank into her body as 10 more pairs of nipples began to form along her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long for a female rat to be standing where the young cleric had been. Vocal cords that might have said a counter spell were no longer available to her and her mind had altered to new needs, wants and desires. She could smell the other rats in the tower and knew they would be coming for her shortly but no fear entered her mind as the heat in her lower region was calling out for them. Soon she would more than replace the rodents she had killed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrawling up the steps to the top of the tower with her new clawed feet was easy and it didn\u2019t take long for her to scurry across the floor as her tail whipping the air. Male rats rush to meet her and were warm in their greeting licking her genitals sending pleasure coursing through her body. She stood still waiting for the first male to mount his place of honor and she didn\u2019t have long to wait as the largest male pressed his long penis into place slowly thrusting back and forth into her while holding in place with his incisors on the scruff of her neck. Sperm flooded her womb seeking out her eggs to fertilize the eggs. It was over in less than a minute but she wouldn\u2019t have to long to wait for the pleasure to return as another male lined up behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former virgin wasn\u2019t sure if she was pregnant, but it wouldn\u2019t be for lack of trying. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All the money and property owned by his family had been taken, leaving Hector and his Mother to the less than tender mercies of the streets. Hector had grown up hard and fast but not quick enough to save his Mother from the ravages of disease that could have been treated if they had had the money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was amazing that Hector had attained the title of Captain over several pirate ships at the age of twenty but he intended far greater things and his pirates believed in him and his chances of success. Every success added to his reputation and brought more and better people to work for him but failure would be the death knell for his revenge because pirates didn\u2019t back losers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no moon out this night allowing them to move with greater stealth as they took potions that would give them dark vision for the rest of the night. The compound appeared to be lightly guarded but Hector suspected it was just cover to hide the truth of the valuable property they protected. The pirates would have to work quickly and try to block any alarms from being sounded because when the city guard got involved the numbers would quickly turn against them even if they had superior skill. Setting two of his best archers to secure their escape route if things went bad quickly and headed towards the entrance.</span></div></div>",

All they really needed to do was steal the ship, it wasn\u2019t like they were going to stick around and hold the port hostage. All he wanted was the ship, at least for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d he smiled at the boarding crew. \u201cIt is time to separate the men from the ladies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I were a lady I might take offense at that comment,\u201d Cali pulled out her short sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have to show her that you have bigger balls than her. At least do that for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFat chance with this lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral of them chuckled and elbowed each other as they drew their weapons. These were some of his finest people, he had handpicked them for this mission. They were not as bloodthirsty as so many who found their way to this field of work. Brandishing their weapons with a few quick sword strokes would be enough, he didn\u2019t want them getting into a prolonged fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral loud explosions lit the night sky attracting the attention of the guards. Most of them didn\u2019t even notice the pirates until they saw them cutting the ropes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be up there!\u201d a shined a beacon lantern on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding me,\u201d Roger muttered as another rope fell away. \u201cI am not asking for archmages or anything as guards but seriously get a clue buddy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPirates at work go away!\u201d Hector shouted. \u201cThere does that make you feel better.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMuch.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you coming, Lenna? I don\u2019t mean to rush you but they may have realized we don\u2019t belong here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crossbow bolt flew past his head for emphasis but the elf mage didn\u2019t react. Her concentration was on overriding the controls but sharp words would be had later from her. She didn\u2019t seem able to take her stick out of her butt but she had an essential job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t stand there!\u201d a captain of the guards appeared with reinforcement cutting down their time table. \u201cGet aboard the ship and arrest them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger smiled as he saw the man made no attempt to come aboard the ship himself. The vessel creaked to life lifting them into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would love to stay and talk but I have places to be,\u201d his crew cheered as the guard fell to the hard stone below. Hector took the helm and steered away from the port only taking time to pick up his snipers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis prize was worth a fortune and would set them up for a long time to come if they sold it. They would not be happy to hear that he was thinking of doing other things, grander things. It would be difficult to win them over because most were after instant gratification.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere should he go? </span></div></div>",

Far below he could see his ship Bella\u2019s Hope waiting for him in the waters below. Three other ships were docked at the pirate port with life bustling even this early in the morning. The holds were being loaded for new trips or pirates were in a hurry to sell their goods so they could enjoy the fruits of their criminal behavior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if I told you I was thinking of not selling this ship?\u201d Captain Hector turned to Cali. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would say you promised the crew a major score, you haven\u2019t exactly been filling the holds with gold and silver,\u201d concern filled her face. \u201cWhat hair-brained scheme are you thinking of trying to accomplish?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe could be so much more than simple pirates barely scraping by.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnless you want a knife in your spleen I would suggest you cut the sales pitch and get to the point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have two options, option one we go after the Castle of Queen Nazara. The second option we start forming an armada, we could bring back the pirate kings and queens of the days of yore. Which one do you think I could sell to the crew easier?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me think. The first one involves going to an island with a nest of ornery wyverns to find a place that may or not exist. Even if it does exist we don\u2019t know if it is still functional yet it still has more chance than your second choice. Armadas require money which we don\u2019t have and it requires captains to show a modicum of teamwork which I have yet to see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf there is enough money involved . . .\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will just have more blades stabbing into your back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHerzod has said he would be willing to give us a loan which will buy us time for the crew to come around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCali rushed in and kneed him in the balls dropping him groaning to the deck. She piloted the ship into docks and waited for the captain to recover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI take it you don\u2019t think dealing with him is a good idea.\u201d Hector struggled to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe will make a loan with anyone but makes sure they are forever in his debt. Do you want a slave collar around your neck because I sure don\u2019t. It is good to have dreams but let us just sell the ship and see where that takes us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe might never get a chance at another skyship.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThan sell Bella\u2019s Hope, it will be less of a profit but you won\u2019t have a mutiny on your hands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps you are right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t know if he could sell Bella\u2019s Hope, it had been his Father\u2019s ship even if he did sell it wouldn\u2019t be long before he tried to get it back. The attractions of town didn\u2019t call him as they usually did. Trollops and whores pressed their wares against him but he just pushed past them. The shouts and screams of the gambling parlors held no sirens call only the business district had what he want. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was far quieter here, even the most notorious pirates didn\u2019t dare steal from these men but the foolish and desperate would still try. Fearsome guards stood by to make them think twice. Shops for buying an selling all goods were available it was now time to pick the future for him and his crew.</span></div></div>",

The shipyard closed down at night with only a couple of workers staying late for work and a couple of guards patrolled the yard. Numerous figures seemed to be peeking out from behind cover looking for something and he had a strong idea that they were looking for him. He had been betrayed by someone and that worried him more than the men in front of him. Hector had come out on top against long odds, they would be closing on a trap on him and that most likely meant they had divided their men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he pushed forward with enough force he might be able to get the ship and get it flying out of this trap. It would be a tale of great daring if it succeeded but the odds were certain to be against him but weren\u2019t they always when you were a pirate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have been betrayed men,\u201d Captain Hector quickly motioned for them to be quiet before they started to express their anger or fear. There was no time for those emotions. He didn\u2019t know how tightly they were surrounded or how quickly the trap would be sprung. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about raising the alarm just head for the ship.

If that works, drop a rope to me and if all goes well I will climb aboard and we will be searching for the traitor soon enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men weren\u2019t happy at their prospects but they were happy that the Captain would be taking the brunt of the attack and not them.

Any delay was a good thing for him and his mean, a bolt narrowly missed him and exploded with a cloud of glittering dust which told him they were trying to capture him not kill him and he hoped his crew was getting the same treatment. He darted behind some boxes as he decided his next move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurrender and you won\u2019t face the death penalty!\u201d General Narn screamed over the area. The man\u2019s voice had come from the ship they were trying to take and the pirate knew the trap was complete. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere would be no victory this day if a powerful leader of the king\u2019s armies was here. He didn\u2019t realize the King viewed him as such a threat and was a little flattered by it if more than a little frustrated there would be no victory this day. Death would serve no one this day so he did the only thing he could, live to fight another day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive up men, we don\u2019t have a chance!\u201d Captain Hector yelled to his men as he tossed out his weapons. He kept a few items pocketed and hidden on his person but he doubted that he would keep them for long. If General Narn The Destroyer was here they were not taking any chances and would be looking for any tricks or secrets the pirates would have on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was pleased to see that his men were obeying him and much happier about there being no slaughtering of his crew. They were being cuffed and led away as a group of guards surrounded him but none took an effort to close in on him as it looked like the General wanted to put the manacles on him personally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is a great honor to be captured by such a beautiful woman,\u201d Captain Hector stared into the dark eyes of the small dark-haired general. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPirates are a plague on this land and I would see you dead,\u201d the manacles clicked into place and he felt a chill going down his spine from the war mage\u2019s words. She would kill him if he got the chance so he would have to wait for an easier guard to make his escape. \u201cBut the King has another purpose for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is so nice to feel wanted. May I be so bold as to ask what it is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may but you will not get an answer from me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was escorted away from his men to a carriage that raced away from the port taking quick twists and turns. The pirate tried to keep track of where they were but it was impossible with the hood over his head but he knew it was the better part of town as he felt the carriage go up hills. He didn\u2019t bother trying to work on the manacles because he heard Narn talking to the driver and knew she was with him. She could kill him in any one on one battle that would come up so he focused on the nobles they would be taken to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had to be one that was powerful and influential who wouldn\u2019t want the company of a pirate leader known about. He sniffed the air outside of the carriage as he was dragged from the carriage and got his answer from the rich aroma of Crimson Orchids. An expensive flower to keep in this climate and he knew of only one person who kept the flower. The Duke of White Manor, a powerful man who was a great threat to the King with his money and power. The hood was yanked from his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe package is delivered,\u201d General Narn said as she held out a parchment to the Duke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark glee filled the face of the man as rushed through the reading of the parchment before signing, \u201cBe on your way I and my guest have things to do.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grunt of an agreement was given as the general turned and left slamming the door behind her. There were dark rumors about the pleasures this noble took part in and he hoped the man had other reasons for securing him but he didn\u2019t know what they could be. The man was more than a little mysterious only rarely appearing outside on rare occasions but the strange collection of people and creatures that came and went from the place spoke of dark dealings possibly with cults, or treason no one was really certain but with his heavy control over shipping and transportation he certainly had reason to have a grudge against pirates interrupting his services. </span></div></div>",

The servants looked like they were trained warriors because of how they moved but he couldn\u2019t see any weapons on their bright white uniforms. They gently planted him on a couch and moved to either end of the room to wait for any further orders. It was likely they were some sort of monk who could crush his body the instant he tried to go against their master. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have cost me a lot of money,\u201d the Duke sat behind a desk as if this was some sort of interview. \u201cBeing the generous person I am, I want to know how you intend to repay me for these losses.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a temptation to say something rude to the man but that was certain to not get him out of here, \u201cI have some treasure stocked up but I doubt that it would be enough to tempt you and my ship and crew have been taken so why don\u2019t you make me an offer and I will see if I am willing to make a deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew that you were the right person, intelligent enough to ask about the deal and wise enough to know you might not be willing to pay the price. I am seeking an heir and you are the right kind of stock for that, you have a bit more recklessness but you haven\u2019t had the proper education.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you propose I provide you an heir?\u201d he doubted the man was planning to give his fortune and he couldn\u2019t remember any daughter being spoken of. An unpleasant thought formed in his mind that magic would be involved and he would be the one bearing the children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened a small box revealing a beautiful blue gem on a beautiful gold necklace, \u201cYou shall make lovely children after the necklace has done its work upon you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if I refuse?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, if you refuse, I shall put a much different necklace and bracelets upon you and we play a much different game. Honestly, I am willing to do either, one brings the joy of a child to mold into a child who could one day rule the kingdom more than paying me back for the losses you made for me and the other provides me with a game that shall give me my revenge and could still give me the heir I desire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuke Crest opened a second box that had a slave collar and bracelets for the wrists and the and the ankles. He knew that there would be a great deal of magic in them, Hector could see the servants watching him closely for an attempt to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you could make refusal any better for me because no offense you aren\u2019t exactly my type,\u201d Hector knew he was delaying for a time but his hands and legs were still bound. He worked at the knots but he wasn\u2019t sure it would help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noble rubbed his chin, \u201cThere should be a reward if we are going to play a game. If you choose to turn back into a man after a year I shall give you the money for a ship and crew but if you don\u2019t want to turn back into a man, well, I will have my reward.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pirate captain could feel the ropes on his hands loosening.</span></div></div>",

Swords and axes were attached to the walls at various spots, he might be able to use them, he just hoped they weren\u2019t ornamental.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slave collar would take care of the Duke, it would serve the man right for trying to turn him into a bride. It was worth the chance he decided he wasn\u2019t going to go down like a bitch to some rich entitled noble. The rope fell to the floor, he grabbed the slave collar and leaped towards the Duke who only took a side step with a nasty smile formed on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHector made a quick pivot bringing the collar to the throat of the man attempting to enslave him, just a simple latching and it would all be over for the noble but he couldn\u2019t do it, his hands wouldn\u2019t latch it shut. To his horror he turned the collar towards his own throat, he wanted to stop it but he had no control, a hideous dread filled him as he heard it lock into place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little curse,\u201d the Duke explained. \u201cIn case anyone attempts something, don\u2019t worry my games are not done with you. You have to be the one to chose to have sex with me if you manage to resist for a year I shall free you of the collar.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat will be a sunny day in the Abyss,\u201d his nimble fingers probed the collar searching for any release, a secret latch for if it was put on by accident if there was one he couldn\u2019t find it, he cursed magic. He continued the fruitless effort scratching himself, he brought the hand to his face, his nails were long and the nails were delicate. The changes would be coming fast and he had to do something quickly. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nCrest caught Hector had as he tried to dig out his throat, \u201cAcquiesce.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHector dropped to his knees in an instant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will find you have certain keywords you respond to my darling,\u201d Duke Nicholas gently lifted Hector\u2019s chin looking into the blank blue eyes. \u201cI will only use them when you try to break the rules of the game by trying to leave or attack me. Be aware that they work for anyone so conversations with strangers can become very interesting fast so escaping won\u2019t make you free. Acquiesce makes you go into a submissive state until you are given a command.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the pirate could do was stare forward and await release as he felt his body continue to change. His body sank down into the clothing, as long saffron hair streamed down until she could feel it down her back. She could feel her balls and shaft slipped inside turning her into a woman, her nipples engorged as they rubbed the front of her shirt at the top of two magnificent mounds. The duke slipped the bracelets and anklets, they snapped shut with a spark sealing them by magical means. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStrip your clothes off, Callista,\u201d relief filled her as she obeyed the command it felt good to obey. A shiver of pleasure tingled through her body as she took the clothing from her body allowing Nicholas a full look at her magnificent form. Control finally started to return to her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t fair I should have some way to fight back against you,\u201d Callista argued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man pondered this for a moment, \u201cNo one said this would be fair but I like the idea though there should be consequences for failure. If you attack me and I stop you, I get to use a command word on you, if you should succeed in killing me I will have my people unlock you from your bindings. To increase the fun, I shall put a key to your locks in the cabin of my yacht in the harbor but if you get outside of the grounds you shall be subjected to a command word if I discover you are missing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose you get to decide if you have stopped me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course but I will be generous, now for the next step sweetie. Where do you want to sleep tonight, my personal favorite would be my bedroom but you might not be ready for that.

The artifacts and portraits could have set her up for a lifetime but gave them little attention as she searched out a weapon. Statutes of beautiful women would be hard to swing at several hundred pounds each. Smashing a portrait of his smug face over his head would be satisfying but hardly deadly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA four-poster bed with crimson curtains was at the back of the room awaiting the pair, no secondary bed was available. She moved over to the dressers and quickly starting shuffling through the drawers pretending she hadn\u2019t noticed the sword on the wall. It was too high to reach easily but perhaps something smaller would be available. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust like a woman only interested in clothing,\u201d he stripped revealing a hard muscled body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you use magic to gain that body,\u201d she didn\u2019t like the way her body was feeling towards it. A noble shouldn\u2019t have such a fantastic body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do plenty of training but there is certainly a lot of magic to this body if you care to find out.\u201d He gestured to his bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo thanks, I think I will take a spot on the floor.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head as he walked his nearly naked body over to her gently removing her top off. Some of the controls from earlier must have lingered because she didn\u2019t want to stop him. Her mind pushed back the control managing to give a half-hearted shove to him. The Duke smiled as he took a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about a game? If I win you get in bed, don\u2019t worry no sex unless you ask really nicely\u201d Nicholas laughed. \u201cWhat would you like if you win.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you know what I want,\u201d Callista lifted the magical bracelets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be too steep a price for such a small thing, no, how about you get to pick your clothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I care what I wear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe attire you have available is not exactly modest, if you play the game I shall have brought in items you would not be ashamed to be seen in public wearing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t want to stay on the floor and the idea of wearing something which meant her breasts wouldn\u2019t be threatening to pop out at every step would be nice.

If I don\u2019t return when the time is up you can subject me to one of your command words.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were places in the city that specialized in removing slave collars. Some for-profit but there were others who didn\u2019t believe in the practice. Five hours might be enough time to get it off even for one as fine as Duke Crest had crafted. It would be cutting it close but it was better than making a beeline to the boat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are asking a lot so what do I get if I win the game?\u201d Nicholas looked amused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she asked suspiciously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA week of dreams. I have a special incense that should ignite your lustful mind. You were a real ladies man from what my spies report. Will they be ladies in your dreams or men, I wonder.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough talk. I think we have a deal. Shall we play some cards for it or do you have some other games in mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noble closed the distance between them. His hot breath upon her body was surprisingly pleasant. She took a large step back from him and he made no attempt to chase her. Instead, a smug smile formed on his face. Callista had shown weakness, it didn\u2019t matter if it because of the change or not. She couldn\u2019t let it happen again. This monster took every advantage he could and he was already well ahead in the score. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCards are the standard practice but I don\u2019t know if I trust you,\u201d the Duke responded. \u201cPerhaps a game of hiding and seek? We could duel with swords if you think you are still man enough for a fight. The truth is I don\u2019t care what competition I face you in because I will win. You lack the imagination to win against a superior opponent.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThan how did I elude the royal navy for so long?\u201d She felt rage rising in her. She knew the man was trying to bait her but couldn\u2019t help biting down on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDumb luck I assume. You might mix in incompetence on the part of King Emeril. You certainly failed when I brought my talents to bare against you. Or do you consider this a success?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe poked her soft breast so it swelled in size. Nicholas\u2019s hand jerked back to avoid the slap which followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that is enough foreplay,\u201d the noble laughed. \u201cShall we get to the main course? Make your pick so I can take my victory. You shall have such pleasant dreams.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI pick . . .\u201d</span></div></div>",

This was the Archmage\u2019s tower that few intruders were going to invade but she was certainly not looking forward the long climb down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before the scroll she was wearing started to get soaked with sweat.

The readjustments of the garment were slowing her down but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to travel naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eyed the giant door as she reached the bottom and tried to decide the best way to approach this fresh barrier. There was a tiny gap at the bottom she thought she might be able to squeeze through. After catching her breath she moved to the door and got on the cold stone floor and started crawling under. Her breasts rubbed against the floor and she cursed her large breasts again as she strained to get past the barrier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting outside didn\u2019t provide her much relief as she had lost her clothing to her efforts to exit the tower and it was too mangled to use any more. Naked in the sunlight she took in the world around her and saw how gigantic everything appeared. Melis rushed for the cover of the grass as she saw a person walking in the distance towards the tower.

The man grabbed hold of her in his left hand and lifted her close to his face so he could get a better look at his prize. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had hoped to claim some treasure when I came in here but nothing this fine,\u201d Baron Lucas laughed. \u201cThe untouchable eternal virgin is now but a pet to be held by someone, and I am that lucky person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me go!\u201d Melis yelled. \u201cYou will be punished if you don\u2019t release me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer threats only drew more laughter, \u201cNo one will know what happened to you.

Soft fabric pressed against her private areas as she climbed to the top of the pocket, but she did her best to ignore the jolts of pleasure. She wished her body wasn\u2019t so sensitive to pleasures of the flesh. It didn\u2019t take her long to get to the top and lifted herself over and she thanked all the strength she had done silently, and dropped to the ground grimacing in pain but she managed to contain and cry out of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took some time to collect herself and figure out the damage her leg was broken, several ribs were bruised and her arm was broken. Melis called upon her most powerful healing spell and found herself as good as new.

After she solved that problem she would have to figure out how to get to her saddle bags.

The Baron didn\u2019t have a good reputation and she didn\u2019t want to test if he would harm a child to get her into his clutches again, so as they approached another set of bushes she dropped out of the bag and landed on the soft muddy earth before crawling for cover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mud provided a nice cover for her but she didn\u2019t know where to go next, because she could see the Baron escorting her horse away, and with it her hopes of returning to her normal height. It was hard to trust anyone at the size she was, so she debated if she could do anything on her own, but she could think of little that would restore her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was likely a fools errand to try and get to her home as it was across the city, so she likely need to seek help. There was a small fairy enclave in the royal gardens she could go to that would be willing to make a deal with her, but their deals usually didn\u2019t end up going well for the humans who made them. She could try to make it to the chapel within the castle grounds where she might find someone from her order to help her, but it was a much greater distance from where she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed the mud over her naked body, so she would be harder to spot as she moved through the grass, and give her a little insulation against the cold.

Erin was a powerful witch who had made a pact with an ancient fae for great power shortly after her parents had been killed when she was just a child. It had broken her mind, but her magic was some of the most feared in the realm, not just because of the strength but her willingness to abuse the power on innocent people. Her transgressions were ignored as look as she was an obedient servant to the King. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cleric reached out and touched and felt a barrier at the edge of the dollhouse floor, confirming her suspicions that there would be no easy way out of this place. This place was certainly filled with traps to make her into some plaything for the amusement of the monster watching her. It didn\u2019t look like she had much choice about playing the game unless she could some how trick or talk the mad woman out of these wicked actions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin left the room and came back with a tray covered in treats and goodies with a large steaming pot that she set on a table in front of the tea house. It looked like she wasn\u2019t going to be leaving her show any time soon and Melis was more than a little bothered by the wide eyed stare, the eyes never seemed to blink as she watched Melis. Melis wondered what her next action should be, because none of her options looked good and she had little desire to see what the doll house had in store for her. </span></div></div>",

We can have such fun together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA growl exited Melis\u2019s throat, but she decided to stop arguing and getting to work at getting out of here. The staircase downstairs called her to move towards freedom, and with the saber at the ready. The creak of the stairs bothered her as she hoped that it didn\u2019t signal anything ahead of her that she was coming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were no stairs that could see further down, only two doorways. </span></div></div>",

Three dolls sat around a round table appearing to have tea, but there was no stairs or other doors out of the room, so she backed up to the door she had entered only to find it had vanished. Fear tried to swell in her as she wondered what threat lurked in this room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you want to join our tea party?\u201d One of the beautiful handcrafted dolls lifted her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be exhausted after your journey,\u201d the second one came to life. \u201cPlease, come sit next to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is your name so we can properly welcome you to the tea party?\u201d The third one stood up and took a step towards the young cleric who held the sword in front of her like a talisman of protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a sudden compulsion to tell them her name, it would be rude to not tell them after all. Hadn\u2019t they welcomed her? She took a step back from them bumping into the wall. Melis noticed several incense holders leaking a disorienting odor into the room.

Melis started to feel much better as soon as they were smashed but the dolls in the room looked horrified at what she had done. Their beautiful faces contorted into monstrous shapes filled with fangs as claws extended from formerly pristinely manicured nails. They moved in a coordinated fashion backing the young cleric into a corner. She didn\u2019t think she could take them all at once with her blade, she wished she had her mace and shield with her to give her a fighting chance in melee combat against the dolls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were close enough she called down a pillar of flame on the group dolls and sending them up in smoke. She could feel the heat of the flames as the dolls howled in pain as they vanished into ash. She had been reluctant to use such powerful magic because Melis suspected things would get more difficult as she continued on but if she had waited for it, she might not have made it any further through this nightmare of a doll house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClapping and laughter came from her cruel observer who seemed amused by the events and not bothered at all by the damage to her prized possession. A doorway had appeared on the other side of the room but Melis was most interested in the hole burned through the floor. She carefully peered through the hole and saw an empty bathroom below her. Melis could drop down into the room and probably save herself some time but she strongly suspected there was going to be a trap in any room she entered. It would really help if some better equipment.</span></div></div>",

She scrambled to get out before she was sealed inside to some unknown fate for the rest of eternity. Melis felt the seal start to press against her hip as she worked free of the tub she fought the pain as the heat of something starting to fill and pushed as hard as she could manage to break free and landed on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting herself from the cool tile of the floor after she caught her breath and took a look at what her fate might have been. Hot wax had filled the tub before it drained away and the tub reopened as if nothing dreadful had just occurred. She shuddered at the thought of having to be a wax doll in this cruel spell caster\u2019s collection for untold time. Cautiously she moved towards the door as the floor was very slippery with some unknown substance design to slide a person into the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a firm grip of the door knob that resisted her efforts to open it but she was not to be denied and with a grunt of effort it twisted and the door opened to a hallway. Melis slammed the door shut behind her to end the threat of the trap. To her delight, she saw a large staircase that would lead to the first floor. Music reached her ear, the sound of a full orchestra playing a waltz if her knowledge of music served her right. It appeared there was a ball going on at the bottom of the staircase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeautiful dolls of many styles and garments danced and twirled around the floor in relentless frenzy. There seemed to be no halt to their movements even after she had been watching for many minutes. It didn\u2019t look like she could cross the room without being spotted to the windows on the other side of the ballroom. Those windows might lead outside of the dollhouse and to freedom of this nightmare world. She wondered if her captor would keep her deal or if there would be further games once she had gotten out of this prison. There appeared to be a few more rooms on this floor she hadn\u2019t checked out but she was worried they contained further traps for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyeing the dolls she wondered how many of them had once been human beings like her with long lives ahead of them stuck dancing for a monster for years. Once she was free she would find a way to free her fellow prisoners and make them human again and her mind delighted in thinking of punishments for the Crimson Tiger who had put her here. The longer she waited to take action, the more likely something would attempt to trap her here. She slammed her wooden saber into the wall cutting the wallpaper. </span></div></div>",

The music was very well played and she had to admit it was more than a little tempting to dance. She had been to many balls with her friend the Archmage and enjoyed the chance to dress up and dance. It was a nice distraction from all of the dangers and evil that lurked outside of the protective walls of the capital. The dolls continued going through the motions of a ball as a new song filled the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes swept the room but she couldn\u2019t see the band and she started to realize her desire to join the dance was growing. The music was another trap! She tore at her dress wishing she had a knife and stuffed the fabric in her ear. It helped to reduce the urge but it wasn\u2019t likely to be enough she could still feel the desire to stand up and dance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started a prayer and called upon the power of the gods to assist her and silence the entire room. At once the room went quiet and all of the dancing figures dropped to the floor and she rushed down the stairs to the window grabbing a chair and swinging it hard against the window but the chair shattered before it hit the glass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must exit through the front door little one though I am impressed by your ingenuity,\u201d the Crimson Tiger\u2019s voice said clearly in her mind unhindered by the plugged ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cleric scanned the room for an exit and saw a large set of doors and a door that likely led to the kitchen. She had a powerful spell that might be able to shatter the window despite the protective barrier. It didn\u2019t look like she would have much time to make the decision because the dolls were started to twitch, Melis suspected it was the first sign that the music was starting again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving quickly through the room to see if she could find a weapon or a source of the music but none came into view. The blond woman could hear the music was starting again and her legs were starting to twitch without her permission.

Her eyes scanned the room but the source of the noise couldn\u2019t be found as she began to lose feeling in her legs as they started to pick up motion against her will. Melis had enough power to blast something good. It was tempting to use it against the glass but she felt certain that wouldn\u2019t work because getting out of here was certain to not be easy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dazzling chandelier overhead seemed to be the only option for a musical source. It was the only thing that stood out to her and with a quiet prayer that she was right she let loose all of her collected power at the target and ducked for cover. A thousand shards of crystal exploded across the room flying in all directions tearing at clothing and digging into the dolls on the dance floor. Silence filled the room shortly as the young cleric collected herself. She eyed the blood coming from several wounds across her body and she had never been so thankful to see wounds in her life because it meant she was still human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding was awkward for her as her feet didn\u2019t want to wiggle and move. Lifting her skirt she saw that feet were now a delicate porcelain that was cool to the touch. Tears welled in her eyes as she stalked toward the doorway. She was so tired and wanted to rest but it wouldn\u2019t be safe in here. The ground shook with a pounding causing her to have to grab the wall to stabilize herself. The wall with all of the glass vanished revealing the architect of this evil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are ruining everything!\u201d Erin complained the rage was obvious on her face. \u201cDo you know how much time this will take to fix!?! How much it will cost!?! You are a naughty little dolly!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelis might have laughed at the behavior of a full grown adult acting like a petulant child but all of the laughter had been drained from her. She wiped the tears from her eyes and debated what to do next as she stepped closer the giant magic user. It was doubtful that she could reason with her but she was likely to be bound by her word. If Melis could make it out of here she would be restored so maybe she should continue the game but the temptation to confront her was growing inside of her. She shouldn\u2019t be allowed to continue treating people this way but provoking someone who was insane might put her in danger word or no word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother idea started to form in her head, there was so much magic interlinked in this place there was a chance she could shatter the magic on this place and free every one of the magic of this place but she was about at her limits. Judging by the behavior of Erin this place might be at its limit as well. </span></div></div>",

It was a place of ancient secrets and hidden danger and humans had defiled it by tearing a hole through the middle of it by making a road. Narra was half tempted to let the forest continue to collect the blood debt it was owed, but she had a stronger desire to have the ancestral land restored to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarra was filled with joy as she entered the forest and took off her shoes to run through the woods in her bare feet. The elf was thrilled as the wind blew into face allowing her emerald hair to dance like falling leaves in the air. The stresses of civilization vanished with each foot step into wilderness. Duty would reclaim her as she drew near to her goal, but for now she was free as any animal in the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long to discover the remains of an attack that had been pushed aside for the ease of swift travel. It had been looted by travelers along the road but there weren\u2019t any signs of violence. Narra did find traces of the passage of nymphs and fairies. Nymphs were known to claim unwary travelers, but they rarely claimed an entire carriage. Fairies were always curious about new and strange things, so they could have been checking out the abandoned carriage, but they were also known to play tricks on people. Finally, she noted this wasn\u2019t the carriage of the princess and wondered if she should focus on finding her.  Which should she investigate first?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Their hair was a rainbow of bright colors similar to elves who claimed distant relations to many fae creatures, nymphs included. The beauty of nymphs was like that of much of the fae in they could be truly dangerous. Many men were lead to death by pleasure by these seemingly playful creatures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarra decided to follow the trail of the nymphs because they weren\u2019t known to be skillful at deception, and they weren\u2019t difficult to track. The nymphs were also rarely dangerous to women if a little flirty because honestly they weren\u2019t picky about partners. It wasn\u2019t long before she located the nymphs from the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glade was beautiful a small blue pond and hills covered in an array of flowers blossoming over them. A group of nymphs danced and frolicked as satyrs gave chase, but the number of the nymphs was surprising. Nymphs usually traveled in groups of two to five members and this group was at least two dozen strong. Narra was beginning to have second thoughts about talking with them because she wasn\u2019t sure she could take all of them if combat were to occur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nymphs finally took notice of Narra and with bright smiles on their faces several the nymphs bounced over towards the elf. One of the nymphs drew forth some powder as they drew close and blew it at Narra. Narra\u2019s fear of danger was realized because she recognized it as the rare Daphne dust which could transform someone into a nymph and Narra was quite contented as an elf. Agility was natural for an elf and Narra used all of it to try to avoid the dust.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her mind raced desperately for a possible cure, but any help was a great distance away and she feared she was already too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before the changes began to take place to her body. Narra felt her leather armor tighten as curves began to form on the slim elf. The road was within sight when the pain of her constricting armor became too much for her to continue moving. Her armor was strong but the magical transformation would not be denied and with a scream of pain her breasts broke the straps and her other curves soon rendered her armor into a pile of scraps. Her breasts heaved with sweat as they continued to grow to obscene proportions. It wasn\u2019t long for the changes to finish leaving a buxom nymph where once a slender elf had been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarra caressed her enlarged breasts in awe and pleasure as sexual urges began to dominate her mind. She wanted to seek help to transform herself back to an elf, but she wasn't sure how long she could control herself because if hormones were this bad alone how bad would her desires be around men? The other option was to go back to the nymphs where it would be safer because a lone nymph was often taken as a sexual slave by many of the sentient races. It was possible a cure could be found from the nymphs, but maybe that was only the fear of being enslaved talking. Her time to make a choice was at hand as she heard the sound of wagon wheels heading her way. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The carriage ahead of her held a man inside of breeding age her nose could smell him as he drew closer but the driver was of a female persuasion and of little interest to the young nymph other than to entice the male into breeding. Perhaps she could send her back to become another nymph so she would be out of the way for proper collection of the sperm from the man.  The alien thoughts scared her as she fought them down. The former elf doubted if she would be able to get help before she gave up to the urges of the nymph. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carriage was starting to pass her by as she could see the driver the driver giving her a dirty look but the passenger called her to stop and she was forced to comply.

She had been a ranger once a master of the forest once the thought entered her head as she struggled against the urges within her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilhouettes of women dancing naked could be seen along the hall as men browsed to make their selections to spend an evening with. Her feet started to carry her towards them and the men turned at the powerful pheromones produced by the nymph. It appeared they had made their choice and Narra smiled at the victory and the bliss she was about to experience. She was still a powerful hunter, she just hunted sex. She might no longer be a master of the forest but she was certainly the master of cocks, her small hand reached out and gently stroked one of the members of her suitors causing it to explode. Methodically she wiped up the precious fluid and swallowed all of it to the delight of all of the onlookers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to get you to the cleaning room,\u201d the servant started to pull her away from the men drawing a frown to Narra\u2019s face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Narra was to be a nymph for the rest of her life she was going to be the best nymph she could be and she wasn\u2019t going to prevent her from getting the sex she desired.

The wild was the friend of nymphs and never harm her, she could hear them asking for her to stay and bless them with her fertility.

Her senses had always been keen but the forest was like a whole new world to her since becoming a nymph. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hearing had diminished as well as her sight from what she was used to but she could feel the forest. The animals were not just creatures, she could see if they were hungry, diseased, or on the hunt, their stories were clear to her. It was becoming clear to her why nymphs always seemed so stupid, they were concerned with all of the stories around them. These creatures were family to them and they thought of them, she could feel herself wanting to stay in the woods helping them, they would protect her from the noble if she wanted that, or she could see if she could turn the tables on the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed to stop thinking about herself as an elf or a ranger, right now she was neither of those things, she was a nymph. Being a nymph meant that she had new powers and abilities, perhaps it was time for her to use those powers.

Elves could leave for over a couple thousand years so losing twenty years wasn\u2019t a disaster but she was dealing with a human in danger it could be very dangerous. She needed to calm the party quickly and a dirge would do well at that but it was dangerous because of killing the mood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarra had few worries about being killed because the fairies didn\u2019t kill those they could punish other ways. There was a very real worry in her heart that she would be made into a slave or something worse. They were known to turn people into animals or plants and as she looked around she wondered how much of the plant and animal life around her had once been sentient life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let the worries drain from her and into music as she started to sing the tale of Princess Maven and Sir Garith. The Princess had been cursed by a demon to eternal slumber and the noble knight who loved her but because of duty, he could never confess his love to the one he served. The knight had gone to hell to free her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been her favorite song as a child, the journey was an amazing tale of heroism and loss as knight fought his way through the layers of hell helping lost souls and hearing the tragic tales of those lost to the dark realm. Eventually, the knight found the demon he was looking for and fought him in a fearsome battle until he won the freedom of the one he had love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thousand years had passed since the man had started his journey. The kingdom and the people that he had once loved and cared about were long gone but he found the Princess where he had left her. His once shining armor was blacked by the fires of hell, his eyes were fiery red orbs from the horrors they had seen and his flesh was withered under the strain no human should have to endure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Garith had worked up the courage to confess his love to her but when she woke all she saw was a monster and screamed in horror. Princess Maven did not see the scars as the markings of his love and caring for her so she rejected him. The noble knight left with his heart broken, and dirge came to an end. It faded out with the denial of love for the knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a child, she had wondered about many things about the tale. What had happened to the Princess and more importantly to the good Sir Garith? The song had been left open-ended and she had wondered about adding an ending to it, something less sad, something with a glimmer of hope but it seemed like a disservice to the song. It was rumored to have been a true story and without knowing the truth of what happened next she would leave it as it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence had fallen over the crowd as all around her had stopped their merriment and were focused her. Tears started to fall from cheeks as the crowd started to sob and cry over the song. She could see that she had won them over. The fae loved emotion and passion even sad ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened next?\u201d the leader of the village asked as the rest of them stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo one knows,\u201d Narra said. \u201cThe legends vary, some say the Princess discovered the truth and is on a thousand year journey to be with him and others say that Sir Garith was cursed by the demon with its dying breath to forever walk the world alone, always denied the love that he had fought so hard for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA sad song to be sure but one worth the price of assisting you. You ask for our help in saving a Princess and give us a tale of an ungrateful Princess who was saved. I do hope that your tale doesn\u2019t turn out as sad as this one. Giving you information seems a small thing so let us do more.\u201d</span></div></div>",

She was familiar with the appearance of the princess by the speeches she had attended. The woman had lovely chestnut hair braided down to her rear. She had just come to full womanhood and had bright green eyes that had started to draw suitors to her. The young lady had vanished on a trip to meet with a potential foreign suitor, but the man had never shown up and she had disappeared on her way back. For some reason, the King had refused to tell her who the suitor was but if she needed to she would find out who the person had been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dreamed of the success and the rewards it would bring to her people. Narra was so close and every coin she could get a hold of went to the goal. She couldn\u2019t fail when she was this close. Narra knew where the Princess had last stayed so she would work back from there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA storm cloud was rumbling towards the inn as she arrived at the Dragon\u2019s Nest. The building looked ominous in the flashing lightning. Narra wondered if she should stay at the inn or continue with her habit of living in the woods to save money. She would have a better chance of learning more if she stayed in the inn but it would also announce her presence to anyone remaining in the area involved with the kidnapping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf watched as the guards circled the large structure looking for any trouble makers who might be lurking and it made her wonder how the Penelope had been captured with body guards around her. Perhaps they had been drugged at the inn, so the people had passed out on their journey home. </span></div></div>",

An organization that could take down a Princess might be very large and very powerful so she had to be careful. She was very familiar with poisons and herbs, so if there were any hidden in the kitchen she should be able to find them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the time waiting for darkness to set up camp and have a few edible plants so she wouldn\u2019t get hungry. There would be no campfire this close to the inn in case the guards came to investigate. As soon as she felt able to hide in the shadows she slipped away from her camp and headed towards the inn. The moon was only half full but the light was more than sufficient for her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards didn\u2019t break up their routines, so it was easy to time their passage and slip through unnoticed under the cover of darkness. She watched closely the inner courtyard which had many more lanterns to light it and few places for cover. Thankfully, the guards appeared to be more interested in talking than patrolling.Narra found that luck favored her when she felt right in her actions. Her master had often laughed at the thought because he believed only doing your job and he believed that if things were easy it was because someone wasn\u2019t doing their job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe peered through the window of the kitchen and saw they were finishing up the cleaning of the kitchen before they left for the night. The elf was glad she had taken training in the art of lock pick and her nimble fingers opened the simple lock. Odors of many spices and foods struck her nose but she needed to find out if there was something more here than delicious food being cooked up. </span></div></div>",

Narra probed the wall with her dagger and discovered a switched which pressed before stepping back and drawing her short sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight click could be heard as the secret door slowly swung open revealing a passage leading down into the unknown. Lanterns lit the way down but she was cautious about heading down because she hated closed in places. Her desires told her to back out and watch for a few days so she could figure out the comings and goings of the people down this tunnel. She would know more about who was involved and how many but going down these stairs would always be a risk. The longer she waited the more chance she had to be discovered. Going now was her best chance to get in and out without being spotted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to take a little more risk and quietly went down the stairs closing the secret door behind her. Narra listened closely for the sounds of any people but she didn\u2019t hear anything so she continued to the bottom of the stairs. The sounds of chains reached her keen ears and she wondered if would be able to free some prisoners but she would have to be extra cautious because where there were prisoners there were usually guards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the sound she had heard, she discovered a room with a small cell at the back a room with a guard facing the cage laughing as the prisoner tried to grab their food that was just out of the person\u2019s reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll you have to do is take off your clothing and the food is yours,\u201d the guard laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever,\u201d came the response. \u201cYour bosses won\u2019t let you starve me to death!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue but you going a few days without food won\u2019t bother them.

The narrow entry point would allow her to mitigate the superior numbers of the enemy, especially as they stumbled over the dead bodies she was creating. Eventually, some of them would try to come around the other way and flank them or even come around through the inn if there was another entry point to it and she would be captured but hopefully the princess would be far from here when that happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cultist started to grow more cautious as their numbers dwindled before the deadly twin blades of the ranger. They started to pull bodies out of the way as they fell before someone took the place of the corpse. She wished they would take longer in doing it so she would have a chance to rest before fighting another opponent but they kept coming like the endless waves of the Great Selac Sea. The sound of people coming from the side hallway turned the elf\u2019s thoughts to the more than likely chance that she would be captured or killed soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dwarf might be happy at setting his death price so high and continue fighting to the end but elves placed a far greater value on life. She still had a chance at escape and she hoped that she could make it. </span></div></div>",

She was very good at hiding and her magical cloak would help a great deal so she headed down the enemies coming from the side hallway, easily dodging them as they were shocked by her approach and went into the unknown beyond the doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slammed her door shut behind her and shut the lock before taking in the new environment. It looked like there was a limit to the number of cultists after all because she was alone at the top of a set of stairs. The elf moved quickly knowing that it wouldn\u2019t take them long to find the key or come around the other way so she searched for a place to hide as she worked her way deeper into the complex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sensitive ears could hear people racing through the room with the large crystal so she picked up her pace to block their entrance to where she was located. Two guards blocked her objective so she threw a dagger into the throat of one and dodged past the guard of the second burying her sword into the man\u2019s chest releasing her grip as she jumped for the doorway shutting it with force on the first of many cultists trying to get through. Narra quickly locked the door but she decided to add an extra layer of security as she tied the doors shut with some rope she had and collect her sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deeper she got into this temple the more uncomfortable she felt. As she walked deeper into the temple the lower into the ground she seemed to go. The air grew colder as she went farther away from the light of the sun and she didn\u2019t know if it was being underground or something more that was bothering her. She went down another set of stairs and knew she had never been this deep in the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had been chances over the years to enter the grand underground world of the dwarfs but she was a little scared of the Underdark because of the stories her Grandmother used to tell her about the creatures that lurked in the sunless world. Drow that would snatch you from your home to serve as a slave for the rest of your days, fearsome monsters that would control your minds and the terrible mind flayers with their twisted and appetites for brains. It was a world of endless suffering and dangers. She had fought some of the monsters her Grandmother spoke about especially the drow but some of the fear still lingered in her heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if bringing her fear to life she saw a collapsed wall that had a hole showing a big tunnel into the Underdark that might lead to the surface. The hallway bent around to parts unknown and a nearby doorway revealed a gigantic library that would make a superior place to hide so she needed to decided what path to take. </span></div></div>",

Narra didn\u2019t like the fact that the earth was soft because it meant she would leave a trail. As she moved she eyed the fading light of the temple wondering if she should remain close by because she was certain of how to get back to the surface world. Several of her enemies appeared at the hole and looked down the tunnel but thankfully their human eyes were far inferior to her elven ones but she needed to get out of here in case they decided to look further. She took several turns before she felt comfortable to sit and relax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer muscles cried out for rest and she was happy to give them what they asked for as she curled up into a small alcove pulling her cloak over her allowing her to fade into the rock. She had done the best she could to cover her trail with light careful steps but an expert tracker would be likely to find her and an inexperienced one might get lucky. Narra decided to not worry about what she couldn\u2019t control and went into what the elves did instead of sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still aware of the world around her but visions of her life passed before her eyes so she might review them and learn from them. For the next several hours she would be subjected to the random thoughts her mind thought she needed to see. It helped that the images and thoughts were distant, almost like viewing a painting or reading a story, because memories could often be disturbing things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemories of the tales told to her by her Grandma came back to her, likely to help her survive. Not all of it was frightening to her, hearing the voice of her beloved relative was wonderful to her ears. Finding food in this darkness wasn\u2019t easy so she would have to keep her senses keen for the edible plants and animals down here. She had rations for three days left so she hoped she would be out of here long before they ran out but she couldn\u2019t depend on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was movement close to her and she almost broke from her rest to go check it out but she didn\u2019t even know if what it was would notice her much less bother her. If she didn\u2019t rest properly soon her strength would soon fail her in the combats she was likely to face but the noise made her nervous. Visions of the creeping dark elves and slithering things that she had been told about filled her head. Even as visions, they still caused her heart to race a little but she had faced many monsters her Grandma had told her about and come out on top. The fear faded from her but the sound grew closer to her, allowing the worry to remain. </span></div></div>",

Eventually, the sound of footsteps faded into the distance and she was able to finish her rest. Her muscles still had some aches to them from all of the recent activity but she felt much better and ready to face what the Underdark had to offer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarra found the tracks of what had made the noise and saw they were boot prints of a single traveler. The person\u2019s footsteps were light like those of an elf or a drow. She doubted one of her own people was down here so she would have to be careful about her choices. There was no way to tell if the dark elf was coming or going from their home so she decided to take another tunnel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blades were ready for combat as she quietly moved down the tunnel with only glowing mushrooms to light her way. If she didn\u2019t feel she was surrounded by enemies she might have even thought it was beautiful but the dull light just coated the world in an eerie glow. She came to a large open area with crystals shining the lights of the mushrooms turning the room nearly as bright as day. Three new tunnels lay in front of her and she took some time to examine them before making her choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, none of them was labeled with a surface world and a directional arrow so she would have to take a guess. The right tunnel looked like it had been dug out by something with powerful claws, if she could somehow guide it she could use it to make her way to the surface. In the middle the tunnel reeked of fungi and mold she had heard that sentient fungi lived in the Underdark, this tunnel might lead to them. On the left was a tunnel with a paved walkway which more than a little ominous in a place that was known for being wild and uncontrolled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a couple of societies that she could make deals with down here but not many. She wasn\u2019t sure it was worth the risk to check it out because there were many more societies that would make a permanent slave of her. She eyed the tunnel on the left closely but she didn\u2019t see any markers to give a hint where the tunnel led. </span></div></div>",

There were serious dangers down the other two tunnels so she went down the right tunnel because she would at least not be heavily outnumbered. Narra could see this was only one creature and she already suspected who had crafted this tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloser inspection of the tunnel revealed what she had thought were claw marks were signs of the Red Worm of Tarna. There were only a few of them left on the world because they were being hunted to extinction by the people of the world. They were crafted by the titans in the war against the gods to destroy the cities of the servants of the gods. The dwarves had an entire guild dedicated to finding and slaying the creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt scared her to be moving down the trail of something that could level a city but they were simple animals that could be manipulated by those who understood animals since the loss of their masters and she didn\u2019t know when this tunnel had been made. Narra knew this tunnel was fresher than she would like because hers were the only footsteps in the tunnel but it could have been days or months ago that the creature had crafted this, virtually no one was in a rush to chase the creatures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarra\u2019s eyes widen as the tunnel exited into a large cavern where she could see a devastated city lay before her. As she looked over the rubble she realized it was a drow city and flashes of light revealed the battle was still going on. There was a temptation to help or at least take a closer look at the city but it would be dangerous. As she watched another building started tumbling to the ground to the ground, its crash echoing loudly through the cavern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drow were especially vulnerable because the creature was weak against those who studied nature which the drow were loath to do unless it involved poison. The magic of either a divine or an arcane source was practically useless and they were immune to poison that the drow often depended upon. The Guild of the Wurm Hunters knew the secrets of getting past the hide but most didn\u2019t know how to damage the creatures. Hundreds or thousands were likely to die if she didn\u2019t get involved and it wasn\u2019t the drow that she was worried about. It might be a long time before she contacted the dwarves and the worm was likely to strike another city and it might not be the dark elves next time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she helped the dark elves she had heavy doubts of the gratitude she would get from them but it was hard to not think of all the lives that would be lost if she didn\u2019t do anything. Maybe if she got out of the Underdark fast enough she could get the Guild hunting the monster hunted down before it destroyed another city. </span></div></div>",

Tarna was a more foul being than even the dark gods of the drow because she sought the complete unmaking of the world and all within it. Some people talked about it being so she could craft a new version of the world but Narra didn\u2019t care for the reason the ancient being wanted to unmake the world. She would put a stop to Tarna and her servants every chance she got and pray the drow would let her go from her unmolested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been taught how to attack the creatures years ago by a hunter because she knew herbs well. The elf took cover as she prepared to take the giant monster down or at least get it to flee from the area. The leaves need to be precisely portioned or it would be virtually useless against the creatures, normally these herbs were healing and rejuvenating which was likely why the drow didn\u2019t know of them but against these worms, they were the deadliest of poisons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarra waited for the chance to strike with deadly accuracy. The hide was hard and the organs in the animal were placed at odd spots different from a normal worm so she watched for when the creature stretched out thinning the hide and let loose before it had finished. The shriek let loose as it struck home told her aim was true. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned to face the only threat to it, Narra and she continued to pelt the monster with shots every time she got an opportunity. The drow had pulled back and taken notice the creature had changed targets, but they had yet to fire upon their surface cousin. The ground shook beneath her as the great maw of the creature approached her hungry to devour the one who pained it. She could see the creature was slowing but it was still faster than the nimble ranger as she tried to escaped death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunters had warned her death was likely when facing it alone because no footstep was soft enough that it wouldn\u2019t be noticed by the creature and there was no barrier that would stop it as it could shatter even the hardest stone in time. She was determined to give a good account of herself if this was to be her last day on this earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer quiver was quickly running out of arrows doused with the poison as it drew within striking distance. There was some satisfaction in the fact she felt certain it would not be long for this world. Blood and other precious fluids had started to burst from the body of the Red Worm but she was still likely to be crushed by the death throes as she achieved victory. It started to lift high into the air but it was suddenly caught. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowerful spider webs from driders and drows pulled it safely away from her. The drow eyed her cautiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d a woman of noble bearing stepped forward. \u201cCome with us so we can show you our gratitude.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gratitude of the dark elves was something to be very wary of. There could be truth to the words but they could also be seeking for more from her and any reward she was likely to get was almost certain to come with a heavy price attached to it or they could just be planning to betray her to either enslave or kill her as some sort of sick sport. There was also a danger in not accepting the gratitude because it could be seen as an insult. </span></div></div>",

The cultists backed off for a moment but she was still running out of time is she couldn\u2019t catch the rest of the place on fire but the floor of the inn was made of wood instead of the stone walls done here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf reached out to the nature spirits in a way that she rarely did and call forth fire. It was a minor spell to allow the producing of a fire usually to form a campfire but she asked for more this time as the fire spirit started to glow with life in her hands. She released it on the ceiling and called for it to burn as much as it could. The cultists were starting to consider jumping past the flames but the fire was taking hold in front of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat poured down her body from the heat from the fire was growing but she had to be the cultists wouldn\u2019t get past. She pulled the last two arrows from her quiver and hit a couple as they tried to make their way through. Narra hated being out of arrows but at least she still had her blades. The elf backed slowly to the exit and went out the secret door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCries of panic were starting to be raised in the inn as people discovered the growing fire. The chaos might allow her to get away unnoticed which she wanted because she didn\u2019t know who she could trust. The others were nowhere that she could see and she hoped they had managed to escape because she was sure to be seen as an outsider if someone located her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt good to get outside again to the ranger as she slipped under the cover of some bushes to wait for the chance to go over the wall again. Guards were turning their attention to the inn as cries for help were going out and lights went on from guests awakening to the chaos. Her careful gaze searched for the princess but she saw no sign of her and she worried she was captured again. She hated the wait as men and women rushed past her but a chance would come in time but was it better to wait and listen or try to find the trail of the Princess? There was no way to be certain and she would just have to gamble that she was making the right choices.</span></div></div>",

Elliott decided to probe, \u201cHas your son been kidnapped by some sinister force that I should be prepared to face?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe King cautiously said, \u201cI only have limited knowledge of his whereabouts.  Of course, I encourage you take all due caution.  I would offer you aide but I do not wish to insult your capability.

Do your best and our peace will be strengthened.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Elliott turned and made his way out of the great hall.  He shifted into a swarm of bats taking flight to home.

The air of confidence as if he ruled the hall he stood in.  He said, \"I am Lucian formerly of the kingdom of Dar and I hope to be again with your aide.  I come to you under flag of truce that I might parley with you.  My father's tyrannical rule imperils my beloved homeland as we speak.  If any try to question his mistakes they are cast out or killed sometimes worse fates await them.  Even now he sends agents after me to eliminate me as a threat to his rule.  With your years of experience and power we should have no trouble toppling my father\u2019s government.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliott thought about the prospect for a minute.  King Emeril could only be relied on to seek his own best interests.  To openly go against him unwise with his great resources but a covert effort might be worthwhile.  An agent that could not be traced to him.  Still Lucian probably was as trustworthy as his father.  A fair-weather ally most likely. What would he gain moving against either?   The most fun would be to play along.   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even after all the centuries, humans could still surprise him on occasion especially when he let his arrogance at his own power put himself in danger. He had assumed that the King had some honor and would keep his word, he should have realized how little his fellow respected honor. Honor was like an inside joke for nobles that they let the little people believe were true. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe odds were against him for getting out of here but they were planning to capture him, most likely for his blood. Blood from an ancient vampire could keep a person young and strong forever as long as you could keep milking the source so he needed to plan for his escape after he was captured. Taking out a few key people would make things much easier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Emeril was a very tempting target but that was what told him not to target him. He was likely to have many protections so he shadow traveled behind the head priest of the land. The priest didn\u2019t realize what had happened until he saw his head tumbling to the ground as the vampire\u2019s blade severed the head. Elliot hated the Church of Dar and all of the members of it because they were pawns of the King. As they were distracted the vampire cut his way through them as he planned his next move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could see several of the Crimson Tigers but he couldn\u2019t be sure who would be used to guard him and he didn\u2019t see the Archmage but he did see the apprentice of the grand mage who looked terrified by the events occurring around him.

Several of his deadly launched at the man who seemed stunned he had been hit and collapsed before he realized he had actually been killed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstra the Huntress\u2019s whip wrapped around the neck of the vampire and started to drain him of escape. Elliot decided on a last act of defiance before he was taken to prison by this army of warriors. His gaze took hold of the Crimson Tiger\u2019s mind and made a command to it as the clerics lashed bindings upon him. Astra pulled a dagger from its sheath and slammed it home into her cadet\u2019s throat. Her niece stared, stunned by her Aunt slaying her, never seeing the control return to her beloved relative. The cries of pain from Astra drowned out the laughter of Elliot at the success of his paying back his old friend for this betrayal. She had promised him he would be free to leave after this meeting and she had believed her. He wondered if she thought the reward for the betrayal of someone who trusted her was worth killing her sister\u2019s child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a dangerous move to anger her so much as he would soon be at her mercy as the spells and prayers brought him low but it had been worth it for the vampire. He had trusted few over the years because of past wrongs were done to him but Astra and he had been close from years of fighting side by side. He looked on the sobbing woman with blazing eyes and she hoped she knew that he wasn\u2019t done with her.

It was painful calling out, the priests had done fine work in blocking him from contacting his more intelligent allies but the animals were easy, many had been feeding on his body for years and almost felt like a part of him. The people who were binding him were busy worrying about his terrifying strength and his fearsome monster allies but no one worried about the tiny creatures, the rats, and bats that could carry messages and other things to assist their dark master. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn\u2019t see the bat swarm that lurked outside but they were already seeking out the aid of his allies and even with his sensitive hearing he couldn\u2019t hear the rats working their way to him. Even in this windowless room, they would manage to get to him. Elliot would destroy this Kingdom and take it for his own not because he wanted command of these lands but he wanted the king to see the consequences of his actions. The man would see his children lost or slain and Elliot ruling over his ancestral land before he took the man\u2019s life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContemplating the conquering of these lands helped to pass the time as he waited. It was not long before he saw a small group of rats enter his cage. These were his leaders of his swarms, they had been serving him for decades and were more intelligent than many humans that he knew. Three swarms to start his work so he would be ready or even free by the time his armies arrived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlague,\u201d he petted a black rat. \u201cYou will help free me. Gather those who serve you and start chewing a hole in these walls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt scurried off to obey the command, such instant obedience and complete loyalty pleased him. Dawn was closing in on him and it would be an unpleasant slumber without the earth of his grave. They had removed the hidden pouch of the dirt he kept with him in case of emergency as well as most of his clothing. They had left him nearly naked in only a rag as underwear but they would pay especially the guard who had laughed at his plight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsabelle,\u201d a tiny white rat stepped forward. \u201cSend part of your number to get my hidden stash of dirt where I hid it before I entered the castle and bring it to me and find out where the keys to my chains and the door are. See if it is possible to get them just before nightfall for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLothar,\u201d a rat as gray as the stone of the floor lifted its head. \u201cYou are to start causing chaos in the castle, especially for the priests and clerics. Destroy their scrolls, taint their precious holy water, and hide their holy symbols. Do as much as you can in secret.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Many people had the misconception that they were gentle and weak and though they didn\u2019t seek violence they could be violent and destructive as a hurricane. Those who harmed nature\u2019s balance often found her fury was more of a match for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Emeril had asked for the assistance from the Circle to deal with a group of trolls that had started to attack the lumber town of Evening Falls. Many druids would have laughed at the request but the town had always consulted with druids about responsible logging and replanting to allow them to flourish without losing the resource that had made their town prosperous. It was the duty of the druids to encourage others to become a partner with nature instead of an enemy of nature and helping Evening Falls would help a great deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Grand Druid had requested Ela to assist the town because of her mastery of stealth strikes. Ela was invisible in the woods and her usage of druid magic for combat was deadly. It was unknown how many trolls or other threats there were, so having someone who could sneak in and take out whatever threat might exist was wonderful for the success of the mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEla was thrilled at the chance for violence which was generally discouraged. Honestly, Ela had a blood thirst which many considered unhealthy, but her animal half was always looking for an opportunity to exercise its predatory instincts. The cat people were known for being great hunters and Ela was better than anyone and was thrilled at the chance to prove it.</span></div></div>",

She felt awkward because of the staring and whispered comments which made her angry but in the forest she could commune with wildlife and nature. It helped to center her and make her calm while civilization always seemed to enrage her. The elders encouraged her to balance her duel nature but it was hard to do when there was little she wanted from her human half. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drew on a little of her powers to help silence her movement through the tree tops with hardly enough of a pause to bend the branches much less break any of them. Many of her fellow druids marveled at the movement but it came so naturally to her it was hard to be proud of the ability, but she did enjoy the feeling of the breeze through her dark fur as she raced towards a target. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take her long to spot a troll lumbering through the forest towards the town bent on attacking. The creatures were forces of destruction bent on killing things and eating them raw. They often latched onto more intelligent monsters because they didn\u2019t have the knowledge to make tools or clothing. A single troll would be an easy kill but it might lead her to others or it could have been sent on a mission by an orc. It was wearing a simple loin cloth, which suggested it might be working for someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tail twitched with anticipation as Ela decided what to do next. Her body wanted the thrill of the kill but she needed to quell the urge if she was ever to become a master druid. All things, even trolls, had a part in the circle of life, but if that was true, where was her spot in the order of things. Surely there was room for a predatory cat person. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It had been moving at a fast clip indicating it might be running from something, and whatever it was would be the real danger. Besides having it out of the sight meant she was less likely to be tempted to kill the creature. Anger filled her as she saw the destructive path the creature took through the woods. She might need to get back to the creature and teach it that it wasn\u2019t nice to mess with Mother Nature, but as she entered deeper into the woods she saw something that horrified her more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething had torched a large portion of the forest leaving a wasteland behind. Ela wondered if she would need help with this because this looked far worse than a group of trolls damaging the land. She reached out with her powers to find out what was behind this crime. The animals shared there memories with her of the fear as the fire spread across the woods. She strained to see further back into their minds but it was difficult to see what had happened as their focus was on survival and not on the cause of the problem. It looked like she would need to go deeper into this wasteland to find the cause for this mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eyed the ground and discovered the footsteps of troops in large numbers moving through the area. Her mind suspected an invasion force of humans from the look of the boot\u2019s size and design. What were they up to and who were they attacking? These were not particularly rich lands and of no real strategic value as most kingdoms were far from this place. A group of monsters might gather in some force but not in these numbers. This was the forming of an army and an army didn\u2019t form unless someone was planning to use them, usually for something very bad. She summoned a raven to take a message of warning back to her circle that something was wrong here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer next course of action needed to be decided upon carefully because there was danger here. She needed to get more information on what had occurred here. The suspicion was that a dragon was involved but there were darker things that frequently used fire. Ela shuddered at the thought of having to deal with the dark ones. If they were involved it would mean cultists who might be forming an army in secret up here, and that was a greater danger than she wanted to deal with alone. Her circle was powerful but she wasn\u2019t sure they could defeat an army with dark ones. To gather information she could return to the lumber camp or follow the tracks, but another idea was to get assistance with this quest. It might be the best idea considering the number of enemies she might be facing.</span></div></div>",

The sounds and smells of the forest being mutilated reached her ears and nose, she knew she had found them but took a moment to collect herself. Not everyone had the skills or abilities to survive off of what the forest provided them like she could, most humans needed shelter and fires to keep away the cold and cook their food. She wished they would keep their numbers in check so they didn\u2019t have to keep destroying forests to craft farmland but the civilized people kept away the orcs, trolls, and giants who did far worse to the land than altering it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled when she saw they were planting saplings to replace the trees they had taken like the druids had asked them to when the group had come looking for a place to build a lumber camp. The working continued even as she appeared in front of the camp. A few took casual glances at her but they quickly turned back to the work at hand. A large human man stepped from the largest building and made a direct path for her. Two blades were strapped to his sides and he carried himself like someone who wasn\u2019t a stranger to combat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing here druid!?!\u201d the man yelled. \u201cWe paid your people for this land but there was nothing in our contract that said you get to hound us. Your people have been delaying my work for too long. I have men missing and workers are talking about leaving because of the actions of your people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer quarterstaff whipped out to the back of the man\u2019s knees dropping him to the ground before she flipped it around and placed it firmly on his throat,\u201d My people have done nothing to you and you would be wise not use that tone with me! I am no gentle soul who will take such abuse for things I didn\u2019t do, especially when I have come to assist you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man smacked her staff aside and rolled back drawing both blades to a ready position. He didn\u2019t like being humiliated in front of his men but she didn\u2019t care. The voice of her elder reminded her that she should take a more diplomatic approach but her primal instincts called for blood over the insult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have found the tracks of an army of men,\u201d Ela took a step back trying to de-escalate the situation but secretly hoping he would try something she could show him were stupid. \u201cStrange fires have occurred not far from here, fire that wasn\u2019t natural, tell me what you know and I will be on my way to solve the problem. I only ask that you warn the others in the area because I am a stranger to this place.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Kagar,\u201d the man put away his blades. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t you, I would very much like to know who was involved and give them some payback for their actions. Do you have any suspects . .?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEla, none that I would like to face in combat alone. A red dragon is a possibility but it is more likely one of the dark ones.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDark ones, what are they?\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The air had been disturbed by something, not of this world, it could have been something summoned but she was suspected a portal had been opened for something to pass through, the start of an army.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe explained to the man that they would soon start to build a portal that would allow their armies to invade. They had tried before and been stopped on every occasion, only eternal vigilance would prevent something worse from happening. She would find the portal and prevent it from being built and slay all of them trying to build it, a simple plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need you to go warn your people and get word to my order of my worries,\u201d she explained. \u201cIf you don\u2019t hear from me in three days evacuate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am not unfamiliar with a blade,\u201d Kagar lifted his ax. \u201cYou are likely to need some help out there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEla shook her head, \u201cI need you to warn the people and get them ready if I fail.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded and moved back to the lumber camp with the rest of the people to prepare and get word back to the druid circle. She had lied to him, she could have sent word back by an animal but these people were untested and she would be facing trained warriors. Strength and being able to swing an ax against an inanimate tree would only take you so far in a real battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hoped she was wrong about what she was dealing with, they hadn\u2019t been seen for over three hundred years but they had gone for long periods of time without showing up. The druid tried to call on her knowledge about them but there wasn\u2019t much. They had explosive power that often robbed the world of much of the evidence of them. She wondered what had caused them to use their powers to destroy the forest, they often tried to hide their presence to build their gates which took a long time to build so the question was how long had they been here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTraveling between planes left a stain for at least a month, the gods and the natural world didn\u2019t care for people messing with the travel between worlds and marked them as outsiders. She could hear movement ahead of her and she went to pure stealth mode cover her movement in silence and blurred her image with another spell allowing her to get within striking range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wall had been erected to protect a clearing and from the trees, she could see a patrol wandering the grounds. They wore armor the like of which she had never seen before covered in symbols from alchemy and as she looked closer she realized something disturbing about the two guards, they weren\u2019t living beings. </span></div></div>",

There was a group of druids in the heart of the nearby forest, the only problem was they were very reclusive. She didn\u2019t know if they would accept her, she hoped they would since she was a fellow lover of the natural world but they had been known to slay outsiders. Perhaps she could slay a couple of enemies to bring them as proof of her attentions. She moved quickly through the forest trailing a small band of scouts she had seen the tracks of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer nose caught the stench of orcs and her face wrinkled in distaste. She hated the foul creatures but they would serve nicely as a gift to druids of the Stone Garden Circle. The orcs threw bits of bone and half eaten pieces of flesh about them as they ate their meal. She could see the trees they had cut and torn down for their fire, most of which they likely wouldn\u2019t use. Ela called on her power and transformed into a powerful dire tiger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHundreds of pounds of muscles and power were added to her small frame as her fur thickened. Bloodlust called as her jaws turned into instruments of bone crushing death. Flesh rending claws extended as she slowly stalked forward towards the four orcs gathered around the flames. She wanted to toy with them and give them the slow painful death they deserved but time was important and she would have plenty of other targets for her rage later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first orc would probably regret having taken his helmet off if he had known a dire tiger\u2019s jaws were going to slam shut on his skull. Ela lifted her paw and slapped it across the back of another easily severing the spine of the orc leaving him helpless on the ground. She leaped towards a third orc as they tried to recover from the surprise attack but the weight of the giant creature sent the powerful orc to the ground knocking the breath from his lungs. Her teeth plunged in the soft flesh of the throat spraying the ground with blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her attention to the final orc who had his blade ready but the fear was clear in his eyes. Blood dripped from her lips as she stalked towards the orc unafraid of the weapon. The movements of her enemy were clumsy and sloppy while she was fast and graceful. A slight groan of pain came from the orc on the ground as it tried to crawl towards the fire, probably thinking it might provide some protection. She could smell death overtaking the crawling form so she ignored it as the other orc took a wide swing.Orcs were three to four hundred pounds of muscle but that was but a fraction of the muscle and power of the dire tiger. She slapped the sword from the hand of the orc tearing the flesh of the hand with her claws. Ela lashed out with her paws she cut the orc to a bloody pile of dead orc meat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long to collect a couple of the heads of the orcs in a sack to bring as an offering. Ela reached the road that served as the edge of their territory and saw the sharp thorn bushes that served as the markers for the edge of the grounds. She leaped over them into the trees with ease and made her way to the center of the forest. The feeling of the woods didn\u2019t feel natural or right. It felt far darker and more dangerous than it should. </span></div></div>",

Someone had been cultivating blights that fed off of blood and carnivorous plants that feed on flesh. This was a preparation for war with someone and she didn\u2019t like it. She had more of a thirst for blood than her fellow druids but even she saw this as madness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDruids were supposed to keep a balance to the world, to hold nature sacred and prevent the defilement of the natural order. War was against all of their beliefs because of the destruction it caused. It perverted the good in the world and despoiled the world with the carnage it created. Death was part of the natural order of things but wholesale slaughter was not natural, it was the thing of \u201ccivilized\u201d people and shouldn\u2019t be part of a circle of druids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe landed in a tree near the encampment of the druids and saw them busy at work. Ela saw them planting seedlings of another generation of killer plants. She suddenly noticed a blossom opening near her and she tried to leap out of the way as she recognized it. The stunning spores filled the area as she landed hard on the ground in her attempt to get away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer muscles fought her commands to obey as she tried to back away from the village of druids hoping they hadn\u2019t noticed her. She didn\u2019t trust them to let her leave here alive, she had to warn others about what was going on here and seek the wisdom of the elders of her circle of what they might be up to. Ela stumbled back into the woods taking a moment to rest behind a tree. It appeared no one was following her and she might be safe to head back the way she had come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vine whipped out wrapping around her legs and yanking her to the ground. She managed to cut herself loose with the claws on her feet and scrambled as best she could to get away but another set of vines struck at her tearing her clothing revealing generous amounts of cleavage. The young cat woman was being surrounded by plants that weren\u2019t going to let her go free. There was a very real possibility that they would kill her or do worse to her. </span></div></div>",

She called on the primal predator inside of her and started to slash and tear through the dangerous enemies. The vines seemed to keep coming no matter how many she destroyed in her efforts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel her speed and attacks diminishing as the spores continued to work on her body attempting to paralyze her. Slowly she backed away from the attacks but fresh blossoms opened on her approach and blasted their deadly contents out upon her. In an attack of more rage than sense, she stomped on several of them and ground them into the dirt. Ela could only vaguely see the vines coming for her, it felt like she was going in slow motion, swinging at them through the mud. They started to wrap around her limbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was so much more strength in her arms than these plants but what they lacked in strength they were making up for in number. More and more vines shot out and wrapped around her slowly pulling tighter on her form restricting her movement. What few shreds of clothing she had remaining on her body were torn off by the probing spins leaving her sweaty form naked. Her muscles finally gave up the struggle as she panted in exhaustion and waited for what was going to happen next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou fought well,\u201d Ela lifted her head to see a woman of an Archdruid but she didn\u2019t recognize the symbols of the order she belonged to. \u201cYou have put back our work for a long time to come but perhaps in time you can make it up to us.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman opened the jar and covered her hand with some sort of foul smelling goo.

She needed something to enter her. Her body writhed as she tried to bring her hand down to bring some relief but she was held firm. Sweat poured out of her body as she thought that she might go mad if she didn\u2019t screw something soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman rubbed Ela\u2019s belly causing her to moan, \u201cYou will make for a beautiful breeder. Let\u2019s bring out your mate because you shouldn\u2019t be kept apart from any longer because you have so many things to do.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVines released her onto the ground but she couldn\u2019t find the fight within her body, there was only desire to see who her mate would be. </span></div></div>",

She was to become a Seed Mother, one of the deadly leftovers of the wars between the Titans and the gods. A spike shot out from the pod stabbing her in the heart. The pain was only momentary as it spent the load into its victim\u2019s heart, her heart a load of fluids was soon coursing through her veins and the pod collapsed into ash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart felt like a sledgehammer in her chest, her entire body quaked with the change coming over her. Fur and hair fell from her body as green started to cover her freshly sun-kissed body. Her body swelled to a gigantic size especially her breasts which oozed a sickly sweet fluid form them. The belly she had made such efforts to keep trim and tight was gone as it grew full with the incubating of hundreds of seeds, each one a monstrous being incubating in her pregnant belly. Her toes broke and split into dozens of roots to suck nutrients from the ground. The transforming beast person\u2019s jaws grew large with teeth as it snapped at the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer were there eyes on the head of Ela, they were no longer needed as other senses took over. What was once her tongue had become many different tendrils whipping about the sky in search of knowledge of the new Seed Queen\u2019s surroundings. She searched the ideal ground, for enemies and most importantly food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laughter of the druid was loud at the victory, \u201cSoon all of the lands shall belong to me and my enemy is going to give me the army to do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gloating was short lived as the tongues of the monster immobilized the druid and drew him inside to soaked in the acids of the stomach. Her children would have fresh food to grow them into the killers she would need them to be. The colleagues of this druid would soon join their companion in death and feed her growing army. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEla called the other sentient plants in the area to obey her and they quickly worked to fulfill her desires. Others would try to stop her so she set them to the task of building a fortress for her of the wilderness. Soon she would have a kingdom of her own to invade the civilized lands from and bring all of them under the rule of nature once and for all. She was going to do more good for nature as a Seed Queen than she ever could as a druid. </span></div></div>",

In his native lands common people would have hidden their gazes for the fear his kind inspired. Har preferred the stares because they came from curiosity, not fear and hate and to be honest he did look strange. He didn\u2019t have any hair upon his body, and other than a pair of shorts he was devoid of clothing even in the coldest of weathers. His body was instead covered in arcane symbols etched into his flesh from the top of his head to the pads of his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost people thought the symbols were religious in nature but they from dark magic conjured by people willing to breed human like cattle and experiment on them with acknowledgement of the value of their humanity. Har might have cried at the pain they had inflicted upon him if his master hadn\u2019t removed his eyes and placed light blue glowing orbs in the empty sockets, but that was the past and he now sought to ingratiate himself to the local ruler so he could build a home far from the madness that plagued his homelands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow may I serve you, your Majesty?\u201d Har asked King Emeril with a bow, but habit forced him to not lower his eye from the potential threat.

I suspect they are being taken by through the sewer because it would explain the lack of witnesses.

He was glad to have escaped her but he could still feel some attachment to her even after many years and many miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spell scarred could never escape the noble they served because they were bound to them by blood magic from childhood and only the death of the one they served was a path to freedom, but it was the freedom of death because their lives were attached to the one they were bound to. He still remembered being a playmate to the Queen when she was a child. Her father had decided she needed guards even in the play room so he was chosen to be given the change. He wondered how many before him had been subjected to it because few survived the process and fewer still survived with their minds intact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral men hid in shadows ahead of him, waiting to ambush him, but the magical objects that had replaced his eyes allowed him to see through the shadows and even walls. He wondered if they were the people he was looking for or if they were simply criminals looking for easy prey. They would find a much more difficult target then what they had hoped for.

A crossbow bolt struck the warrior and he realized they were meant to conceal an enemy waiting in ambush. Five heavily armored warriors streamed from the tunnel attempting to surround Har. The power of lightning coursed through his body as he lashed out at one of the assassins in place to kill him. A screamed of pain escaped the man\u2019s lips before death silenced him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong years of training had silenced the questions that would plague most men like who had planned this ambush. There would be time enough to discover that if he lived through this encounter which would be very unlikely if he wasn\u2019t very careful. Escape was a possibility but he would much prefer to slay these people than to have to face them later when they had more men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men were slowed by armor and heavy weapons allowing Har to deliver blows of fearsome power into them with his strength enhanced by his powers. These warriors were strong and their armor was not giving way even with his great strength, so he would have to draw on the magic etched into his skin. Fire lit his fists and he struck the leader of the group sending the flames jetting into the warrior\u2019s mask and down the throat burning away the lungs. Leaving the leader of the group dying as she tried to pull oxygen into her lungs and failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hadn\u2019t been hard to pick out the leader of the group with the subtle signals she had been giving the others. Seeing their leader die caused the others to hesitate for only a moment, and this was an indication they fear failure more than death. Rage filled him as he suspected who had sent them, and even as their blows struck hard against his body he barely felt their attacks. He had entered the black haze a condition he had long avoided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe awoke along the empty armors of his enemies. He had devoured there spirits leaving nothing left of the flesh. The nightmares would start soon, when he slumbered this night the spirits of those he had slain would come to him, and for months to come. He had let his rage at the Queen finding him far from her lands allow him to use that dark power again. Was the King involved? He was the only one who Har had told where he was going, unless, a dark thought came to the mind of Har. If the Queen was close she could detect where her spell scarred was. He wasn\u2019t sure if he wanted to run or stay and fight more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHar knew he would need allies if he was to fight her, the one he feared the most in the world.

Much of his powers would be completely useless against her and he suspected he couldn\u2019t even harm her if he tried because the gods knew he had tried before on several occasions. She was always greatly amused by his failures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to tell himself that he had grown much stronger but he couldn\u2019t be sure so he would have to select a companion or two to assist him with his quest. Har didn\u2019t like depending on others but he would have to if he hoped to take down the monster who had haunted him all of his life. He had always worked alone so there was no one in particular that he could trust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercenaries were always available to hire but they were only as trustworthy as long as you were the one with the most gold. Har had earned a lot of gold because his needs were few but the Queen had the fortunes of an entire nation to call upon. Still, you could generally trust in the reputation they had because people wouldn\u2019t pay their prices if they hadn\u2019t earned their worth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could contact the King about the threat and get help from his elite warriors. Each of them was powerful enough to help him but most of them had more than a few screws loose that could make them just as dangerous as an enemy. The Sorcery Queen of his homeland was certainly not someone you wanted to have in your kingdom so the King was likely to help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he could go to the heroes guild to find someone to help. He would have to do it by posting a request with the guild and he would be assigned a random hero to assist in the quest. They would likely realize the danger of the assignment and give him someone good but he didn\u2019t know how much time it would take and time was very important because the Queen was out of her element. She was far from the protections of her kingdom and eventually, she would flee back to it when her enemies started coming after her. This was her best chance to get her and he didn\u2019t want to lose it. Perhaps he could ask for certain skills to help with the quest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe exited the sewers and thought about the job he had on hand. It felt good to have the goal ahead of him and have a plan to take care of it. If he could slay the monster perhaps he could end the nightmares and try to live a normal life. He looked at himself in the glass of a shop and seeing all of the magical tattoos carved into his skin he decided normal may no longer be possible. </span></div></div>",

Most kingdoms banned them but there were always those looking for another weapon to get what they wanted so they flourished with unknown goals and motives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHar wanted to know more about them and their magic for his own purposes so he chose to go after them. Secret groups often had secret knowledge especially arcane related ones and that was what he wanted most. He was willing to make a deal with them if they able to help him and worried him that he didn\u2019t know how far he would go to get what he wanted. Under the command of the Sorcery Queen, he had committed murder on many occasions but he always told himself it was because of her, it wasn\u2019t him. During his escape he had slain many and since that day still others had been added to his debts, at what point did he become as bad as the Queen? Would he let the Blood Moon keep the children if they could free him from his connection to his former master?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could still feel the connection to her, she called to him as he slept and he could feel her searching for him. What scared him most was the fact that there was no anger to the searching, she wanted him but she was a twisted creature whose idea of love usually involved torture. His defiance intrigued her and she would break him trying to understand him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the Blood Moon had left the city according to the sources of the King he would follow them. He was good at trailing magic users, it had been his duty. His powers allowed him to find and kill threats to the Queen. Magic users left a stain on the land that he could follow. The trail was stained dark that hinted at evil and foul actions and he saw attachments to something distant and alien to this world. Whatever the things were had great power, power even greater than the Queen of Sorcery could muster. It was frightening to touch the vibrations of it but it gave him hope that he would be free of his attachment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would he do when he was finally free? Could he live a normal life? The process to craft his powers and strength with embedded deeply into him. It was attached to his body, mind and even his spirit so that he could never be made to betray his master.

The Blood Moon name suggested they were connected to the star entities which was good news and bad news. If he was right it was good because he could use the stars to determine where they would be but it was also bad if he was right because the star beings were alien creatures to this world who were trying to invade this reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHar had fought their kind before and he looked forward to meeting up with this group if they had made pacts with those alien beings. King Emeril had given him permission to kill those involved with the taking of the children and he had no intentions of taking them alive. It was never a good idea to take those with a star pact alive, there words and magic could warp the minds and bodies of those near them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe star chart led him to the spot the stars marked for the best sacrifice this night as his steed panted in exhaustion. If they were traveling as a group they would be moving slow, much slower than a magically enhanced animal. He eyed the location unhappily as he saw the large stones set to honor long forgotten gods that had been perverted to worship the alien beings from beyond this world. Their true name was unknown but the Queen had called them the Kalamar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes hurt as he stretched their power far beyond what they had been crafted for. He had learned the trick but found it left him blind for several minutes afterward but he had his other senses to compensate. The guess he had made had proven right as he saw a large gathering bearing the mark of the Blood Moon. It was many more than he had been told about and it wasn\u2019t just arcane magic users. This had the look of a grand meeting and as his gaze reached into the covered tents and saw many bound children as well as some adults. They were up to something big that would need to be stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost likely they were trying to pull one of their masters through from the other side. He had seen one of the elder things before, he had helped the Queen put it down but it had taken months to fully recover. He had used the chance to get away from her.

All of his tattoos ignited in numerous brightly lit patterns shocking the warlocks having the effect to stop their ritual in an instant to explore who would dare bother them, they didn\u2019t have long to find out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNumerous golden bolts of energy shot through the air at the group sending them rushing to avoid the attack. He didn\u2019t wait to see if he had succeeded in taking any of them down as he sped forward at inhuman speeds striking death blows to two of the number before the others could react. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sizzling green blast of energy splashed over Har\u2019s body doing no more than washing over his like a warm bath. Several of the others were preparing there own warm welcome so the warrior grabbed one of the large ritual boulders and flung it at the leader. Har took quick advantage of the stunning moment as the head was taken from the stake to strike at the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother tattoo ignited as a pair of electrical whips came to life in his hands, it was only a small bit of pain compared to what they planned for the children but it made him feel better. Bodies shook and convulsed into death, it wasn\u2019t taking long for them to realize they were outmatched as he seemed to take no notice of their attempts to harm him. Poison, fire, and acid were flung at him but none of it harmed him, he didn\u2019t even seem to take notice of the flashes of magic around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou shall not finish your dark work this night!\u201d he smashed the last of the thirteen who had tried to flee before the glow around him faded.

She had never listened to him before why would she start now. \u201cI will break the connection as soon as I have dropped them off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you want to play a game of hide and go seek. This is going to be so much fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have your kingdom to rule! There is no way you can leave!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am the Queen goddess of my lands, I can do as I please my darling. We have been apart for far too long. You had your holiday, it is time for you to return to my service.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be bad enough to have her hunters after him but she was a whirlwind of disaster. The power of the gods with the whims of a child. He tried to quicken his pace but the children moved about a step faster than snails. His mind raced for a solution on his slow journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could start a war if you come here,\u201d reason, the last act of a desperate man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Sephira snorted, \u201cIt would hardly be a war. A mild sneeze by me and Dar would be destroyed. But don\u2019t worry about your precious kingdom. I might harm you in destroying it and I would never harm you, darling.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was doubt she would keep the promise but it was better than nothing. Har had sworn to himself he was done with servitude to her. Maybe if he took things to her level he could be done with her forever. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Queen Sephira was so pleased to have Har contact her. She loved him and the fact he had contacted her was proof he loved her. This was just some game to prove she loved him and she intended to win as she always did. There had been a part of her that had started to fear he loved normal women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA surge of anger flashed over her when she saw the milky skin of a slave. A splash of the boiling water on the woman who shrieked in pain scrambling to get away from further abuse. Har\u2019s eyes would not find the scarred woman so beautiful anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unnatural golden color of her skin started to glow intensely as her powers flared. Every other generation her family would sleep with the sun god to maintain their power. It left them with a few unnatural traits that made them abhorrent to most beings. Her mother had often told her it was worth the price but Sephira was not so certain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had often read stories of love and family from foreign lands. It was something she feared she would never have until she met Har. All of the other Zelteir feared her. But he stood up to her and tried to stop her when she raged against those who he felt didn\u2019t deserve it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a great risk. Zelteir were the will of their Queen. No matter how powerful a Queen couldn\u2019t be more than one place at a time but with their Zelteir they could. These minions could be infused with power and enforce the will of their Queen. To enforce loyalty they could be burned from within by the power of their Mistress. Even Har who had hidden from her could be melted into nothing but ash if she had wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGather my things,\u201d a servant rushed to obey. \u201cI am going on a trip. Tell the Solar Guard to be ready to go within the hour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe loved to watch them scurry to obey. Har was certain to complement her for not bringing all of her armies with her. Sephira only planned to slaughter those who got in her way. It was only fair because they were surely idiots if they stood before her and the man she loved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she had left to do was select the Zelteir who would come with her. She had never really trained any in tracking down others of their kind so she didn\u2019t have a perfect candidate. There were ones who excelled at interrogation both mentally and physically. Perhaps she should bring a more destructive member. Har seemed to care about people so a proper event might draw him out to scold her. But she didn\u2019t want to make him angry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSephira reached out to all of her Zelteir and could feel them cringe in fear. Her mind searched through to select the ones she wanted. </span></div></div>",
