Oh no...nononononono-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up!\" A voice shrieked. Cream's eyes shot open and she sat up like a bullet, knocking Cheese down. The chao sat up, rubbing his head. \"Oww! I didn't mean to launch me across the room, Cream!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheese?\" Cream's eyes widened. \"You can talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Cheese looked at her, confusion obvious by both his expression and a question mark over his head. \"Yes...no. Yes I talk, but Mobians and Humans don't understand me. Us. Most of us. You can understand me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream held a hand to her head. \"Uhh...I don't know...I'm confused..Where are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Someone said. Cream and Cheese turned towards the newcomer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shadow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" The lookalike shook his head. \"I'm not Shadow. It's not important who I am. Iblis must have brought you here, so it's not safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" Cream asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fiery guy?\" Cream nodded in recognition. \"That's Iblis. He's bad news, it's no good if he's dragging you into this...come on, get up. We need to leave now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream stood, picking Cheese up. \"Why? Where are we?\" The hedgehog started walking away, and Cream followed him closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to know, you'll just get more involved than you need to.\" The hedgehog stated. \"We're in the basement of...one of the stores in Westopolis right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of the..?\" Cream stopped as they reached the top on the staircase. They had arrived in a bar. The hedgehog closed the door of the staircase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, and be quiet. Hopefully we'll be ignored, but I can't promise anything.\" The hedgehog started leading her out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cream held Cheese close to her, as though she thought that someone would come along and snatch him right out of her arms any second. In this place, that might not have been too far-fetched of an assumption. She stood close enough to the hedgehog that she was almost stepping on his heels. She looked back up at him. He <i>was</i> a hedgehog, right? Now that she looked...something seemed off. His head was bowed, making it hard to see his muzzle, but his eyes were also unusual, being a venomous green with cat-like pupils. She had yet to see him blink. She couldn't help but feel unnerved...her mother always said not to trust strangers, but who could she trust here? The strange Shadow look-alike seemed like her only opt-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream nearly walked into her escort's back, not expecting him to stop so suddenly. She didn't take long to notice a subtle change in expression, a hint of...fear? The fear lasted only a few seconds before the hedgehog recomposed himself. Her attention moved, finally, to the cause of his odd behavior, and she gasped, stepping closer to the hedgehog. They were surrounded by a few human men, drunk if their foul breath and slurred behavior was anything to go by. There were only four, but they towered over the two mobians, being that neither Cream nor her escort was more than three feet tall, while the shortest one of the men was about five feet. A few of the men gave slurred laughs at an unknown joke, one of them finally managing to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heyy, kiff..ki's...kids!\" He snickered. Although he was not very tall by human standards, he seemed like a giant to Cream, who cowered closer to the hedgehog with a similarly scared Cheese in her arms. The hedgehog didn't give any indication he noticed her, his attention on the gang that seemed to be getting closer, unless it was merely her imagination.. The man attempted to continue. \"This isn' no place for kids,\" He stumbled over the words, but didn't notice in favor of leering at the mobians, Cream unable to shake the feel that he was looking at her. \"'Speshully not any 's preddy as thissun...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hedgehog directed a glare at the man, who seemed about to dissolve into laughter again. Cream could practically feel anger radiating off of him, and winced when he spoke with an edge to his voice that hadn't been present before. \"I would advise you to remove yourself and your gang from our way if you have any sense of self-preservation that has yet to die of alcohol poisoning... You have until three.\" The men, if anything, found this even more amusing. \"<i>Three.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, one of the men collapsed, another hedgehog identical to Cream's escort behind him with a hand raised, likely having hit a pressure point based on the bruise on the man's neck. Running at the first hedgehog standing next to Cream, their thoughts seeming to match up perfectly, the second hedgehog was launched into the air by the first, flying at another of the humans and kicking him in the face. A shadowy hole seemed to open up in the ground, a third version of the hedgehog flying up out of it and socking a third man in the face, leaving only one left. The second hedgehog arrived next to the first and tossed him into the air, Cream gasping as he dissapeared in another portal, the second hedgehog disappearing in a different one. The hedgehog that was left stared hard at the last man, who quivered. \"Boo.\" The man yelped and ran off, the bar falling silent to stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to Cream and Cheese, who was still staring at him wide-eyed, the hedgehog took the rabbit by the shoulders and led her out of the bar, ignoring the stares that they received. After managing to get a few shops away, the hedgehog allowed himself to let down his stotic facade. Slumping against the nearest wall, he groaned, placing a hand on his head as though exhausted, closing his eyes. Cream chose not to dwell on the discovery that he actually had eyelids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened?! How did you do that? Who <i>are</i> you? Can I really trust you?!\" Cream gasped, barely able to keep her voice down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was awesome! You were all like WHACK! BAM! KICK! PUNCH!\" Cheese wiggled out of Cream's arms and zipped around in excitement. \"And there were <i>three of you!</i> That's so cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hedgehog, of course, did not respond to Cheese due to having no idea what he was saying. He opened his eyes and looked at Cream, his voice back to normal. \"Please, keep your voices down.<i> Both of you.</i> Using that much power...comes with it's drawbacks.\" He tilted his head back, Cream staring at him with a sudden shock. \"I normally have a Chaos Emerald with me when I do that, which counters the migraines...but I couldn't control my temper.\" He sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You-\" Cream interrupted, staring. \"You don't have...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A mouth?\" The hedgehog sighed, lowering his head to stare at the ground. \"I suppose I'll have to answer that as well...but later. It's not safe here...until we reach our destination, just call me Dark the Shade.\" Something about the name Dark seemed...important, somehow, but Cream couldn't put her finger on why... \"It's not my real name, of course, but it will have to do for now...\" He stood up, Cheese staring at him intently, having stopped his erratic flying and choosing to hover next to Cream's head. \"Come on...we have to get somewhere safe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheese frowned as the two followed Dark. \"Something isn't right... The way his ear keeps twitching is sort of like your pink friend does when she hears something she doesn't like...and, he almost looks as if he's in pain...\" Cream sighed and shrugged, giving Cheese a similarly curious look, saying what they both thought without words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We have to trust him. If we don't...then who can we trust?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">(Unusual Author's Note: The name Dark the Shade is a <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">blatant rip-off</span> direct reference to Rae Logan's Teaching Darkness series, which can be found on DeviantART, Fanfiction.net, and NetRaptor.org.)</font></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cream had been following Dark for a while, Cheese sitting on her head sleepily and herself unsure as to where they were going. It might have been her imagination, but Dark didn't seem to know where their destination was either, frequently glancing down at a piece of paper that had appeared suddenly in his hand and glancing around. Gradually, the sky lightened as it neared day. They finally stopped in a peaceful clearing. Cream thought it was a lot like a meadow, but it had too many cliffs and hills to really be called one. It seemed a perfect place to stop and think. They stood at the beginning, still close to the buildings of the city, one of which had a small water tower of sorts on the roof. She had never seen such a thing before, but chose to ignore it for now, doubting it would be important. She gave Dark a curious look. \"Why did we stop? Is this the safe place you were talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark shook his head, and Cream was silently startled to see what looked like the paper absorbing into his hand. \"No. I hate to say it, but we're lost...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need some help?\" A familiar voice asked. Cream's head whipped in the directing so quickly that Cheese fell off her head, flying back up to hover next to her and wondering how the rabbit managed not to get whiplash. Standing under a tree next to one of the small cliffs, with a casual air about her and a smirk on her face, was a purple cat, a glowing red gem on her forehead, her yellow eyes seeming to have a bright orange glow. Her hair was pulled back into a ponytail, and she wore a regal coat. Her shoes and gloves were spiky-cuffed, and bore a slight resemblance to Sonic's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blaze!\" Cream gasped, a grin spreading across her face as she moved to run to her friend. Dark grabbed her arm and halted the rabbit in her tracks as she was pulled behind the shade. She gave Dark a confused look. \"Mister Dark, what's wrong? Blaze is my friend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That isn't Blaze.\" Dark told her, narrowing his eyes and keeping his gaze locked on Blaze. \"Not the Blaze that you know, anyways...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze's smirk seemed to loose it's friendly feel, and her eyes started glowing more obviously as she began clapping slowly, stepping closer to the two of them, stopping at the edge of the cliff. \"Bra<i>vo</i>, little brother. You catch on fast.\" Blaze stated cheerfully, her voice warping oddly. \"Let's cut to the chase then, shall we?\" She hopped off the cliff, landing neatly and continuing her slow walk towards them, her hands falling to her sides. \"I need you to cooperate, little brother...but it seems that you'd like to do this the hard way, am I right?\" She smiled eerily, holding up a hand and creating a flame with a snap of her fingers. \"And since I suspect that she will become quite a nuisance later...Why don't I just take care of your little friend now?\" Her smile widened at Dark's startled look. \"Just give up, and maybe...<i>maybe</i> I won't kill her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark looked at the ground, Cream watching him closely enough to notice his eyes become distant, as though lost in thought. After a pause, he looked back up at Blaze, re-focusing. \"I believe that in this case, I'll take a third option.\" Without warning, he charged Blaze, who's eyes lit up in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's a fight you want, then it's a fight you'll get!\" She laughed, getting into stance and bracing herself for Dark to run into her. A few steps away from the waiting Blaze, he suddenly opened a void like the ones from earlier and ran through it before it disappeared. Blaze stared at the place where the void had been seconds prior for a moment, before shaking her head, still smiling. She left her battle stance and strolled towards Cream, who stared at her in shock. \"Well, looks like Mephy ran away and left you, poor girl.\" She cooed mockingly, holding up a fireball. Cream stared blankly, wondering what was wrong with her friend, unable to comprehend what was happening. Blaze <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">(Was it really Blaze?)</font> continued. \"Don't worry, it'll all be over and you won't have to feel any more pain.\" She laughed. \"Right after you go through a lot of it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if I can help it!\" Cheese said in his most menacing voice, flying a bit higher. \"<b><i>Leeroy Jenkins!!</i></b>\" He gave a brief glow before shooting towards Blaze. Blaze calmly raised a hand and caught him by the head, stopping him cold. She watched the chao struggle to escape her grip while shouting, before calmly flinging him away. He hit a rock with a cracking sound before falling to the ground, immobile. Cream gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, where were we?\" Blaze was suddenly cut off as she was barreled over, clutching a newly forming bruise on her head. \"Now what?!\" She glared behind her, and her eyes widened. Dark stood behind her, appearing to crack his knuckles while another void dissapeared behind him. The brief shock dissapeared as she started to stand, growling.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream chose this moment to run over to where Cheese had fallen, kneeling to the ground and picking him up. She cradled the unresponsive chao in her arms, bowing her head. \"Cheese? Are you okay? ...Cheese, please say something.\" Cream started to tear up. She didn't know how to check for a heartbeat, she didn't know how she could tell if he was simply unconscious, or if he was... \"Cheese? Cheese! Please wake up!\" He didn't look like he was hit, his face serene. He had to have lost consciousness before even realizing he was hit. He had to be unconscious. He had to be. Cream slowly set the chao down. He looked like he could be sleeping. She turned back to the fight between Dark and Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark was losing. His brief disappearance seemed to have brought back his previous migraine with a vengeance, and it was seriously impairing his fighting skills. Blaze, meanwhile, had an obvious advantage, her powers being boosted by the sun that was rising higher in the sky. Dark was clearly running out of energy. Blaze quickly reached out and grabbed his arms, flipped him around while keeping a firm hold on him, and kicked him square in the back with shocking force. Dark screamed, unable to drown out a painful ripping sound before he fell, falling silent. Cream could only stare at the place where his arms had previously been connected to his body, a strange purple mist seeming to take the place of blood. Blaze dropped the arms, the outer layer dissolving into the same mist and leaving what appeared to be mechanical bones, before calmly stepping over him and moving to Cream, who could only stare in shock at Dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream tore her gaze from the collapsed shade and looked at Blaze, narrowing her eyes. Suddenly she jumped up, charging at Blaze fast enough that the cat was caught off-guard. Sliding underneath her and rolling away on the cat's other side, she was already flapping her ears and running again when Blaze turned to face her. Cream flew up towards a building, turning and sticking her tongue out. \"Come and get me! Or are you to much of a scaredy cat?\" Cream taunted, quickly landing on the roof with the strange water tower and ducking behind one of the wooden legs holding it up. She fell on the ground as the leg splintered apart and burst into flames above her, quickly scrambling behind another leg. \"Is that all you've got?!\" Cream shouted down at the enraged cat, who couldn't jump high enough to reach the rabbit. Cream fell flat again as the leg caught fire and splintered apart, getting back up and flying up on the other side. Looking down, Cream saw Blaze pale as she realized what Cream planned to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cream! Get down!\" Blaze said, her voice sounding panicked, the warping toning down. Cream could still hear it faintly, though. \"You wouldn't hurt me, right? I'm your friend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream gave Blaze a stern glare. \"<i>Blaze</i> is my friend, <i><b>not you!</b></i>\" With that, Cream planted a solid kick on the water tower, the force of it being enough to lean it over. The last two supports broke apart from the weight, and the tower crashed down on Blaze, soaking her and trapping her underneath the rubble. Cream flew down to the park, wincing at the damage. The grassy meadow was little more than charcoal in the areas that Blaze had fought in. Picking up Cheese, she walked over to Dark, who had started to stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, Dark?\" Cream gave her escort a worried look, helping him up. The mist surrounding him was absorbed back into his body, the paper that had been in his hand lying on the ground next to one of the skeletal arms. A quick glance confirmed that they were metal, with odd purple-blue crystals and gears decorating it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine,\" Dark sighed. \"But I'll need time to regenerate. Luckily water puts out Iblis's flames for a time, so he'll be knocked out until further notice. Can you pick up those directions? They have the location of our destination on them.\" Dark managed to stand while Cream picked up the paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how to get to this place!\" Cream exclaimed after examining the writing on the paper. \"We could have avoided running into Blaze...Iblis, if you had asked me..\" Dark sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rather than dwell on what could have happened, let us focus on what will happen next.\" Dark stated, nodding at Cream. \"If you wouldn't mind to pick up those,\" he nodded at the metal arms, \"Then we'll be on our way. Lead on.\"</span></div></div>",
