Kevin, the Junior sales clerk was looking forward to an idle day of answering young childrens questions about goldfish and generally trying to look busy to his manager.  He was only killing time to pay his way through college after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis line of thought was interrupted by a strangely dressed young woman.  There was wearing black and then there was wearing black!  Indeed there did not appear to be anything on her that was not black in colour - her hair was even jet black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes madam.  How can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dragon died yesterday.  I need a new one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your... dragon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my dragon.  Smoky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we have a very good reptiles section....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've already been there,\" the frustrated girl replied.  \"What I need is a dragon.  Doesn't your store slogan say 'for ALL your animal needs'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes, madam, but... let me just call my manager.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl smiled evilly,  \"Now where do you think you're going?\"</span></div></div>",

Finding a dragon used to be so easy in the old days, but in 2002 it seemed near impossible.   The Knights had obviously gotten far too good at their job before the introduction of the endangered species act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what else could she do, she had to have a new one!  Although maybe it had been worth it just for that look on the store assistant's face....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh well, all was not lost.

There was a shout from behind, \"Hey lady, get over here and pay!\"  She turned, smirking, and flicked her hand.  A loud croak emitted from behind her and the caller was now a toad!  The woman glared at the toad then raced off for the reptiles area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon ran into the keeper, and asked a hurried question for a dragon. \"What is your name, ma'am?\" the keeper asked suspisiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tanya. And where can I find a dragon?\" she half shouted. The keeper grinned slyly and pointed toward a large building to his right. A large sign perched on top, reading: \"Dragon Enclosure.\"  A purple dragon picture sat next to the letters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it!\" Tanya said to herself and walked toward the building.</span></div></div>",

She nervously tapped her pencil against the table and wondered how someone from her small town would come across such an item, since Yeti sightings in her quiet neighbornood had occured, well, never to be honest. She realized she would have to find a suitable alternative, some sort of faux-Yeti that while accessible to her would still please the gods of the spirit world, who were known to be a picky lot. Her attempts to substitute eye of newt with oregano during one particularly trying spell had met with such disaster that her fellow sorcerers still chuckled about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Samantha, I'm out of wolfbane. Got any allspice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it came to her, as if a cauldron of hot goat's blood has spilled on her foot. She remembered Mr. Pitts, a local handyman of some reknown, mostly because of his severe lack of any real sense of hygene. A plethora of odors usually greeted anyone within two hundred paces of him (that was with the wind blowing away), his skin, at least the parts that were not covered with thick hair, was mottled with lesions from diseases that quite possibly only he carried and his clothes were covered with stains of a highly questionable origin. But his work was of the highest quality, whether it involved the creation of impeccable lawns, or, as Samantha recalled, his precise removal of snow from sidewalks and driveways in the winter, a skill that had earned him the nickname \"The Snowman\" from the neighborhood children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, he was a \"snowman\", thought Samantha. And he certainly was \"abominable\".  And enough hair covered his back that she could probably take enough clumps for two incantations. As she visualized his hovel at the end of the street, its less-than-secure front door, its broken side window, she found herself reaching for the scissors on her bureau and heading outside. </span></div></div>",

How may I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need a dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry madam, as far as I am aware dragons are mythical beasts, and as a result not stocked by Petsworld,\" Mr. Jacobson replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's simply not good enough.  'For all your animal needs' - that's what the sign says.  And you two are going to get me a dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin's next conscious thought was when he woke up in a field.  He had no idea how he had got there, but Mr. Jacobson was there beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm... where are we?\" Kevin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How should I know?\" was the testy reply.</span></div></div>",

Perhaps it was the strange sounds that were continually drifting into his hearing range. They sounded a bit like screaming, but the media had accustomed him to this type of nonsense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound came again, this time quite a bit more animalistic. Kevin's manager jumped in fright, unsure as to what might be emitting the sounds. There it was again! It was coming from the left, and Kevin decided to trace it to its source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I wasn't calling you!\" a strange, musical voice from somewhere beyond Kevin's viewing field cried out. A figure stepped out to accompany the comment. It had the feet of a goat-like creature, and was covered in white fur up to the thing's torso, where it branched into a fully-grown if flat-chested teenage girl. Her ears were pointed, and a small horn protruded from her forehead. A horse tail was held elegantly above the ground, finishing the look of strangeness and beauty. With a start, Kevin realized she was naked and hurriedly turned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-uh-I'm sorry, miss. I didn't realize--\" he stammered, more embarrassed for himself than for anyone else. The girl tossed her head impudently and stared directly into his eyes. She began to speak again in that oh so musical voice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, why are you here? You certainly aren't a local.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin thought quickly, deciding to tell her about the strange woman in black and her command to find her a dragon. His manager squirmed at the mention of the woman, but the girl merely giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can show you where there's a dragon's nest. But only if you promise to do something for me first.\"</span></div></div>",

He turned to Mr. Jacobson only to see him with his hands stretched out with his palms up with a blank expression on his face.  So Kevin walked to the right.  As they walked down the rocky, dirt road they heard someone coming towards them on the road around a sharp curve behind some large trees.  Kevin and Mr. J. jumped to the side of the road behind some bushes out of sight.  As they hid, they saw a horse drawn wagon driven by an old man dressed in a ragged medeival garb.  The wagon had a cage on the back.  In the cage was a youth about seventeen years old wearing green tights, with a brown pull-over shirt, a matching green hat with a feather in it and leather moccasin-type shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin jumped out of the bushes, \"Excuse me, sir, could you tell me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the horse reared up and bolted towards a large oak tree, throwing the driver off and banging the wagon and cage into the tree leaving the driver unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. J. ran over to the old man to find that he was alright except for a nasty cut to the right side of his head.  He wrapped a piece of cloth around the wound and carefully laid the man against the tree until he would regain consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy in the cage got up with both hands on his head and said in an English accent, \"What happened?  Who are you and why are you dressed so strangely?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Kevin, this is my boss, Mr. Jacobson and we don't know where we are.  The last thing we remember is a strange lady dressed in black telling us that her dragon died.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Ian.  Pleased to meet you.  Was this woman wearing a ring with a large red stone on her right hand?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin thought for a minute and Mr. J. blurted, <br>\r\n\"Why, yes, she was.  I thought it odd that a woman dressed in such ragged clothing would be wearing such an expensive looking ring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my,\" replied Ian, \"That was Delia the witch.  Sir Gwain slayed her dragon when it breathed fire and destroyed the home of his love, Katherine, and killed her father.  Delia has many powers.  She can change her looks and become anything she desires.  She can even travel through time into the past.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that explains how we got here.\" replied Kevin. \"We are from the future and she has brought us here but I don't know why.  By the way, why are you in that cage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delia made false charges and had me imprisoned for revenge against Sir Gwain.  She has no power over him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why you?\" replied Kevin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir Gwain is my father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found the keys to the cage!\" said Mr. J. \"They were on the driver's belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin unlocked the cage and freed Ian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My father is preparing me for the knighthood and when I become a knight, Delia will have no power over me, either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then they saw a dark figure walking towards them from a distance on the other side of a grove of trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Delia!\" exclaimed Ian.</span></div></div>",

Kevin followed. The room he entered was a great library or perhaps a great lounge, but certainly a great surprise. A cheerful log fire burned in a gigantic stone fireplace around which were several very comfortable looking, old, red leather sofas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirtually none of the deep green walls could be seen between the extensive bookshelves loaded with ancient and modern books.  Gaps were filled with a tasteful collection of modern art.

He now wore a spotless white tee-shirt and blue jeans, Calvin Klein if Kevin wasn't mistaken.
