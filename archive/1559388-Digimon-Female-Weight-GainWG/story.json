Finally over with the battle, Zoe is able to relax in the real world. Away from constant danger of the evil digimon. But even though she had vowed that she would be able to make friends when she returned, it just wasn't working out for her. Frustrated with herself she decided to go to her aunt's house for the remainder of summer vacation her parents had already agreed and she had decided her best option was to not worry about anything until the school year began. Hopefully she would have better luck then. After being driven through the countryside of japan her parents waved her off and our story begins.<br>\r\n  \"Auntie?\" Yelled Zoe as she entered the almost empty house.\"Zoe is that you? Come in my dear!\" Cried her Auntie whom hadn't seen her neice in quite a few years. She was amazed Zoe's parents had called her to take care of Zoe after not seeing her since before the move to italy. Shizune Orimoto is the exact opposite of Zoe's family, a country woman by heart she could only think a few things about Zoe after not seeing her for so long. 'Dear god they dont feed her at all!, Oh well by the time she leaves I'll put some fat on those bones!' Zoe just stared at her aunt curiously, she was quite a large woman probably weighing around 250 pounds, \"Auntie Shizune! How is everything? I havent seen you in ages\",Shizune replied \"I remember you as an infant, you have grown into a fine woman, Now go upstairs, unpack your stuff and I'll call you down for dinner, We can catch up then\". Zoe followed, blissfully unaware of what her aunt had prepared for her.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Arriving at the kitchen, her aunt Shizune yelled \"Try some of my homemade chocolate chip cookies! I made too much again, better eat them while there hot. You can have as many as you like! Im making alot more for the bakery\" Zoe being only a light 105 pounds wasn't too hungry at the moment but decided to try one, biting into it she devoured the cookie in seconds and mesmerized by the smell and taste she took a plate full of them which her aunt had prepared for her and brought it back to her room which she mindlessly continued to munch on as she unpacked, also going down for a few plate refills. She didn't realize that no matter how much she ate her aunt alway's had more prepared, (Considering that Shizune was owner of the town bakery her food was almost impossible to resist), something inwhich Zoe witnessed firsthand. <br>\r\nAs dinner time arrived even though Zoe had stuffed her face with her aunt's pasteries, she wasn't the slight bite full. It seems the cookies only managed to awaken her appetite, allowing Zoe to eat all the dinner given to her by Shizune, as an amazing cook , It was almost impossible to resist her cooking. Finally Zoe with a huge stomach ache went to bed not realizing how much she actually ate, oblivious of her new profound gluttony.</span></div></div>",

Though she didn't take too much notice to the restriction of her clothes. Mostly because of Shizune claim's to have shrunk them all in the dry cleaners and promised to buy new one's at the earliest chance she can get. Zoe even though not stupid was too believing at her aunt's words to think anything else could be up. Following her aunt through the town market they found a shop with clothes for woman, as Shizune and Zoe were looking for a new wardrobe for Zoe, Shizune told Zoe a prehanded lie, \"Zoe, let me warn you before you go crazy.. Sizes here in the country are different then in the city, If you wore a medium in the city it would probably be a large here\", Shizune seriously didn't believe Zoe would fall for it, but to her luck she believed Shizune and went to the dressing stall's with the large. As Zoe was changing the sign's to her body were now visible, she had gained a total of 16 pounds. It wasn't considerably a small amount but it wasn't enough to make Zoe 100% aware of her problem. Her breast were now actually visible going from non existant to small but nevertheless there, she had developed a small potbelly, which jiggled with a tiny touch and forced her to pull her skirt down after many meal's to easier digest the food. Her thigh's had thickened and her butt had expanded a bit, it was a bit more wider and also jiggled a tiny bit as she walked, finally her face had filled out a tiny bit, even if she hadn't grown a second chin yet, the devolopment for it had started. Wearing the large, Zoe sees that it fit's her the same as her old small did, so she leaves with her aunt cheerfully for dinner.</span></div></div>",

When Zoe finally reached her aunt's kitchen she started yelling! \"Cmon Auntie im hungry, please make more danishes, we ran out!\" Shizune was confused , she had certainly expected Zoe to come down yelling about her weight but instead she asks for more food? She was lost at words.. , unable to resist food and oblivious to what was happening to her, Zoe had seriously become addicted to her aunts cooking, but not only had the fattening affected her appetite but Zoe was also starting to get extremly lazy, walking around without her shoes and doing nothing but eating and sleeping, Shizune had actually transformed Zoe into a piggy within 2 weeks. The only thing Zoe did apart from sleep was cry out for more food. Yet Shizune's body had also taken a toll from cooking sweets 24/7, her weight had skyrocketed from 250 to 302 pounds, she wasn't able to control herserl with all the food lieing around anymore. Yet Zoe's differences were now visible perfectly across her body as she blossomed into the fatter woman her aunt wanted Zoe to be. Having gained 31 pounds Zoe's breasts were now quite visible and laid on her potbelly which had increased the most, from a spherical shape to now drooping slightly over her waistband, she was forced to unzipper her large pant's almost constantly in order to breath, her thighs had grown thicker and her butt wider, also her arms were now noticably fatter which strained her shirts to the point her aunt made slits in her sleeves. Finally her face had grown a second chin, and was much more rounder, giving her a much cuter, childish look. Her 152 Pound body was covered with a layer of fat which caused most of her body to jiggle with the slightest touch. But sadly Zoe was now to immersed in food to care about anything else.</span></div></div>",

Zoe and her aunt continued to gorge constantly on every sweet and morsel Shizune cooked, and while Shizune had managed to stop at 345 Pounds, Zoe wasn't able too. Because of her aunt's sweets Zoe was always kept eating at the table, but her hunger increased constantly until the point that even her aunt couldn't keep her full. Because of this Zoe always ate, never getting full, her weight skyrocketing to the point even Shizune was amazed.<br>\r\n Zoe had now reached 351 Pounds. Food was the world to her at this point, unable to fill her greedy mouth, her desire was to eat forever, she was consumed by gluttony and her body showed it. She rarely changed outta her morning clothes at this point and her once once lean legs were now covered in fat, even her toes had grown fatter. Her arms had grown a length that even Shizune's clothes had a hard time covering her, her fingers also resembled vague sausages at this point. Her butt had increased tremendously, now about 3 feet wide, Zoe needed 2 chairs to sit. Also her breast now covered in fat layed on her huge belly, which reached until her knees, Zoe could never resist to give it a rub, Zoe's face had also changed, now bearing 3 chins and as round as it could possible be, Zoe was a beauty of fatness, her backrolls, her belly, everything about her, beatifull.nSeeing as Zoe was leaving back for her house, Shizune prepared one last feast for Zoe, with everything she could think of spread across the table, the legs of the table creaked but nothing mattered. <br>\r\n  Zoe sat down and started the feast, stuffing everything her fat fingers could reach down her greedy mouth, her belly slowly but surely grew, fatter and larger and Zoe cleared the table, at some point Shizune ripped off Zoe's shirt which allowed her belly to reach it's full size. Doing so increased the pace inwhich Zoe ate, faster and faster she started using her hands to stuff everything as fast as she could inside of her, not caring about anything but her hunger. Finally as the feast neared the end, Zoe stepped on the ground causing her heels to break, which made her kick them off. Finally free of all clothing Zoe climbed on the table to reach the food at the far end, causing the table to crash and fall, allowed her to jiggle until she finished the last of the food. Inwhich she got up, rubbing her belly yelled \"Thank you Auntie, that was seriously delicious!\".<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",
