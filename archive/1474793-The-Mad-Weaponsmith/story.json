Just because I turned a tower into a fish, and stuffed three people into a phone box just to see if they would fit doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m mad, does it? Anyway, my name is Cysero, a weapon smith. This is my story, a story that changed lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day started off normally. I was woken by a stray chickencow that had wandered into the tower. It let off a loud moocluck (seriously, how do they do that?) and flew out of the window rather groggily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Cysero first see?</span></div></div>",

All I could remember was helping Ash pull a prank on Artix, and Warlic shouting at me to stop my laundry from destroying his research. As I got up, I heard a loud explosion outside. I went to the window, and saw Dr. Voltabolt. Falconreach\u2019s resident mad scientist and dentist was cackling madly in the wreckage of his lab. He was talking about \u201cdestroying magic\u201d and \u201ctaking over the world\u201d, the usual drivel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went to get some breakfast, half walking, and half stumbling down the stairs. I felt unusually dizzy for some reason. Must still be a bit tired, I thought, but as I saw in the mirror I saw none of the usual symptoms: Bags under my eyes, slouching, and well groomed hair. (With most people, their hair is usually messy when the wake up, but I\u2019m not most people.) I just assumed it was a trick of the light, and went down into the kitchen. It was empty. Usually Warlic was here cleaning up the mess I made from dinner, but though it was clean, he was nowhere to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

I quickly summoned up some clothes and ran outside, where I was in for a shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe town was empty! There wasn\u2019t the sound of Yulgar working at the forge, or Gram\u2019s pet store\u2019s usual growling. I decided to investigate, so I made my way to my store to see what had gone on. The way the town was so quiet, it frightened me. Usually the town was alive and bustling with adventurers seeking new quests and rare items. Now, the only sound was of the wind blowing and the inn sign creaking.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I quickly searched around to try and find anything that could tell me what had happened, and soon I had. The dimensional anchor keeping my mega store attached to the universe had been severed! This is serious, I thought, so I decided to do the one thing that I had been taught to do in this type of situation: Run around screaming like a sneevil being chased by a gorillaphant. However, as I screamed, I heard a faint rustle behind the bushes so I decided to check it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Cysero find?</span></div></div>",

I cleaned him with a blast of Waterga and after he wringed out his ears; he told me what he remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember much,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly a big blur. All I can remember is Artix chasing Ash for some reason. I woke up this morning under this bush, and when I realised that no one else was here I hid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe decided to split up to try and find anyone else, so I gave him some spare health potions and went to the portal at the top of town, near the guardian tower. I decided to go to Warlic\u2019s tent, to see if he had just left early and if he knew what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs Warlic there?</span></div></div>",

The bad news was that he was unconscious. The horrible news was that he was in a cage guarded by a giant mechanical drill. I had seen that drill before, but I just couldn\u2019t put my finger on it, or my toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blasted the drill with an energy bolt, but it just shrugged it off. On its shoulder, I saw that a bit of its wiring was exposed, so I jumped over it, and prised its shoulder open with my staff. Then I finished it off with a blast of energy at its wiring. I blew open the cage door and woke up Warlic. I woke him up, and asked him if he knew who was behind all this, and what he said confirmed where I had seen the drill before, and that we were all in danger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Voltabolt\u2019s\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Cysero do next?</span></div></div>",
