            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"<i>Will you just... get off of... me</i>?\" you grunt, struggling against Jonas's weight as the sandy-haired boy sits on your chest with that \"annoying little brother\" smirk plastered on his face. Your mom is on the other side of the house, in the living room, but you're pretty sure she can hear what's happening to you. Recently she hasn't been doing much at all to protect you from your siblings. Honestly you can understand... your brother and sister are so darn persistent, and despite your mother diligently defending you from them in the past, you're sure that at a certain point it's just... tiring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you feared, the world suddenly begins to grow as you see Jonas sticking his tongue out at you. You try to yell for your mom one last time, but now it's clearly too late, as your little brother's weight increases tremendously, at least from your perspective. Now you can't even breathe. \"Can't talk now, huh? You're gonna be a BUG soon!\" Jonas laughs obnoxiously, shifting his now crushing weight around on you cruelly. He's four years younger than you, and if you weren't currently half your normal height, he'd also be quite a bit smaller than you. Of course, now the size advantage is completely his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear your mother turn up the volume on the television in the distance, perfectly aware of what Jonas is about to do to you. This time she's not going to bother trying to prevent the inevitable, and just let you all fight it out. You don't suppose that would be such a big deal if your brother couldn't shrink you down to the size of a speck. With that, your big sister Hailey's head appears over the edge of Jonas's bed. Jonas's room is typically the main gathering place for everyone but your mom, as that's where all the video games and movies are located. Two years older than you, her long brown hair dangles down as she looks at your situation with a huge goofy grin. \"I was thinking... we could play a round of <i>Fierce Fighters</i> to decide who gets to <b>torture</b> you this weekend. If *I* win, you're gonna be the size of a speck of dirt in my sneaker ALL weekend while me and Greg go hiking,\" she smirks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I win, we'll be playing <i>dodge the giant wiener</i>,\" Jonas smirks down at you. You squirm helplessly under his weight, still unable to breathe. You're not really <i>surprised</i>, but just hearing the threat come out of his mouth, knowing you can't do anything about it...  and you're even more disturbed as you feel your younger sibling's stiffening member through his shorts on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you are allowed to breathe again as your younger sibling hops up off of you and goes to grab the controllers. \"No... fair...\" You wheeze, feeling to see if your ribs are broken or just bruised. It's when you're shrunken to these medium sizes that you're most easily injured, you've discovered. When you're shrunken further, down to maybe an inch or as small as a bug, your body seems to become much more resilient to pressure, although by you are no means invulnerable to it. \"At least give me a chance,\" you mutter up at Hailey, finally sitting yourself up in the floor. Your clothes are huge now, about to fall off. She just peers down, amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we could make it more <i>interesting</i> if you want to challenge <b>us</b> to a round instead,\" she grins. \"You feel like double-teaming him, Jonas?\" she adds, twirling her hair around with her finger. Fierce Fighters used to be your favorite game, but now it's just a more complicated version of rock-paper-scissors for your siblings to decide who gets to torment you. The game itself is part of a long running series: Fierce Fighters 3 came out when you were just four, and you and your siblings grew up playing it and each following installment religiously. The latest is Fierce Fighters 6, released just last year. Of course, your brother and sister discovering they have the power to shrink you has seriously changed the family dynamic... it's been a while since they've even let you <i>play</i> the game, instead of you simply being the reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, if you can beat BOTH of us... I'll grow you back AND we'll leave you alone for the rest of the week,\" he says, returning, having already gathered the controllers and started the game. \"But if we win...\" he starts, before going over to Hailey and whispering something into her ear. She giggles and whispers something back, to which he his eyes widen a bit and he laughs. Try as you might, you can't make out what they're saying. They deliberate back and forth until they both finally look down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>It'll be a surprise</i>,\" they both declare, creepily in unison. You're not sure if you want any of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And <b>we</b> get to decide all the rules and set up all the settings before the fight,\" Hailey adds, with a big, confident, ear-to-ear grin. Clearly this isn't going to be fair at all. \"Or me and Jonas could just fight it out, and the winner gets to do whatever they want with you for one weekend. Otherwise, if you fight us both and lose... we're gonna double-team you for a <b>week</b> non-stop! Your decision!\" She adds. Fantastic choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously they're going to make the rules so unfair if you decide to fight them yourself that you won't even stand a chance. But, at least, there's a slim chance you might get out of it... And just before your brother tackled you earlier, you were just about to call and ask Lia, your best friend and girl you've always had a crush on, to go dancing this weekend. It's honestly why you let your guard down to start with, you were distracted when one of your mutual friends texted you to let you know that \"Lia would totally go\" if you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut looking up at your siblings grinning cheesily down at you, you now have serious doubts you'll get the chance to follow through.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Agreeing to this might be... no, almost definitely is, a huge mistake. But at the end of of the day, beating your siblings at this stupid game is really the only way you'll get a chance to ask Lia to be your girlfriend before some other guy beats you to it. You only hope they make the fight remotely fair... but deep down, you know better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take long before you realize what a mistake you've made. You're not really in any position to argue with anything they say, no matter how ridiculously unfair it is. First of all, Jonas insists that you use the old off-brand controller, which is harder to use normally anyway... but shrunken to half your size, the buttons are too far apart and you have trouble even getting your hands around it. Then Hailey decides to outdo Jonas's handicap by proposing that, not only do you have to view the screen upside-down as you play, but you'll have play with all but your head shoved underneath the bed, as the two of them fight over who gets to use your face as a footstool. All of this WHILE still trying to beat them both at the game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's just the obstacles they decide to put on you <i>outside</i> of the game. In the game... they really put it to you in the settings. You groan as they deliberate over the pre-match modifier settings, finally settling on making your character permanently shrunken in the game and their characters permanently super-sized. Fitting. Typically these are temporary power ups/downs that you get by collecting an item during the match, but the pre-match settings allow for this sort of customization. Of course, they're not going to take turns fighting you either... you'll be taking them both on simultaneously, two vs. one. So they set the rules to three lives apiece, and... of course... pick the battle map they know you do the worst on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on, pick your guy!\" Hailey snickers, as her heel digs into your cheek. Really? They're actually going to let you choose? Struggling with the controller, you have just enough room to fit your hands around it and press the buttons, even shoved under the bed. You see them both chuckling down at your shrunken frame, as you submissively look up them, then further up, straining your neck just to get an upside-down view of the television. You pick the character you've always used since you were little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, big surprise there,\" Jonas mocks, as his enormous foot smashing down onto the other side of your face. As the match starts, their doubly huge soles knead into you and they compete with each other to do the best job smothering you and obscuring your view...<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlip a coin SIX times... if you get even a single tails, you lose. Pick the first option. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtherwise, wow! You manage to beat them! You must've been sneaking in some major practice lately. Congrats! Pick the second option.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Or if you don't have a coin handy, use this link: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.random.org/coins/?num=6&amp;cur=60-usd.0025c-ct\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.random.org/coins/?num=6&amp;cur=...</a></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With Jonas and Hailey's one-sided set up, this round of <i>Fierce Fighters</i> is probably not going to go well for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were always a little better than them at the game, skill hardly matters when your character is the size of a few pixels on the screen, and your opponents both hit like a truck and move four times as fast as you. All you can hope for is to luck out and grab some sort of power-up that will push the odds at least a <i>little</i> back in your favor, but... it's no use. There's two of them, and you're too slow to even get near a power-up before you've already been slammed by at least one of your siblings' sweeping attacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It doesn't take long before your fighter is sent flying, losing your first life.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I thought you were gonna <b>beat us both</b>?\" Jonas chuckles as your fighter is returned to the screen with only two lives left. They've only taken a <b>single</b> point of damage between the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, I think you got this, Jonas,\" Hailey snickers, wiping her huge sweaty sole along your shrunken face before trying to jam the double-sized toes of her other foot into your mouth. You clamp your mouth shut and just try to focus on what little you can see of the game, prompting her to laugh. Now that you're one life down, Hailey decides to run her fighter to the edge of the arena and simply watch while Jonas pummels you all on his own. You try to put up a fight now that it's one-on-one, but it hardly matters. His fighter is too big and fast, and repeatedly you're kicked into the wall, and if you occasionally find a moment of relief to try to get away or head for a power-up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh uh!\" Hailey laughs, and kicks you right back over to him. Jonas starts taking his time, hitting you with weak, simple attacks, humiliating you more and more before he finally uses his weakest move to send you flying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And another life is lost. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like being our bitch, bug?\" Jonas grins down. Jonas steps back and lets Hailey take over for your last life, her massive fighter immediately cornering yours and catching you with a crushing stomp move that stuns, burying your shrunken fighter in the ground. She takes a moment as you furiously pound at the buttons, trying to dig out of the ground, and makes her fighter do a <i>taunt</i> - which is nothing but an irritating, pointless move made to hurt nothing but your pride. Her fighter taunting you gives you <i>almost</i> enough time to break free of the ground-stun, if you tap the buttons as hard as you can... but each time, just as you break free, her taunt ends and she simply repeats her stun attack, crushing your tiny fighter underneath another powerful stomp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour upside down view of the screen is obscured as Hailey's feet slide across your face, as she laughs at your hopeless in-game struggles. You quit even trying to escape. \"Is that... it? Are you giving up?\" she grins down. You don't even bother moving, as with one powerful, charged up attack, Hailey's fighter sends yours bouncing off the nearest wall and flying off of the screen, ending the match. Both of them squint down at you... you lost, and now... whatever it was they both agreed would be your fate in that case, is going to be your fate. Non-stop. For a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure which of them is doing it, but you feel the controller growing larger and larger, and the world begins to grow... you see the open neck of your shirt and the rest of your already loose clothing growing large before you, still stretched out under the bed. They've chosen to shrink you down into the spot where your head was lying... exercising a bit of extra control, they've learned this prevents you from getting caught up in your own clothing. So your naked body is left sprawled out, right where your head was, underneath your siblings' feet. And your tiny naked body <b>continues</b> to grow smaller, and smaller, until it's little more than a speck. From your perspective, the linoleum floor which once looked flat has grown large hills and valleys. And your giant siblings' feet and toes look like the feet of gods wiggling around above you. Past their enormous feet, you can see that same humiliating view of their grinning faces looking down at you as before, as Hailey happily waves down. <b>They're so, so far away. </b>There's a bluish haze due to the sheer amount of atmosphere between you and them now, something which you couldn't perceive before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, BUG,\" Jonas's voice booms, reverberating the very ground your tiny naked form is lying on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's <i>PLAAAY TIIIME</i>!\" Hailey laughs, her voice... booming... feminine... <b>godlike...</b> shaking the world around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Her massive fingers slowly grow more and more huge as she reaches down to grasp you...</i></span></div></div>",

Jonas's enormous face appears from behind, smirking down at you. \"And basically...\" she continues, \"...Jonas and I are gonna take turns.
