As you were walking home, you were listening to some jazz music to calm your nerves. After a couple of hours, you got home, opened the door before closing it as you yelled to your sister that you were home but you heard no answer. You soon thought that she was at her boyfriend's place leaving you home alone for the night. You went to your room and threw your bag onto your bed as you walked into your bathroom which was connected to your room. Thankfully, you had your own bathroom as you turned on the shower before getting in and started to wash yourself. Another hour passed as you turned off the shower before stepping out and drying yourself off. After you placed the towel around your body, you noticed something was wrong. So you opened the door from your bathroom that leads into your bedroom but instead of seeing your bedroom, you saw a bunch of doors that wasn't there before. So you walked down the hallway and noticed the names above each door and was shocked that these doors lead to anime's which got you to have an idea which was to leave your old life. Which door do you go through?</span></div></div>",
