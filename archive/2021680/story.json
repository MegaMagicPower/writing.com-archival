            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Three months have passed since the meeting with the Keryxian, which changed planet Earth irrevocably, forever. The newspaper article, kept from that momentous day, has proven to be a significantly historical document. By now the words are fairly familiar...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>11th December 2084</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b><u>A Brave New World?</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nArticle written by Kayleigh Simmonds</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is, without a doubt, a day that no human will ever forget. Nothing will ever compare to the abject misery and brutal treatment that we were subjected to, as an entire planet, earlier today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresident Joseph Harding could barely contain his excitement, when a week ago he announced that NSEP (New Space Exploration Program) had managed to make contact with life forms on another planet. And not just freaky monsters, or raging lunatics! After speaking on the projection system with a \u201cspokescreature\u201d from said planet, he was delighted to inform the eager media, including myself, that she was \u201cutterly beautiful, charming, intelligent and completely fluent in English, and apparently \u2013 every language on Earth!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA media frenzy inevitably followed this; bold predictions were made that Earth had finally made a breakthrough that would change our future forever. Well, they were certainly right about that. Ignoring the sceptics and warnings from various experts and regular citizens alike, President Harding organised a meeting, via the projection system with the aliens, who he revealed were known as the \u201cKeryxian\u201d, and invited all of the other major world leaders, who were suitably honoured and eager to attend such a groundbreaking event. It was made crystal clear to the media that no delegates from any newspaper, tv channel, blog, journal or any form of communication would need to be present; instead the event would be televised live to every tv station in every country in the entire world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, everyone seemed to be genuinely thrilled and beguiled by the spokescreature that President Harding conversed with, just hours ago \u2013 watched by billions around the world. As promised, she was undoubtedly the most beautiful creature ever seen (by any human at least): utterly flawless bone structure and complexion, startlingly intense eyes, a luscious wave of golden hair, all on top of a light purple, almost violet covered skin. However, the next thing that happened \u2013 something strange and unexpected \u2013 that all those still alive are still in understandable shock about, and will be for quite some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter exchanging pleasantries, President Harding was happy for the Keryxian spokescreature to express some sentiments to all of the Earth viewers. Bizzarely, she lifted up both of her long legs to reveal her feet to the screen. Two bare soles that were simply flawless and divine to gaze upon. Smiling at the screen, in a high-pitched yet soothing voice, she spoke the following words:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHumans: your life is about to change. Forever; for the better. Most of you males have already crumbled to dust and ash. You were unworthy. A few of you have been spared, as you appreciate the female foot sufficiently. Females:  you will control every aspect of your planet, which is now called \u201cFemFoot World\u201d. Males that are still alive: your role is to be nothing more than slaves and to honour every female foot, which is the greatest blessing you will ever aspire to achieve.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese words reverberated around mine, and countless others' minds while we watched, shell-shocked, as the spokescreature vanished. President Harding was shown looking catatonic for several seconds, while several screams and shrieks could be heard, before the cameras were turned off and the screen went blank...<br>\r\n</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>Since then, a huge flurry of activity has broken out, not just in this newspaper station, but across the entire world. Women have scoured the streets for their husbands, sons, fathers, friends, loved ones - now lost ones: nothing more than dust and ash, as was promised. The surviving men, from what I gather have either been blamed for their fetish, or secretly kept hidden, in case they are to be captured or punished in some way. President Harding issued a statement, simply stating: \u201cHeartache and pain is echoed throughout the entire world. This is not only a tragic, but confusing situation. I urge all the American people to stay united and not give in to any fears or demands that are thrown their way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho knows what will happen next? The only thing that is for certain is that nothing is for certain in this brave, new world.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the name of the journalist \u2013 Kayleigh Simmonds \u2013  she was one of the women rounded up and imprisoned for being a \u201crebel\u201d. This was of course after the Keryxian issued one more set of instructions \u2013 approximately a day later. These were as follows:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\tAny living male must be shown the Soles Of Enlightenment \u2013 looking at any image or video clip of the Keryxian spokescreature\u2019s bare soles for a mere few seconds would either reduce him to dust, or allow him to live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\tIf the male is allowed to live, he must be enslaved.  As a creature with \u201csufficient Femfoot appreciation\u201d, he may serve female feet but nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\tIf a female wishes to procreate, then she can obtain a sperm sample from a male of her choosing. Newborn females will be raised to follow the Femfoot principles. Newborn males will sent to Enslavement Education. If by the age of 18, they survive the Soles of Enlightenment, then they can be used as a slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\tAny female caught treating a male as anything other than a foot slave, or rejecting any of the Femfoot principles will be exterminated immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition to that, the Keryxian spokescreature explained that from this point forward, FemFoot World would be controlled and run by human females, and monitored by the Keryxian. If after a year, the women have failed to successfully meet the criteria given to them, then the entire planet will be destroyed and human existence will be over, permanently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course many rebelled against these principles and they were dealt with harshly, swiftly. The human population had been approximately 11 billion before the Keryxian meeting. With the extermination of the non-foot-fetish males, it initially dropped to just over 5 and a half billion. After the rebellions from the surviving females ended, the population was left at just 150 million. A HUGE proportion were wiped out from the resistance to the Keryxian, which lasted just over a week, and resulted in such a massive loss of life, that the leaders from the survivors agreed that they would have to comply with the Keryxian demands. From there, those resisting the Keryxian rule, or who refused to swear fealty to the aliens were quickly wiped out too. Entire towns and cities were destroyed instantly, until the survivors gave their full and total surrender: some allowed to join the new FemFoot World at its capital in Nevada, America. Others, who had spoken out against the Keryxian were publicly executed, swiftly. The population of the current FemFoot World was set at approximately 7 million, approximately 1 million of which were male slaves.<br>\r\n<a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/2021680-FemFoot-World/map/13\">More detail of that here</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/2021680-FemFoot-World/map/13\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the surviving men capitulated willingly or were forced into foot slavery. There were however a number of men who were still alive and have avoided foot slavery somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one knew a great deal about the Keryxian, other than the fact that they were determined to successfully turn Earth into FemFoot World, were utterly ruthless and had far better technology, weapons etc than humans, and were beautiful but deadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Continue reading to or adding to the story from the following character\u2019s perspectives...</b></span></div></div>",

For the past week, he had received very little other than food and water - and he wasn't even technically enslaved!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie - his longtime girlfriend - has maintained how determined she is to protect him from the FemFoot authorities. Since the Keryxian invasion, for the first couple of months or so, he felt trapped, claustrophobic in his house, but at least he had the regular warmth and affection that Melanie consistently offered him. Of course, Seth had to be careful, and after the Keryxian wiped out most of the male population, they both agreed that he would stay in the house - out of sight. He was even cautious to use the phone, Internet...just in case it revealed his whereabouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anyone did come over to check on Mel - pretty routine stuff - they both agreed he would hide in the basement. The thought occurred to him afterwards that he could have just worshipped her feet in front of any FemFoot delegates (he would have obviously enjoyed this, despite being assumed to be a slave).  In fact, it almost made him tempted to suggest being her foot slave all of the time anyway! But deep down, he couldn't allow himself to do this: it would be basically giving up on dreams, on hope - on life. Plus, if the authorities found out that she had lied...that's a risk neither of them were prepared to take!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, visits were becoming increasingly frequent; it was as if the FootFem delegates suspected Melanie of being disingenuous and wanted to ensure that she wasn't harbouring anybody. The only way she could convince other people that she was fully behind the FemFoot principles (even though she loathed them), was to socialise and spend time with other women - women who had bought into the new world order and seemed to genuinely believe that men were worthy of nothing other than foot slavery! Realising that Seth had barely seen each other in over a week, his girlfriend made the suggestion that he resided in the basement all of the time. With more visitors coming over - \"friends\" and FootFem delegates alike - it did make sense to keep him out of the way. Even though this meant a pretty miserable and lonely existence for him, it was still better than being an actual slave though, he mused grimly to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, every time the basement door creaked open, he felt excited about the prospect of seeing his sweetheart, but terrified in case he was about to be discovered and forced into slavery. Again, part of him was curious about being a foot slave, but not enough to allow himself to have it determine his existence, which is inevitably what would happen! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Melanie's long blonde hair appeared, dangling down either side of her tanned, pretty face, relief spread through you. In her hand was a plastic bag, which probably meant \"dinner\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel! It's so good to see you!\" Seth said, rushing over to embrace her, his long black hair tied in its usual ponytail. He wrapped his strong arms around her and squeezed but she released him, far too quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Seth - I haven't got much time. Supposed to be meeting some of the others tonight and I need to get ready. Here are some leftovers from the sandwiches we had earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\" He couldn't disguise the disappointment that once again he wouldn't be able to spend time with his girlfriend that evening. \"For the sandwiches.\" He added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" Melanie said awkwardly as she made her way back towards the basement door. \"I might be back later tonight; if not I'll catch you tomorrow, hun.\" With that she quickly departed, leaving him - once again - all on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed but was so hungry, he hurriedly began shoving down the leftover sandwiches into his mouth. All ham and cheese: not even his favourite. As Seth slumped down onto his mattress, trying to chew slowly to avoid indigestion, he contemplated his joke of a life. Three months ago, he had no major worries - in fact he was planning to propose to Mel - his girlfriend for approximately five years. She never had a single issue with his foot fetish, in fact she enjoyed allowing him to indulge in kissing her feet, licking her soles, sucking her toes. Neither of them had a problem with it whatsoever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow strange then that what he always considered a quirk, a weakness possibly, would actually end up saving him. Had he not had a foot fetish, he would be nothing more than a pile of dust! Then again, how was his current situation any more preferable? At least he was alive but what could he realistically do about it? Lead a revolution against a female-dominated society that was being overseen by powerful female aliens, who believed that males belong and are destined to be foot slaves? The thought itself almost made him laugh!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing the sandwiches, he lay down on the mattress and prepared for another isolated evening. And probably night too, unless Mel did actually come back. Then again, what if he risked contacting someone or venturing outside? He usually quelled those urges relatively quickly, but would caution prevail on this occasion?</span></div></div>",

You must feel honored, Mr. President!\" <i>Honored</i>... as if...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former president lifted his head to see the beautiful and alluring body of his master approaching him with the loud and stable clack of her ornamented boots as she entered the room. This Keryxian, like practically every other female of her species, was just as visually stunning as the spokescreature that he allowed to show her soles to the world... dooming every male without a foot fetish in the world to a merciless and spontaneous death. \"Good evening, by the way\" she said in the elegant manner he'd grown used to hear as she sat in the floating throne-shaped chair right in front of him, not really expecting an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard the soft humming of the advanced Keryxian machinery as both her chair and the construct holding him twisted and turned to take another position, eventually making his \"cage\" end up looking more like a rather simple, yet elegant desk, while forcing his face to stick out on the lower part of it, a motion Joseph had also grown used to. Once the construct was finished adjusting, he saw the now bare feet of his master getting closer to his helpless face, to which he simply responded by closing his eyes, and accepting the perfect and soft touch of her flawless keryxian soles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaah~\" Joseph heard her moan in approval as she wriggled her dainty toes over his eyelids. \"You wouldn't believe how much I needed that today\" She told him as she accommodated herself into her regular position, bringing her delicate hands to the holographic keyboard displayed in front of her. \"It had been so peaceful for the last few weeks but today it was nothing but reports of rebels running to their deaths all day. I believe they tried to organize some sort of attack, but they didn't really do much. Turns out our human agents are quite capable at using the equipment we gave them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Keryxian continued to casually tell him about her day as if he was one of her closest friends, all the while writing almost automatically on her computer and sliding her rather sweaty and delicious-smelling soles all over his face. Despite having a striking similarity to humans, Keryxian's feet proved to be sweatier, often times dragging some beads of their sweat and dripping the floor a bit as they took their shoes off. This sweat however, while smelling definitely stronger than a human's, was not exactly unpleasant, even if the salty properties of human sweat remained, Keryxian's foot sweat tended to be filled with high levels of pheromones that made whoever come in contact with it practically addicted. These properties, combined with the fact that Keryxian's skin was essentially perfect and smooth as silk, made it easier for them to rub their feet on their slaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But all in all, I am glad that I can finally come to archive these files and have some time with my precious foot slave\" the Keryxian said pausing in her typing to pinch his nose with her toes and look down at him with a warm smile. He realized that he didn't hear almost anything of what she said previously for being so focused on the delight of having her feet all over his face, but he didn't worry too much since she usually didn't confirm that he listened at all, despite the fact that she always bothered to speak to him in his language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he did indeed tend to listen to whatever this beautiful alien said from time to time, Joseph knew full well that he was not allowed to say a word in response anyway unless she told him to, which was not often, so he mostly just reduced himself to smell her delightful feet and let his face be used however she saw fit, because even if he was simply considered as her property, she did seem to care for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally finished writing and started stretching a bit, taking her feet away from his face for a moment. He looked back at her wondering what could cause her to remove her feet, especially considering this was not normal in her behavior. Once he looked up he got to see her darkened eyes illuminated simply by her bright blue irises stare back at him firmly, fiddling with her hair as she pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know?\" She finally spoke \"You have proved to be a rather adequate slave. You haven't resisted me and have obeyed my every command ever since your very first day as my property. Usually it takes a bit of force to break my slaves into submission, especially since rulers tend to be quite proud and self-willed, which makes me get tired of them quite quickly... but you were not, you were very accepting\" Her beautiful lips twist into an enticing grin as she looks back at the door from where she entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back at you she raised her foot above his expecting face again \"Say your oath\" she commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I am nothing more than my master's property<br>\r\neverything required of me shall involve only my master and her feet<br>\r\nI will not service anyone else, for my master owns me completely<br>\r\nI am forever bound to Mistress Dasillia, current ruler and overseer of my former nation\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about this oath felt odd to him every time he said it, almost as if she made it personally and specifically for him, nevertheless he uttered this automatically, and he heard Dasillia chuckle when he finished \"Good bo... slave! Good slave\" she said correcting herself... \"Did she just stutter?\" Joseph asked himself, but every thought about it disappeared as she immediately forced her toes inside his mouth, allowing his tongue to dance all over those precious and salty violet toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, you belong only to me and nobody else! And for being so loyal I shall grant you a reward\" she said in her elegant accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA reward? Knowing the Keryxians he knew that whatever passed as a reward from them usually meant being shackled to Keryxian slavery, which he was already part of, even if he only served this single Keryxian unlike other slaves, but still he had already licked her soles, sucked her toes, served as a foot rest, kissed her feet, etc. He thought for a moment about her wanting to negotiate your freedom, but shove off the thought at the unlikeliness of it. What, then, could be this so called reward?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few laps of his tongue taking all of her foot sweat she finally continued: \"I probably shouldn't do this, but I suppose I will...\"</span></div></div>",

Why would I do that when you are the perfect slave? Tell me your oath again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I am nothing more than my master's property<br>\r\neverything required of me shall involve only my master and her feet<br>\r\nI will not service anyone else, for my master owns me completely<br>\r\nI am forever bound to Mistress Dasillia, current ruler and overseer of my former nation!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he said the words, he felt stupid for even considering such a notion! As if Mistress Dasillia would allow that to happen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again,\" She commanded you, allowing you to pause from your subservient foot licking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe repeated the oath, several times over. By the fourth time, he felt more inferior to the Keryxian than ever. She made a thoughtful noise, as if mulling something over. \"The fact that you thought about your freedom, just for that moment there does make me doubt you. Do you deserve a reward, slave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore answering, he chose his words carefully. Instead of giving her an apology or well-constructed rhetoric - he used to be so good with words when president after all - he repeated the oath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made her nod with approval and smile widely. \"Good slave! OK, it is now time for your reward...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMistress Dasillia suddenly slid her feet away from him, which made Joseph admittedly miss them. She pushed a button on a remote device that immediately removed the bars of his cage. \"Crawl out, slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did so, gulping and feeling his legs unused to actually being used. For the past three months, he had been confined to this desk and apart from serving his Master, had only had the most basic human functions. Once he had made his way into the middle of the room, one of Mistress Dasilia's violet feet pressed gently on the back of his head to stop him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strip,\" she commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith trembling, aching fingers, he did so, slipping off his shirt, trousers, shoes and socks until you're just in your underwear. Embarrassingly, Joseph realised that your penis was quite erect. He had been licking her soles to be fair! The beautiful alien viewed him with amusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have let yourself become soft and dumpy,\" she remarked - not in a spiteful way but almost in affection. \"The perfect human male should be exactly like you. The more subservient and honoured you are to be at my feet, the better your thoughts sound. Sometimes you project beautiful melodies and sweet tones from your weak, basic mind. But other times, there is discord and disharmony. I don't like that.\" She said, wrinkling her nose and lifting one foot up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise, the foot came down not on his face, but over his crotch. Immediately, Joseph let out a whimper and closed his eyes with how good her sole felt against his hard on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say your oath, slave,\" Mistress Dasillia commanded him in a voice that sounded almost excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I am n-nothing more than...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former president began reading out his mantra, as the Keryxian slowly slid her silky smooth sole against his shaft, throbbing from beneath his underpants. Once he was done, he let out a whimper, feeling so turned on yet inferior to her at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again!\" She said, wiggling her toes so they tapped against his hard-on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe barely make it to the second line as he let out a cry of ecstasy, his dick shooting out its load with so much velocity that his lower body lurched, spasming several times over. Vast quantities of semen were projected into and out of his shorts, drenching him in his own cum. Your Master wiped her sole casually onto his legs until she was satisfied that it was clean enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying flat on his back, arms at his side and a giddy feeling about him, Joseph hazily gazed up at Mistress Dasillia, a beatific look about her as she stared down at him through her shining blue eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love that sound,\" she purred. \"The sound of your thoughts right now is bliss to my ears!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe promptly left him on the floor, passed out with excitement and pleasure, still spread-eagled there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe woke up some time later.

How was this possible?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had given it some thought and after awhile he came to a likely conclusion.  He had not seen the broadcast that had shown the world the Keryxian soles.  His theory was that if a man saw an image of those soles and did not have a foot fetish they would instantly turn to ash.  The image of those soles would randomly be played on the official state television meaning those who had missed it, or tuned in to see what was going on would be turned to dust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that knowledge he never watched television again.

All of them had to get away before the all female state police found them and began their interrogation.  They were never gentle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had the place surrounded though and so all of the rebels scattered to the four winds.  Along with Pete was a woman who fiercely believed in equality.  Her name was Lucy and she was a petite woman with red hair.  And he loved her.  Pete had met her just two months ago but her courage and dedication to the cause was without equal.  She was a girl 3 years younger than him who could have a life of ease and luxury but had chosen to take a stand for principle.  He would do anything to make sure she escaped.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete and Lucy ran on and a bright searchlight lit the area.  A female state police officer brandished her taser.  What were you going to do?  </span></div></div>",

Only it sprayed water; that was immediately evident when she doused you again, submerging you once more. With a 'clink', the end of the gun suddenly morphed into a red ring, glowing brightly. This must have been one of the latest technologies Pete had heard of: guns with multiple settings: water, flames, bullets, wood, electricity, red hot poker...almost anything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name, dog?\" The officer asked him coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pete Drew,\" he answered immediately. He was by no means a coward, but having heard horror stories of the torture that could be inflicted by FemFoot officers, it would be plain stupid to lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good start,\" the woman said commandingly. Shaking his head a little to allow more water to drip off his face, her form came into focus. She had short black hair, styled into a bob, sharp features - almost alien like - and was clearly tall and powerful, at least 6 foot 2 or so. Her lithe, slender form was adorned with the standard officer's uniform: a tight-fitting black body suit, complete with steel-capped boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Stacy Firth,\" she stated. \"And I am here to interrogate you. We know from our records that you are a rebel, who has chosen to abandon the FemFoot principles. Why a pathetic dog like you isn't gratefully serving the feet of its superiors is incomprehensible to me.\" Her nostrils flared angrily as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete's heart skipped a beat; she did not realise that you didn't have a foot fetish?! Would this be of any benefit to him, Pete pondered to yourself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me tell you a secret,\" Stacy walked over to him, making him  tremble slightly as she smirked down at him, while he lay on the floor. \"I <i>love</i> torturing wimpy foot lovers like you. I know that I can inflict unbearable pain upon you with this...\" She raised up her gun, but then - rather surprisingly - placed it on the floor and kicked it neatly away. \"But I much prefer to break men psychologically. You and I both know that your place, your destiny in this world, is to be a foot licker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gulped. The idea of kissing or licking feet, no matter how attractive the woman, was simply repulsive to you - even though he'd lived in this FemFoot world for three months now, he had never found feet even remotely attractive. In fact, they seemed even more disgusting now than ever considering the world has been ruined by the adoration of female feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly began to hoist himself up to his feet, but Stacy used one boot to firmly push against his chest, pinning him effortlessly to the wall behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I say you could move, dog?\" She growled at Pete. \"Now as I was saying, I <i>could</i> hurt you. A lot. But I'm going to give you a chance - well a treat really. Shuffling her foot around, she nifty removed the boot, then after dropping the footwear to the ground with a thud, placed a bare foot just in front of your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stench is utterly rank and putrid: aromas of damp leather and blue cheese collide as they invaded the man's senses; it took a huge effort not to gag!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now lick my foot, slave. Lick it and surrender to me and the FemFoot principles, and I may be able to eventually allow you to be a compliant slave for someone, after you've worked for me of course...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of licking the rancid-smelling foot made him want to vomit, but Stacy terrified you...what on earth would she do if he refused her?!</span></div></div>",

Closing his eyes, he leaned forward slightly, steeling himself to place it on her sole, but the smell became more intense. It was too much!

How is that possible? I thought we had stamped out all of the unworthy males.

What would be the point in lying - it would only prompt him in seeing the soles, which would absolutely be the end of him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is interesting!\" She said, a smile spreading on her face, making her cheekbones even more pronounced. \"I haven't met a non-foot fetish male for over two months! Are there more of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Honestly - not that I know of at least,\" Pete replied earnestly as her eyebrows raised. \"There are others, but not like me - only women and foot fetish males who have chosen to rebel...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled at you. \"Why on earth should I believe you, dog?\" Before he could answer she held a hand in front of him, then continued. \"So...hmmm...maybe there is a use for you after all....\" Her pupils flickered rapidly, as through a plan was shaping and developing in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The FemFoot rulers in each area - they have decreed that ALL non-fetish males must be exterminated immediately: that was a direct order from the Keryxian after all,\" Stacy said matter-of-factly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...please,\" he found yourself whining up at her. \"Please don't kill me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't have to - I'll just get an image of the Keryxian soles...\" She smiled malovently. \"Or, or - you could work for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConflicted feelings build inside of Pete Drew. Was he that desperate to live that he would turn on his friends, on Lucy - his sweetheart...? Weighing it up, he decided that he had to stay alive at all costs - that way, there was a chance of fleeing or at least trying to save Lucy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't decided: you present a dilemma to me - keeping you alive is a great risk...\" The dominant officer says thoughtfully, making Pete realise the matter was out of his hands completely - she now decided his fate!</span></div></div>",

All Pete could do was whimper under her nasty sole as she pulled out a small remote control and selected a button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I were you, dog, I'd be licking away at the sole which is infinitely more important in this life than you will ever be: you never know - it could spark an appreciation of female feet in you, which could save you...\" With that she chuckled before all four walls became lit up with a white screen, which was suddenly filled with images of the Keryxian's bare soles...!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurrender engulfed you as your tongue lapped desperately away at Stacy's admittedly soft but repulsive-tasting, long and thin sole. Your eyes closed quickly, but she expertly used her toes to roll the lids up so they were wide open again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfflfleassee...\" You whimpered as you licked, but it was too late. As your eyes latched onto the light purple tone of the Keryxian soles, you had to admit how flawless they were.

Right in front of him was the state officer who would be conducting his interrogation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was on the tall side, around 5 foot 10.  Her voluptuous figure was quite impressive.  She had slightly too much meat on her to be a model in the 21st century but no one would have ever called her fat.  She had shoulder length black hair and brown eyes.  He complexion was light brown indicating that was of Hispanic descent from one of her parents.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer uniform was form fitting and ended in a pair of heavy boots.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pete Drew, unregistered male.

The technology we have been given by the Keryxians... well it makes our old interrogation techniques look quite quaint.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was terrified, he didn't want to be tortured.

They only left men alive who had a foot fetish.  Those men are to be enslaved and to serve feet for the rest of their lives.  This is backward thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope flared within his soul.  Maybe he wasn't going to die!  Maybe she was actually part of the resistance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What fun is it to have a foot slave that LIKES feet?

Her foot was lowered right over his face causing the smell to intensify.  He hated doing this.  It was so humiliating.  But what choice did he have?

His nose was planted right in the middle of the sole.  He breathed out of his mouth in a desperate attempt to minimize the smell.

If he didn't obey the consequences would be dire.  He pushed your tongue forward and took his first lick of her sweaty foot.  That taste was awful.  It was salty and gross.  He imagined it tasted similar to licking mouldy cheese that someone had dumped a container of salt over it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt sick to his stomach.  It was so damned awful.  He wasn't even sure he could force himself to continue.  Fear can be a powerful motivator though...</span></div></div>",

She gave a content sigh and picked up her newsreader and began scrolling through the stories of the day.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't dare stop licking her feet.

I want you to fear and tremble before me like the worm you are!\" With an evil glint in her eye, Kim suddenly swiped one bare foot across his face. The soft centre of her sole made a surprisingly firm smacking sound against his cheek, while the toe nails scraped mercilessly against the skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" He gasped, only for her to use the same foot to whack across the other side of his face. The sheer force of this caused him to stumble and trip to the floor, his back flat against the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beg me for mercy, slave,\" Kim said, grinning wickedly at him, one bare sole hovering over his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, p-please!\" He whined up pathetically at her, his face still smarting from her forceful blows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! I love dominating you, knowing how much you don't like feet! You are a mistake, an abberation in this world: a man who does not hold complete admiration for female feet. You should be dust, yet here you are. Beneath my bare foot. All mine!\" She had pure delight spread over her features as she lowered her powerful sole down so it crushed into your helpless face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Pete could even splutter into her smooth yet strong skin, Kim's other bare foot suddenly raised up and pushes firmly into the other side of his face, obscuring it completely and making it more than difficult to breathe. Any sound he attempted to make was muffled by her bare feet. Without warning, both feet quickly left his trembling face, only for them to come crashing down against it, making him whimper and caused a few tears to spring from his eyes. The sheer intensity of the pungent stench would be enough to make him vomit, if gravity would briefly suspend itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, slave. Take my feet and let them crush your pathetic face. This is your life from now on: being forced to smell and taste my feet! Knowing you don't have a foot fetish...\" She giggled, sliding her feet around a little yet maintaining her balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's play a game...\" She smirked before finally stepping off him.

The usually stale, cheesy smell seemed to be obscured by something...dirt and mud! Her soles were completely covered in dirt, so that he could barely see even a slither of skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lick all the dirt off my feet in two minutes or less, or I will make the next challenge harder!\" She said, gradually descending her soles down on to his reluctant mouth...</span></div></div>",

Her job as a document clerk was by no means a desirable or exciting position and she often found herself reflecting about the meeting with the Keryxian and the foundation of the FemFoot World, which inevitably led her to conclude why she had chosen to accept such a boring career. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been one of the few rebellious women to survive the clash with the aliens and their human followers. At the time of the Keryxian crisis, she and her family were spending their holidays in Paris and it was there that her father succumbed to the sight of the spokescreature's feet; turned into a mere pile of ash before her eyes. Her brother, Kaito, managed to survive but it soon became clear that the newcomers would not rest until all men on the planet were either enslaved or dead. Paris was the epicenter of the female resistance, which she was eager to join. Her mother, however, insisted that she return to Japan as soon as possible, leaving her revenge to a later date, an advice that proved to be ominously wise, as the following day the capital of France had been rendered lifeless. The buildings, the vehicles, the objects... they were all intact, but no people remained in the city, no evidence pointing to what might have happened. There was, at the time, the theory that French resistance warriors had fled to rendezvous with other rebel forces. Over time, more and more towns started to become desolate; very few battles were actually fought between the rebels and the Keryxian, but from the weapons and technology they used on the battlefield, it was clear the aliens had the means and the motive to cause those mass disappearances. How they did it remains yet a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was certain is that the Keryxian won the battle for Earth effortlessly, imposing their new world order, hoarding as many humans as possible into what was previously called North America. The resulting nation was renamed FemFoot World, with its Capital City in Nevada. Isumi, like thousands of people, were coerced into migrating to the Capital City. But her revenge remained yet to be enacted. She knew that were many men and female rebels still at large and that, by decree from the government of FemFoot World, courts were now tasked with investigating the whereabouts of these so-called 'criminals'. She took a job at the local courthouse so she could destroy this inquisition from the inside out. By destroying and redacting intelligence reports that came from the police she could prevent a case from even reaching the judge's ears. She could edit evidence reports and steal proofs to protect her fellow rebels from conviction. She could even make up evidence to keep the courts busy with fake cases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she had to be careful. If there was even a suspicion that she was interfering with the judicial system, she could be in for a huge trouble. She had heard rumors about what the state does to traitors... some say the police will seldom hand over criminals to the Keryxian. And only heaven knows what those aliens might do with their prisoners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, she had been given the case file of a man called Pete Drew. For all she knew, he had already been captured by the authorities. But perhaps she could do something for him, tidy up his legal process, get him a decent cell. She resumed her work until the end of the shift. As she gathered her things and prepared to leave, she was suddenly stopped by... </span></div></div>",

Whenever his friends hollered about a large pair of boobs that passed by all he could do was nod and laugh halfheartedly. Even though no one suspected his fetish, he felt a little embarrassed that he was looking elsewhere. But that all seemed irrelevant as state police dragged him out of his home at gunpoint, slapped handcuffs on him and chucked into a van with a couple dozen other men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf way through the trip a screen flickered into view. It was the Keryxian, and her long soles. Nobody had a chance to close their eyes, everyone was staring intently into them. He was losing himself, and he didn't mind at all. His eyes followed a bead of sweat as it trickled from in between her big and second toe, down the arch and dripped off the heel. He imagined catching with his tongue as the Keryxian would look down at him, steely eyed and content with his obedience. He longed to bury his face in her pillowy soles. After what seemed like forever the screen blacked out. A horror gripped him as he looked around. Every other prisoner had become a pile of steaming ash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors swung open and a tall, red-headed guard sighed at the ashes. \"Ugh!\" she exclaimed \" this van is filthy now!\" She then spotted Brent: \"Looks like we've got a slave. And a cute one...\" She grabbed his cheek and inspected him, before putting a collar around his neck. She yanked him out and he tumbled onto the floor. The officers glared down at him. The red head who held his collar spoke to another officer who was examining a clipboard. \"So what who are we assigning him to? He looks to be about grade-4 slave, the best quality we've seen all week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon a minute of reflection, the other officer said:</span></div></div>",

He couldn't believe they had died in front of him without him noticing. He was put into the custody of the red head, she forced him onto a motorbike to deliver him to the other embassy slaves in Nevada, which came into your view after half an hour of riding. After watching your town be raided and pillaged of men you expected Nevada to be a hell-hole, but to your surprise, it seemed very clean and organised. And there was no rubble or debris on the streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParking at a coffee shop, the officer kicked him off the bike and tied him to a lamppost along with his warrant so that nobody would steal him as she ate lunch. He watched her walk in and pick up a huge sandwich, he hadn't eaten since your capture. He turned away, unable to watch her eat. She didn't care he were out there, taking her time to relax. After 20 minutes of waiting with your rumbling stomach, a couple joggers noticed him and stopped. Two blondes with wide smiles. \"About time! Why don't we take this loser?\" One asked, the other knelt down and read your warrant. \"We can't.\" She responded \"According to this he's going straight to the Keryxians!\" The joggers looked at each other with smirks. They instinctively took off their shoes and began wiping the grimy foot sweat onto your face, without socks their feet were soaked. Taking advantage of this, he moved his face around, letting them smother every inch of his face with their wet feet. His cooperation egged them on and they demanded you lick. Brent obeyed and push his tongue against their soles, lapping the sweat away. This continued for 10 minutes until they put their shoes on and strolled away laughing. One of them called back \"You're welcome!\" Brent watched them leave until he looked up to notice the red-head looming over you. She dropped a small crust for him to eat. She told him that she was watching, and that he had earned the crust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should know\" She began \"the Keryxians have very high standards, they expect you to be not only totally obedient, but also grateful for every second in their presence.

And how dominant the women are of course,\" she finished rather pompously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrent gulped. The idea of actually meeting the aliens who had forced Earth to become a FemFoot World filled him with both excitement and utter fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't take that risk. Not yet anyway. Any sign of defiance could completely compromise our control over you pathetic men! When you are ready, you could get the privilege to serve some of the most important female feet in the country, before the Keryxian grace us with their presence! Submit fully and happily and you could become the best slave around!\" She smirked at him, clearly enjoying seeing him squirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, Brent was more than intrigued. Having never fully embraced your foot fetish before, he realised this was your chance to experience it properly, to celebrate it! He had never indulged in licking or kissing bare feet, other than the two pretty blondes who you had met just minutes ago. He found yourself actually wanting to prove how good a slave you could be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please - I will be a good slave. I want to worship women's feet,\" he gushed at her, making her chuckle a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You certainly are a compliant one!\" The officer told him. \"I think I'll train you myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she firmly gripped him by the scruff of the neck and took him back on her bike. Racing along the road, he still had doubts about your future. Sure, he would get to worship feet, but life as an actual slave? What about your family, having a girlfriend, or a career, friends...would he have to just accept that these things would cease to exist? The thought scared him, though it was strangely comforting to think that his only real responsibility would be to service female feet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at a police station, she led him past a line of cells. Glancing across, Brent saw a whole variety of men: a whole mixture ages and ethnicities. Some looked terrified, some completely humbled. So this was where the surviving foot fetish males were kept...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just a fraction of the men who survived the Keryxian soles,\" the redhead officer explained, as if reading his mind. \"Those who prove undying loyalty and complete submission will be allowed to live as slaves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking you to a small room, the officer sat behind a desk, while you stood apprehensively in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, slave to be. The first part of your training is to see how comfortable your face feels. Lie down on the floor so I can place my feet on your face...\"</span></div></div>",

The first step of the training was smell endurance, he spent hours with your head trapped in a box stuffed with socks, sometimes she would slip her sweaty feet in, blasting his face in the intense odor. After a couple days the smell couldn't make you flinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe training went on like this, Ruby found creative ways to erase any possible resistance he could put up. She made him conditioned to the taste of feet by infusing your food with sweat, invited other officers to trample him to make him a sturdier footstool. But maybe what made the biggest impact, was the FemFoot propaganda he was forced to watch. After the 3 months were up, Brent felt like someone ironed out your brain. He dreamed of feet every night and found himself thinking about them constantly. Maybe he needed to get away or have a break. This was getting intense. But it was too late for that, he was being driven to the embassy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe embassy was filled with odd looking installments that you thought was Keryxian art. Ruby handed her collar over to the embassy slave handler and offered her goodbye. \"You'd better remember what I taught you foot worm, speak and serve when told to. Otherwise you stay silent no matter what! Not as much as a murmer.\" She strolled out, the state was happy with how she treated you, and became a head slave trainer on the force. You wondered if she would think about you as you were strung along to the committee room. A bright light engulfed the room, when it faded, the Keryxian stood, in a glittering purple ceremonial gown. As you were under the table, all you could see was many pairs of uniform platforms, headed off by the Keryxian's glorious boots that seemed hard to look away from, almost hypnotic...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meeting began, it seemed like boring platitudes and politics until... </span></div></div>",

He was responsible for organising the Keryxian meeting. Having survived looking at the Keryxian soles, we know that he must have a foot fetish. But what happens to him after that fateful day?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Kayleigh Simmonds</b>: the journalist who wrote the negative article about the Keryxian meeting. She was supposedly rounded up with other \"rebels\", but what happened to her since? Is she even still alive?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Seth Spider</b>: a man with a foot fetish who has been protected and kept secret by his girlfriend, Melanie. He is 25 years old, long black hair, good looking, but living in constant fear with no one else to converse with other than his girlfriend. What does the future hold for him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Melanie Andrews</b>: Seth's girlfriend who decided to keep him away from the FemFoot authorities. Attractive, long blond hair and tanned, Mel is loyal to her boyfriend. But does protecting him for so long start to take its toll?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Pete Drew</b>: somehow this man has managed to avoid the Keryxian soles for three months: that's right - he doesn't have a foot fetish! He has a loving girlfriend Lucy, who he is determined to protect. But can he really survive for long in this new world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lucy</b>: Pete's girlfriend. Fiercely loyal red head who lives with Pete along with other rebels who have rejected the FemFoot principles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Brent Potts</b>: an eighteen year old who was enslaved quickly. He has a foot fetish and hasn't indulged in his love for feet before. Having been told he is a \"grade 4\" slave, does he fulfil his potential?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Andrew Vellot</b>: Another young foot fetish enthusiast that has managed to avoid capture. He is 22 years old, seemingly of latino descent, and has joined the human rebellion to try and release his planet from the keryxian dictatorship one way or another. While being quite capable of defending himself, he is by no means eager to participate in violence, using it only when completely necessary, a condition that has ensured him his position in an infiltration squad among the rebels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Karla Vellot</b>: Andrew's younger sister. She is only younger than Andrew by 2 years, but tends to behave more like a teenager, always taking any opportunity to tease and bother her brother. While she is indeed thankful that her brother didn't disintegrate like so many other males, she refused to openly admit it and instead opted to pick playfully on her brother about anything, but more recently about his fetish. Other than that she tends to contrast rather well with Andrew, while he is often discreet and meticulous, Karla is more direct and rushed, which is why she was assigned to a strike team after joining the rebels along her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>FemFoot authorities</b>:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Stacy</b>:a FemFoot officer who is a passionate supporter of the FemFoot principles. She loves to capture and torture rebels!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Kim</b>: another officer who loves the idea of making a non-fetish male into a slave, knowing he won't enjoy it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mistress Ruby</b>: the redheaded officer who trains Brent Potts personally.

He is 22 years old, seemingly of latino descent, and has joined the human rebellion to try and release his planet from the kyryxian dictatorship one way or another.

She is only younger than Andrew by 2 years, but tends to behave more like a teenager, always taking any opportunity to tease and bother her brother.

The feet licker extraordinaire~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do realize I am not the only guy here with a foot fetish right?!\" He said in a semi-yell manner, all that teasing from his sister had really gotten into his nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe but you are the only one here who is worth annoying!\" Karla replied in child-like way which showed no remorse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree months had passed since the <i>Keryxian soles</i> incident, and Andew Vellot had managed to avoid capture like most of the men here among the ranks of the human rebels. He had found himself a steady position as an infiltrator, and got to spend his days in relative freedom... a freedom that required him to stay in constant vigil and partake in some risky operations involving the Keryxian embassy and random groups of survivors, but freedom nonetheless, which was more than could be said about most of the surviving men in the planet. At least right now he was able to relax for a change... or he would if his visiting sister wasn't so pushy about his foot fetish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we really have to go through this every time we see each other, Karla?\" He asked her as he calmed himself down, to which she responded with a simple shrug, a playful smile and \"Would you rather be licking some purple alien soles all day instead?\" A question that quickly got him blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No waaaaay~ You really would huh?\" Karla commented as she noticed the darkened skin tone on your cheeks and threw herself to force-hug you. The Keryxian were perfect beings indeed, and he fantasized about licking the feet of at least one of them quite often ever since he saw the \"soles of enlightenment\" as the authorities called them, but of course he was not willing to give away his freedom and become some alien piece of furniture or a slave just to get a taste of those perfect-looking soles. \"Oh no~! My big bro's uncontrolled lust for feet will condemn him to a life of slavery one of these days! Whatever shall I do~?\" she continued in her mocking tone and acting as if she was a worried mother, so he simply pushed her off of you as you heard her burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I hadn't my foot fetish I would be nothing but ash, and you <b>know</b> that\" he returned, annoyed again at her persistence on making him feel uncomfortable, to which Karla shrugged again. \"I don't know~ lots of folks here don't have a foot fetish\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lots?\" He asked rising an eyebrow to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe not lots but...\" she paused grabbing her arm \"Dammit Andrew, do you always have to be such a party pooper?\" she finally said as she threw her arms into the air and let herself fall directly onto the floor to sit. \"Finally a moment of quiet\" he thought to himself with a smug smile that quickly vanished. Despite her annoying comments, his usual sense of victory after finally making her shut up wasn't there, in fact, achieving that this time felt quite wrong. He never enjoyed seeing his sister upset, only as annoyed as she made him be, but he quickly realized that what she was feeling right now from her verbal defeat is not annoyance, but genuine concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any news from mom or dad?\" she asked in a very different mood from a few moments ago. This question made you realize that all her joking around is mostly done to help her get a grasp on the past when she would tease him about other things before knowing about his foot fetish. As much as this annoyed him -especially when she did it in front of others- this was her way to take her negative thoughts away from his current situation... even if the current situation caused her to know about his fetish to begin with, and even if you didn't like to be the main target of her distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" He responded, resigned to his realization, sitting next to her on the floor and staring at the same void his sister was suddenly staring at. \"We had some transmissions from some desperate non-foot fetish group of fellas that almost got caught, but we got to them in time and managed to fight our way through, so there's that.\" He said without wanting to mention to her about the new weapons the Keryxian had given to their human agents, and the losses that surprise had caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to lighten up the mood he nudge her ribs lightly before saying \"Maybe you can find a guy for you in that group\" with a gentle chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarla seemed to catch up on your attempts to cheer her up and nudged him back with a slight smile on her lips. \"Well it's not like I mind your kind or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh <b>my kind</b> is it?\" You responded in a jokingly fake-angry tone \"So we are aliens like the Keryxian now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarla chuckles \"I don't know, <b>are</b> you?! Maybe you were all replaced with feet-loving clones to fulfill the Keryxian demands!\" she said playing along. Her remarks made absolutely no sense, but at least she was smiling again, and that was reason enough for him to do so as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSooner rather than later he found yourself quite relaxed as he had a genuinely good conversation with his sister which, given recent events, he hadn't been able to in quite a while. They both started talking about your assignments in their corresponding teams, the lives they'd saved due to their efforts, their plans for when all of this is over, and generally other positive stuff, but before anyone even noticed, night fell over the camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, we were talking for that long huh?\" Karla remarked, looking outside their tent. Time certainly flew by as they enjoyed each other's company as siblings for the first time in quite a while, and looking outside it seems like the rest of the host was getting ready for bed time while the assigned sentries changed places with the previous ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp, I guess I should be heading for my tent then\" Karla said as she started getting up again, but for some reason the thought of his sister leaving so suddenly after such a pleasant conversation struck him like lightning, after all, she was one of the few people who he truly trusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really have to go?\" He asked with a stern look on his face, not revealing his wish of her keeping him company for a little longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, judging by what the captain told us earlier, tomorrow is going to be important so she wanted everyone available as soon as she rang the alarm. Now, I don't know when that's gonna be but my tent section is definitely closer to her than yours. Besides, judging by what <b>you</b> told me, you are in a similar situation about all the info gathering mambo jumbo\" She responded, letting him know the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCertainly both of them had their duties and had to fulfill them no matter what, but would it really hurt to convince her to stay here so they both could chat yourselves to sleep? If she left now, they would probably not see each other for quite some time again.</span></div></div>",

With that they waved each other goodbye until Karla got lost in the sea of people from the host as she got further away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at this scene took him back to the reality of your situation. Most of these rebels were females and, while it certainly doesn't bother him to have plenty of eye candy around, he couldn't help but feel disturbed at the fact that he was one of the few remaining males on the planet. After a long sigh he finally returned to his tent and forced himself to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was woken by an incessant beeping coming from his trusty multi-tool device, a small wrist-watch sized machine that had proven to be quite handy for whatever task you need it for, being able to fulfill every task usually done by computer thanks to its holographic display. As thankful as he was for this device he couldn't help but feel a grudge towards it for also serving as an alarm clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a swift move of his arm you reach for your MTD to turn it off right before getting up with a jump. <i>Today is important.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had received valuable information about higher ranking keryxians coming down to earth for a formal gathering at the embassy, but further information was still held by his own superiors. All he needed to know was that your team was supposed to infiltrate the building, locate a specific target (which was still unknown to you and the rest of your team), capture it and bring it to the host as discreetly as possible, if every attempt at doing this unnoticed failed, there were strike teams at the ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurely enough he got geared and armed up rather quickly and make haste to the pre-mission reunion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright ladies, listen up!\" He heard his captain yell, not failing to amuse him on her choice of words. \"As you may know, some fancy-panties aliens are coming down to earth to pay her friends at the embassy a visit! It is your task, no, your OBLIGATION, to infiltrate that building and take the priority target that each of your teams will be assigned.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are more than a few targets\" he thought to yourself, realizing why your superiors hadn't been more specific before. \"Each of your lieutenants will be granted with the characteristics and details on the target your teams will be in charge of. It is of the utmost importance that you all focus only on your own targets, we cannot risk disorganization.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the major continued giving the briefing, Andrew could not help but wonder how they managed to get information on such targets, especially considering that just a week ago he was struggling to even find a new place to locate the host without the Keryxian noticing (or bothering to follow) but, like many other minor things, he simply brushed the thought off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe briefing ends and the major is given a few minutes with the lieutenants for the target assignments, once that's done he saw his lieutenant approach the team rather wide-eyed. \"Is... something wrong, Lt?\" He heard one of his squad mates ask, to which the lieutenant responded by simply raising her head, standing straight, and speaking with a proud (if nervous) voice: \"Ladies!...And gentleman\" she comments pointing at him with her head \"If we are victorious on this mission, this will prove to be our most successful day since the start of the rebellion!\" She paused to let her words sink in for a while and you noticed everyone seemed to be cheering up already \"Every team has been assigned with an important target, yes, but I am honored to say that we may well become  the backbone of operations from here on out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit teasing boss! Just tell us!\" He heard another high pitched voice yell from the background. He had to admit that, if this was to be considered an army, it would not be a very disciplined one. Sure, everyone did their best to take the rebellion forward, but more often than not, the lack of military expertise was clearly shown among the ranks of these rebels and even himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another pause and a wide smile the lieutenant finally announced: \"We are the ones in charge of capturing the main overseer Keryxian.\" The tent was immediately flooded with cheers from his squadmates and others in the group as if victory was already achieved. He did start to wonder (and worry a little) about how legitimate the sources for this information were, but like many times before he rolled with it and decide to stay quiet, after all, his team had just been chosen to partake in a very important task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everyone was done getting ready for the mission the vans start getting of their way to the Keryxian embassy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis squad in particular was in charge of allowing safe passage to the rest of the team, scouting ahead, getting probes for easy access and bypassing basic security commands. It sounded simple enough considering that many of them had already had some experience fiddling with Keryxian technology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally arrived at the embassy and noticed that there was still no alien ship nearby, which meant that his squad still had plenty of time to set things up right. He was simply given orders on how to proceed, which sections to cover, and was quickly dismissed, allowing every single one of them to do their jobs. Everything seemed to be going just fine, but you couldn't help but feel that something was still a little odd about all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alpha sector, clear.\" \"Beta, sector, clear.\" Andrew heard the voices of his squadmates report consecutively of their success rather quickly, they had all entered this place just a few minutes ago and they had already fulfilled their roles. On and on he heard the transmissions of other squadmates who had covered their duties until he are the only one left to finish. \"Roger that, team. Begin your return to the vans so that we may proceed with the rest of the plan\" He hear dthe voice of a superior say through the radio, but nobody responded which, given the stealthy nature of the mission it didn't surprise him... but then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo feminine plated figures wielding some sort of halberds dropped from the ceiling. It was a trap! He reached for your communicator to quickly warn the others but soon he realized that every outgoing communication from you has been blocked. \"Lieutenant? Lieutenant, can you hear me? Hello?! Team?!\" He yelled at his device while the plated figures continued to approach you slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is useless, human! You, like the rest of your pathetic team have been tricked into the first phase of our trap!\" One of the armored figure said. As they finally come out of the shadows he managed to see the details on their armor. Pure white plates covering their chests, forearms, lower legs, and topping it all off with a rather elegant helmet that covered their faces from the nose up. This design seemed to cover only the vital areas while leaving some free space for mobility, revealing their perfect purple skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you done to them?!\" He shouted to the aliens while rising his arms at the sight of their weapons, which made one respond automatically with a disturbingly amused tone in her voice \"The same thing we do to the unworthy and ungrateful.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew what she was talking about, but Andrew didn't want to believe it... the rest of his squad was nothing more than ashes now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But don't worry, we did not expect a male to form part of their ranks\" One of them said, still pointing her advanced-looking halberd at him. \"Indeed\" The other one continued \"We might actually spare you if you behave, but first we have to confirm something\" and with that one of the Keryxians twists some controls on her helmet to project in front of them all a holographic image of the broadcast of \"The soles of enlightenment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his current situation you can't help but be mesmerized by the perfect soles of the spokeswoman as he re-watched this, seeing the familiar drop of sweat from between her big and second toes fall teasingly to her heel. Soon the transmission ended and he saw the Keryxian guards smile at each other knowingly. \"You are worthy indeed\" one of them says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you do as we say, you will not only be spared, but you will get to be one of our slaves here in the embassy\" The other one informed him with a rather wide smile. \"We may lend you to our higher ranking human officers, but most of the time you would be servicing the embassy guard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-**** go-****** is he********s\" He heard his communication device go crazy with static, realizing that these Keryxian had now blocked incoming transmissions as well, probably to not let him be distracted from their proposal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, if you refuse, I am sure you are well aware of what fate awaits to those who do not please us\" the Keryxian continued as you noticed that now both of them were circling around you with their weapons at the ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was between the sword and the wall, there didn't seem to be any escape even if he managed to go through these two (though chances are he could not). What would he choose? Run for it in an attempt to break free, or break his joke promise to his sister of not becoming a slave?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Scanning his situation, Andrew realized that there was probably not much of a chance to get out of this one easily... at least if he gave up, he would live... \"I... I am yours\" he said reluctantly, and he saw both Keryxians smile as one of them shot a net made out of hard light from her highly advanced halberd to him. The net coils around him, and he fell to your knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, we test your potential\" said one of his captors as she approached him with a hand already moving toward her plated boot, but right as she said this he saw a shadowy figure jump from out of nowhere and throw itself onto one of his captors. As this happened he heard the attacked Keryxian bark something indelicately in her own melodic language to her comrade, and the second Keryxian was swift to aid her companion, leaving Andrew helplessly wriggling within the net. Soon, his ears were invaded by the sounds of clashing weapons, fired lazers, and martial impacts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued to struggle trying to release himself, he gazed up to take a look at his mysterious savior. The figure was swift and agile, and her only weapon was a rather odd looking combat knife. At first Andrew found it difficult to determine if this figure was male or female, but after his eyes adjusted to the speed of this figure -and despite the fact that it was fully covered in a dark armor, hooded and wearing a mask- her body outline became more clear to him, enough to realize that she was indeed a female. But <i>who</i>? This female moved with much more agility and precision than anyone he'd ever seen fight before, which was proving to be quite helpful in her fight against two Keryxian guards who were clearly struggling in their attempts to neutralize her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight continued and Andrew continued to wonder if he even knew this woman from somewhere, or at least tried to realize how she bypassed the Keryxian lockout system. All of a sudden, the positive comments from other rebels about his sister's melee prowess came into your mind. Could this be her? Could Karla be this good? He stopped his struggling to let the thought of his sister coming to his rescue sink in for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no doubt about it, this had to be her! This operation depended heavily on multiple squads and his sister must've been nearby when things started to go downhill so she came to her brother's aid! He could already tell how much she will tease him after this, but he didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cracking noise brought him back from his thoughts and made him look back to where the fight was taking place, only to see as the dark figure released the body of one of the guards and let it hit the floor... she had just broken her neck. A quick glance to the right showed him that the second guard already lay dead on the floor, but this one was bleeding a dark purple substance from her neck. This is certainly not the way he expected this day to go, but at least he was alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mysterious savior approached him calmly, moving almost in a catwalk manner, letting him see that her armor covered every inch of her skin and made Andrew appreciate that, despite her attire and ferocity in combat, she was very feminine indeed. She took a zapping device from one of her pockets and used it on your net, making it vanish into the air and allowing him to properly stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks sis, I thought I was about to become a slave for life\" He said with a smile, already too certain on this figure's identity, but she dismissed your comment for one reason or another as she approached the body of the bleeding Keryxian and dragged it into a hiding place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Undress the other one\" she ordered suddenly, taking him completely by surprise. \"U-undress? Where do you think we are? In fact, what the hell are you thinking? We have to get outta here!\" he responded nervously. \"And that's exactly my plan!\" was all she said as she started to clean Keryxian blood from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized that there was a certain melodic ring in her voice, and even if it was the mask causing that, he also noted that this was not the voice of his sister. \"Karla, is that you?\" he asked just to confirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not know who that is, now do what I told you.\" She responded. That was all you needed for confirmation. She was not Karla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\" he said. \"But I'm going to need to know who is rescuing me if I am to fully trust you, 'cause you're making me undress an alien and I don't think I follow your process of thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure let out a clearly annoyed sigh as she sat down on a nearby crate. \"Shallya\" she said dryly and started unbuckling her black leather boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is... Is that your name or...?\" he started, but before he could finish his question he saw something that he certainly didn't expect at all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bare foot dropped a few visible beads of sweat as it got released from its leathery prison. This was, without a doubt, the most perfect foot Andrew had ever seen. It looeds like a sculpture, it was smooth, it was flawless... and it was purple...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This day was full of surprises.</i></span></div></div>",

Tell me now so that I know if I can leave you as bait!\" she hissed at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you're a Keryxian!\" Andrew finally said as her purple skin became clearer to him once her legs were out of their respective pieces of armor. \"And you are a human, any other obvious statement you would like to announce?\" she responded, which only made you hold your breath while trying to process this entire situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the Keryxian -or Shallya, as she told him earlier- let out another sigh. \"Look, I imagine you are confused... as if it was not obvious... but I really need you to help me undress the guard who is not covered in blood so I can wear her armor. If we are going to get out of this place, we need to go through unnoticed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he saw the sense in her words, there would be time for explanations later but for now this Keryxian was actually helping him and he was in no place to question that, so Andrew finally went to undress the guard's corpse... as distasteful a task as it may be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started by removing the helmet, then the breastplate and the gauntlets. Eventually he found himself removing her boots, revealing the stereotypically beautiful bare feet of their former wearer, though he really could not feel attracted to this pair due to the condition of the body, of course. After that, the short leggings came off and he finally piled up the entire set near his rescuer, who is almost completely naked by now, save for the mask she was still wearing, making Andrew blush and turn to the side as to not look like a pervert in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the complex appearance of the guard's heavy armor, he found it surprisingly easy to remove, which was certainly not the case when the user was alive given the amount of hits it took. Another wonder of Keryxian technology that he would have to explore later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\" Shallya grunted as she removed the heavy looking mask from her head, revealing her beautiful and youthful face, with bright red eyes and blazing red hair that reached only to her shoulders. Andrew had seen Keryxian before, but even as ideal-looking as all of them were, none of them compared to the outstanding beauty of this one, though he was not certain whether this was because of the fact that she was the only <i>friendly</i> Keryxian he'd seen, because of her shameless attitude towards showing off her naked body, or because she had left quite the impression after rescuing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't act like you've never seen a naked woman before!\" she exclaimed at you with a smile after acknowledging his reaction while heading toward the guard's armor. This sentence made you realize how dumb he must look by all your blushing, staring, and silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Well I've never seen a naked Keryxian before\" he responded, trying to explain his state to her, to which she responded with a simple and unmotivated \"Hmm\" before starting to put on the guard's leggings. \"As far as I know the anatomy of our species is not all that different\" she continued, making him feel glad that she actually seemed pretty approachable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, there are few differences but, there are very few humans who are so... perfect!\" he stated while making gestures that contrasted his comment, a comment that Shallya apparently found amusing since she actually let out a very cute chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow you humans really are submissive!\" ...not quite the reaction he expected, but he felt certain that her comment was not ill-willed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh <i>excuse</i> me for complimenting you, I'll make sure to never do it again!\" he replied sarcastically, already feeling more relaxed with Shallya's presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh a feisty one too? I'm starting to like you more!\" Shallya said with another chuckle which, admittedly, took him even more by surprise given how loosened up she seemed to be for a Keryxian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Shallya finished putting on the armor and grabbed one of the dropped Keryxian halberds. \"Right then! From now on you will be my prisoner!\" she stated, making him lose composure for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Andrew blurted out, but Shallya was quick to shake off those thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh relax! This are the papers we will be playing to get out of here. Did you not pay attention to what I said earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did, which made him feel quite bad for automatically jumping to the conclusion that she would suddenly betray him. \"Right... right... sorry\" is all he could say to try to compensate for his assumptions \"So what do I do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a forgiving smile, Shallya patted him on the back without poking the subject again. \"That's simple, just follow me and...\" but before she could finish her sentence a transmission came up in the holo-panel of her left gauntlet. Every word coming from it being complete melodic gibberish to Andrew, but clearly not to Shallya, as she found herself responding to whatever was being told through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short chat the transmission ended and Shallya looked up at him with a bit of concern in her face. \"W-what happened?\" Andrew managed to let out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The... the others detected that one of the guard's vital signals stopped... I completely forgot these armors had that sort of detection... and now they are sending reinforcements\" she responded, her words hitting like a hammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well then, what do we do?!\" he asked in a sudden rush of desperation, a question which Shallya was quick to respond to. \"Bring one of the crates to the center, and a chair too, I will move the other body to a better place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitating, both of them went and started setting things up, and within a few moments he seemed to catch up on her idea. Basically she wanted to make it look like he was the one who pierced the first guard's throat, while at the same time made herself look like she was the one who defeated and captured him... but why the crate and the chair?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let... Let me capture you!\" she blurted out rather desperately as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Andrew asked in surprise, but before he could react, another hard light net surrounded his body and made him fall rather heavily on the ground. \"Hey!\" he exclaimed, but Shallya limited herself to bring him to one side of the crate, and the chair to the other side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she said \"I need you to play along until the reinforcements are gone. I will apologize later\" and right as she finishes saying this, an entire group of Keryxian guards appeared from the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halt!\" the leader yells, followed by Shallya who is now pointing her halberd at him in a suddenly smug pose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And for that, you will now be my slave, worm!\" she exclaimed as if she had just finished giving a monologue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew heard the Keryxian start arguing again in their own tongue, which he did not dare to interrupt even if he didn't understand what they were saying, but by the nature of this entire situation he was almost certain that Shallya was trying to convince the others that she had captured him and had things under control, so he just stared down in silence looking defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden silence filled the room, and right as he lifted his head to try and figure out what may have caused it, he saw a pair of  heavy plated boots slam on top of the crate, mere inches from his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remove my boots, slave!\" Shallya commanded. He looked at her in disbelief, feeling uncertain again of her intentions. Was this part of the act or did she just take advantage of him for whatever she had planned? Either way he realized that he didn't have much of a choice, so he tried to obey... but the net was keeping his hands tight to his body, so he wiggled around trying to comply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh..a-ah! I see you are unable of even the simplest of tasks, human\" Shallya said with clear uncertainty in her words. Unclear to him at least, making him see once again that she was still in this with him, and that it was probably unfair to judge her for trying to get them both out of this place. At least knowing that she wasn't going to betray you that easily made you relax a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall help you, but you will have to lick for twice the time as I initially stated!\" Shallya continued as she started removing her boots. While she did this, he turned to see the rest of the Keryxian, all of them standing in place and looking at the scene expectantly... they seem determined to confirm whatever it was that Shallya told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, he saw Shallya's glistening feet slide off of their plated prisons, dragging a surprising amount of sweat considering how little time her feet had been in those. \"Start licking, slave!\" Shallya commanded, and he found himself staring lovingly at that outstandingly perfect pair of feet in front of him. Knowing the situation and circumstances, he didn't even consider to hesitate, so he slowly placed his tongue on her heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn electrical shock ran through his spine as soon as his tongue made contact. He'd had girlfriends before who would let him indulge his fetish with their feet but, admittedly as good as their feet felt, smelled and tasted, none of them compared at all to what he was feeling right now. He started to run his tongue through her sexy soles as he focused on the sensation of what licking a Keryxian foot for the first time felt like... <i>how could this feel so good?</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Up and down... Up and down again...<br>\r\nEvery lap he gave to her feet with his tongue felt heavenly to a point he didn't even know was possible. He felt his tongue sliding up and down her soles with very impressive ease, for not only did he find himself more and more eager to serve her with every lick, but her peds were actually completely flawless! No rough spots, no grime, no toe jam or any significant physical alteration, just this sculpture-like pair of impossibly soft feet and the delicious sweat that emanated from them -sweat that he found very helpful for your tongue sliding purposes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, human, I find your feet-licking technique very appropriate!\" Andrew heard Shallya comment in a fake arrogant manner, though at this point he was surprised that he actually heard her say that, given how lost he felt to her feet. Suddenly, Shallya spreads her toes allowing their aroma to further assault his nostrils and letting him feel another shockwave of pleasure as they do so. \"Don't you dare leave my toes behind!\" she exclaimed, something that he rather ironically needed to hear since he was actually getting lost to her soles alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tongue found its way in between her toes and he started to tremble in arousal, suddenly realizing why the human slaves of the Keryxians never truly complained about their service, even after being rescued. \"Just licking, slave!\" Shallya commanded as she caught him starting to instinctively wrap his lips around her delicious toes \"You shall only suck on them when I say you are allowed to!\" she continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made sure to meticulously slide his tongue between every available space, starting from the one between the little toe and the fourth toe, making sure to thoroughly enjoy every aspect of her feet, their smooth texture, their delicious taste, their alluring aroma, everything! And just as his tongue reached the space between her second toe and her big toe, Shallya clutched on it with her toes and pulled him closer to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole situation was making your mind go numb, all he could think about was this pair of Keryxian feet that so easily submitted him, but he was conscious enough to feel and see how Shallya used one of her feet to push his nape toward her at the same time as she pulled his tongue with her toes, making him go so far in front that his torso started to rest on top of the crate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, and with her second foot still holding his nape, Shallya quickly shoved her foot into his mouth, using it to feel everything inside. \u201cYou may suck on them now, slave!\u201d she stated  \u201cSavor them thoroughly, savor them and know this is the <i>taste</i> of your new master!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t even have to struggle or move at all, for Shallya herself was making sure to cover every part of his inner mouth with her wriggling toes, making a pull/push motion with her foot\u2026 If he didn\u2019t like this so much, he could say she was violating his mouth with her foot. After a while of this she decided to stop only to switch to her other foot, which she used to deeply penetrate his mouth just like she did with the previous one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was brushing her foot inside his mouth, Andrew felt his consciousness coming back slightly, just enough to steal a few glances to the Keryxian guards, who all seemed to be enjoying the show he was displaying. He heard them comment a few things every now and then, but even if he understood their language, the distance alone was still enough to not let him know what they were talking about, but he was sure it was about Shallya\u2019s dominance over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple more minutes went by like this and Shallya stopped her shoving only to firmly place both of her soles on his face and push him off the crate. He fell flat on his back with a hearable grunt. Luckily the crate wasn\u2019t tall enough to make the fall damage him in a serious way, but the surprise and sudden rudeness did feel rather painful in its own way. This, at least, makes him fully come back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet up, slave!\u201d Shallya demanded as she placed both of her feet on the edge of the crate once more, so he quickly obeyed with his gaze still on the floor as to continue with his act. Once his head is on the same level as her feet he heard her say \u201cLook up! I want to see the look of defeat on your inferior face!\u201d so once again Andrew obeyed trying to act as reluctant as he could\u2026 but then he sensed something odd about her\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the guard\u2019s helmet still covered the top half of her face, the lower half still gave up plenty of signals of how she was feeling about all this. A gentle smile decorated her dainty lips, which also were partly opened letting out her muffled heavy breathing; looking at this, as well as the darkened purple shade on her cheeks, you could say that she was doing her best to not look excited in front of the other Keryxian\u2026 but from Andrew's point of view, she seemed a little too eager despite the situation. It even looked like she was\u2026 <i>aroused</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold still, human. If you try to defy me you will be evaporated in no time!\u201d Shallya stated, and before he could process what she was trying to do, she pierced both of her big toes in each of his lip\u2019s commissures, clutching them with her toes and stretching his lips with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOpen wide, now\u201d she continued, and he wilfully did so. Having the inside of his mouth now fully exposed to her, all she did was lean forward and spit directly into it, making him gag slightly and taste the odd sweetness of her saliva\u2026 yet another distinctive racial trait he'd have to investigate later on. \u201cYou humans are nothing to us but tools, mere instruments to be used for our pleasure! If you swear servitude to us you will be spared, and you will live the rest of your days with everything you need as long as you never try to resist our authority and our feet! Nod if you surrender.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mouth was still held open by Shallya\u2019s toes when she turned to her \u201ccolleagues\u201d to speak in her own language again. Whatever she was saying, the Keryxian seemed to be satisfied with the results, and after a few moments of dialogue everyone heard and felt a sudden nearby explosion, so the Keryxian squad saluted their comrade and hastily retreated. Once all of the other Keryxian were gone, Shallya gently released her lips and rested her feet on the edge of the crate again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI uh\u2026 I apologize for talking down on you like that\u201d she commented \u201cI\u2026It was all to pretend\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know\u201d He interrupted her with an understanding smile as he noticed her violet cheeks were still blushing red, which Andrew found both intriguing and cute. Did she really enjoy that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking off the thought he finally continued as he stood up \u201cWe\u2026 we better get out of here, that explosion must\u2019ve been caused by my colleagues. We already know this whole operation was a mess so we have to hurry if we\u2019re to get out of this alive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShallya, however, seemed to be more quiet than before, so he turned to her \u201cHow about you show me the wa\u2026\u201d Andrew started, but once he looked at Shallya he could not help but feel confused, for she was frozen in place, breathing heavily as she just stared at her saliva-covered feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhm\u2026 Shallya?\u201d He asked, to which she responded with a very cute gasp and a surprised \u201cYes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you\u2026 going to escort me out of here?\u201d He continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes\u2026 yes, of course\u201d Was all she said before recovering the plated boots and putting them back on. To Andrew, it seems like she\u2019d rather shaky for a Keryxian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you\u2026 are you ok?\u201d He asked, trying his best to not sound offensive in any way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes I just\u2026\u201d she responded before taking a deep breath \u201cCan we discuss this later? I do not feel like this is the right time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo there was something off about her, the fact that she recognized it at least gave him a small confidence boost, for whatever it was she felt when he was licking her perfect feet it did have an effect on her. All he needed to do know was figure out what that effect was.<br>\r\nAfter a short moment he decided to break the silence again \u201cSo are you going to release me from this electrical net?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u201d She responded dryly \u201cThe guards think you my prisoner and slave, if they were to see you around in a more comfortable state they would certainly doubt my intentions\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that makes\u2026 sense I guess\u201d He responded with a bit of a disappointed tone. \u201cSo how are we going to do this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe simply walk out\u201d Shallya said as she stood back up with her halberd in hand \u201cAs long as we continue with the act we should be able to move around discreetly\u2026 at least until we go past the slave sector.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe slave what?!\u201d Andrew asked rather abruptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSector\u201d  Shallya casually replied. \u201cWe will be heading in that general direction, but once we go past that to reach the rendezvous point with your comrades, the guards will grow suspicious of our acts, so we will have to make haste\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo no hold on\u201d He said dismissively \u201cYou have an entire sector dedicated to store slaves?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>I</b> do not have such thing, the supremacy does\u2026 but yes, there\u2019s an entire sector dedicated to slaves\u201d Shallya responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this time Andrew had only seen slaves being walked around like pets, even the ones he'd rescued so far, and he never really thought about where they\u2019d be when they were not serving their masters, but seeing how this was the Keryxian embassy it made sense that there was a bigger concentration of human slaves in this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have to do something to save them!\u201d He instinctively responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo not be ridiculous! We only have one chance to make it out of here. If we survive this, we will be able to rescue your fellow humans another day.\u201d Shallya said in a genuinely worried tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know Shallya's right but could Andrew just abandon his people like that?</span></div></div>",

I-I mean you're not a <i>thing</i>, you're a...\" Andrew started, but before he could bring himself to form an articulate and credible explanation Shallya simply raised a hand, silently ordering him to be quiet before doing so with words \"I have no need for your stupid excuses, slave! Now move along before I decide that my mercy is too much for you!\" she exclaimed as she tugged the cable holding the net around him, making Andrew's confusion grow \"What are you...?!\" he started only to bite his tongue as he saw a steady flow of keryxian guards running towards the commotion near them. \"Oh...\" Is all he thought as he looked back at Shallya who was still staring back at him, but her facial expression (or what he could see from it) belied her angry tone of superiority, or rather, her air of superiority was still there, but her expression was more like a mocking smile, one that took him by surprise when he noticed her discreetly licking her upper lip before speaking again \"I said move!\" she exclaimed tugging at the cable again, making Andrew follow her in reluctant silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked through the hallway Andrew couldn't help but admire the utter synchrony and discipline of the keryxian forces, all of them looking like beautiful machines following a single command executed at the same time for everyone instead of a bunch of living and capable individual soldiers. Their shiny ornamented armors only helped to make it all look like a spectacle from the likes of this old place the veterans often call \"Broadway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Andrew caught a glimpse of the place that Shallya mentioned earlier\u2026 The entrance of slave sector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of rifle-bearing keryxians, along with a very skinny and pale human were at the entrance, naturally the human was the only one that was on all fours as a line of more keryxians were exiting the place. Andrew noticed that the keryxians inside were still mostly armored, save for their boots and a couple other pieces, while the human outside was mostly naked save for what seemed to be a loin cloth of keryxian design and a pair of metallic shoes and gloves that were seemingly holding him perfectly in place. Lastly, Andrew managed to see that the human was also forcing his tongue out, barely moving from that position as each and every single keryxian that exited through the door ran their soles over his tongue at least once before putting on the boots that shifted in place before them thanks to an automatized system and ran off to the commotion as well, a sight that made Andrew wonder if his tongue hadn\u2019t gotten dry from the continuous exposure, but a quick glance back at Shallya\u2019s rapidly moving boots made him remember of the sweating capabilities of keryxian peds, which in turn made him wonder what it would be like to have his tongue moist not with his own saliva, but with keryxian foot sweat instead. \u201cNonsense!\u201d he thought to himself as he shook his head in an attempt to forget about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are almost there.\" Shallya discreetly told him in a brief moment of privacy they got, at this point Andrew was certain that most of the keryxian forces would either be distracted fighting or preparing to do so, so he allowed himself a sigh of relief. \"I can't wait to get out of here.\" he mumbled shifting within his boundaries due to the uncomfort they caused on him. \"Yes...\" Shallya retorted \"We have much to discuss once we manage to reach a...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"HALT.\"</i> A booming yet melodic voice suddenly caught them both off guard, making them flinch and stop in place as they hoped whoever just spoke hadn't noticed their little reaction. \"You! The guard and the human, turn around!\" And with that, not wanting to prolong suspicion, Shallya turned as harshly and steadily as she could manage in face of the situation and tugged on the boundaries holding Andrew before giving the mysterious figure a keryxian salute to look more convincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Andrew was forced to look back even after being so close to escape, he couldn't help but let out a frustrated groan, both from the situation and from the electrical net forcing him to move awkwardly.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As this story has the option of being written from multiple characters' perspectives, here is some general information, which will hopefully be useful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the year 2084, the human race has become more peaceful. Negotiations between countries have helped to resolve conflict. Different stances from superpowers, such as the United States of America have been adopted to encourage a more selfless world culture. Essentially, there have been no nuclear wars and the population has continued to swell - from an approximate 6 billion in 2014, to 11 billion - nearly double - by 2084! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarth's resources have become scarcer, which is why the NSEP (New Space Exploration Program) was set up by major world leaders in 2077. Having explored all of the Solar System, but failing to successfully initiate growth or life on any planets - including Mars - it was agreed that venturing elsewhere was of paramount importance. Using the latest technology, it has taken seven years of constant, exhaustive work to make contact with a species - an actual living species - outside of our Solar System!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresident Joseph Harding was instrumental in passing the necessary bills and agreements amongst the United Nations to open up dialogue with the aliens. Miraculously, they seemed to be friendly, peaceful...and enchantingly beautiful! Perhaps foolishly, the major world leaders all quickly agreed to engage in further dialogue, thrilled at the fact that the alien - known as 'Keryxian' could adapt to any language on Earth. Their other abilities they were modest about. But there were some clear truths: that they did not want to attack Earth, that they wanted to form an allegiance and help Planet Earth gain the resources that had been exhausted in their supply on Earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with all of that, it was logical to allow the 'Spokescreature' to speak to the entire human population of Planet Earth. The idea of a live feed, transmitted to every country's tv stations and channels, as well as accessed on phones, devices and any other technological means, was a tremendously exciting one. Joseph Harding lapped up the praise and attention that he received, and had the honour to introduce the Keryxian - the first ever create of intelligent life to Planet Earth. How could he know what a disastrous mistake that would be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Keryxian, from what we know, live on a FemFoot planet called Keryxia. They have evolved to have the males as nothing more than slaves, specifically foot slaves. The females are strong, powerful and dominant, while the males are weak, emaciated and submissive. For hundreds of years now, it has been totally natural and normal for a male Keryxian to live for nothing but to serve the feet of his superiors - the females of this alien race. It seems to be that the Keryxian have been looking for another planet to force their doctrine of 'males = foot slaves' upon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, when the Spokescreature showed her bare soles to the cameras, she knew that it would do the following:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\tReduce any males without a foot fetish to dust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\tAllow males with a foot fetish to live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\tInstigate civil war, knowing that the human population would not just accept their country to follow 'FemFoot' principles, as dictated by the aliens in Keryxia<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were spot on with all three. To see billions of men killed instantly, and to be betrayed by the Keryxians like this, there was an immediate backlash. Women from all countries and nations around the world, still in shock, were at odds with what to do. Attack the Keryxians somehow? Try to restore some sense of order? Create new governments? Unfortunately, there were various groups - some of them pro-feminist, others simply out to create chaos, such as terrorist groups, who welcomed the change! There was one particular staunch supporters group, quickly named the 'Keryxian Freedom Group', who spread their hateful message on every internet and communication channel that they could - that the Keryxians had done Earth a favour! That now, with women in control, the Earth could be a more prosperous place!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men who survived the SoE (Soles of Enlightenment) were either because they had a foot fetish, or that they simply did not see the SoE at all. All women survived the SoE - foot fetish or not! With the image of the SoE sent around on social media, displayed on advertising screens, posters, billboards by the pro-Keryxian groups whittled down the non-foot fetish male (NFFM) population down to supposedly none. Not that simple though - it is known that some have managed to avoid, rather miraculously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of women who did not support the Keryxian doctrine, which was the majority, went to civil war with the various groups, such as the KFG. Many were killed, through acts of terrorism, chemical warfare... the Keryxians themselves stayed silent while this played out over several months. Eventually, the pro-Keryxian groups won. Men were divided in who to support: some foot fetish males (FFM) welcomed the Keryxian's barbaric act, feeling appreciated and proud of being allowed to live, thanks to their fetish!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the population reduced rapidly - from an estimated 11 billion people, down to approximately 6 (after the SoE), it went much, much more dramatically down to 150 million, within a week of civil war on Earth. With entire cities and in some cases, countries, being destroyed effortlessly by those who opposed the Keryxian, total surrender happened just days later. Any remaining survivors not associated with secret rebel groups begged for mercy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pro-Keryxian groups formed a united front, known as the FFWG (FemFoot World Government). Scattered as the population was after the civil war, key areas were more frequented than others. Most of Europe was wiped out, as was Australia, most of Africa and many countries in Asia.  The Keryxian advised the FFWG to order the pro-Keryxian and groups to Nevada, America, where the main headquarters were set up. Survivors in other parts of the world were given the choice to fully embrace the FemFoot principles and be taken to the capital in Nevada, or be promptly killed if they did not. This is where the Keryxian themselves had been based ever since; their presence had been instrumental in luring people over to them.  Women, along with a number of submissive male slaves, flocked from all over the world. The other countries and continents were still wastelands - mostly but not entirely deserted. The Kerxyian, along with the FFWG, had no preference in skin colour or racial background; rights and privileges are based purely on gender, as well as how loyal the person is to the FemFoot principles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that was why the Earth's population got reduced by so much, so quickly. Stragglers who were still anti-Keryxian were, and still are, rounded up and killed. Men were always given the chance to prove themselves as potential slaves. Any man not willing to comply with the FFWG, or was a non-foot fetish male, would be disposed of...or shown the SoE! The confirmed population in the new FemFoot World, capital city in Nevada, was <i>just over 7 million</i>. A massive, massive reduction from the 11 billion it was before the Keryxian arrived!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Keryxian themselves sent several of their majestically beautiful aliens to assist the FFWG in dealing with rebels and setting up the new world order. They were clearly pleased with how easily the entire planet had capitulated and was now operating in the way that they wanted. The FFWG remembered the added pressure - that they only had 9 months to fully integrate Earth into a successful FemFoot World. That meant that if any rebels were still lurking around for not dealt with by that point, then Earth and all of its inhabitants would be destroyed by the Keryxian, who would turn their attention elsewhere to another planet in the Universe more worthy of being honoured to become a FemFoot World. Eventually, the FFWG had been tasked with having a FemFoot World headquarters set up in every continent in the world, exactly the same set up that was in Nevada.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is what was set up in the FemFoot Capital, and is the plan for every continent, and eventually, every country and city in the world:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>FemFoot captains </b>- these were each responsible for an area within FemFoot World. FemFoot World was divided into 6 key areas. The captains reported to the Keryxian. The captains were selected by the Keryxian as they showed 'outstanding commitment to the FemFoot principles', and were thus rewarded with these incredibly powerful positions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>FemFoot authorities</b> - these were the 'police' who patrol and kept order in each area. They reported to the captains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>FemFoot loyalists</b> - women who actively supported the FemFoot principles. They were not one of the 'police' but did work for the FFWG. Their jobs were all linked to serving and adhering to the FemFoot principles. They obeyed the authorities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>FemFoot slaves </b>- these were the foot fetish males who loyally served any of the above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn terms of numbers, there were 6 FemFoot captains, 1 million members of the FemFoot authorities, 5 (approx) million FemFoot loyalists and 1 (approx) million FemFoot slaves. Clearly from the numbers, it was impossible for every woman to have their own slave. So, it was decided that earning the right to a slave was a privilege. Out of the 5 million FemFoot loyalists, 750,000 could earn the title of 'Elite Loyalists', who would each be given their own slave. The other 250,000 were used by the captains and authorities, and of course the Keryxian - their power meant that they were entitled to more than the regular loyalists. The Keryxian themselves had a presence on the planet formerly known as Earth. Some were in the capital, to where the captains report. Others were searching other parts of the planet to recruit more FemFoot members, or destroy anyone that opposed them. Either way, it was unknown exactly how many Keryxian were on FemFoot World. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs mentioned before, there were rebels out there - their numbers are unknown. It could be as much as millions, but it's very hard to tell, scattered as they were. Some were part of major rebel groups, others were fragmented bands of desperate survivors...either way, the FFWG know that they have to totally eradicate any anti-Keryxian thought or presence. Another plan was to set up a stronghold in each of the other continents - Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa and South America. This was necessary for the FFWG, so that they could guarantee that any rebel groups are removed, and so that the spread of the pro-Keryxian movement is across the entire world. Also, with so many nationalities of women who flocked over to Nevada, they already had every language and ethnic group accounted for. It hasn't happened yet, but it is a long term goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe FemFoot authorities were constantly searching for and destroying rebel groups, which is why there was such a vast number of them. They were also tasked with capturing males who were not already identified slaves and ensuring that they became loyal slaves. Any of which were non-foot fetish males could be 'converted', which took longer but is an effective way of increasing the slave count. Of course, it was down to the FemFoot authorities if they would be bothered with this process, or simply use the SoE to efficiently get rid of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFemFoot loyalists did not actively seek and deal with rebels, as the authorities did. However, they were responsible for educating the youth in fully embracing the FemFoot principles and adhering to them. Boys up to the age of eighteen were kept in very basic living quarters, where they were trained in how to appreciate female feet and to embrace that their ultimate goal in life is to be a woman's foot slave. At the age of eighteen, if they survive the SoE, then they could become an official slave to one of the Elite Loyalists, or authority members. Girls up the age of eighteen were taught in schools about why a FemFoot World is better, more efficient way of life than what we had before. Propaganda and brain washing basically. It was important to maintain a slave presence - another one of the Keryxian expectations. Also, it was crucial to use male sperm in order for new humans to be born. Naturally, the most submissive men's seed should be used, increasing the chance that any newborn boys would be natural slaves. Newborn girls are vital to pass on the FemFoot principles to in the future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loyalists that were tasked with training the boys and teaching the girls are part of the FemFoot Education group. Loyalists have a number of different options - not only as educators, but to working in fields such as communications, agriculture, the economy, retail....all of these industries all served the common purpose of making FemFoot World a prosperous one. Businesses no longer existed - all financial gain is controlled by the FFWG, very much in a totalitarian, non-capitalist state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom where we start different character's stories, FemFoot World was now fully established. It had been three months since the initial meeting with the Keryxian. The idea is to tell different accounts of what could happen and create some overlap to where possible. Will the FFWG maintain a strong hold on the planet, or will the rebel groups be able to overthrow them, along with the Kerxyian?!</span></div></div>",
