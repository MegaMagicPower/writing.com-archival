For the brief period I have been here, I've noticed that only a certain group of characters (Most noticably the females) have been subjected to this Inflation/Weight Gain craze. Basically ommiting the others that aren't used, I now give you an area to do so. Change in the 'Another Character' section as you please. <br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\nNo sex. No clearer than that, nudity and clothing rippage is ok though.<br>\r\nNo vore. Save that for another interactive.<br>\r\nNo massive weight gains. (Ya know, \"OMG I GAIN 1000000 pounds!)<br>\r\nPopping. Wait for a few chapters<br>\r\nPooping. Just no.<br>\r\nN00b posts shall be deleted with avengance!<br>\r\nLastly, no storylines that go on WAY past the mark of an ending.<br>\r\nLet us begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </td>",
