Dan rolled over and slid his hand across her belly rubbing it gently before kissing her neck. A small mummer left Sara's lips before Dan moved his down over Sara's belly button.<br>\r\n\"Sara I need to...\" Lilith Sara's room mate swung open the door and then quickly slammed it.<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry I did not mean to..\" Lilith said behind the door.<br>\r\n\"Do you want to join me in the shower, hun?\" Dan asked as he stroked Sara's cheek<br>\r\n\"No, you go ahead I think I know what Lilith wanted to talk about.\" Sara said as she slipped out from under the sheet. Sara walked over to the closet, staring at Dan's Sexy 24 year old butt,  before wrapping a towel around her naked form. Sara walked out into the living room where Lilith would most likely be. Lilith was sprawled out on the floor in a state of shock shaking violently as a stroke ran through her body.<br>\r\n\"Dan call a ambulance!\" Sara yelled as she held Lilith's head. Lilith convulsed and shook as Sara's cheeks were stained with tears.<br>\r\n\"It is not working!\" Dan yelled as he ran into the living room holding the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>At this time your call can not be completed please try back at a later time</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is not working.\" Dan tried the police department then the fire department and found the phone still useless. Dan dropped the phone and then grabbed Lilith's legs as they kicked wildly. <br>\r\n\"Grab her arms.\" Dan said looking at Sara as she wiped the tears from her eyes. She grabbed Lilith's arms before being pulled by Dan as he made his way out to the pickup.<br>\r\n\"Stay with her back here.\" Dan said and then got into the truck and started the engine. Lilith let out a sudden blood curdling scream and then went limp.</span></div></div>",

Tammy un buckled her seat belt and then moved over the seat shaking her mothers shoulder. The 5 year old let out a scream seeing the foam coming from her mothers mouth.

The Semi driver already in a state of convulsion slid and then crushed the car in front of him.<br>\r\nThe sound of cars striking each other entered Dan's ears before thee train three blocks away could be heard screeching against the steel tracks. What followed was the breaking of wood and twisting of steel as the passenger train cars slid off the tracks. The sound of the crushing of homes was quickly pulled from Dan's mind as he looked in shock at all the people as they scrambled. It was weird despite the massive loss Dan noticed that he found comfort in Sara over everything else. The single thought of her still being with him made the destruction less shocking.<br>\r\nA few hours had passed and it seemed that whatever had caused the event was over.

Surprisingly, and despite everything that happened Sara had slept through the night comfortingly in Dan's arms. Sara walked over turning on the coffee pot before grabbing a piece of toast.<br>\r\n\"Sara!\" Dan wailed and then bolted to his feet looking around before his eyes settled on her.<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry. It was just.\" Dan said  as he seen Sara in the kitchen.<br>\r\n\"It is ok I was thinking the same thing before I felt you Against me.\" Sara saidd as she walked over to Dan.<br>\r\nThe two although deeply, in love had always placed there careers before what they deemed as pleasure or recitation. Dan worked as a IT tech at a local college making sure all there systems operated in the best manner while still staying within budget. <br>\r\nSara was totally different then Dan she had obtained a grant through a university to research a vaccine that would detect and deteriorate most types of cancer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe news reports of the event of the 29th littered the morning broadcast and radio waves. Despite the fact that people were advised to remain indoors most people simply deemed the current situation a freak accident and figured the best thing to do was to go on with there life's. Dan kissed Sara and told her he would call her, and see her later on tonight. Sara had a to prepare  for a presentation that had she had planned for the last few months. as she backed out of the driveway returning a blown kiss to Dan as he prepared to leave her mind was already on the the presentation. Sara found a solstice in the office and that she could produce a \"better overall product\" with fewer people pestering her. While many people were not in the office on Sunday and even fewer expected to come in after the incident on the 29th. Sara still had a few little quirks to smooth out before the international presentation on the 4th. Lilith had been such a big part of the work that she and Sara along side with  Lilith's friend Nancy. The three of them had developed a system that could possibly work given the presentation was a success and the funding was provided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe traffic was fairly light, most people were taking time off or spending time with loved ones. Sara reached down and flipped on her i pod. The sweet sound of Beethoven's Sonata flowed into her ears and she pulled into the highway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car in front of her was slowly weaving back and forth. \"Probably on there phone\" Sara thought as she slowed her speed and then began to move around the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the car Samantha tried her best to control her arm as she felt the sudden sensation running through it. It began as a warm feeling that turned to pain and before Samantha could react her arm felt numb. Instantly Samantha tried to push the pedal to no avail. Her foot simply did not react the muscles were numb and not functioning. In a state of paralysis that increased by the second Samantha found her thoughts scattered as the car began to weave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara watched the car weave and then blared her horn as the woman suddenly waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Judge lived a life determined by fitness yet took the time to take and respect the sweetness of a sunrise before his morning jog.

Something seemed to overtake Brian and he found himself running into a full sprint. His feet moving faster his muscles began to ache and his heart thundered against his chest. Brian felt his feet moving faster and could not control his movements. His feet scattered across the pavement then he found his feet stammering before he tripped. Brian's body skipped across the pavement and rolled  to a stop. Brian felt the blood roll down his forehead and then wiped it away. Before his body got back to his feet. Despite the harsh fall Brian felt no pain and then brought his hand to his chest. His heart was beating faster his beating more and more erratic trying to keep pace with the rest of Brian's body as it continued to produce more and more adrenaline. Brian reached into his pocket and with shaking hands tried to dial a number only to feel the plastic slip through his fingers as his body lurched over. Brian's heart beating faster into his chest continued beating quicker and more drastically erratic.<br>\r\nA military truck slowly rolled past Brian before slowing and coming to a stop.

This was only partly true. While massive graves had been established, they were quickly filled.

The 2 year old was very playful and had found a comfort in Megan that was only second to her mother. Megan had done the best she could with Sandy after learning of the young girls parents death on the 30th when they were killed when a car slammed into the side of the passioner train they used to commute to work.<br>\r\nMegan had told no one about Sandy. Megan was unable to have a child and with the loss of Sandie's parents Megan took it upon herself to watch over the child. <br>\r\nMegan knew that Sandie's birthday was in February and thought of how the rest of the people had suffered up to the point. Megan loved the little girl to the point where she had considered a death may be the best option but quickly dismissed it. Megan watched Sandy laying in her play pen as the morning clouds streamed across the sky. The little kitten clock on the wall's eyes moved back and forth as it showed ten minutes from nine o' clock.<br>\r\nMegan knew there was little she could do and although the military had dwindled the only people who were going out doors were people that were burying the dead. The air out on the streets was filled with death. It was not so much from the people that simply had no one to bury them. The problem was from all the animals. Mother nature had never planned for this amount of death and the ground and lakes were cluttered with animals of all shapes and sizes. The sky was filled with instincts that had a daily life span that moved over any living or dead thing around them that went outside.<br>\r\nBack inside the kitten clock showed nine ten and nothing had happened. Megan picked up Sandy and looked at her. She had a small fever and a redness in her cheeks from crying earlier.<br>\r\n\"Maybe it has passed her maybe it is over. The whole thing just swept off as fast as it came on.\" Megan thought and a smile came to her face. Megan looked over at Sandy who now had crawled over and grabbed her bikie and was sucking on it with a vengeance. Megan smiled and then looked at the little two year old. The bikie slipped from the two year olds mouth and she began to whimper before she cried. Megan reached down and slid the binkie into Sandies mouth before picking her up and hugging her. The little girl sucked at the binkie and then Megan felt the binkie tumble down her back followed by a screech from Sandy that was followed by a gurgle then another scream. Megan felt something against her neck and held Sandy away from her. Sandy had blood running down her cheeks and was coughing between wails. Megan grabbed a rag and quickly wiped the blood from the child's lips only to find more run from Sandies mouth. Megan was busy wiping Sandies mouth she had not noticed the blood running down the 2 year olds legs. Megan pulled the diaper off and then let out a gasp the child was bleeding . At that moment the child spit the blood up once again and then her ears and nose started to bleed. Tears stained down Megan's cheeks as she found could do nothing as the child seemed to bleed profusely in front of her. The wails became louder and the child could not help it as she spit up the blood until after about 3 minutes Sandy laid limp in front of Megan.<br>\r\nMegan left the child on the blanket and then walked into the bathroom and started a bath. Megan took the small child and then washed her and dressed her in a bumble bee outfit that she had worn for Halloween that her mother had left at Megan's house.<br>\r\nMegan opened the door and was met by a onslaught of flies and wasp running across her face. She simply continued walking and then noticed a truck parked down the street of the subdivision.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The piglets and hamsters were also dead. two of the three chimpanzees were dead. The single monkey left in the cage was named Kansas from which Nancy grew up from.<br>\r\nNancy has drawn blood from Kansas and was flabbergasted at the presence of nanites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The model of the protein based nanites has been simple and the programming even simpler. The nanites followed a basic design where they would mask the traits of cancer laden cells. Once masked the cancer and nanites would merge and then slowly, over a twelve day period, the cancer would be removed.<br>\r\nThe nanites already incorporated within the cancer would slowly break off and break down the cancer to a point where the mound of cancer could be moved through the blood stream. Once inside the bloodstream the nanites would send a trigger through the body to recognize the cancer and nanites as a waste material. As a waste material the cancer and nanites would be naturally expelled from the body.<br>\r\nThe treatment was virtually painless, involved no surgery, covered every and all types, and was something that over time could be added as a immunization as a baby to eliminate any chance of a cancer ever occurring.<br>\r\nThe only downside that anyone possible had seen was the number of deaths that would occur due to the lack of the cancerous mound and what it may have held together. But, most of those occurrences could be dealt with surgery to fix any cosmetic damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy looked at the screen with a confused face. While the nanites were intentionally intended to be used for cancer they could be adapted to treat a virus or at least slow a viruses progression. By the 2nd Nancy had come to the conclusion that the effects were caused by some form of a virus. The strange thing was the spectrum in which the virus had attacked. It had hit the nervous system, had caused some unexplained mental effects,and had now moved on to the cardiovascular system.What Nancy could not explain is the lack of any defined virus. Nancy was almost certain the nanites could wipe the current incident away from existence. Luckily, the amount of dead was plenty full and acquiring a sample from each stage was easily done.<br>\r\nWhat puzzled Nancy was the lack of a virus or a outside influence for the effects. It was only upon further examination that Lilith had found traces of her, Lilith's, and Sara's nanites in the sample. </span></div></div>",

They altered there programming after leaving the host body.\" Sara said in awe.<br>\r\n\"Yes, What I had a problem with was trying to figure out how they were being moved from one organism to another and then considered the amount of time we have been using them. Sara they have been moving around over eight years moving through the water supply the animals and all over the world every organism is exposed at this point.

All of those people simply died due to there..\"Sara looked at Nancy confused.<br>\r\n\"The time table. Yes that's what confused me also. We programmed the nanites to dispose of the cancer and them selfs on the 12th day. What I believe has happened is due to a unexplained event the nanites have seen 9/9/09 as that day. I believe it has to do with the mathematical equision of 9/9/9. But it could be anything. What is for certain is on the ninth the nanites will stop.\" Nancy said and then looked at Sara waiting for the question.<br>\r\n\"What does it have and do with the month people were born? Oh, wait the nanites.. they are seeing people not born inside of the equision to be a danger.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, using the equision the nanites were able to communicate with the host determining the date of birth. You did not kill them Sara. You simply allowed them into the host. I killed them, I was the one that established a network for the nanites to communicate to each other to find and deteriorate the cancer cells.\" Nancy looked over at Sara and then to the clock showing 8:55.<br>\r\n\"Remember the first time we reset the nanites. The very first wave before injecting them into the mice. We synchronized them at exactly none o clock eastern time. The massive jolt of electrons to stimulate them before the injection. It was Lilith's idea to expose them I believe that's when  they developed the glitch in programming.\"Nancy looked back at the clock and then looked back to Sara with a bit of sadness in her eyes. Sara looked at the clock and seen it was reading 8:59.<br>\r\n\"I think that some types of frequencies disrupt there communication with each other. That's why not everyone seems to have the effects come on all at once.\" Sara I have always loved you as a sister. I do have one request of you though. See I was born in March. I have seen what the nanites are capable of. They are using the bodies natural defenses and psychology to destroy what they see as a cancer.\"Nancy said.<br>\r\nThe sound of Kansas jumping in her cage could be heard as the chimp grew restless. Kansas moved back and forth finding her self suddenly hot. Kansas waved her arms and Sara noticed the beads of sweat roll down the chimps forehead and then arms. The lab was air conditioned. But even so the chimp began breathing heavily and sweating profusely as her temperature rose higher.<br>\r\n \"They are heating up the host to produce a growth of the cancer. The problem is that the entire host being the cancer they will simply continue increasing the temperature\" Nancy said as the sweat ran into her eyes. The chimp began screaming and running around in her cage then suddenly fell down and panted quickly in the cage letting out little wails that dwindled off. The chimps body temperature continued to increase.  The blood became hotter and the over all temperature rose to over 120 degrees the blood pulsed and the heart beated faster the veins swelled as the blood began to boil The chimps body continued to rise in temp and the smell of burnt toast began to fill the room as the skin began to sag on the bones. The veins swelled to the point where the boiling blood could not be sub sustained and then the veins split open like a overcooked hot dog in a microwave. Kansas lay dead in a pool of sweat and blood.<br>\r\n\"Please before it is to late, Don't let me die like that.\" Nancy said short of breath before dropping to her knees and looking around.

The thought of how Sara would react if Nancy suddenly woke up ran through Sara's head as she pulled a layer of flesh from the chimp. Sara noted how even though the host was dead the nanites continued to heat up the flesh. It was there response to stimulate the cancer. Without a doubt most cancer lay dormant but a sudden temperature change around the cancer mound would cause a growth. It was a simple way to fish out any  cancer cells that would be troublesome later on. But, no one had planned on anything like what had happened.<br>\r\nSara knew the layout of the nanites. They would be introduced and find the cancer, incorporate them selfs with the major parts of cancer and then slowly break them down moving those parts into the blood stream. Upon that they would find and stimulate other cancer cells before breaking them down and then pulling at them tearing that cancer apart. What was to come next is what would really be scary. The nanites would break down the cancer to a cellar level to be passed through the system. Sara typed and analyzed the sample from Kansas and wondered if she could possibly find a way to slow the progression of the nanites.</span></div></div>",

The 16 year completed her life. Over the last few days she had lost so many. Every thing around her seemed quieter every day. The smell of death lingered in the streets. The people always seemed in a rush and never seemed to care about the girl with her hollow eyes looking out into the world.<br>\r\nJamie looked up at the sun focusing on the world and meaning of life. She felt her pioups dilate but kept staring. Jamie wanted to see past the reasoning and into the why and now.<br>\r\nThe soft touch of something fuzzy moving across Jamie's calf brought her back to reality. Jamie looked down and then smiled noticing the little kitten. Jamie rubbed her eyes and then let out a little giggle.<br>\r\nJamie had lived a simple life. A life defined by most as pity full. Looking down at the trace marks in Jamie's arms reminded her what time of day it was and she wandered to the corner where she usually found Buck.<br>\r\nBuck had brought Jamie up from 12 years old. He had shown her the streets both the respectable and dirty aspects.<br>\r\nJamie scraped her fingers around her arm. Buck was a man who kept a schedule and Jamie knew it he would always pick her up on Thursday morning for fun on Thursday night with associates. <br>\r\n\"Come on Buck where are you?\" Jamie said aloud looking up and down the street. A little shake followed by a sudden jolt startled. Jamie stayed decent with the clients. She found that the death of most of the residents awarded a almost limitless supply of cash. It did not matter though. Many people stopped taking cash for goods others hoarded what they had. Many of the elite class held them self's in there penthouses watching the news broadcast how many were dead and watching in disbelief as the number grew.<br>\r\nFor Jamie though she knew her way out. Her birthday being in April Jamie knew something terrible was coming and had decided to leave before the event overtook her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The programming should return to a state of either what we have programmed or a default setting where as the nanites will cease to function all together. Of course if this was the case the current epidemic would not have been a result. But it is the only thing I can think of at this point.<br>\r\nThe downside of this is the amount of a jolt it would take. While the injected nanites required a 4 volt shock to reset the 10cc volume of solution containing the 100 nanite cells. Once the nanites have entered the host they would directly seek out the protein and feed off of it to provide energy for cell division.  Within one of the mice samples after a single 24 hour period the nanite number rose to the millions. With the time that they have had  the nanites could have entered a human host and using the protein naturally supplied through the body could have mirrored more then half the bodies natural cells while still being undetected.<br>\r\nThe removal through a jolt of electricity would not only kill the host. But, if even a single nanite existed after the volt it would reconstitute it's numbers within a 24 hour period. Through electricy seems to be a lost cause there has to be another way.</i><br>\r\nSara looked at the pad and then heard the sound of the lights and whirling of processors as the lab sprung back to life.

The onslaught of the recent events caused Kimberly to wonder what she would be deemed with being born in May. Kimberly had lived in the city all of her life and never even seen the country side. With her back pack full Kimberly walked down and got into her Tercel. The car fired to life and Kimberly navigated through the cluttered city streets. The highways and most of the major roads had become un passible. While most people were told to remain indoors very few did. And when the reporters told the public that there seemed to be a like between the deaths and the date of birth many people left the cities.<br>\r\nKim knew the link and knew about the nine o' clock time in which people were to be affected.  her birthday being in march Kimberly made the decision to see the country side and enjoy what little time she had left. In the back of her mind and with the dearest serenity, Kimberly hoped that leaving the city would somehow allow her more time or that she would move outside what ever was causing the effect.<br>\r\nKimberly drove through the night and then into early hours of the morning. Kimberly arrived at a small waterfall overlooking a forest. Here Kimberly laid down a blanket and rested against a tree watching the morning sun rise into the sky. Kim watched as the country side was alive with wildlife of all sizes as they moved through the morning. Kimberly was taken back at the sight of a hawk circling over the base of the waterfall. The majestic flight seemed almost intoxicating as the bird cascaded higher into the sky.<br>\r\nThe incandescent colors burning up the sky son left Kimberly's vision as the sun rose higher. Throughout her life Kim had been healthy. Mostly it was because of her parents genes. But, Kim was not allergic to any thing that she had come across. Kim took a deep breath of the country air and then let out a small cough. The small coughs continued as the pollen began to fill Kim's throat. Kim reached behind her snagging her Mountain Dew and took a demanding sip from it. The coughing stopped but a pain in Kim's throat soon became apparent.<br>\r\nThe allergic reaction was only haltered by the flow of the sugary drink into Kimberly's throat. But, while the poilon was only a irritant the sugars and fruits in the drink caused the muscles in Kim's throat to slowly swell.<br>\r\nKim started to panic. She told herself what ever happened she would remain calm and embrace it and as Kim gasped for air  and then looked up at the sky at the hawk that now seemed to be mocking her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before she filled it with the left overs from the jeans, Edwards mother closely stitched eyes and a mouth and lines representing whiskers in the face. This was not only so the cat could be safe around a two year old. But also, so that the playmate could be cleaned easily.

There programming was once again to act in conjunction with the bodies natural defenses to disable the current strain of nanites. Sara knew that the previous strain of nanites could adapt quickly to any threat that may affect them. With this in mind she built the new strain to cooperate with the malfunctioning strain of nanites until such a time a attack could be initiated.<br>\r\nSara knew that distributing a new strain of nanites world wide was all but impossible. The new strain was developed with increased cell division capabilities it would be the only way to possibly combat the overwhelming amount of malfunctioning nanites. <br>\r\nAt this point the worlds population was a mere quarter what it was less then a week ago. As the morning rose on the seventh of September Sara searched around looking for someone that was born in July. After roughly she came across Troy. Troy had been a construction worker. At the age of 31 Troy was a fit man with a wife and child. That was all lost as the cloud of death took everything he had held dear from him. Sara discreetly asked him and explained the possibility of him surviving past nine am. The decision was made with a steady heart.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSara looked at the clock showing 7am and then back Troy. Pulling the syringe out of the container she wiped down Troys arm and with a steady push of her thumb brought the plunger down. The nanites flowed into the blood instantly acquiring protein and dividing as they spread through out Troys body.<br>\r\nThe nanites divided and moved next to the malfunctioned nanites. And by eight AM the nanites had outnumbered the malfunctioning nanites. With little exception the effects had occurred at nine AM. With the knowledge of this Sara had programmed the nanites to execute massive destruction of the malfunctioning cells at the first sign of communication. <br>\r\nThe seconds of the clock ticked by as Troy looked up at Sara with anticipation and then at the clock showing Nine fifty.<br>\r\n\"Just remain calm the nanites will work. At there current division rate they should more then outnumber the malfunctioning nanites and provide a curtain against any ailment they may affect.<br>\r\nThe clock closed upon nine am and the malfunctioning nanites began communicating with each other.<br>\r\nTroys breathing began to quicken as he felt a great pain flow through his chest.

Most were skeptical hoping for the best but denying any hope. The fact that Troy was in the room with most of the people brought a calming tone.<br>\r\n\"Watch.\" Troy pointed to the clock as it counted down the few seconds and then passed nine AM.<br>\r\n\"See we are alright.\" Troy said in honor of Sara who had retired to her office determined to stay calm despite the outcome. The sound of the people outside as they yelled and banged on the door was overpowering. But only lasted a few minuted before it settled down leaving the untreated people born in August dead.<br>\r\nInside the lab the people rummaged around cramped in the lab taking and reassuring one another happily to be alive.<br>\r\nTroy walked over to the jumble of computers that Sara had been sitting next to earlier and then looked at the monitor. It showed a diagram of the new nanites and a small animation of how it would destroy the malfunctioning nanites. Troy was taken off guard how similar the new nanites and malfunctioning nanites looked. In effect the design was similar but the programming was drastically different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside of Troy the nanites communicated with one another searching the crevices of his body for any remaining malfunctioning nanites. <br>\r\nDeep buried with a platelet of skin of Troys body. A hord of malfunctioning nanites converged as they communicated with the other nanites inside the room that remained dormant. The people inside the room showed no sings in any manner of any type of resistance to the  malfunctioning nanites. The time had simply passed 9am and then.<br>\r\nThe doors to the lab were opened and the people were shocked to the sight of  the untreated people. There bodies seemed to have been scorched to the point the skin had peeled. The people stepped and looked away from the untreated people as they moved out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark came up and dropped to his knees to the sight of his father who had arrived simply to late to be treated. The man took his father in his arms and hugged him the tears flowing down his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep within Marks father the nanites communicated with the nanites within Mark. A small jolt of electricity was sent through Mark causing him to almost instictly push his deceased father away. Mark stood up and then looked up at the lamp post and the broken bulb above him as it seemed to hum.<br>\r\nWithin a split second the nanites within Mark became negatively charged. The lamp post above Mark shot a bolt of electricity through him illuminating the Man for a brief second before he fell to the ground in a limp scorching mass. The people that were treated let out a wail that was quickly silenced. The malfunctioning nanites within the people had adapted to the new strain of nanites and were using them to form a negative charge throughout the treated individuals body before they were struck and killed by any item that carried a charge. Most people found that not moving yielded the best chance of not being electrocuted. But even this was not a possibility. <br>\r\nTroy cam running into the lab yelling for Sara. For some reason he was not affected in the same manner as the people born in August. With a gleam of hope he thought the nanites had passed over him.<br>\r\nTroy ran past the monitors he had seen earlier looking at the animation on the screen and then seen the screen go of as he passed it. He found his feet moving slower and then felt his body come to a stop. Troy faced the monitors and the machine that created the new strain of nanites. The processors suddenly started buzzing before Troy was struck with a jolt of electricity. Troy fell forward onto the desk before the computer and the macinge that produced the nanites exploded in a small burst of sparks sending flames throughout the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the screams brought the joy and accomplishment to a crashing halt. Followed by a huge explosion throughout the lab. Sara reached for the handel to the door of her office and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It had dark gray fur, yellow eyes, a protruding dog like face, and a stinch that could wake the dead. It held it's nose high in the air, sniffing for something. Dan was frozen with fear. No way in hell he could take something like that with just a golf club. Out of nowhere it's ears pirked up and it's head swivled in the direction of Dan. The monster met eyes with Dan, causing him to drop his club. For a second, Dan lost all cognative ability. Then the beast smiled a smile that would make small children cry. It seemed to have a look of pity in its eyes before turning back to its sniffing. <br>\r\n\"Damn it.\" the beast said with it's deep, scratchy voice. \"Not here EITHER!\" It brought its fist down with a force that shook the entire room. Lamps broke, stands toppled, and Dan pissed himself. The beast turned around and started walking on all fours back to the door. It paused in the arch of the door and looked back at Dan. \"Hurry up an change your pance moron. You got a lady to get back t... raghhhh raghhh raghhh.\" The beast coughed. \"Stupid shit faced disease. Wasn't even born in October so why the h... raghhh.\"</span></div></div>",
