He brushed his long, dirty blond hair out of his eyes and drove on, putting his phone in the light blue backpack that was sitting in the passenger seat. Having just finished high-school, Howard decided to take a year or two off before going to college and was in the middle of a road trip to visit his cousins back east. Without his phone's GPS, he had no idea where he was going. He drove down the long stretch of road, hoping that he might be able to find some place where he could charge it again when his headlights revealed a deer caught out in the middle of the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned the wheel hard, his foot slamming on the break, as he lost control of his car. Howard just missed the deer but ended up landing in a ditch, being tossed around the inside of his car, his vision going black.</span></div></div>",

There was a mild pain in his breath and he didn't know why. The confusion stayed with him as he began to see his surroundings. In the distance Howard could just make out the sound of chirping that he finally realized were crickets which was mixed in with a light ringing in his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved his arms and felt his neck, which felt tender but he didn't know why. That's when it all came back to him. The deer. The car. He slowly opened his eyes and saw that he was still in the car but he wasn't in the driver's seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to get his he straight but it felt fuzzy. What was wrong with the car? Something was off. He looked around and with some effort, he was able to pull himself up. He climbed up out of the driver side window and slid out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoward took the scene in. His car had landed in a ditch and flipped to its side. He didn't know if it was in that order or not. One of the headlights was still on, shining into the woods which showed something glinting in the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoward walked over to it, distant in his thoughts. The glinting was the zipper of his backpack surrounded by broken glass. He picked it up at tossed it over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBroken glass...Howard looked down at himself. He knew he should be concerned but he really wasn't. It was like he was watching himself as an outside observer. He checked himself over, looking for blood. He didn't find any, nor did he find any cuts or rips. If he was in his right mind, he would have considered himself lucky that all that seemed to hurt was his throat and head...his head hurt?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing what to do, he picked a direction and started walking.</span></div></div>",

His mind was on fire as his tongue slid along his length and he gave small kisses to the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoward saw a drop of precum form and his tongue quickly darted out to catch it. Howard wanted to hate it with everything he was but he didn't. As soon as he tasted what Nate had to offer, his own trapped cock uselessly strained in its prison. His mind was clouding with lust and it was a guy that was causing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe licked the length again before taking it back into his mouth. He sucked on it as if to draw the life out of him. He heard Nate groaning and a smile forced its way onto his lips. He heard other moans in the night. Courtney and John were getting to know each other very well but they were not the only ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailey's moans were enough to finally put Nate over the edge as he came hard into her mouth. She wanted every last drop she could take and made sure she didn't spill any. She swallowed Nate down and the pleasure of making her man cum push Howard over his own edge. Somehow, despite the device, he felt an orgasm rock his body. Her clit throbbed and she bathed in the pleasure as she looked lovingly into her man's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night was turning out to be better than she dreamed it would.</span></div></div>",

After a stretch he brought himself to his feet and yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a few weeks since Jaime lost his last job at the local bookstore and hasn't been able to find another since. Without a job, he ended up losing his apartment as well, but luckily his friend Rob had been nice enough to let Jaime crash at his place for a while until he can get back on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaime thought that maybe he should start looking into another job but he wasn't that motivated. Rob had plenty of cash so there was no worry of him wearing out his welcome. The real problem, however, was that he has no marketable skills. The bookstore job was just inventory stuff, which he could do fine until they had to make cut backs. He wasn't too sure where to even start looking for work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter using the bathroom and getting a shower, Jaime headed downstairs into the living room. There Jamie was shocked to see Judith, Rob's Ex. They had a pretty nasty break up after Judith had found out that Rob was cheating on her. She was writing something on a piece of paper and there was a package on the coffee-table. Jamie was thinking about sneaking back up the stairs when Judith finished writing and looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi Jamie,\" she said blankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Judy,\" Jamie said uncomfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just dropping something off, could you make sure Rob gets it?\" She asked while handing him her key to the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure,\" Jamie responded, taking the key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudith left quickly and Jamie was left to his own thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie took a seat on the couch, picking up the package and giving it the once over. It was a large, thick envelope with the top ripped and inside were a few CDs, all numbered. He took up the paper that Judith had been writing on and read what she wrote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI told you the last time we spoke that it was over and that I wanted nothing more do with you. You broke my heart and as much as I would love to forgive you, I just can't. I don't know what are on these disks, I couldn't bring myself to listen. Don't send me anything else. I mean it. So help me, I'll get a restraining order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Judy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, a little harsh,\" Jamie said to himself. He put the note back down and leaned back against the couch looking over the disks. He was tossing around ideas in his head on what could be on the disks, the curiosity eating at him. Finally he stood up, deciding that he was going to find out what rob sent or it was going to bug him all day.</span></div></div>",

In fact, after the first track finished, he went to close the media player but stopped when the next one started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll just finish this track then I'll delete them,\u201d Jamie thought to himself leaning back in the computer chair.

He was dragging the tracks to the recycle bin when he decided against it. He got up and went into the guest room, where he had been staying, and came back with his mp3 player.

He moved closer to them, not wanting to be seen looking at them, and continued to browse them from across the aisle, he liked what he saw, and who would know. nobody ever saw him in his underwear, so why shouldn't he get whatever he wants to get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile no one was around he quickly checked the sizes and selected 5 pairs all different color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe kept them close, hoping nobody would notice what he was holding<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext he headed to shirts deciding that he would start wearing undershirts from now on, not knowing where the idea came from though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nafter selected a few T-shirt's that were much less Drab, than the ones he owned he browsed undershirts. having the same problem as before, they were all plain. but then an idea struck him, it was an undershirt, nobody would see them, just like his new underwear, why not have some fun with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving towards the ladies section he browsed some Girl's T-shirt, selecting a few sizes, not sure what he wanted, and quickly moved to a changing room<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly tried a few of his selections, finding that he really liked the snug feeling a particular baby-tee fit, it was small on him, and showed a bit of mid-riff, but wearing it under another shirt would be perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went back to shopping returning what he didn't like and selecting more baby-tees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly wanting some new jeans, realizing that his budget was nearly hit, he only got two new pairs of jeans, these were skinny, and really hugged his legs up to his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\ncarrying his new outfits to the register. This stuff would cost most of the money he had at the time, but it was well worth it he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And when I get back I'll make dinner for me and Rob and I'll start looking for a job.\" he thought, things were starting to look up</span></div></div>",

Don't worry, they weren't too expensive it won't cost you much, by doing this I know you're desperate for this job so you probably need the money anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that makes sense, this is just a bit weird for me, since an hour ago I thought I'd be working here as a guy, I'm not sure what made me decide to try this out.\" Jamie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan handed Jamie what looked like flesh colored shorts and a pair of large breast forms. along with them she handed him a demi-bra<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally we don't wear bra's but I don't see any other way for the forms to stay on, short of gluing them to you, which I figured you weren't up for, oh and one last thing, I would've gotten you smaller breast forms, but since They would need a bra and we didn't want anyone else to know, I am laoning you one of mine, so the forms had to match, sucks for you cuz I'm and E-cup, one of the largest here. Sorry\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great\" Jamie thought not only was he working as a woman, he was stuck working as a woman with rather large tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan told him to change into all that and she'd start training him. Jamie went to the nearest bathroom and slipped out of his shorts and slipped the hip/butt padding over his panties. Then he slips the shorts back on, with the extra layer, it puts even more pressure on his dick, its not comfortable, but it does look realistic, he's definitely got a feminine shape now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext the bra, clipping it on isn't all that hard, he slips the forms in and settles them in, before putting the tank top back on. The forms to a pretty good impression of real breasts, but damn are they heavy, Jamie can't imagine what it would be like to have them all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he's changed he returns to Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan began blending the forms into his chest to hide them, and then she started putting some makeup on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach step was more and more embarrassing for Jamie, Finally Megan finished putting the finishing touches on his Lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hands Jamie a mirror to inspect himself and Jamie's jaw drops, he could barely see himself behind this female illusion, he had to hand it to Megan she was good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie took a deep breath, feeling the weight of the forms on his chest. \"Alright, so time to train me?\"</span></div></div>",

Looking at his soiled clothes, he decided that now was a good time to take care of that. After putting away the cleaning supplies, he made his way to the upstairs bathroom for a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hurriedly stripped, placed his clothes in the hamper and then jumped into the shower. He looked at all of the different soaps and washes that filled the shower as the warm water hit his skin. There were a couple of artifacts all over the house left behind from Judy and this was no exception. Seeing the different bottles that all did one thing or another were perched along the side of the shower, he wondered what they did as he tried to enjoy the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a nice reward for all of the work he had been doing around the house...work. He thought about that for a moment while using some of Rob's shampoo. He had been living off of the kindness of his friend for so long and how does he repay Rob? Sleeping late, eating his food and using up his toiletries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, no more. Today I am going to start pulling my own weight around here. The cleaning was a good start, but more can be done. I'm going to head out and fill out as many applications as it takes until I get a job. At this point, I don't even care where I work.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In a forest just outside of Celadon City, a Hypno stumbles around in the dark. He had lost his trainer a few weeks ago, Ashley, and was desperate to find her. This had been the longest that he had ever been from is owner and he wasn't taking it well at all. He grew up in her care since he was a little drowzee and had never had to survive in the wild on his own. He had many close calls and was very weak from the constant fighting. He had just gathered some leaves he intended to use as a makeshift bed when he heard voices in the distance. He wanted to sleep, but what if this was her? He used the last of his strength to bring himself to his feet and make his way toward the voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot far from there, Ash, Brock, and Misty were making camp. It had been years since the three of them had been traveling together in Kanto but it felt nice to do it again and with Ash and Misty arguing, it felt just like old times again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh had been feeling kind of uncertain about himself the last few months. He was thinking back to his adventures in Kanto and never realized before how many Gym badges he had never won through legal battles. That kept nagging at him until he decided to retrace his footsteps and re-challenge the gym leaders that he felt he never truly earned his badges from. He re-battled Brock who then invited himself along on his mini quest, and then the same happened with Misty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had finished putting up their tents and were sitting around a campfire eating something Brock cooked up. They were about one day away from Celadon City, where he planned to battle Erika. She had given him the rainbow badge after he risked his life to save her Gloom from a fire set by Team Rocket about seven or eight years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust outside of sight, Hypno was watching. His eyes darted back and forth to the faces sitting by the fire and he tried to focus his eyes. He looked hard, but it didn't seem like she was there. His heart sank and started to weep quietly when he heard the one with red hair speak to the one with black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think you are all set for your battle with Erika, Ash?\u201d Misty asked. Hearing the name Ash, Hypno stopped crying and looked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I am. That battle is as good as won.\u201d Ash mumbled with a mouth full of food. Hypno stared at the black haired human. That couldn't be her could it? The height looked right and the hair was the right color but that voice didn't sound right and she would never dress like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not so sure, tell me, what are planing on wearing?\u201d Misty questioned with a funny look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh raised an eyebrow, \u201cThe same thing I always wear and anyway why would that matter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I was just thinking. Since you have been retracing your steps I thought you might have planned to get dressed up again, Ashley.\u201d Misty giggled. Hypno could not believe what he just heard. The red haired human called the other one Ashley. If that was her, then they could be together again, pokemon and trainer. He wouldn't have to be alone anymore. Everything would be right again. Yes, yes. Why didn't he see it before? Of course it was her. He had found her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh and Misty ended up getting into another fight while Brock and Pikachu wisely stayed out of it. It eventually ended with them both storming off to their own tents and Brock putting out the fire then turning in himself, all while Hypno watched.</span></div></div>",

Pikachu, startled, arched his back and readied himself for a battle. Hypno, however, just shuffled passed him and went for the tent. Quickly, Pikachu dashed in front of the tent's entrance just before Hypno made it in. Not knowing what this pikachu's problem was and not wanting to waste anymore time, he dropped his pendulum and used Hypnosis. Pikachu did his best o fight it, but ended up succumbing to Hypno's attack. Before Pikachu even hit the dirt, Hypno was inside Ash's tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding before Ash's sleeping form, Hypno was overcome with emotion. He jumped on top of Ash and hugged him tightly and started crying again. They were together again, now he wouldn't be lonely any more. He'd never let her go. He and Ashley would be together forever. The sudden jostling quickly forced Ash upright. Ash felt someone crying into his neck, with strong arms squeezing him. Frightened, he grabbed a flashlight and turned it on relieving the shadowy form of a hypno grabbing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh tried to yell but couldn't find his voice as he tried to push the pokemon away. Hypno looked up with watery eyes not knowing why Ashley was acting like this. Did she not love him anymore? Then it hit him. The last she had seen him, he was still a drowzee. All the fighting that he had been forced to do had triggered his evolution. She didn't know it was him! It was ok, he could fix this. It would all be fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Hypno dropped the pendulum that he used on Pikachu and used Hypnosis. Ash stopped struggling and grew still while Hypno chanted. Though he couldn't speak the human language, he had learned to use Psychic. He opened the bridge between their minds and spoke to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you hear me?\u201d Hypno asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Ash responed, his voice monotone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Hypno. I used to be your drowzee until we were separated. I have been searching for you ever since. Do you understand?\u201d Hypno was hopeful that now that he had calmed Ashley down, she would remember him, even if he looked different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are Hypno. You used to be my drowzee until we were separated. You have been searching for me ever since. I understand.\u201d Ash stated with no emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWake Up!\u201d Hypno clapped twice and Ash started to blink. He shook the fog from his head and when he looked back, there was his Hypno sitting right in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHypno, your back!\u201d Ash yelled excitedly as he reached out for him. Hypno jumped into his arms, ecstatic. He was so happy that she remembered him now. Of course if he was in his right mind, he would have known that had just created the memories, not resurface old ones. The thought never entered his head. All that was in his head right now was having things go back to being the way they were before he had is pretty trainer, Ashley, lost each other. In fact, he was going to make sure things were better than before. Now he was going to make sure Ashley got everything she ever wanted.</span></div></div>",

He was kept warm against her chest, but something was wrong. He realized that her chest wasn't as soft or round as it used to be, instead, if was much smaller. It was strange, but he would worry about that later. Her Hypno was back, so he could find some way to help her fix that later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Hypno and Ash woke to the smell of Brock cooking breakfast. They did a bit of stretching and walked out of the tent, Ash just barely stepping on a still sleeping Pikachu. At about the same time, Misty stepped out of her tent, rubbing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning guys I hope you are hungry because I made a whole bun-\u201d Brock stopped half way seeing a sleepy and disheveled Hypno. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right. Everyone, I'd like you to meet Hypno. He used to be my drowzee until we were separated. He has been searching for me ever since.\u201d Ash said, gesturing to Hypno. \u201cHe found me last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the more the merrier. Here you go, Hypno,\u201d Brock handed Hypno some food that he had prepared. \u201cI wish I knew you were hear earlier, then I could have tailored your breakfast to you. I hope this is ok.\u201d Hypno didn't know who the tall guy was, but he liked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean you were separated?\u201d Misty inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think it means?\u201d Ash spat while getting himself something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what, you just misplaced your pokemon? I've known for a long time that you were irresponsible but this is terrible. Did you even look for him?\u201d Misty complained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I did...I think\u201d Ash said, feeling a bit confused for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypno was busy eating, so he didn't hear the words that were being said, but he did get the feelings behind them. This is the second time he heard the two of them going back and forth like this. He did not care for this red haired girl that was mean to his Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh and Misty bickered for a bit and once their spat subsided, they began eating. Hypno watched Ashley eat and was once again a bit confused. Her posture was wrong and she was eating very sloppily. She is bound to choke doing that. He is going to have to fix that for her own safety. Hypno looked over at the red haired girl and saw her sitting and eating in a proper manner while she was reading a magazine with a crabby on the cover. Though he didn't like her, she would have to do as an example. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock had just gone back into his tent when Hypno brought out his pendulum. Ash just glanced over at Hypno and quickly feel back into a trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want you to look at the red haired girl\u201d Hypno commanded in Ash's mind. Ash obeyed, looking over at Misty. \u201cI want you to study the way she holds herself. Now, I want you to try and do the same. Try and hold yourself like she does.\u201d Ash sat up straight, put his knees together and crossed his ankles. Misty was oblivious to what was happening while Hypno instructed Ash to eat more daintily and not shovel huge chunks of food into his mouth. By the time Brock came back, Hypno had finished getting Ash to sit and eat like the young lady he thought he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright everyone. Lets pack up and get a move on \u201c Brock said cheerily. With that, the folded up their tents and packed up their belongings. Pikachu had just woken up by the time they were ready to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry sleepy head, I grabbed you some food, since you slept in,\u201d Ash said scooping up a groggy Pikachu. Hypno watched the display of friendship with some jealousy.</span></div></div>",

Pikatchu, sitting on Ash's shoulder, was still in a haze after Hypno's attack and was still trying to shake it off. Hypno limped along with a grin on his face, holding Ash's hand. Ash couldn't help but notice hypno's limp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright Hypno?\u201d Ash asked concerned. Hypno nodded but Ash was still worried. \u201cHere, just get in your pokeball and we'll get you checked out at the pokecenter in Celadon,\u201d Ash felt around on his person for Hypno's pokeball but couldn't find it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, you lose that too?\u201d Misty scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I just can't find it right now,\u201d Ash barked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slightly exasperated Brock finally chimed in, \u201cCome on you two, don't you think it's a little early to be going at it already. Just enjoy the smell of the air, the sound of the bird pokemon in the trees, the beauty of the...surroundings\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that they all saw a lovely lady in a fancy dress walking in their direction. She was accompanied by an older gentleman in a suit. It didn't take Brock long to go into his normal routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran up to her and took her hands into his, \u201cHi, I'm Brock. I know we just me but I just wanted to tell you that you are beautiful and I was thinking that maybe, if you weren't busy, we could go out sometime and catch a movie then get some dinner and take a walk and get married and have some kids-\u201d Misty grabbed Brock's ear and dragged him away, just like old times. The sudden outburst frightened Hypno and he took cover behind Ash's legs and hid his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hello,\u201d the lady said and curtsied to Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, hi.\u201d Ash said scratching his head. Hypno looked up at Ashley's back. That was rude of her, he thought, she should have curtsied. She told him before that it was proper manners, had she forgotten that too? Poor girl, being away from him must have done something to her. Well, Hypno was here now. Hypno would help her remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss, we must be going if we are to make it back before sundown,\u201d The older man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, of course. I'm sorry, we need to go.\u201d She said curtsying to Ash again and then the both of them moved on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey seemed a bit distracted,\u201d said Misty watching them go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, it's too bad, I would have liked to get a battle in.\u201d Ash said a bit disappointed. Ash picked up Hypno and held him so he didn't have to limp the rest of the way to Celadon City they started walking again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust out of ear shot the girl spoke to the older gentleman, \u201cOh Reginald, today is the day. I know we are going to find my sweet little Drowzee, I can feel it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReginald responded, \u201cNow don't get your hopes up. You have been looking for Drowzee everyday and there has been no sign of him. Maybe its time we stopped looking and you got a new pokemon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl stopped and turned, \u201cReginald! How can you say such a thing? He is not some thing that I can just go out and replace! I am going to look for him every day until I find him. If you do not wish to join me, then you can go back home and I'll search alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA slightly guilty Reginald responded, \u201cI'm sorry, I only want what is best for you, Miss Ashley.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Not only did he misplace Hypno, but he didn't even go out looking for him? Now that I think about it, that's really out of character for him.

When did you lose him?\u201d Misty inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe wondered off into the woods by himself almost three weeks ago. He would sneak out sometimes to battle wild pokemon. I've tried so hard to give him toys to entertain him with, I would take im for walks in a stroller, I'd enter him into contests but no matter how I tried, he still would go out to fight. He is so fragile, I hate that he puts himself into danger like that. What if...what he really got hurt this time.\u201d Miss Ashley started to tear up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPokemon are very strong creatures, I sure he could take care of himself,\u201d Misty tried to comfort Miss Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot my Drowzee. You see, when I was younger, Mother and Reginald took me to a store to buy my first pokemon. I was ever so excited that I hardly slept the night before. The owner showed me so many impressive looking pokemon, I didn't know what to pick. When we got to the pen of drowzees there was just one. The owner told us that he was the runt of the litter and the last one from that batch of eggs. It turned out that one of his leg's never fully developed while in his egg but I didn't care. My mother tried to talk me out of it, but I made my decision. He needed someone and I needed him. He's my best friend, and that's why I wouldn't let him fight, I don't want anything to happen to him.\u201d Sniffed a watery eyed Miss Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not 100% but I think I know were your pokemon is,\u201d Misty said, thinking back to the Limping Hypno. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock and Ash were not too far from the city when Brock asked if they could take a quick break. After carrying both Pikachu and Hypno, Ash was happy to sit down for a little bit. Brock walked off by himself while Ash sat on a log, putting Pikachu and Hypno down on either side of him. Though Hypno enjoyed being in Ashley's arms again, she really jostled him around while she was walking. Not smooth and graceful like normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much longer guys, then we can rest in the city.\u201d Ash said to his pokemon. The city, Hypno thought, they were bound to me a lot of people there and he still hadn't helped Ashley remember her manners. He pulled out his pendulum and shook Ash's arm. Ash looked over and once again, was in a trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want you to think a back to the last time you saw someone curtsey. When you introduce yourself to people, I want you to curtsey and greet them sweetly, okay?\u201d Ash nodded in understanding after thinking about meeting miss Ashley. That's good, now she won't accidentally be rude to people. Thinking about it, Hypno decided that now would be a good time to help her with her gracefulness as well. \u201cI would also like you to move more gracefully. When ever you walk and move, try and be as ladylike as you can, understand?\u201d Again Ash nodded. Pleased that he was being so helpful, Hypno released Ashley from her trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Ash was free, he instantly sat up and crossed his legs at the knee. He placed one hand on his knee and brushed a bit of hair behind his ear.</span></div></div>",

Before he could recover his balance, he was struck by a yellow blur. Hypno landed on his back, his pendant flinging from his hand, while he felt a sudden weight on his chest. Pikachu hovered over Hypno, cheeks sparking. Hypno struggled to get free while Pikachu demanded to know what he did to Ash. <br>\r\n\"Pikachu, Stop!\" Ash called, drawing Pikachu's attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypno saw his chance and used Headbutt on the distracted electric mouse. Pikachu fell back, caught off-guard, and Hypno stumbled toward his pendant.

With his Agility suddenly disabled, Pikachu lost his footing and slid in the mud, slipping a few times before getting enough traction to chase after Hypno again. Just as Hypno grabbed his pendant he was struck by a Thunderbolt. Disoriented, he mad a wild blast with a Psybeam which Pikachu dodged. Hypno tried to set off a Confusion attack, but Pikachu shook it off. Hypno tried another Psybeam but Pikachu Slam attacked him before he could fire it.

Hypno didn't know what sparked the battle, but he couldn't help being impressed by the little pokemon. The Pikachu was very strong, much stronger than he was, and he found himself admiring the small electric pokemon. Hypno always wanted to be a great battler, that's why he went off alone in the first place. Ashley would never let him fight because of his leg, but he knew that could do it if they started training like she had obviously been training Pikachu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you attack Hypno?\" Ash asked while mud dripped off his nose. Pikachu tried to explain that he saw Hypno doing something to him, but Hypno cut in that he was just trying to help her. Pikachu and Hypno kept going back and forth, talking over each other, leaving Ash with a garbled mess of noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough!\" Ash shouted, silencing the two of them. \"I know its been awhile since Hypno has been with us but he is back now. He is part of our group so I don't want to see anymore of this fighting, understand?\" Pikachu grumbled a reluctant agreement, glaring at Hypno. Pikachu didn't know what was going on but he wasn't going to forget about this either. Until he knows what to do, he'll have to keep an eye on Hypno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything alright?\" Brock asked, jogging over to them after exciting the woods. Brock looked over the muddy trio, \"I thought I heard a battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, but that's taken care of now.\" Ash spat out, placing a hand on his cocked hip. \"You ready? Apparently, we need to hit a bathhouse or something.\" It was then that Ash noticed something in the mud. Daintily picking it up, it was revealed to be a pair of his jeans that were in his bag. Looking around, he saw more articles of clothing strewn about. He took off his backpack and was annoyed to find it empty, with a big hole in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, and now all of my clothes need to be washed.\" Ash huffed trying to gather everything up.</span></div></div>",

Though Ash was still fairly aggravated by the impromptu battle between Pikachu and Hypno, he knew that he had to calm down so that he could think clearly once he re-challenge the Celadon gym leader. It had been a long time since Ash had visited this city to challenge Erika for the Rainbow Badge but the memories were still fresh in his mind. The perfume, the disguise, and the fire that he had rescued Erika's Gloom from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHear we are, Marina's Bathhouse,\u201d Brock stated merrily, shaking Ash from his thoughts. The bathhouse is a simple building, white on the outside walls with thick wooden trim. Inside's much the same except hanging on the walls are cute little paintings of water pokemon playing. In the center of the main entrance is a large desk with an older looking woman sitting behind it, reading a book of some kind. Behind her are a bunch of shelves with assortments of toiletries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere,\u201d Ash said to Brock while holding out his soiled backpack. \u201cDo you think you could find somewhere to wash my clothes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing how aggravated Ash was acting recently, he figured it be nice to give him one less thing to worry about. \u201cSure, would you like me to hold on to your pokemon, too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, here you go,\u201d He said handing Brock his pokeballs. \u201cI'll keep Pikachu and Hypno with my, they need to get cleaned up anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod, Brock is on his way out the door and Ash turns to approach the woman at the front desk. When he turns, however, he bumps right into a very large woman that had cut in line in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman turns to Ash, a displeased look on her face, holding a small tray of cleaning products. \u201cWell?\u201d she says blankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what?\u201d Ash says raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren't you going to say excuse me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy should I? I never would have bumped into you if you didn't cut in line.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmph, you should learn some manners, little boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman hit a sore spot and Ash was boiling, again. Though he was no longer a child, he wasn't the tallest guy and still had a slight frame, which he had always been a bit sensitive about. \u201cWhat! I'm not a little boy!You're the one that should learn some manners!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypno pulled at Ashley's pant leg, trying to get her attention. He didn't know why she was acting so aggressively and wanted her to stop yelling. She seemed to get really upset at being called a boy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh looked down at at Hypno and saw that he looked upset. Kneeling down, Ash patted him on the head to comfort him, \u201cIt's alright big guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman took this time to disengage from the argument and by the time Ash was done reassuring Hypno, she had slipped into the woman's changing room.</span></div></div>",

As Ash put the things Marina gave him on a bench, he took a quick look around; the room was white with powder blue lockers along the walls, each of which was numbered. Amongst the items that Ash was given was a long chain with a key attached. On the key, was the number 15, and after looking around the room, ash found the corresponding locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh disrobed, put his clothes into the locker and then quickly looked for something to cover himself with in the pile he place on the bench. He found a white bathrobe with a very faded red trim and quickly put it on. The robe fell very short on him, hanging well above the knee. Ash sat on the bench, crossing his legs, and sorted the bathing items. He gave both Pikachu a washcloth to hold and Hypno a basket of cleaning supplies. Collecting what was left, Ash headed out to the bathing area with his two pokemon following behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathing area was a bit hard to navigate due to a great deal of steam in the air wafting about. Luckily, Ash was able to find a an empty stall quickly enough. Once inside he hung up the robe then sat down on a stool that was provided. Ash called Hypno over and began washing the mud out of his fur. First he was rinsed with warm water then with Pikachu's help, began sudsing him up with shampoo. After another rinse of warm water it was Pikachu's turn to get cleaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypno saw Ashley had started to work on Pikachu, so he looked in the basket, and saw all of the things that Ashley liked to use for when she bathed. Hypno took it upon himself To help Ashley like she just helped him. He lathered her up with some scented soap then began to shampoo her hair. Her hair was much more bristly than normal, and he hoped the shampoo would make it soft and silky like he knows she likes. It was while Ashley hair was in suds, Hypno saw how hairy her body had gotten. He knew, however, what bottle she used to get rid of it. Applied it to her skin with a brush, careful not to get any on himself and scrubbed off the hair from her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile shampooing Pikachu, Ash heard a familiar voice. It was the rude lady that he was arguing with that he bumped into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is she in the wrong room?\" Ash said to himself. He listen closely then heard other voices, also belonging to women. Slowly it dawned on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't stay here, I have to get out before she sees me.\" as exclaimed in a panicked whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypno heard how upset Ashley was and tried to calm her down, but she wasn't listening. He knew the best way to help her, however, and once again used his trusty pendant. Like each time before, she was went stiff her eyes went blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have as much right to be here as she does,\" Hypno tried to explain, not realizing that it was coming off as a command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have as much right to be here as she does,\" Ashley repeated in a monotone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. Don't worry about what she thinks. Now lets finish here, and enjoy the bath for a while.\" Hypno suggested. Ashley repeated him again and then Hypno released the hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh shook his head then continued to shampoo the unaware Pikachu. He knew that he was upset before but couldn't remember why. It was something about they rude lady seeing him here, but that didn't make any sense. Sure he was in the woman's wash room, but he has as much right to be here as she does, he thought to himself. He didn't dwell on it, instead he finished up Pikachu and rinsed himself off. He put the Robe back on and was surprised at how soft it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey gathered their things and headed to the bath. The rude lady had just exited her on stall and saw Ash glide by in the white and pink robe, brushing his silken hear out of his eyes. Ash payed her no mind as he daintily stepped past her. The woman's face turned red, not with anger but with embarrassment for calling this poor girl a boy earlier.</span></div></div>",

Ash want not sure if the spring was naturally occurring, but none the less was looking foreword to a nice relaxing soak. The room was filled with vapor from the hot water, which obscured the shapes of the women that were already there. Lucky for Ash, that also meant that there was little chance of someone seeing him and getting upset at his presence. Of course Ash wasn't thinking about that, nor was he thinking about how he was in the wrong side of the spring; all that was on his mind was enjoying the bath for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh disrobed and placed everything he had in a neat pile just out of reach of the water. Once convinced the robe wouldn't get too wet, he slipped into the water with his Pokemon. He rested his head on the edge of the spring and closed his eyes, letting the heat wash over him while his mind drifted. As it usually does, his mind settled on thoughts of pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erika is known for her grass type pokemon, like her Gloom. Fire or Ice moves would be really good against her...but she might be expecting that,\" Ash thought out loud as he was making his battle plan for his upcoming gym match. He looked over at Pikachu and Hypno setting next to him in the spring. Hypno was all smiles, playfully splashing Pikachu while Pikachu didn't look too amused. Ash pulled Hypno away from the grumpy mouse pokemon and put himself between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think Pikachu is in the the mood to play right now,\" Ash said with a smile. Ash looked at Hypno and thought for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Gloom isn't just a Grass type pokemon, it's also a Poison type. Actually, now that I think about it, a lot of Grass types are also Poison types,\" Ash said with a wry smile while Hypno and Pikachu just looked up confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That settles it, You and I are going to beat the Celadon City Gym,\" he stated grining at Hypno. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypno wasn't expecting to hear that coming from Ashley as she never let him battle before. Tears began welling up in his eyes as a huge smile appeared on his face. He gave Ashley a big hug then started bouncing and splashing around, unable to contain his joy. Pikachu couldn't help but smile, seeing just how happy Hypno was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypno was still beaming when they made their way back to the locker room. Ash was glad to see Hypno was excited for the fight but something was bothering him. He was coming up with some ideas on how to use Hypno's strengths to their advantage, but it felt like this was the first time that he was thinking about it. It was almost like they never battled together before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" A voice called from behind and Ash turned to see the lady that he had the spat with earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I uh... just wanted to say that I'm sorry about earlier. I was rude, it was uncalled for and I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Ash said a little taken aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Nora, by the way\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh curtsied in the pink bath robe, \"Ash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I have to go. Again, I'm really sorry. Oh, wait,\" She stopped and reached in to her purse then pulled out a small piece of paper and handed it to Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here is my card, come by later. It's on me,\" She said with a nervous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" he said as she left. He didn't know why she was being so nice but again, he couldn't bring himself to worry about what she thought. He looked down at the card which just said \"Nora's\" and had an address.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's descriptive.\"</span></div></div>",

Either way, Ash's clothes were missing! It seems like someone else has left their clothes in his locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypno, upon seeing his beloved Ashley's confused face, peers into the locker. What Hypno sees delights him. It appears as though someone has left clothing that Ashley used to wear! How nice of the person who left these.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Hypno didn't know that these clothes actually belonged to the real Ashley, who had just passed by Ash unaware of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it looks like my clothes are missing guys. I don't know what to do about this. I can't very well go outside wearing nothing... but I can't just take these clothes.\" Ash said, with an air of sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypno was confused at this, these clothes were so similar to the clothes Ashley usually wears, so why isn't she just putting them on? Then it hits him. Of course! Ashley must've forgotten that these are her clothes. He would help her remember. He pulled out his trusty pendulum... and just like the many times before, put Ash into a hypnotized state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These clothes belong to you, of course. Never mind those old silly clothes, these are your favorites!\" Hypno said, not knowing how commanding his tone was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! How could I have forgotten. These ARE my clothes, I should just get changed into them.\" Ash said, snapping out of the hypnosis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu, on the other hand, wasn't having any of this. His trainer wasn't like this! He would make Ash see what this Hypno was doing. Pikachu tugged on Ash's leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Pikachu? What's wrong, buddy?\" Ash said in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu tried to explain to Ash that he was not acting right, and that he was about to put on girl's clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? But these are my favorites... are you sure Pikachu? I don't think they're meant for girls\". Ash replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypno could see that Ashley's Pikachu was acting strange. Then Hypno realized. This Pikachu must've met his dear Ashley when she was struggling with her identity! This Pikachu only knew the strange Ashley who called herself \"Ash\" all the time. Hypno wondered why Ashley wouldn't respond to her own name too, he'd have to fix that. So many things he had to help her with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled out his trusty pendulum again, and put both Ash and Pikachu under his spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been a bit concerned about you two. For one, Pikachu thinks you're a boy of all things, and secondly you never respond to Ashley. You need to remember that you're a girl! And start using your real name. No more of this \"Ash\" thing. You are Ashley! Pikachu, try and remember Ashley as a girl, and remember that she is very feminine! I am only trying to help her, so please try to help as well.\" With that being said, Hypno released the Hypnosis, again not realizing how commanding he sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu blinked confused, as memories were being re-written. He had always been friends with Ashley. Wait... that didn't seem right. Ashley was always his favorite trainer, she had always helped Pikachu grow stronger. Why could Pikachu only remember Ashley as a girl? And with that name? Pikachu stopped worrying about it as the memories finished shifting. Of course Ashley is a girl! She always has been!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh, or rather Ashley, on the other hand, was easy to over-write. After all, his memories had already been tampered with, and he was already under the impression that he was a very feminine boy. Now he remembered himself as a she. Her name was Ashley, right? Yes, that sounds right. She had always been a pretty girl, and these clothes belonged solely to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ashley' got changed into her own clothes and, without any more hassle, left the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypno reflected on what he had seen in the bath. Had Ashley grown some kind of worm on her crotch? Whatever it was, it was definitely not there before. He had seen Ashley bathe before, and he would certainly remember something like that. These things would definitely need to be fixed. He also noticed the lack of bumps on her chest. Ashley hadn't grown too developed, only having around a B-Cup, but somehow she had lost her bumps, and Hypno meant to fix that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley stopped by the laundry machines to check in on Brock, however he seemed rather busy, so she left to explore the rest of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere should she go next?</span></div></div>",

He wasn't looking forward to putting on his muddy outfit but there wasn't much else he could do, or so he thought. In the hall he was stopped by Marina, the woman that owned the place, who was holding a basket of random items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, good. I caught you in time,\u201d Marina smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, hi. Is something wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, nothing is wrong. I just thought that since it didn't look like you had a spare set of clothes, you might not want to put those muddy things back on. With that in mind, I collected things from our 'lost and found' box. I have been meaning to get around to clearing out the older items anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, that's really nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed Ash the box and left him to look for something to get changed into. He wasn't super happy with having to wear someone's  forgotten things but it did beat the alternative.  Ash placed out the items, on by one onto a bench and looked them over. It looked like the best Marina could come up with was a simple hoodie and black shorts along with a pair of pink socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWouldn't be my fist choice but here we are. Maybe we should look for a shop and grab something something else to change into once we are done here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Ash dropped the robe and slipped up the shorts on his now hairless legs, which he finally noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?...That's not good...\u201d Ash blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypno silently took note of Ashley's displeasure of having to wear shorts with a hint of relief. She had always been a more of a fan of skirts and dresses and it looked like she still remembered that. He was looking forward to helping her find something cute to wear later. Pikachu jumped up on the bench and gave Ash a concerned look. Hypno wondered if Pikachu knew what she used to wear, too. He could tell that Pikachu was really a good pokemon inside but so far things have been a little rough. Ever since Hypno arrived, Pikachu was abrasive if not outright aggressive but it was clear he cared about Ashley. He hoped that Pikachu wasn't normally always so worked up before he was around. Ashley did say he was acting out of character...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no...I see now,\u201d Hypno thought. \u201cPikachu must think that since I'm back, I'm going to replace him.  He must be so scared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh looked over the empty bottles from the shower and found the depilatory that Hypno had used on him. Though frustrated at the event, there was no use in being mad at a pokemon that was just doing his best to help. In the end, he decided that there wasn't anything he could about his legs at the moment and he should just move on and grab some pants before his friends saw him. He was sure Misty would have a grand old time at his expense.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hoodie was next and immediately Ash saw that it was a bit big. Even so, he slipped it on and felt it hang on him in a way he wasn't used to. The front was oddly baggier at the chest and it was so long that it almost covered the shorts completely, which wasn't saying much since the shorts weren't the longest pair out there. After slipping on the pink socks, he looked at himself and felt kind of ridiculous. He grabbed his muddy shoes and slipped them on, dirty as they were, the inside was dry at least. Now finished, he place the the bath items into a collection bin and turned his attention to his muddy things. After considering getting them washed too but chose to just toss them out instead. He reasoned that if he was going to get a new outfit, he wouldn't need to carry that one around anymore. He tossed it out and he, along with his pokemon, left the bathhouse.</span></div></div>",

Though wearing a hoodie, he still felt exposed due to having so much of those legs showing. It didn't help that he kept getting weird looks from people as he passed them. Their expressions were hard to place and he steadily grew more uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo I really look that weird? I feel like I'm I being stared at.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh stopped outside a cafe window and looked at his reflection. He cringed, taking in his appearance, not surprised by how ridiculous he looked but still not pleased. He looked unnervingly feminine, which was really effecting his male ego. He almost looked...cute. Ash's was shaken from his thoughts when he heard a set of familiar voices, much to his annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrepare for trouble!\"<br>\r\n\"And make it double!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh rolled his eyes and shook his head. \u201cCan you guys wait until later? Now isn't a good time,\u201d Ash turned to face the voices but was surprised to not be their focus. Team Rocket was doing their normal introduction but instead of Ash, they were announcing to a young man and his eevee. Ash jumped behind a car parked along the road and crouched down after realizing who they were talking to. Pikachu and Hypno looked at each other and shrugged before joining Ash behind the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's Gary doing here?\u201d Ash peaked out from the rear of the car to get a better look. In Gary's arms what a large case of some kind, similar to a cooler chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary looked just as annoyed as Ash had been, \u201cYou guys are still doing this? What do you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat case looks heavy,\u201d James struck a pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe just want to help lighten your burden,\u201d Jessie mirrored James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? I thought we wanted the Fossils?\u201d Meowth scratched his heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of them bantered as Ash watched while Hypno tried to make sense for this newest odd behavior. Hypno didn't understand why Ashley was hiding after seeing the guy named Gary but she was staring at him pretty intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should go over there...but I can't let Gary see me like this,\u201d Ash muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it dawned on Hypno what was going on. She must really like this guy but was too nervous to know how to act around him. She was clearly self-conscious which, of course, Hypno didn't like seeing. His Ashley was great, anyone could see that, she just needed to see that too. If she wanted Gary to be her boyfriend, then Hypno was going to make sure that would be what happened.</span></div></div>",

Ekans, Get me that case!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing Jessie's lead, James sent out a koffing, much to the surprise of Ash. He didn't recall when the last time they they had those kinds of pokemon. He had to assume that they had picked them up for nostalgia's sake once they got to Kanto. He didn't get much time to register the sight as the chaos started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEkans lunged forward and made a strike for the case but both Gary and Eevee were ready. With a quick shout from Gary, Eevee dashed forward and tackled at the large snake's face. The strike landed true, knocking the snake to the ground while the koffing closed in. Using the momentum from the first attack, Gary directed Eevee to preform a quick attack, knocking the koffing out of the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's guard dropped while watching them battle seeing how well Gary and Eevee handled themselves. Their experience as a battlers was still serving them well, it seemed, not to mention Team Rocket's pokemon were still rookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings made an unfortunate turn, however, as Jessie's ekans wrapped itself around Eevee and glared into his face. The pokemon stiffened, unable to move or act. Koffing followed up forming a smoke screen that obscured the view of the fight from Ash and his pokemon. Not willing to sit out any longer, Ash jumped out and dashed into the smoke. Though difficult to see, they made out the forms of Eevee and Ekans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHypno, use your Psybeam on the Ekans,\u201d Ash cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypno planted his feet and reached out his arm, aiming his pendant. Gathering his focus he launched a multicolored beam of energy out and got a lucky on the snake. Gary scrabbled to his knees and picked up his Eevee into his arms. Koffing, seeing the new combatant panicked and released jets of smog around the area. Gary instinctively covered his pokemon and tried to sprint out of the zone, his eyes stinging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKoffing, no!\u201d James cried before he and his partners were consumed by smog. He called back his pokemon but the damage was already done. With the battle having turned and a new trainer entering the scene, Team Rocket decided to cut their loses and retreat for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHypno!\u201d Ash called out, getting a lung full of smog. Coughing, he grabbed Hypno and dashed out of the radius of the area as his throat burned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the smoke cleared, Ash looked over Hypno, who was luckily okay. Once he was sure his pokemon was fine, he turned his attention to Gary. He was happy to see that they both looked alright. Gray's eevee was already alert, ready to keep fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's over buddy. I think we got some help,\u201d he said, squinting over to Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was about to speak but then remembered his state of dress. Suddenly self conscious, Ash froze, not knowing what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, thanks for the assist. I guess it got a little out of hand there. My name is Gary,\u201d rubbing his eyes Gary walked over to a puzzled Ash.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ash was confused at the introduction until he saw Gary having trouble focusing his eyes. He figured that Gary couldn't really see him well, while unfortunate, it did mean that Ash wouldn't have to explain himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh curtsied on instinct and began to speak but he couldn't get more than a whisper out of his mouth. He tried again but still, nothing came out. He grabbed his neck and made one final attempt before giving up. Gary rubbed his eyes once more and blinked, attempting to clear his vision. Ash pointed at his throat, which Gary was only just barely able to make out threw the blur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, you lost your voice? I'm sorry you got hurt saving our butts. I really appreciate you stepping in when you did. I was transporting some fossils to a former colleague of mine who lives here and if Team Rocket had gotten them, our research project would have gone...up in smoke.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary was pulled from his line of thought by Eevee as he slowly pushed the cooler into Gary's leg. He crouched down and clumsily reached out and scratched his pokemon's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, little buddy. Not sure what we are going to do now though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh knew exactly what they were going to do. He bent down and got the attention of his pokemon, pointed at himself and then to the chest. He walked over to the cooler, grabbed a handle and pointed to them before pointing the other end. Pikachu and Hypno understood and stepped over and lifted the other end of the cooler together. Once Eevee saw what was happening, he crouched under the chest and joined the other pokemon in lifting. With the cooler secure, Ash took Gary's hand into his own. Gary smiled as Ash lead them all down the sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether they all walked carefully into the direction of a Pokecenter in hopes that they might be able to help Ash and Gary out. Being the only one able to speak, Gary told Ash about himself. Ash silently chuckled to himself at hearing Gary explain who he was and where he was from. Once he got his voice back, they were going to laugh about this later. Of course, only after he had gotten changed into something less silly looking. It wan't long before, they all arrived at the pokecenter and were greeted by a curious nurse Joy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome. How can I help you today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe got into an altercation with a bunch of thieves and a liberal use of smog. All of our pokemon need to be looked over but this trainer and I got it pretty bad too,\u201d Gary explained, unable to figure out where she was exactly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh dear. That's horrible but don't worry, you are all in good hands. Can I get your names and what your symptoms are?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm Gary Oak and I'm having trouble seeing but I don't know their name. Looks like the smog messed with their vocal chords.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Joy frowned hearing what happened and instructed the group to take a seat. They all sat down and waited for Nurse Joy to get everything ready.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, so, I don't know how long this is going to take and I'm sure you are busy but I'd really like it if you'd let me thank you. Would you be interested in joining me for dinner tonight?\u201d Gary asked with a hint of nervousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh, never one to turn down food, nodded. Once he was sure Ash said yes, he told him the place and time just as Nurse Joy came round with a wheel chair. Gary and Eevee said goodbye before being taken away. It was a short wait before she came back for the rest of them and were taken to another room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short examination, Joy was able to confirm that Hypno and Pikachu were both fine. Unfortunately for Ash, his vocal chords were swollen and inflamed. Nurse Joy opened a cabinet and pulled out a pink bottle as well as a small paper cup. She poured the contents into the cup and instructed Ash to drink it, which he did after sniffing the cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe relief was immediate but his voice was still gone. She assured him that his voice would not only be back sooner than later, he would also be pleasantly surprised with the sound. Ash didn't pay that last bit any mind since he didn't really care how he sounds but was happy with how the medicine soothed his throat. As they finished up, she wrote him a script and told him that he could pick up a bottle at the Celadon Department Store. Ash gaver her the softist of squeks of thanks before leaving with a destination in mind. Not only were they going to get the medicine, the department store sounded like a great place to pick up something else to wear. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Though it wasn't the first time he had ever seen the Celadon Department Store, Ash was still taken aback by the size of the place. The building reached into the clouds, the windows shining with the reflected sun, stunning Ash for just a moment. A moment was all it took to keep Ash's thoughts occupied while he was approached by a sales girl holding a bottle up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like to try a free sample?\u201d she chirped with a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh turned with a soft \u201chmm?\u201d that the girl took as a sound of acceptance rather than of questioning. In a flash, Ash was surrounded by a cloud of purple smoke. The mist forced its way up his nose and into his lungs, burning as it did so. In between coughs he tried to ask what she just sprayed him with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm happy you asked! This brand new perfume was made with love in our hearts and on our mind at the Celadon Gym! Though we believe all of our perfumes are special, this one is especially so.  Its a secret blend of fragrance with a base of wormadam flower essence imported from the Sinnoh region. Wormadam is unique in that it is the only plant based pokemon that naturally learns 'Attract' as it grows and with that in mind we set forth on making a perfume that would do just-\u201d She was cut off by Ash who squeaked out a \u201cno thanks\u201d as he made his way to the elevator. Thanks to the spray, his head was feeling a little odd. He hopped that getting away from the area would help him feel less strange.<br>\r\n\u201cIf you change your mind, you can buy a bottle at the Celadon Gym!\u201d she waved as he and his pokemon disappeared behind closing elevator doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe just got a... bath. What...what happened,\u201d Ash clutched his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter speaking a few more phrases to himself and doing his best to return his voice back to it's proper octave, he found himself unable to make himself sound any deeper. It had been such a strange day and it seemed like it was only getting weirder as it went on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors to the elevator  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypno smiled hearing the voice that came out of Ashley's mouth. It sounded different than he remembered but still very pretty, not to mention much prettier than the one she was speaking with before. As the doors opened into the pharmacy level, Hypno made a mental note to help remind her to keep taking it, so she doesn't forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelves segmented the pharmacy into multiple sections, each with numerous health items from humans and pokemon, alike. Ash assumed that the place probably smelled like antiseptic but for the moment, all he could smell was the flowery remains of that spray from downstairs. As they entered, they were greeted by a man at a counter as they entered. The team stepped over where Ash curtsied and introduced himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really need to talk to her about using that nickname,\u201d Hypno thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a breathy voice, Ash explained what he needed and handed over the script. After a short look around, the pharmacy tech came back with a bottle that looked the same as the one Nurse Joy had. It was when he told them how much it was did Ash realize the problem. He opened his wallet and counted what he had but it wasn't enough to cover the price of the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I can't afford that. I guess I should go,\u201d Ash said turning to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypno was distraught at hearing that they were just going to leave. His Ashley needed her medicine and this human had to understand. With all his might, Hypno climbed up onto the counter, much to the surprise of the pharmacy tech. Once again, Hypno used his hypnosis and put the unsuspecting man into a trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Ashley needs her medicine. She can pay you back later. Right now, she needs your help to be healthy,\u201d Hypno informed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAshley needs her medicine. She can pay me back. Right now she needs my help to be healthy,\u201d the man repeated back before walking away from the register.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAshley? Hypno...stop this!\u201d Ash was shocked to see what his pokemon was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved forward to stop Hypno but the pokemon turned the hypnotism back onto him. Ash froze in place, falling back into a trance once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's okay, I'm just helping.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's okay. You are just helping.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypno was just about to talk about the name situation when is spotted a yellow blur. Pikachu slammed into Hypno, knocking him to the ground. He didn't have time to react before he was slapped by a tail whip, which caused Hypno to spin. Pikachu kept up the assault with a thunder shock and Hypno recoiled from the attack. Hypno knew he couldn't beat pikachu in a battle, he was just too strong. The best he could hope for was to talk reason into him. With everything he had, Hypno held up his arm and moved his pendant. Though he tried to shrug it off, he was soon entranced like everyone else. Hypno took deep breaths until he was finally able to communicate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPikachu...I'm not your enemy...I'm not trying to replace you. Ashley is my trainer as well as yours. She won't abandon you now that I'm back. Please, stop fighting me. I'm just helping our trainer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Pikachu a few moments to process what he had been told. Once Hypno was sure he wasn't going to get attacked again, he turned his attention back to his trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know things haven't been normal but just trust me. You should stop going by Ash and start going by Ashley again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThings haven't been normal. I should trust you. I should stop going by Ash. I should....I should go by...,\u201d Ash's mind fought the new command but Hypno wasn't going to give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's okay. Your name is Ashley, not Ash,\u201d he pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name...My name is...My name is Ashley,\u201d Ashley said, his resistance braking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. I'm so glad you remember! Now, once we get your medicine, don't forget to take it like you are supposed to. Once we do that we can get you something cute to change into for your date with Gary tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley's mind swirled, trying to take in that last command. The words tumbled around and around until the pharmacy tech returned, jostling him from the trance. He was handed  the bottle he came fore but also several items from around the shop. There were several supplements, all for women to promote a healthy body. Ashley read the instructions and removed one dose of everything. He asked the tech for some water and he was all too happy to help. Once he returned with a bottle of water, he handed it over while Ashley stared at his handful of pills that very much not meant for a guy. His pulse raced as he stood there, thinking about what he was about to do. He knew he shouldn't...that they were going to do weird things to him...In a swift movement, he tossed them into his mouth and chased them with the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on guys. Let go get me something...something to get changed into for my...for my...for tonight,\u201d Ashley said, still fighting the last commands.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The elevator's aggressively inoffensive music played as Ashley's head throbbed. He looked down at his bag of items, brow furrowed in confusion. He couldn't understand why he had taken the pills when it was so obvious that they were meant for women. He was a guy, it didn't make any sense at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu was in a haze of his own after being subject to Hypno's ability. He was doing his best to shake it off but wasn't having an easy time of it. Everything in him was telling him that something was wrong, that Hypno was dangerous. Hypno wasn't his enemy but he was still causing Ash to act weird, even if he was only tying to help her. He glowered at the oblivious Pokemon, trying to summon the will to jolt him but he just couldn't bring himself to fight him anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypno bounced with joy at how well everything was going since they got to town. His Ashley was remembering herself and her new pikachu was finally settling down since he had the heart to heart with him earlier. He knew it would take time but he hoped they could become friends soon. There was so much to learn about battling from such a strong pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator doors opened once they got to their floor reveling store after store. They walked together, new clothes on their agenda. Much to Hypno's dismay, Ashley kept going to stores that normally held his preferred but every time he picked something up, it just didn't feel right. They just weren't...cute. Ashley was getting really frustrated at his own thoughts, forcefully handing the plain t-shirt back on the rack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry guys, this was a bust. It doesn't look like we are going to find anyth-\u201d Ashley cut himself off in mid thought, pausing as they exited the last clothing store when he spotted something that caught his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the window of another shop was an a simple blue dress hanging loosely over a mannequin. Ashley couldn't understand what it was about it that held is interest like it was but he had a hard time pulling his eyes away from it. Taking a few steps backwards he looked up to read the name of the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNora's\u201d is said in stylized purple letters. It was the place the rude lady told him to go to back at the bath house, he remembered. From the look of it, it was a woman's store, which wasn't something Ashley had any interest in visiting. Even so, his eyes drifted back to the dress. Hypno took Ashely's hand and began tugging it, attempting to lead him inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wouldn't hurt to just look,\u201d Ash relented though uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bell chimed, announcing the entrance of the trio, which alerted Nora to their arrival. Nora's voice projected out from the back of the store, informing them that she would be with them momentarily. Hypno wasted no time in pulling Ashley over to a rack of skirts he thought might be to taste while Ashley took in the sight of various shoes lining the left wall and undergarments lining the right. He felt uneasy surrounded by so many feminine garments and started to consider leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm so glad you came, Ash was it?\u201d Nora grinned, stepping out from the back room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAshley...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yes. Ashley. I remember now,\u201d she lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm...I'm not really sure-\u201d Ashley began to explain why he had to leave but was interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat to get? Don't worry, I have an eye for this kind of thing. Come along,\u201d She said taking his arm into her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley couldn't get a word in edgewise as Nora lead him to a chair and had him take off his shoes. She sized his feet then pulled out a tiny notebook and made a note of it. She then stood him up and very quickly produced measuring tap and got his sizes. She pulled him over to the wall of undergarments, which was making Ashley feel uneasy. She grabbed a matching pair of panties and a bra, both with a small bit of lace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe bra should help, I think you will be pleasantly surprised.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp with wh-\u201d Ashley was interrupted buy another tug of his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pokemon followed as he was yanked back and forth across the shop while Nora held different articles of clothing up to Ashley's body. His face grew flush with embarrassment at everything that was happening and tried to bring this experience to an end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I don't think-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour right, green isn't your color.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I can't wear-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're right, we should show off your legs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I just looking for something to wear tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's happening tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a da...dinner. I'm going to dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDinner, huh? With a boy?\u201d She smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yes...but.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I know just the thing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley's arms were filled with a slow growing pile of women's clothes which soon became too high for him to see passed. He was lead into a large changing room, stumbling along as he blindly followed. Everything was taken out of his hands and placed on a bench inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou start getting changed into one of the selections and I'll get you some shoes to try. We will find you something perfect for tonight, I promise,\u201d Nora said, closing the door as she left the trio along with the clothes. </span></div></div>",

They were about to watch some hypnotist show or something and Dan was dreading it. He hated this cheesy kind of thing, people pretending that they were being mind-controlled into acting like idiots. Normally he wouldn't have even come to something like this but he knew it would cheer up Scott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott was his roommate and at one point he would even say friend. Not now. Not anymore. Scott didn't know, but Daniel and Scott's girlfriend, Mandy had been spending a lot of time together and at some point, things turned intimate. It went on like that for a time until the stress of the affair became too much for Mandy and she ended up ending the relationship with Scott. It had been a few weeks and Scott was still heartbroken. Dan felt guilty for what he had done but he knew that no good would come of telling Scott about it. The best he could do for Scott was to hide the fact that his friend betrayed him, or so Dan thought. Dan just wished he could do something to fix things. He would do anything to help Scott get over Mandy and make things right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's why Dan got him and Scott tickets to the hypnotist show. Though Dan hated this stuff, Scott loved all that pseudoscience crap. It wasn't much but he could do this much for Scott, thought Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the lights dimmed and a spotlight hit the opening curtain, revealing an odd-looking man dressed in black. He had way too much eye makeup on and his bald head gleamed in the shining light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man spoke with a solemn tone, \"Welcome ladies and gentlemen. I am Drake Bloodstone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan sighed as Drake continued, \u201cTonight we are all explorers. Not explorers of strange jungles or dark tombs but of something much more frightening: the human mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pffft,\" escaped Daniel's mouth much to Drake's obvious distaste. Dan didn't realize he had even done it until Scott nudged him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan gave Scott a sheepish, \"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBloodstone cleared his throat and then continued. \"There is still much to be discovered about the mind and tonight we will plunge deep into the unknown, past the veil of consciousness into eternity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel rolled his eyes as Drake continued, \"To start, I will need a volunteer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, the stage filled with people from the audience. There were the normal things: people singing, people pretending to be animals, and other mildly embarrassing actions but all and all nothing special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTonight we have journeyed and adventured but our time together is over,\u201d Drake said with open arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally,\u201d Dan said quietly. Apparently not quietly enough because Drake looked right at Dan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps, we have time for one more pilgrimage. You sir, please come up here.\u201d The next thing Daniel knew, he was standing on stage.</span></div></div>",

It was a familiar musk but Dan couldn't quite place it, all he knew was that it smelled really good. So much so, that he shivered a little bit. Next his hearing returned, which started off as a distant muted thing that grew and swallowed him up. Eventually it cleared into what Dan could only describe as laughter. It was then that he realized that he was sitting on something. His hand was absently rubbing against something while he felt his leg bouncing up and down. That's when he opened his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found his vision a bit obscured as it seemed that his face was nuzzling up close to something slightly rough but warm. Pulling back and looking down, Dan saw his legs. His baggy pants had been folded up to his mid thigh and his legs were crossed at the knee with one of them going up and down in an idle bounce. His dress shirt was undone and tied into a small knot leaving his stomach exposed. Dan could feel the fingers of his right hand twirling his brown hair that was coming down past his shoulder. He lifted his hand and felt the ponytail, higher and tighter on his head then he tied it before Him and Scott left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan stiffened when he realized why the musky smell was so familiar, it was Scott's cologne. Dan withdrew his other hand, the one that had sneaked under Scott's shirt rubbing his chest leaped off of Scott's lap. His face was hard to read but Dan could see embarrassment as Scott quickly put his hand in his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive them a hand,\u201d Drake said to the audience while gesturing to Dan and Scott. The audience exploded with applause as Drake motioned for Dan to take a seat, which he did as fast has he could. Before Scott could leave, Drake leaned in and whispered something into his ear. Trying to get to his seat, people kept telling Dan how funny he was and how good of a performance he delivered to which Dan could only give a weak \u201cthanks\u201d. Once Scott was seated Bloodstone simply said, \u201cThank you everyone and goodnight.\u201d and then withdrew behind the stage curtain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dan gathered his coat Scott look over at him and told him, \u201cYou know, its going to be cold outside.\u201d Dan looked down a realized, to his embarrassment, he didn't fix his attire.</span></div></div>",

There were so many questions that he wanted to ask but he just could bring himself to vocalize them. Did he really want to know what he did on stage to get such a big reaction out of the audience? Was hypnosis real? He always thought it was just something to part stupid people with their money. Maybe it was better not to know and just try and forget any of this happened. Still, he was left troubled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hardly noticed when they arrived back to their apartment, his head still feeling a little off. Scott plopped down on the couch and turned on the TV while Dan started to get ready for bed. After changing into his night shirt and pajama pants, Dan walked into the kitchen to fix himself something to eat. He grabbed a beer and made a simple ham and cheese sandwich. When he sat down to eat it, he just didn't feel hungry anymore. Thinking that maybe he was getting sick or something, he got up to put the food back into the fridge but found himself walking up to Scott and handing him the sandwich and the beer. Scott looked Dan up and down with a slight confused expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI decided I wasn't hungry,\u201d Dan said as Scott took the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Scott said as Dan turned away to go to bed, wearing one of Mandy's left over camisoles and her pink pajama bottoms.</span></div></div>",

He was already running late. He wanted to hit up the gym before work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt got even stranger as he rummaged through his clothing to find something to wear.

It was early enough that the locker room was rather empty. The few women present just figured Dan was gay or trans and didn't make a big deal of his presence there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter showering and wrapping himself in a towel, Dan realized he didn't have any clothes to change into. He didn't want to put back his sweaty workout clothes. And even if he did, he'd return home to all that guy's clothing in his closet that someone was pranking him with. His first target was the lost and found, but everything in there stank of sweat as well. With the locker room still fairly empty, he decided to instead peek into some unlocked lockers. He felt a little guilty, but he told himself he'd only take something if someone seemed to have two of something in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't result in the most flattering outfit, but he could make it work. When Dan looked in the mirror, he saw a beautiful woman in a white t-shirt, black leather skirt, and red heels.

He had long hair now, slightly smeared makeup on his face, red high heels and a matching purse. His legs were shaved.

Trust me; we went ALL the way. I made a man out of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott looked at Dan, noting that he could still see a slight bulge in the front of the dress.

He was scrubbing a particularly stubborn pan when he heard the sound of the trash collectors pull up. He watched them take his things and carelessly toss them into the back of the trash truck. That moment hammered home the fact that all he had let were the items in his pocket and the clothes on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d he wondered before giving his full attention back to the pan.</span></div></div>",

He took a few quick lookes in the mirror, his dick securely glued between his legs but still aimed into a tiny whole to pee out of, it wasn't the most comfortable, but it looked perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy put a bra and panties and got another few looks at himself, wondering just how far he was going to let this go... He was still planning on moving and quitting as soon as possible, but now he had glued himself into being <b><i>Tory</i></b> for the time being</span></div></div>",

I haven't really had the time,\" Troy told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat question bothered Troy a little. It was true that he hadn't been dating since this whole fiasco. He didn't realize that he was missing the closeness of having a girlfriend as much as he was. Not to mention that since he had glued himself away, he hadn't been able to masturbate. He thought about trying through the prosthetic but decided it would be too weird for him. He was starting to get a bit sexually frustrated, though.

We are all catching up,\" he said nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We caught up, now we get ourselves some girls,\" Ben said getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sit down. Don't bother them. They are just having a lunch and the last thing they want is to have guys hitting on them,\" Troy told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make it such a big deal. I promise, they will love the attention,\" Ben grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit down and leave them alone,\" Troy said in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You are beautiful, Rachel. Don't forget it,\" Troy told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel gave a small smile at the words. Troy didn't know if he helped but he hoped he did.

It happened a few times during the day but still with the same result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never been attracted to men,\" he told himself, which was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so, if he was he thought Mike would be a good choice. He was funny, smart, mature, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay, he is handsome but I don't have to be attracted to him to acknowledge that,\" Troy told himself, which was also true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy tried to keep his mind busy at work and he mostly succeeded except the few lapses he had. Other than that, the day flew by and he was back home.

I only wanted to hang out. Then he called it a date. Now we are going to see each other Friday-\" rattled on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tory, Tory, Tory. Hey, hold on a sec. It's okay. Take a breath and talk to me. Why don't you just tell him it's not a date?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't do that,\" he almost whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you can. I know Mike and he is super responsible. He would understand,\" she told him calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to make things weird, especially before your wedding,\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think it would be worse if you lead him on?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to lead him on, I really like him,\" he said hugging his pillow for support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you don't, Tory. Trust me, though, if he is worth having as a friend, he will understand,\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's true. You are pretty smart,\" Troy said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. You okay?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks...you are a really good friend,\" he admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you, Tory,\" she told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy finished talking to Tina and sat with his phone on the blankets.

Last time we talked you were feelings some trepidation about it,\" Mike said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I am. It's the looming nature of it, I guess. Not knowing what will happen,\" Troy said taking a sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fair. I can give you my experience if you want,\" Mike offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. It could help having some info,\" he admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike gave a play by play of what previous weddings had been like. Mostly it was a lot of waiting around, which isn't too bad. There are only a few things that need to be worried about and that involved timing when to enter and exit a room. That's pretty much fine since someone is around usually to make that go smoothly. Troy stopped him when he started talking about dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn't thought about it until now but Troy was going to have to slow dance as the woman role. He had danced at the clubs with the other girls but this would be very different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, I don't know the first thing about dancing at a wedding,\" Troy admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, it really pretty simple in practice,\" Mike said trying to be reassuring.</span></div></div>",

He found himself afraid that he might be getting sick, which would be terrible timing. After sitting a while he found himself setting back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the game was fun.

He really didn't want to leave so he told Mike he still needed to sober up before he went home. It was true enough but not the whole truth.

Mike had no problem with that so they sat on the couch talking more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know when it happened but he must have fallen asleep because the next thing he knew, he was slumped over against Mike. He could hear breathing deeply and it was clear he had fallen asleep, too. His arm was draped over Troy's shoulder which felt warm on Troy's exposed skin. It had been a long time since Troy had been this close to someone physically and if clearly felt nice to him.

As he thought about it his hands drifted across his own body. He caressed himself thinking of previous intimacies he had. His chest began to rise and fall as his breath quickened along with his pulse. He slipped his fingers passed the elastic of his panties and found the lips of the prosthetic vagina. He felt them before deciding to explore a little bit. His finders reached in to find his manhood trapped under neath. His mind played scenes like an old move projector, faded and dull. As he rubbed, his mind drifted back to Mike and the night they just had. The way his hand as he tried to show him how to dance. The feeling of his arm over his shoulder. The feeling of his cheek under Troy's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moan escaped his lips, and his toes curled as he felt himself orgasm for the first time in months. After he recovered and his lust cleared he realized what he had just done. He got up and headed back to the bathroom to clean up.</span></div></div>",

If you are really think they are going to to try and get you to do something you don't want to do, then be honest with them. I'm sure they will respect your wishes,\" Mike told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy wrapped his arms around Mike and nuzzled his head into Mike's neck. Mike's arms held Troy as they continued to dance..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Mike,\" Troy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey swayed like that for a short time, Mike's calone filling Troy's nose. Mike had a way of making Troy feel better. He was still freaked out by the prospect of the party but at that moment, he felt good.</span></div></div>",

They spoke in quiet tones back and forth with how impressed they were with the actors that were pretending to be hypnotized. They pulled off looking like average audience members so well, if Robin and John didn't know hypnosis was fake, they might have thought they weren't actors at all. Now, knowing that it wasn't real didn't take away from the fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Robin,\" John turned to his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, bro?\" Robin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for tonight,\" John said while Robin smiled back at his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were interrupted from their thoughts when by the hypnotist, Drake Bloodstone's voice and they suddenly realized that he was looking down to them. He pointed to Robin and Robin nervously pointed at himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You there, please come up here. Yes, you, the brunette,\" Bloodstone confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin got up as John clapped and laughed, excited to see what will happen with his friend. Robin shook Bloodstone's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, what's your name?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Robin,\" he said looking at his feet a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was normally a fairly outgoing guy, he felt, but being up in front of all these people was terrifying. He crossed his arms over his chest instinctively, unconsciously wanting to protect himself from the gaze of the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you having a good time Robin?\" the bald man asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Sir. I-I've been...uh... having fun,\" he tells him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm happy to hear that. Now, take a seat and lets get started,\" He said, guiding Robin to a chair that was on stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBloodstone put John under slowly and Robin was impressed with how real John made it look. Bloodstone put John through his paces and had him doing some funny behaviors. At one point he had Robin think he was a model walking the catwalk. As Robin Strutted, John wolf-whistled which made the audience laugh. What it also did was bring Bloodstone's attention onto John. Bloodstone had John sit back down and put him back into his trance before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell me, who is that you were sitting next to?\" He asks pointing at John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's John,\" He said with an even tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Did you come here together?\" He asked Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I bought us tickets for tonight because he was feeling down,\" Robin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's very kind,\" Bloodstone told the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John is my best friend and the best person I know,\" Robin said honestly, which made John happy to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's very nice. So, tell me, how long have you two been dating?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We...we haven't,\" Robin said confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so this is your first date. You're a sweet girl, he is a lucky guy that you asked him out,\" He said to Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin didn't say anything, instead he just listened to what Bloodstone said. This was his first date with John and that he was a lucky guy for Robin to ask him out. It didn't make sense to him and his mind stalled as he tried to sort it out. His head hurt trying to rationalize what Bloodstone told him...that he was a sweet girl. John on the other hand was feeling embarrassed for Robin. Bloodstone was confusing Robin for a girl and that must be embarrassing. His hair was long and he was fairly thin so it wasn't completely unthinkable he could make that mistake but his current situation must be humiliating for him. John wondered when he was going to correct him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My wife and I were best friends, too. The person you marry should be your best friend. Now, I don't mean to rush things, it's just something you should remember,\" he tells Robin, who takes in that information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBloodstone looked down at Robin's and made an assessment of her. She was a small thing, made all the smaller by her baggy clothes. Clearly she lacked self confidence and probably had issues with body image. John was a good looking guy and she thought really highly of him, so there must be something really special about the guy. Robin was such a good sport, he decided to help set this relationship up for success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBloodstone turned fully to the audience while Robin wrestled with the information he was given. He sorted through it as best he could but his mind had to do mental gymnastic to make it happen. Before he came here it had been obvious that he was a guy but how could he be anything but a sweet girl? He decided that he would just focus on the facts to use as an anchor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFact: Robin is a sweet girl<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFact: Robin asked John out on a date<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFact: John agreed to the date<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFact: He was having a great time with John<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFact: John is his best friend<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFact: The person he will marry should be his best friend<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all make \"sense\" but he still wasn't able to wrap his head around it. It was causing him a lot of discomfort try to force it all to feel correct. His mind whirled as Bloodstone addressed the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love to entertain but what I love more is helping others where I can so please give me a moment, if you will,\" he said before turning off his mic and walking back to Robin. While the audience waited, Blood returned to whisper into Robin's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to give you some advice. You want to be a good girlfriend for John so the best thing you can do as John's girlfriend is to try to be the best woman just like he should try to be the best man he can be. You are a pretty girl, so don't feel ashamed to show off that you are a pretty girl. When you look at yourself, remember that what you see is a confident woman that any man would be lucky to be with. You are going to be a wonderful wife for the man you choose. Now, go back down to your seat and show John how you feel about him,\" he instructed before turning his mic back on again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin, ladies and gentlemen,\" He said as Robin walked back to her seat to sit with her lucky boyfriend.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was special to her and she wanted him to know that, so when she sat next to him, she turned his cute chin with her hand to face her and she kissed him gently. He moaned a little as he opened his lips for her and not wanting to disappoint, slipped her tongue lovingly into his mouth. She was glad he said yes to the date, she was going to make sure she was the best girlfriend for him. She didn't know why it had taken her this long to see how perfect he was for her but she was never going to let him go now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was in shock as Robin, without hesitation, started to makeout with him in front of all these people. He wanted to stop it but all that came out of him was a groan of disgust. The John had no idea what to do as Robin tried to explore his mouth and found himself frozen in shock. His brain finally caught up with what was happening and he pushed Robin off him. Robin smiled at him like this was normal, then put John's arm around him and leaned into him to a snuggle. John still hadn't recovered fully after what happened and sat there as Robin took John's hand in his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d John asked horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm just so glad to be with you tonight,\u201d Robin whispered into his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Bloodstone started to bring the show to it's end. John's mind was going a mile a minute trying to figure out what was going on when Bloodstone collapsed on stage. There were murmurs from the audience as stage crew came running. An ambulance was called and the audience was ushered out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn found himself walking outside with Robin still holding his hand.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

John looked at his friend with confusion as he tried to figure out what was going on with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Robin asked John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened back there?\" John said, finally finding the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, he seemed okay enough. Maybe the heat from the lights got to him? He was sweating,\" Robin answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...No, not that. Dude, you kissed me in front of all those people...\" John said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry...I just...I've never been someone's girlfriend before...I thought it you'd like it,\" Robin tried to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn's jaw dropped at that. Did he say girlfriend? Robin looked hurt and embarrassed but did Robin believed what he was saying?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry. I didn't realize that kissing you in front of all of those people was going to bother you. I promise I won't do it again. I wouldn't hurt you on purpose,\" she told John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you're not a girl...\" John told him, getting freaked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...what?,\" Robin said slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin closed his eyes, pain on his face, and he grabbed his head. He started to sway and began to fall over but John moved fast. He grabbed Robin, luckily, before he hit the ground. He held his friend in his arms, afraid of what was happening to him. The moment eventually passed but it felt like ages until Robin seemed okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Robin asked in a soft, pained voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" John said not sure, himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I want to go home...\" Robin told her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Okay,\" John said leading him to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them drove home in silence. Robin looked out the window not really able to focus. John glanced over to his friend and worried. Hypnosis couldn't be real, could it? It would explain Robin's behavior but this was insane. John pulled up to the house and looked at Robin, who he was clearly not okay. That reaction of being told the truth was awful to experience and he never wanted to put Robin through it again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He didn't want to do this but Robin was really looking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...are you okay?\u201d He asked, wanting to hear him respond to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm okay, Robin,\u201d he said weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope so. Maybe you should to head to bed, maybe you'll feel better in the morning,\u201d he suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin looked up at him with big eyes. John took a breath and walked over to him and hugged him. John was really worried but the hug seemed to wake Robin up from his stupor. Robin cuddled in and made a soft noise of happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm pretty beat, I guess its time to get some beauty sleep,\" she told her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight, Robin,\" he told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight, John,\u201d Robin said touching the side of John's face, looking up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn screamed in his head as Robin stood up on his tippy toes and pressed his lips to John's. They kissed gently and John tried with all his might not to run away. Instead he stood there and tried to return the kiss until he couldn't stand it any longer. He pulled away to see Robin's bright smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At leased he seems...\"okay\" now,\" John thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin turned away and glided into his room, swaying his hips gently. John went to his own room but sleep was hard to get as he couldn't stop thinking of their kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope he is better in the morning.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He closed his eyes and tried to will it all into a dream but there was no undoing it, though he certainly put in the effort. He sat up and started his morning routine, not ready to face the day. While getting dressed for work he heard rustling in the house, clearly Robin was already up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe his brain just needed a night's sleep to reboot itself,\" he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hesitating for a long moment, John took a breath and exited his bedroom. He walked to the kitchen and saw Robin leaning over a bowl of cereal, his face in his phone. It looked like he wore the same thing he was wearing the night before, probably just falling asleep in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Robin grunted without looking at John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Robin...how are you?\" John asked cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoever invented mornings should be shot,\" Robin told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn sighed in relief internally at that, glad to see that like Robin was still Robin. He quickly made them some coffee and toasted him some bread. He placed a cup in front of Robin which Robin took into his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, you're amazing,\" Robin said taking a sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to fly, I see you after work,\" John said on his way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin watched as John hurried out the door. She was a little disappointed that he didn't stop for a kiss but he was in a hurry. She took consolation in watching his ass as he walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He does look sexy in those slacks. Now I wish we got up a little early so we could have had a little fun,\" she murmured into her coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin finished her cereal and the coffee her boyfriend made for her and decided to start her day.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Robin quickly rinsed out the bowl and cup she was using and dragged herself to the bathroom. She was definitely not a morning person. It was made all the worse that she had been sleeping in since she lost her retail job not long ago. Luckily she had saved up a good amount that she could live off of for a while but she needed to get herself back in gear. It was either that or let John handle everything when they get married.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not going to be a housewife, that would drive me nuts,\u201d she said to no one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that she had to keep herself in check about the whole marriage thing, after all, her and John only just started dating. That said, she knew that she wanted John in her life forever, she always had. He was her best friend and she always wanted to marry her best friend. Robin was lost in thought when she caught her reflection in the mirror. She looked at herself for a long moment, almost like she didn't know what she was looking at. Her hair was a mess and she looked over tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn girl, no wonder he didn't kiss you this morning, you look like death,\u201d she said to her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe disrobed and looked at herself in the mirror. She was a thin girl and fairly flat up top and it suddenly became clear that she had not been taking care of herself very well. She couldn't remember the last time she shaved, her legs looked like she would need a lawnmower to trim it back. She had always been hairier than your average woman, much to her own frustration, so it was clear how it could get away from her like that. She gathered her shaving cream and razor grumbling about this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod, I hate maintenance. Maybe I should look into a more long term solution?\u201d She said stepping into the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She lathered up her body and began to carefully remove the unwanted hair from everywhere she could reach. It took longer than she would have liked which only reinforced her previous plan of doing something permanent about it. She rinsed off and and then went about cleaning her body. She rubbed herself and closed her eyes thinking about the night before. She smiled at the memory of John's lips on hers as her hands began to play with her nipples. She thought about what could have happened the night before if she hadn't been so tired. How she could have lifted John's shirt and touched his chest...how her hands could have...explored...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Robin's hands slid down her body onto her crotch and she pause. Something wasn't right but she didn't know what it could be. Still, she was turned on and wanted to finish, so she rubbed herself thinking about her boyfriend's body. She rubbed and imagined until she pushed herself over the edge and climaxed hard in the shower. She didn't remember ever cumming that hard before and could only guys how having the real thing was going to feel.</span></div></div>",
