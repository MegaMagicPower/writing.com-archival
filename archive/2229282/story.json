As a successful business woman manufacturing pharmaceuticals, she has accumulated untold wealth. Her stunning figure is only the cherry on top. Her breasts are large even for her kind, and she revels in displaying her phyiscal beauty, which is why her suits are often very daringly cut, letting those smaller than her know exactly on what level they are compared to her.<br>\r\nThe secret to her success is the absolute explotation of her human workforce. As long as she has lived, she has lobbyed governments around the world not to recognize humans as equals, being more than successful in many places. The minuscule, one inch tall humans now work around the clock in her factories, completely for free, of course. To make sure that their work is up to snuff, she only needs a few saurian supervisors. A job which many saurians revel in.<br>\r\nCurrently, Alexis plans to expand her operation even further. Follow her in her talks with state leaders, or relaxing with her human toys at home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Marius Edwards</b><br>\r\nMarius is a peculiar person. For as long as he lived, the white-bellied, blue triceratops has loved all the small beings on the planet, much to the mockery of his peers. But he has never let their words get close to him. Standing at 7'2\", and being blessed with thick muscles also helped keep most of the bullying from escalating into physical violence.<br>\r\nNow, he runs a shelter for humans and other smaller species. As one of the few safe places for them in his country, he has made a name for himself. He tries his best to make their life better in every way he can and accepts everyone into his home.<br>\r\nFollow him as he takes care of his smaller friends and maybe even find the love of his life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Carla Nosova</b><br>\r\nCarla is the president of Caspida Finances, one of the biggest banking conglomerates of the world. An orange brontosaur, she has a commanding presence, standing at 12'7\", though she tries her best not to seem intimidating. Though some of her assistants have fallen victim to being smothered under her colossal rear, she has never injured anyone smaller than her. Despite her pacifistic demeanor, she is an absolute cutthroat business woman. Years of being in her position have granted her a sharp instinct that never lets her down. With incredible swiftness, she keeps buying up more and more businesses, working her way to a massive monopoly<br>\r\nHer biggest enemy is Alexis Carnal, who she doesn't only despise because of the way she is treating humans, but also because she keeps resisting her takeover attempts<br>\r\nFollow her navigate the world of big business and political intrigue, always protecting those smaller than her - especially her tiny human assitants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Roxa Smith</b><br>\r\nRoxa may be the largest saurian in existence: a member of the rare species of Giganotosaurus, she towers even over the largest dinosaurs, and she loves it. The red beast stands tall at 16'10\" and adores looking down at those smaller than her. It doesn't help that with her size comes an intense sexual appetite that has led her at times to crush the bones of her partners in the throws of pleasure.<br>\r\nBut soon, ordinary saurians wouldn't do anymore. She wanted even smaller things to play with...<br>\r\nWhich lead her to her current job. She works for a pet shop, selling humans and anthros. But she doesn't simply sit behind a register. Instead, she goes out to catch escaped and stray tinies. She is good at it too, and always keeps some of her harvest for herself. In her home, she has an entire vivarium filled with humans...<br>\r\nFollow Roxa in the domination of those smaller than her!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When the blaring siren rang out, people already knew what they had to expect. Still, as the busy street slowed to a crawl, they couldn't help but gawk. Hectically, every driver quickly parked their vehicle on the side of the street, creating a lane for the coming car. In other places, one might have expected the police, or an ambulance. But here, in Gale City, there was someone carrying even greater authority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst came the motorcycles. A trio of riders, all massive, bulky saurian, drove past, blasting the siren that alerted the populace to their presence. They were clad in black leather suits, the only splash of color being the white logo on their backs. A square, the skeletal face of a saurian twisted into a huge grin within it. A slogan underneath:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Carnal Pharmaceuticals!<br>\r\nTo make you more than you are!</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the drivers had made sure nothing was blocking their path, a massive, black limousine followed. The same logo was prominently displayed on its doors. Though no one could look inside through the tinted windows, everyone knew who it was that rode in the imperious vehicle.<br>\r\nAlexis Carnal herself was touring the city. Or, more likely, observing her subjects. Though she held no political power on paper, everyone knew she was the de facto owner of Gale City. With a never seen before ferocity, she had expanded her wealth, buying business after business, all the while her main company - Carnal Pharmaceuticals - expanded more and more. After a few years, nearly every job in the city was created by her. Which meant that she was the boss of nearly every person in the crowd. Even the city council was in her pocket. All she had to do to get them doing her bidding, was to threaten to move production somewhere else. A move that never failed. What were they going to do - ruin their city's economy?<br>\r\nAnd besides, it wasn't so bad living under her thumb. Great even, if you were a saurian. Alexis always held the view her natural height elevated her above the other species, in a metaphorical sense of course. It was undeniable that saurians towered over everyone else. Because of that, Gale City had become the most sought after place for saurian workers, since here they enjoyed all kinds of benefits they wouldn't get in other societies.<br>\r\nEven life as an anthro was passable. Though they had it much harder to ascend the corporate ladder, they could make a decent living. It helped, that Alexis had decided to grant them equal protection under the law. Not out of the kindness of her heart, but because it would be a hassle, otherwise.<br>\r\nBut there was one species for which life in Gale City was as close to hell as one could get on earth. Humans. They were barely even counted as people - and the only reason they were was, so that Alexis could employ them in her factories. The work there was grueling for the humans, always at the mercy of their supervisors. Strict, and sometimes even lethal punishments were handed out freely, should one slack off. After all, there was a nearly endless supply of humans in need of money that could replace them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis stretched her legs, leaning back into the plush seat of her limousine. Even after 17 years, she never grew tired of the utter decadence she lived in. Even though it was sweltering outside, the brandy in her glass was cooled to the perfect temperature. The thin, yet elegant suit stretching over her curvaceous body would have cost thousands of dollars, had she not been given it by a very demure tailor who had been grateful that she deemed his business worthy of visiting. It was perfect for a day like this. Light, as is she was wearing nothing at all, and tantalizingly form fitting. She had been very adamant, that her clothing always displayed her beauty. Which was also the reason why she left the top three buttons undone, letting her generous cleavage spill out of her blouse. Of course, her appearance had probably made the tailor millions, since everyone who thought something of themselves wouldn't let a chance of following her fashion trends slip by. Her look was completed by her multitudinous accessories, each one worth more than a high-level manager would make in a year. A bracelet studded with diamonds was clasped around her ankle, her golden earrings glittered in the sunlight. Then, there was her necklace...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was one thing Alexis enjoyed even more than reveling in her wealth, it was reveling in her power. Specifically the power she held over humans. As minuscule as they were, she had a hard time even perceiving them as sentient creatures. To her, the role of a toy had always seemed much more fitting for them. Not that she minded how hard they worked for her, but there was a certain tingle she would get every time she saw one. And that tingle would soon turn into a sinister craving.<br>\r\nShe smiled down at her necklace. At the end of the silver chain was a small pendant that vanished in the valley of her cleavage. There, unseen by anyone but felt by her, a human was chained to it, completely engulfed by her flesh. The tiny woman's struggling hadn't stopped so far. Not out of fear, Alexis knew, but out of self preservation. The worst thing for one of Alexis toys wasn't to try to escape, but to bore her. If she got bored, she would have to make her own fun... and that rarely ended with the tiny still alive.<br>\r\nThankfully, her toys knew by now what was expected of them, so she rarely had to dispose one. This one in particular was actually extraordinarily lively! Alexis made a mental note of rewarding her later. No one should ever say she wasn't a kind mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Carnal?\" the voice of the driver shook her out of her daydreaming. She looked up, her piercing eyes making the fox driving her limousine flinch only the slightest bit.<br>\r\n\"Where to next?\" he asked.<br>\r\nAlexis thought for a moment. There was a lot she needed to do. For one, one of her factories was behind on its output. Apparently, the humans were trying to rebel, or at least, to withhold their work. It wasn't a big deal, but she should quell that unrest before it inspired others to follow suit. A slight smile formed on her lips at the idea of <i>literally</i> crushing their uprising.<br>\r\nOn the other hand, she still had to attend a meeting with her private research division. Maybe it was a silly fantasy, but she had always been fascinated by growing even larger. And only this morning, one of her scientists had called her, apparently having made progress on an experimental serum... She shivered at the mere thought.<br>\r\nBut maybe, all of that could wait till tomorrow. After an arduous meeting with the city council, she wanted nothing more than to relax at home. Of course, she would pay her little pet humans a visit... nothing help her relax more than playing with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she decided on a course of action and told the driver...</span></div></div>",

Why should she? She was warm, cuddled in a blanket made of an old sock. Her belly was full. It was a lazy Sunday for the little mouse. Or Saturday. Or Monday, maybe. Missy didn't really keep up with the weekdays. That stuff was important for the big people who actually had jobs, not for a free little mouse like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grimaced at the thought. Okay, maybe she wasn't that free, which was also why she had to get up in spite of her desire to simply spend the day in bed. But at least, her duty was fun.<br>\r\nMissy didn't know of any other mice that had an agreement with the owner of their house. For a mouse, being seen by a saurian was often akin to a death sentence. Yet there were some that found them cute. Or, in Missy's case, useful at least.<br>\r\nThe house in which Missy had made her home was owned by a gargantuan stegosaurus woman, named Lara. When she first met her, Missy had been sure she would end as paste under her soles. But it had come differently. The green scaled titan had simply snatched her up, carried her over to a table and gave her some food and water. At first, she had been stunned by what was happening, but years of scavenging had taught her to get as much food as she could get. While she stuffed her face with fresh cheese for once, Lara had made her an offer: the massive saurian was alright with mice... but she absolutely loathed humans. The deal was simple: Missy was allowed to live in the house, and would even be fed, if she just made sure that any humans trying to get in would swiftly be punished and thrown out. Missy agreed to immediately. Not only because of the promise of safety, but also because she loved to toy with humans anyway. It wasn't often that a mouse like her got to feel powerful, but thankfully humans barely reached her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that day on, Missy worked for the titan, and she did good. The humans never learned and always tried to get in through cracks in the wall, or by crawling under the door. Often, she would find them in the pantry. If so, she would drag them into her lair to have her fun with them... and later brought them to miss Lara, so she could dispose of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday would be no different, and finally, Missy dragged herself out of the sock Lara had given her to keep her warm. She hadn't found any humans for a while now, which bummed her out a little. Maybe she would be more lucky, this time.<br>\r\nYawning, she stepped out into the massive kitchen. She scratched her rear, and groaned. Maybe she should take a bath first, her fur was all dirty and sticky. Thankfully, Lara didn't mind if she climbed into her sink.<br>\r\nOn the other hand, early in the morning was the best time to find humans. So maybe she should do her patrol first. Hopefully she would find a new plaything...</span></div></div>",

This was where Lara kept all of her snacks and non-perishable food items and was a veritable gold mine for any hungry humans looking to steal a little something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could usually hear with her sensitive ears the noises they made when they were trying to break into a plastic bag or the whispers when were talking to each other if there was more than one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there were any humans in the pantry wandering around where they shouldn't it should be a simple matter to locate where they are and catch them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Missy reached the pantry door she ducked under the crack and crawled underneath, and was soon within the near all-encompassing darkness of the pantry. Already upon entering the dim space, she could hear the telltale signs of human intruders, which caused her to smile broadly, and her heart rate to quicken. After not seeing one for so long she was practically slavering from both ends at the prospect of catching a human and having her way with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunt was on!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The lights were dim, the street quiet. Every now and again, a lone car drove by, rattling the windows of the quiet neighborhood. A small nearby bar was the only source of noise in the whole area. A group of drunken saurians stood outside, laughing loudly about something Hal had absolutely no interest in. He knew to never get close to the places the gargantuan lizards called their homes... except, of course, if he needed something. Like he did, right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, he turned  away from the illuminated windows of the bar, trying his best to ignore the uproarious laughter that would have certainly shattered his eardrums should he have been closer, and focused on his target.<br>\r\nIt didn't look like anything special. A large, six-story apartment building, looking exactly like its dozen neighbors, as if someone had simply copy and pasted an entire block. The red brick might once have seemed fashionable, but by the color was faded and the building was due a renovation. Still, many people lived here. Saurians and anthros, mostly single, who either couldn't or wouldn't spend money on the more expensive apartments in the inner city.<br>\r\nOf course, Hal didn't really care about what the living situation of the inhabitants were, or how dilapidated the building was. No matter what, compared to his home this tower was paradise. One he could only enter very shortly, since humans were seen as pests, to be crushed or otherwise discarded off. But inside was a veritable treasure trove: more food than he could ever eat was piled up in the various pantries. It may last a saurian a week, but for him it was a nearly endless supply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had scouted it out for the last few days after the corner shop he had been used to scavenging from, had gotten a cat and installed mouse traps. After a close encounter with the furry beast, which ended with Hal barely escaping its claws, he had decided that it wasn't worth the risk and searched for a new food source. This tower had been the first on his list. Since it was this old, there had to be holes or cracks through which he could slip. His intuition proved true. Time had gnawed through the walls, creating a few minuscule cracks that led directly into the apartment behind.<br>\r\nHal had also seen who lived there, which sealed the deal that he would try stealing from this place. A massive, red t-rex was the sole inhabitant. At least, he never saw anyone else through the window as he spied on her. What was even better, was that she left the house very early in the morning, most of the time in sporty shorts, a top struggling to contain her generous chest, and running shoes. She would jog away, a bag slung over her shoulder. Hal didn't know where she went - she may have worked as a fitness instructor, or simply preferred jogging to college over taking the bus, but he didn't care. When she arrived back home, she would be completely exhausted, sweating out of every pore. She stayed awake for only two hours afterwards, before she dimmed the lights and went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was the perfect time for Hal to enter! For the last two hours he had observed her, counting the minutes until she went to sleep. Finally, the last light vanished. Now, it was Go-Time!<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, Hal sprinted forwards toward the crack. He hadn't actually entered it before, but he had a pretty good idea where it would take him. Judging by what he had seen through the window, he'd end up in either the saurian's living or bedroom. Since she was asleep anyway, he doubted it would matter much.<br>\r\nSqueezing forwards, the cold stone scraped over his chest. His old, worn shirt tore with ease as it caught on the rough edges. Gritting his teeth, Hal kept going. Though the tunnel was dark, he could see the end already, the moon faintly illuminating the room in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, with a few more tugs, he burst through to the other side. Hal didn't loose any time. Quickly, he took in his surroundings. He let out an annoyed grunt.<br>\r\nHe had ended up in the saurians bedroom, after all. That alone wouldn't have been bad, but he hadn't accounted for her to be this <i>messy</i>. The floor was covered in old clothing. Socks, shirts, even the rex' underwear was scattered all over. He could barely even take a step without being caught in the fabric of some garment.<br>\r\nRight next to him was a massive desk. Hal could barely see the edges of monitor on top. Some papers loosely hung over the edge, threatening to fall. On the other side of the room, a gigantic closet rose to the ceiling, open and stuffed to the brim with even more clothes. Finally, there was the bed, a large, queen sized mattress more suited for two.<br>\r\nWhat was worrying, however, was that Hal couldn't see the saurian woman anywhere. He had counted on her being in bed already. This made traversing her flat infinitely more dangerous... but he also couldn't waste anymore time! He had to locate her pantry, after all, grab what he needed, and escape. It would take him the whole night, probably, not counting actually getting back to his hideout. And if there was one thing he certainly didn't want to do, it was walking the streets by daylight. Doing so was asking to be crushed by some passerby, who probably wouldn't even notice the stain on their boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, he had to get started now! The state of this room would slow him down enough already, so dallying until the rex came in was out of the question. Slowly, he made his way forward, careful not to get entangled in a pile of socks. The odor they emitted was mind numbing and he had to gag, but Hal had endured much worse in his time. He stumbled away, leaving the stinking clothes behind and continued towards the door.<br>\r\nHe had been right, traversing the clothes was taking him longer than he was comfortable with. The thought that he still needed to drag food out of here made him even more nervous. But what really made him worry was, that the rex still hadn't entered the bedroom. Had he missed her going out? Maybe... he couldn't see any lights, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he kept going, something in the corner of his eye caught his attention. Something above him, on a small table, glittered in the moonlight, and Hal could swear he saw something move within. Turning his head, he inspected it closer. It was round, more than double his height, and transparent. Glass. But more importantly...<br>\r\nThere was a human inside! No, not just one. Through the darkness, he could make out multiple shapes, most of them simply sitting around, leaning against the wall. But one of them was banging against the glass, waving her arms towards Hal. She was trying to get his attention, obviously... and judging by her expression, it was urgent. And only a second later, he found out, why...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad he not been distracted, he might have avoided the trap. But since his eyes were trained on the woman in the bottle, he didn't see the suspicious looking strip of plastic on the floor in front of him. Hal's foot landed right inside it - and as he tried to keep walking, he stumbled, sinking his entire leg into the sticky glue trap.<br>\r\nHal balked, but managed not to scream. Still, he berated himself for having paid so little attention. But how could he have known that a person as messy as this saurian would scatter human traps around her bedroom.<br>\r\nEven though he knew it was useless, his body instinctively struggled against his restraints. It took all his willpower, not to do so. Struggling would only make it worse, since it would only get the rest of his limbs caught in the glue as well. The right strategy of escaping was to lie still and slowly pry yourself apart. He had been lucky. With only his leg caught, it wouldn't take all that long for him to free himself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">BOOM!</font></b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">BOOM!</font></b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">BOOM!</font></b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll color faded from Hal's face as he heard what he had been listening for the entire time. Footsteps. Massive, thunderous footsteps, no doubt of the owner of the apartment. And they were coming closer...<br>\r\nHal cursed his luck and himself, desperately trying to pry himself loose. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see the caged human woman slump down, an expression of fear coming over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b><font class=\"size8\" style=\"\">BOOM!</font></b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door swung open. Inside the frame stood the massive form of the saurian woman. Her red scales shimmered in the weak moonlight, her face illuminated by the glow of her phone. Despite his situation, Hal couldn't help but gawk. saurian was completely naked. For the first time, he saw her massive, muscular frame up close. Her legs and arms were thick from intense training, her abs clear and defined. The inside of her thighs, as well as her belly, were a dull gold. The cheeks of her rear were firm, bouncing up and down with each step. Her breasts were large enough to crush an entire human house under just one. Finally, there was her face. The saurian's snout was sharp, canines poking out of the side. Her large, green eyes were looking towards her bed, clearly tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHal sucked in his breath and ceased struggling. He couldn't be discovered, or it would be his end. He couldn't help but feel sorry for those other humans. Whatever the saurian had them caged for, he didn't envy them.<br>\r\nNow, all he could do was to lie still and hope that he wouldn't be discovered...</span></div></div>",

Creatures of such unimaginable power that there are still stories about them to scare children...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, they are awakening, ready to rule the world once more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mira, the fire dragon</b><br>\r\nThe red scaled Mira is the embodiment of fire. The colossal being reaches the height of 300' and is strong enough to pulverize any structure mortals have built. In the olden times, when the primordials still walked the earth, she was a cruel and vain mistress, eager to enslave and dominate. She made her subjects worship her in any way she deemed pleasurable to her, torturing those that dared to defy her rule.<br>\r\nThe world seemingly has forgotten about her... and she will be glad to remind them of her power!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Sestra, the water goddess</b><br>\r\nThis massive shark once ruled over the sea. Her skin is a metallic black, becoming a dull grey on her belly and on the inside of her thighs. A short shock of blue hair covers her head. She is the patron of sailors and merchants and once granted them safe passage through her realm - in exchange for sacrifices. Living ones.<br>\r\nAt her 500' in height, she has built up a voracious hunger over the last few millenia. Now that she has awoken, she will gladly taste this new world...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Tiri, the forest spirit</b><br>\r\nMaybe the only primordial that doesn't see mortals beneath her. The gargantuan, 400' tall deer created the forests and was worshiped by mortals freely, since she gave them bountiful harvests and mild weather. But now, her temples are gone and the people have forgotten her.<br>\r\nBut Tiri doesn't care. She sees the mortals are once again in need of nourishment, and will stop at nothing to rebuild her temple and gather up her subjects in her warm embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Astra, the thing from the stars</b><br>\r\nBefore life on earth had even begun, Astra had fallen from the stars down to our planet. The impact knocked her unconscious... which is the only reason we ever got the chance to exist.<br>\r\nThis gargantuan, star-studded fox has no limit on how large she can get, even able to outgrow planets. Before she fell asleep for millions of years - maybe a few hours for her species - she was scouring the galaxy for intelligent life to capture. What might be the apocalypse for the planets she captures is a simple job for her: she will sell them back in her home galaxy as accessories!<br>\r\nNow that she has awoken, who knows what horrors are awaiting the puny mortals on earth...</span></div></div>",

Especially, if certain events do not happen... like an asteroid never hitting our planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dinosaurs never went extinct, and with time they only got bigger, stronger... and more intelligent as well. Soon, they found fire, metal, and before long, entered our modern age, ruling over the planet with absolute authority.<br>\r\nOf course, that doesn't mean that we never came into existence...  only that humans and mammals now occupy a rather small biological niche. Literally. Under the domination of the dinosaurs, most other animals never quite reached their height. Humans had it the worst, though. They would never exceed the height of one inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, though the history of this planet has been rife with conflict and suffering for the smaller people, after countless battles there is something that could be called peace between the titanic and tiny races of the world. Though it of course all depends on the whims of the massive dinosaurs, and on each countries laws. Some are more progressive, allowing humans and other tiny species the same participation in society. On the other hand are the places in which dinosaurs rule with an iron fist and humans are nothing more than pets at best and toys at worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rules!</b><br>\r\n1.

Feel free to add your own characters!<br>\r\n5. Please keep spelling in mind. I will try to edit out mistakes as best I can, but it doesn't hurt to use the spell check function.<br>\r\n6.
