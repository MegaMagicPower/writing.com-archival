As they were being loaded the dark wizard held up a familiar short, magical staff that looked like a well decorated handle of a whip. The creature flinched back as she remembered the many times it was used. When she was created her masters made her swallow some kind of magical stone and it that staff glows it makes her feel a lot of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark wizard smiled at this and said \"Back to your sell beast, I can handle the rest.\"<br>\r\nThe creature bowed her head and replied \"Yes master Sandell.\" And with that she spread her wings and flew back to the palace of the order of the shadows. As she landed a large gate on the side of the massive palace leading to her sell slowly creaked opened as 4 ogres, two chained to each poles as they pulled to let her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she entered her chamber and the doors creaked shut, she saw that her food dish was filled with the remains of the very wizards she had just killed. Small charges of dark teleportation magic still sending small black sparks of there chard corpses. She groaned, She hated when her masters forced her into attacking people, not only because of all the guilt but also because they always tried to feed her there remains. And she just could not bare the thought. so she will tolerate the smell threw out the night and when the bole teleported out she will get something ells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't take this much longer the creature thought as she sat down in her sleeping corner resting her head against the wall and looking up at the thick bars in the roof of her sell as she tries to go to sleep with tears flowing from her eyes.</span></div></div>",

As long as that stone is in her she can never escape. and unfortunately everything inside her wold always reform with her when she rose from her ashes. And that magic stone somehow wound up on if not inside her heart, she knows this because that's where the pain always comes from when those evil men and women use that awful staff. So in order for her to get out she wold need to operate on her self. and manage to get the stone away from her before she burns. Looking up at the skylight she can only hope that the large puff of smoke that her burning will make will go undetected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No choice\" She thought as she raised her right index finger up, As her claw finger nail extended to twice the length of a sward and ten times as sharp. \"Not if I ever want a life. I can take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully she inserted the claw into herself just below the ribcage and started cutting. She cringed in pain as she carefully made a hole in her self large enough to fit in her giant hand as she then retracted her claw and carefully pushed her hand in and up to her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held in her screams as tears flowed down her cheeks like two waterfall, stinging her opening as a few drops hit it. She has reached her heart and with great care has been searching around it for the stone to find nothing. \"Its not on my heart... That can only mean...\" With a great deal more pain and all of her will power she grabbed her heart, careful not to squeeze it or damage it and with great care puled her heart out and quickly extended her left claws and cut it in half. She quickly saw the stone and grabbed it and threw it across the cell so it won't burn with her and get back inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her heart was cut open it only took three seconds before everything went dark and the last thing she remembered was it getting really hot and then pain all over her body as she was reverted to ash. And the second the ash settled it started to flow in strange and seemingly random patterns on the floor like a small, contained river of ash. Then the flowing ash started to lift from the ground as they flowed in many streams in mid air. All of then converging in one place as her body started to reconstruct itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the ash was in a egg shape and it hardened into a shell that as soon as it was done forming cracked and a baby creature emerged and in no more then 30 seconds she began to rapidly age until she was back at full height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch\" Was all she can say as she struggled to stand, The experience took a lot out of the creature. When she got to her feet she looked over to where she threw the stone...</span></div></div>",

It was all so overwhelming for her as she started shedding tears of joy at finally being rid of that horrid thing. Tho she knew it was still to early to celebrate as she was still trapped within her prison walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she heard the all to familiar sound of metal screeching and gears grinding that announced the arrival of at least one of her soon to be former masters. With a big smile she rushed over to the door to see the form of Lucy a sorceress specializing in necromancy. Whenever its her turn to use the creature she has her kill large and powerful creatures so she can reanimate there remains to serve her. The last time she had the creature kill a small family of fire dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a tired and agitated grumble she holds up the staff used to work the stone. \"And just what do you think you are doing beast?\" she shouts up at the creature. The creature looks down at the tiny frame of one off her former tormentors, suddenly this evil woman looks so... tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked you a question beast!\" Lucy screamed as the small crystal at the tip of the rod glue and black sparks flue from the now burning stone behind the creature. Lucy looked back behind the giant creature she was just trying to discipline to the now emphasized stone in the corner of the chamber. Lucy held a stair at the stone for a few short moments before she realized whats going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a short lived feeling of terror Lucy turned her gaze back up at the creature only to see the bottom of her dirty, padded foot. Time seemed to slow for Lucy as she saw every detail of the bottom of the giant hi-breads foot as it came down. A few crusted on old organs, a broken bone or two skulls included stuck to the bottom of her foot and the entire padded area of the foot was covered in old blood stains. Obviously from the many times the guild members had sent her to kill people and from the fact that she was never aloud to have the water needed to clean herself. The last thing Lucy could think to say before the foot came crashing down and crushed her was \"Oh no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature had just planed to step over Lucy and fly away as she no longer posed a threat. But then Lucy used the rod and all the memories of all the times that she suffered at her hands a great rage like a fearsome forest fire destroying all in its path burst forth from within her. To her this was no longer a tiny person at her feet, it was a bug. A disgusting parasite. So the creature rose her right foot over Lucy and brought it down with all of her weight and strength. Again the creature lifted her foot and brought it down. Continually smashing Lucy's remains, at first turning her into a thick and well blended slime, then fusing her remains with the dirt on the floor making mud, then finally compressing that mud back into a soled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the creature was finally able to calm down she took off into the sky, desperate to put as much distance between her and her former prison as possible. But she was tired from the days ordeals and she still has not eaten. She wold soon need to land.</span></div></div>",

You walk out of your lair that was once a school, you figured that no one will bother you there. as you walk down the street letting your chains drag behind you, the sound they made made you remember what had happened to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You remember walking down the sidewalk one night, you cant remember where you were going or coming from seeing as you only had chunks of your memory only the things worth remembering. When you were grabbed and someone placed a rag over your mouth and nose and you blacked out. when you wake up you were dead. You did not know how you knew but you knew you were dead. Looking around you saw you were in a jail cell and there were cells covering the walls on the large room and in the center were lots of people in lab coats walking around studding you and others in the other cells. When you checked out your cell you saw your skin was pail and you were shackled with long chains to your cells walls and that there were tubs coming out of the back wall and into your back and you cold feel them pumping something into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden you felt very angry and started puling to get free when one of your chains snapped. As you pulled on the other one you saw that the other men were looking around to see where that sound came from. When you snapped the other one they all looked at you and ran for the door while a loud sound went off and some red lights flashed on and off as you walked forward letting the tubs pull out of your back as you charged the door and popped it open. A sound drew your attention and you saw several well equipped men run in in S.W.A.T. looking uniforms and start shooting at you and it really hurt. Angry now beyond control you charged them at unreal speed and before you new it they were all dead. as you ran threw the corridors and charged out of the door surprised that outside stood an army of undead that took the opening you made to storm the lab. You just stood there as you can hear the screams from inside as the zombies past by you to get in \"How long have I\" you began to say but your throat got sore and you lost your power of speech for a while. In time you learned that you can only say a few words at a time before you lost your voice so you had to careful of when you spoke. You also saw that in time as you hunted the animals that some zombies were following you around to get in on your kills. You found that they were smart zombies that cold use tools and follow simple commands tho sometimes you had to use your chains like whips to get your point across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting back to the mater at hand you looked up and saw several deers in the road near an ally that you know had a dead end. You picked up your chains so not to make any sound as you positioned each member of your horde around the herd then gave the command which you use noises since you conserve your voice to move forward herding the deer into the ally and using your chains to kill 5 bucks before giving the command to back off letting the rest go. You then dragged the meat out so not to get cornered yourselves then gave the command to feed, this was the only command you never had to give twice as your horde gathered around opening the knight armer helmets you gave them to feed.

She was not going to stand for everyone treating her like a baby any longer. So she grabbed her bow and what arrows she had left and set out to hunt and get food for everyone and show them all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Emma came across some deer she readied her bow and arrow, she was very good with them, never missing the mark as she practiced every day being born into a world of the undead. Just as she was about to shoot something caught her eye, a small horde of 5 zombies, all but one had helmets and they were all holding weapons like axes and machetes. \"Smart zombies!\" she whispered to herself as she hid behind some trash cans. Smart zombies were the reason that she was in a caravan. Back a few years ago everyone thought that there were only one type of zombie, mindless walking flesh eaters, not knowing that there were different classes so they made wood walls around there survivor post not knowing that in time zombies just smart enough to use weapons wold use axes to chop there way threw and flood the streets killing most of the inhabitants. As fare as anyone knew she and her friends were the only survivors of that incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma knew that with only 2 arrows left she should just sit and wait for them to start eating then get out of there. As most of them crouched down to eat she tensed up as the big one that showed no signs of rot looked around. \"Had it sensed me?!\" she thought. in there travels they encountered a class of zombies that did not rot. the older ones that played games allot and worked on the laptops in the van called them Boss zombies and she knew that she never wanted to face one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it crouched down to eat with its horde she slowly got up and backed up slowly when the top of her bow hit a bottle and it shattered against the ground and they all looked up at her.<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** *********<br>\r\nAs you look up you see a small 9 year old girl looking back shaking with fear. She had black hair and wore old worn out pants and a shirt riddled with holes and shoos held together with duck tape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then your horde stood up weapons clinched in there fists and the girl ran for it. You ordered your horde to get back to there food having to whip the order into a few of them. Just as you were about to get back down to eat you hear a young girl scream.<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** ***************<br>\r\nEmma ran with all her might to get away. Not going back to the others and lead it to them when she looked back to see if the boss zombie was following her she fell into a hole and twisted her ankle and she held in her crying in fear that something will hear her. Suddenly she herd a growling sound and looked up at a undead lion with the flesh around its mouth and across its side exposing its ribs gone and one of its eyes dangling from its face. She screamed as it slowly climbed down into the pit with her and moved toward her. She grabbed for her bow and arrows only to find that the bow was broken. She closed her eyes as it was about to pounce when she herd a sound like chains swinging, the snapping of bones, and the undead lion giving out a quick screech when all wen't quiet. She looked up to find that it was gone and a chain came down and she herd a voice say \"Grab it!\" She grabbed it tight happy to have been saved and called up \"I've got it! pull me up!\"<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** *****************<br>\r\nYou ran as fast as you could to the girl. with memories of being alive you can't let someone die if you can help it. you came to a pit and looked down at that girl about to be pounced by a lion and you quickly whipped your right chain around its neck and pulled and it flew up as you grabbed it in the air and smashed its head on the ground. You quickly unwrapped your chain from its neck and tossed it over the side telling her to grab on and pulled up when she told you she had. As you pulled her up you see her looking at you with horror in her eyes as you grab her and set her down on the ground and she quickly limped away. but before she terned the corner she stopped resting her arm against a wall as she terns to look at you for a moment then looks around for a moment then back to you. \"C-c-can y-you t-talk? she asked still afraid. \"Yes\" you simply reply. \"Were you saving me?\" she asked, you simply nod your answer. She seemed to have calmed down some but still seemed uneasy as she asked \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#1 you tell her and to your surprise you can talk just fine! Whatever was wrong must have only needed time to heal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#2 you try to tell her but lose your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#3 before you can reply a search party from Emma's caravan showed up looking for her.</span></div></div>",

When you heard some human in the distance. You weren't sure, but it sounded like they were calling out for someone called Emma. Then it hit you that the person their looking for must be this girl. You then hear the sound of ragged foot steps quickly stumbling this way. Meaning your pack had either finished eating, and had came looking for you. or more likely that they heard the humans as well, and were coming here for seconds. Knowing that a brutal fight might break out, not wanting to hurt any of the humans, or lose any of your own pack. You turn around and begin running towards your pack when you heard Emma yell. Wait! Where are you going!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma sat there waiting to hear what this zombie would say, it seemed very smart. Even for a boss zombie. But just as it was about to say something, he turned his head to one side, as if hearing something. EMMA! WHERE ARE YOU!?! Then it occurred to her that she had been gone for a while, they must have noticed she was gone and came looking for her. Then she notice the zombie turning around and moving away. Still wanting to know more about him, she asked him to come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back at Emma to see her standing to try and walk over to you. not doing so well do to the injury she got in the hole. No! you shout telling her to stay here. You, stay. I, go. No, follow You grunt. not meaning to make an old movie reference. but it was all you could manage as you feel your throat begin to shut form speaking to much all at once.But before you leave she asks. Will i ever see you again? You look back at her in shock. Not knowing anyone who would want to see him again except his pack, and thats mostly because you were their meal ticket. Thinking of what to do. When you heard your pack shuffling closer by the minute. Taking one last look at the girl, then backed away into a run stop the pack from getting their.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma struggles to her feet in an attempt to catch up to the boss zombie. When he turned back and shouted, No! She stood there in shock for a moment, then heard him say. You, stay. I, go. No, follow. Which added to the surprise. Seeing as how he made a reference for a few decades ago. He turned to leave for a second time. She tried to to say something but nothing came out. just as he was almost out of sight. She managed to say one last thing to him. Will i ever see you again? That seemed to stop him in place. turning back, he had a look that was a mixture of shock and confusion. as if he wasn't sure what to say. Suddenly he turned his head, as it seemed he had heard something else to far away for her to hear. He then turned back once more to look at her. Then at amazing speeds, took off around a ruined building and out of her sight. She couldn't figure it out. For as long as she could remember, she was told that zombies were a bunch of mindless abominations, that only have enough brain power to quench their insatiable hunger for human flesh. But he was different. He helped her when she was about to be eaten. and even when he could have killed her, he just let her go. He was not a normal zombie, but what WAS he then. Thinking about this gave her a massive headache I FOUND HER!!! hearing an all to familiar voice behind her, turning around to see a African American in his mid twenties above her.

He was the gunman. he cold hit a zombie between the eyes when its so fare away it looks like a bug. These 5 were there own party till they joined Emma's party and she took a shining to them right away. In fact without a family of her own they kind of adopted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Ashly) \"Oh Emma don't you ever scare us like that again... Are you hurt? why are you standing on one leg?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ashly picked Emma up and set her down on an old nearby trashcan and got to work on her leg while Alix called in her rescue. And Dan set up a Parameter with some of his gadgets. As soon as Ashly was done and Dan got his gadgets Sara had Emma on her back. Emma excitedly told them the story of what happened and her new dead friend. They knew she wasn't the type to make up story's so when she mentioned a new boss zombie they hung on her every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Alix) \"A super smart zombie? That is a scary thought. I didn't think it was possible.\"<br>\r\n(Dan) \"Why not? In our travels we've seen boss zombies that can throw a tank like a toy, outrun any normal car, one that generated and shot electricity, and even one that was 40 feet tall. Is a super smart boss zombie so farfetched?\"<br>\r\n(Rocky) \"How many boss zombies did those guys make in there lab anyways?\"<br>\r\n(Dan) \"I hear there are still some of them out there making new boss zombies, trying to make them there slaves.\"<br>\r\n(Sara) \"Dumb-asses.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Suddenly Dan raised his hand signaling to stop. He pulled out a mini touchscreen computer he modified to help survive in this undead world. Everyone ells could see that it was vibrating. Dan looked at it a moment then pulled out another invention of his. the stinger. a gun that shot small needle like bullets. it was designed for zombie killing, about as big as a rifle,surprisingly light weight. it held 1000 shots before needing reloaded. The bullets were designed for piercing more then impact so one bullet wold go threw several zombie heads before stopping and made almost no noise when it went off. It had a steady shooting and a raped fire setting. It came with a pouch that held 4 quick load cartridges for it. He made one for all his friends and he promised Emma when she was old enough and had training he wold make her one to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Dan)\"Were surrounded by cold bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n At this everyone ells pulled out there stingers. With Sara's arms no longer holding Emma up Emma dangled with her arms around Sara's neck for a moment before wrapping her legs around Sara's waist. It wasn't long before the sound of moaning zombies cold be herd  as they closed in on all sides.<br>\r\n(Dan) \"Back to back.\"<br>\r\nEveryone moved in squishing Emma between there backs. It was uncomfortable but Emma didn't mind. She loved watching them work. Like pros they handled the zombies with ease. Every now and again a runner or a jumper wold pop out but they made sure to take them out before they got to close. In no time at all they were in the clear. Dan confirmed by checking his computer and they were off again heading back to camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Suddenly a voice broke out over the radio.<br>\r\n(Male voice) \"This is the wolf team. we spotted a boss zombie just outside the old mall. requesting backup.\"<br>\r\n(Female voice) \"This is shark team were on our way.\"<br>\r\n(Male voice) \"This is lion team on our way.\"<br>\r\n(Male voice) \"This is hawk team in root. Anyone we know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1 \"Its claymore.\" Named do to the weapon he uses is a plain propeller he uses like a sward. this 10 foot monster kills just because there is life there to end and doesn't even eat half of his kills. Like off of the boss zombies hes a smart zombie but only as smart as normal smart zombies. He has a horde of about 20 tanks.(steroid infused zombies.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #2 \"Negative its a new one. Its using some chains to whip some smart zombies into submission.\" Emma realizes that it was the nice zombie that saved her. she begged over the radio for them not to do it that hes nice but they don't believe her and attack anyways. The smart zombie minions are lost and Emma convinces Sara and Rocky to go help him. The others take Emma home.</span></div></div>",

Use the escape route.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Lion team leader): \u201cWe\u2019re about a mile away, and we\u2019re cleaning up after last attack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Hawk team leader): \u201cWe\u2019ll be right there, don\u2019t worry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan then said, \u201cScouts are on the other side of camp, we\u2019ll be right there.\u201d Wolf team leader gave thanks, and then the signals went dead. \u201cAlright let\u2019s get to high grounds. If the tanks can\u2019t reach you then you should be safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about if they start throwing the street at us?\u201d Sara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have good aim; it\u2019s either too high or too low. We should be safe, but it is nice to have some cover.\u201d Everyone agreed, and they all climbed up the steps up onto of the buildings, where they could see the chaos going on below. The tanks were just either tearing things out of the grounds, or smashing the remains of someone. As for claymore, he was walking towards the gunmen on the ground swing his claymore all around. Claymore got closer and closer to them, as Rocky got her shot ready when all of a sudden a chain whipped claymore in the chest. The whip came from behind the gunmen.  Claymore roared in pain, stopping the tanks and making them investigate what the yell was from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the gunmen, they saw a new zombie boss walk towards them. Without another second of hesitation they ran to the sides. This new zombie boss was just as big a claymore, though he may have had smart zombies following him, each smart zombie had their weapons held the right way and ready to fight. When Emma new who this zombie was. \u201cGuys, guys, that\u2019s the zombie that talked!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the Scouts, that is what their group is called, looked at the new boss zombie they weren\u2019t it was smart until it roared, \u201cAttack!\u201d in a deep voice. Everyone their thought the new zombies would attack the remaining of the gunmen, but instead they attacked the tank zombies. The leader of the new horde had to whip some to fight the tanks, but most understood what they we\u2019re attacking. This battle was now, smart zombies versus tank zombies and claymore versus this new boss zombie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan was watching this fascinated, a super smart zombie, a zombie that can talk and control other zombies, like a horde of wild animals. As Sara she was wondering how why scientist would want to have such a monster exist. Rocky was now taking aim on some of the zombies that got close to the escaping gunmen. Alex was looking around the whole arena, trying to see if there were any other people in there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the gun men got on top of the roof, wolf team started communication. \u201cWe have everyone out, now we\u2019re sending some of our men to secure the rest of the building. What\u2019s the statue outside?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan answered this, \u201cClaymore and his horde are fighting a new zombie boss and its horde. This zombie boss is able to talk, if worse comes we have Rocky who can kill him with one shot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHawk team here, there\u2019s a super smart zombie boss now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Dan answered, \u201cWhere are you and your men?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe got a little side tracked but we should be on the roof tops in about five minutes.  Shark team is with us too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan didn\u2019t respond because he looked back at the fight, only five tanks were standing one had all five of the smart zombies still fighting it while the others were either falling from head shots or, trying to beat the new zombie boss. As for the new zombie boss and claymore, claymore lost his weapon as this new boss zombie whipped its chains around claymore\u2019s arms. Tearing them off, next whip was to a tanks face, ripping it off. The last chain whip was to the top of claymores head, where it tore it off. All the tanks were down, and claymore was killed.</span></div></div>",

Emma was so excited that she almost didn't notes Rocky attaching a extra barrel and scope that only his stinger had for extra long range accuracy. Normally he wouldn't bother at this range but with a boss zombie its just best not to take any chances. Emma turned as she heard the sound of the weapon being set on the roofs ledge. Her eyes widened when she saw him take aim at her new dead friend. \"NOOOOOOOOOO!\" Emma cried as she tackled Rocky causing him to let off a shot into a window a few feet from his target. She looked back down at him as he looked up at her before wiping his chains causing all of his smart zombies to follow him into an ally and vanish into the shadows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Rocky) \"EMMA! WHY DID YOU DO THAT!?\"<br>\r\n(Emma) \"He saved my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocky just covered his face at her response then looked down as several men in swat uniforms and a wolf's head painted on their backs ran into the ally way only to emerge a moment later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Man's voice) \"This is Wolf team, no sign of targets, they vanished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan looked down at the battlefield before turning to his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Dan) \"Hey guys... Were did Claymore's body go?\"<br>\r\n***************************************************<br>\r\nIn another ally a large zombie was walking with his head barely hanging from its spin and a little flesh. With one hand it gripped its head with its meaty fingers and set it back were it was meant to be before its boss zombie regenerative ability kicked in. When its neck was fully restored it picked up a dead body and started eating it as it walked in the direction of the local air port to get a new blade.<br>\r\n*************************************************<br>\r\nYou managed to escape the area threw the sewers with your horde. As you walked along you thought about what just happened. First the battle. You never faced another as the living called you, Boss Zombie before. All those hours you spend every day training has payed off. Then the reaction you got upon victory. You were used to the living attacking you after you've saved them. Your unbeating heart has become numb to that. But that girl... No living has ever tried to help you before. At least... not since you were alive yourself. You heard squeaking and turned to see that your horde had found a rat's nest and were gorging themselves. You never cold get used to the idea of eating rats but if your horde wanted them they deserved them after their performance in battle today. So you leaned back against the wall and waited. The sewers were a labyrinth running threw out the city and you made plenty of twists and terns so even if the solders did figure out you were down here its unlikely they wold find you. Fortunately you memorized the sewers layout.<br>\r\n*****************************************************<br>\r\nEmma was back in camp getting angry glares from everyone she passed. Word of what happened spread quickly.  SPLAT! A rotten tomato collided with her face.<br>\r\n(Child) \"Dead lover! Go get eaten already!\"<br>\r\nEmma just wiped it off her face and kept walking. It was better then the rotten eggs she was bombarded with earlier. She crawled into her now vandalized tent. Keeping the tent open to keep the stink from building up inside.</span></div></div>",

You...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI snuck in; it seems I smell like the dead, so they didn\u2019t wake up or something,\u201d the little girl whispered.

One minute you save your hero, the next, people are throwing things at you.\u201d Her head went down as she said this. You hear groaning and see your horde awaking up and seeing the little girl. Though with one whiff they think she\u2019s another zombie and leaves her alone, looking for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou here now,\u201d you say as your wrap an arm around her and go into a hug. \u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks and says with watery eyes, \u201cYour welcome.\u201d You both hug for a moment or two, until you hear gun shots, and things falling into the sewerage. \u201cThat must be my friends,\u201d she said cheerfully, until she looks back at you, and realizes that she put you in danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore another word is said, someone shouted, \u201cEmma, where are you?!\u201d Then another voice says, \u201cThere\u2019s too many of them!\u201d You let go of Emma and see she has some pistol or something. You both follow the sounds of bodies falling and gunshots, until you see a light from an open manhole and people climbing out. One of them saying, \u201cThere\u2019s no way she can survive this mess.\u201d Emma is about to say something back, but you cover her mouth and wait, until the humans leave, and the zombies, walk away. You put Emma on your shoulder and climb up the latter, until she is just above the manhole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you say about me not surviving?\u201d Emma asks all cocky like. Her friends turn around and see her walk towards them. Emma raises her hands and says, \u201cStop, I want you guys to meet someone.\u201d She gives you the \u2018come on\u2019 jester and you do as she asks, hoping for the best right now. \u201cGuys this is the boss zombie, which has now saved me twice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them looked shocked at her, for trusting you and Rocky gets his shot ready, \u201cEmma move now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I won\u2019t let you hurt him; he saved me, and saved those men from yesterday, his a hero.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s just another zombie Emma, all he eats are the living,\u201d a girl said now lining up her shot.

Amy was the first to break the silence. Everyone huddle up, everyone started slowly making there way towards her, making sure to keep an eye on you. All except you Emma and Rocky. Rocky come on. Amy spoke. Why? We all know whats gonna happen if we look away from him. Okay, ouch... you think to yourself. I know i\u00b4m a zombie. But I still have feelings. If he was gonna attack us he would have done it by now. I think we can at least give him a benefit of a doubt for now. I\u00b4m not taking my eyes off of him as long as Emma so close to him. He yells. Amy thinks for a moment. Emma, could you please come over here for right now. No. Emma state. If i move, your just gonna shoot him! Emma, we promise that none of us will hurt your new . . . . \u00a8friend\u00a8, now please come here. Emma stands there for a moment. not sure what to do. Thinking she may need a nudge. Emma, go. you say. surprising her. Don\u00b4t worry, I\u00b4ll be okay. you say with a little strain in your voice. Over the years, you\u00b4ve learned that you can still speak in complete sentences, as long as their small sentences and they don\u00b4t have big words in them. With your words of encouragement. Emma slowly makes her way over to the group. Keeping an eye on Rocky making sure he won\u00b4t pull the trigger or anything, once Emma was with the group. and a little more hard pressing from Amy, Rocky steps away from his spot, and joins the group. Once there they begin to talk about what to do, always keeping an eye on you every few minutes. So, what do you guys think? Amy starts. There\u00b4s nothing to think! Rocky yells. He\u00b4s a zombie, not just a zombie, but a BOSS zombie, and the only kind of good boss zombie is a DEAD boss zombie. I gotta go with Rocky on this one. Alex steps in. These guys are no good, its one thing to  be dealing with a slow dumb one. But i don\u00b4t even wanna think about having a zombie smart enough to talk this close. I don\u00b4t know, Dan say\u00b4s, this zombie really doesn\u00a8t seem so bad. If he was, he would have eaten Emma and attacked us by now. I think he really is safe to be around. I agree with Dan. Said Sarah. He\u00b4s defiantly not the threatening type. And because he can talk, there may be a chance we can learn something from him. What do you mean? Amy asks. Well think about it. Sarah continues. He obviously retained at least part of his humanity, which would completely blow our old idea of zombies out of the water. Maybe we could learn about how zombies act from him. She\u00b4s right! Dan say\u00b4s, and because he can talk, it would be much easier to figure things out. Not to mention that he\u00b4s a boss zombie. Alex steps in. every other boss zombie brought in had to be killed first, if we brought him in, he\u00b4d be the first boss zombie to ever be studied thats still.... shall we say, \u00a8alive\u00a8. That would be HUGE. And it would be a big bonus for us bringing him in. Extra rations, more free time, Hell, we may even get promoted to an official team! Finally! No more small fry stuff, no more taking orders, no more getting our credit taken away from us. This could be our moment!!! What happened to being on my side? Rocky snaps. Uh, sorry Rock, Alex stammers. But they\u00b4ve made a lot of good points. Well then let me remind you all of the one most IMPORTANT point that shows that we need to put a BULLET in that THINGS head right NOW! He begins shouting.And that point, is that he is a zombie. A MONSTER! A undead hell spawn that will stop at nothing at devouring the living! NO HE\u00b4S NOT!!! Emma yells, Surprising every one, including you. HE\u00b4S NOT A MONSTER! She continues. HE\u00b4S THE CLOSET THING TO A FRIEND I\u00b4VE HAD HERE IN YEARS!!! But Emma, We\u00b4re your friends, aren\u00a8t we? Sarah said, You guys are my family. Thats different, everyone else in the compound treat me like i\u00b4m a freak or like i\u00b4m not even there. He\u00b4s the only one who treats me like i\u00b4m invisible, or like i don\u00b4t belong. He\u00b4s just as much human as you or me, and he has just as much right to come with us as any one else!!! as a single tear ran down her face. This silenced everyone there, and left them all in shock. After a few minutes, Amy broke the silence. Well then, i guess thats five yeses. All thats left is you Rocky. They all look towards him. Y-your seirious? Your making me decide? Rocky, we ether do this together, or not at all. Amy states. Rocky stood there in silence, thinking of what to do. Until he finally let out a sigh, and said. Fine, you win. everyone there seems to visibly relax at those words. You yourself let out a sigh of relief realizing that you were safe. For now anyway. But i want to make sure that he\u00b4s locked up tight. I mean it! Hand cuffs, muzzle, the works! I am not letting anyone die on my watch! There no need for that! Emma started. He\u00b4s already shown that he\u00b4s- It\u00b4s okay Emma. You say to everyone\u00b4s surprise. If that\u00b4s what it takes, then fine by me. Well alright then. Amy starts, we\u00b4ll split up. Rocky, take Emma, Alex, and Dan, call for a pick up crew. Make sure they bring a S.W.A.T. team van. Mean while Sarah and I- I wanna stay here! Emma Stated. Emma, sweety, it might be safer if you stay with Rocky and the others. No way! I may have to listen to what you guys say most of the time. But i\u00b4m putting my foot down this time! She say\u00b4s as she literally picks her foot up, then brings it down just as quick. I\u00b4m staying with him! She points to you to put emphasis behind it. Amy lets out a sigh of defeat. She knew that once Emma put her foot down like that, there was no talking her out of it. Alright, she say\u00b4s, Rocky, take Alex and Dan with you to call for the pick up team. Mean while Me and Sarah, Emma grunts with a pouty look on her face. AND Emma, She adds while glancing at Emma. The pout quickly being replaced with a smile. Will stay here and keep an eye on our new. . . friend. She finishes. Every one nods to this and begins to go there separate ways, Rocky stopping by Amy momentarily. Be careful. He say\u00b4s, Oh come on Ron, she say\u00b4s with a smile, you know me well enough by now to know i can handle myself. Rocky smiles back before looking at Alex and Dan saying. Alright, you heard the lady, lets move! Right, they both say. then walk away.</span></div></div>",

This had been quite an eventful day. You would have never thought that a day that started out so normally, Well, normal by zombie stature. Would end with you being brought in to a human settlement after five long years... Wait. HAS it been five years? now that you think about it. You had already lost track of time in the facility, and it\u00b4s been at LEAST a few years since then... of course with nobody keeping track of date or time now a days, its hard to tell HOW long it\u00b4s been since this whole apocalypse deal started. It was then that you realize that Emma\u00b4s been talking to you for a while. Um sorry, you stammer, what? I said that we should get to know each other. Now that we can hang out whenever we want! Like what? You ask. Silently worrying to yourself. Well, You already know my name. she says, so whats your name? Oh no. you think. I knew this would happen! I. you start. I. . . . Don\u00b4t have one. you admit. This surprised Emma, Sarah, And Amy, who were listening in to the conversation. What do you mean you don\u00b4t have a name? Emma ask\u00b4s. Do you just not have one? No. I had one, I think? I, can\u00b4t recall it. I thought so, Sarah calls out. It\u00b4s a known fact that zombies can\u00b4t remember their pasts in great detail. if at all. I suppose it wouldn\u00b4t be to much of a strech to say a boss zombie would forget thing, even one like you. You nod to her. Ignoring the back handed compliment. So you can only remember a part of your life? Emma says almost sadly. Bits, and pieces. you stammer, some... better then others... with a hint of sadness. Emma looked up at you for a moment, then down at the ground as if deep in thought, then thinking of something, puts her fist in her hand, then happily saying. Well, if you don\u00b4t have a name, then why don\u00b4t i give you one!!! Surprising you and the others. You\u00b4d, You\u00b4d give me a name? You said in shock. Ofcourse! That\u00b4s what friends are for right? She speaks happily. What do you think about this Amy? Sarah whispers. Can\u00b4t be worse then any name the soldiers or scientist would give him. Amy responds. Good point. Now let me think. Emma considers as she thinks for a minute. She opens her eyes looking down at the chains attached to your arms and legs. Thinking about it for another minute, an Idea came to her. I got it! She almost yells. We\u00b4ll call you Link! Link? You and the others say at the same times. What made you think of that ... Interesting name, Emma? Sarah asks? Yeah, never really hear a name like that before? Amy adds. Well, i thought of Link because of the links of his chains. So i thought it would just make sense! She said while smiling. Wow Emma, That was a really great idea! Sarah says, Yeah. Its not a bad name either! Amy adds. So what do you think? Emma asks you. You then ponder the name. Link. An interesting name to say the least. But there\u00b4s something more behind it. A simple four letter word given to you by a little girl. Just seemed to represent more then just a new name, but a new start. Finally, a chance to reintegrate into human society, sure, it may be a long time before you actually could reintegrate, if at ALL. But you feel like this name could be the first step in the right direction. Yes. You finally say. Yes i think i like that name. Link. You say just to hear it once more. Well then, Link it is!!! Emma starts. I believe its time for a formal introduction! Hello! Its a pleasure to meet you Link!!! putting her hand out towards you. You extend your cold hand towards hers and take it into a firm hand shake. The pleasure is mine, Emma.You say, smiling back. Which lead to both of you giggling. which lead to full blown laughing. Even Amy and Sarah began to chuckle lightly. Incredible, you think. I can\u00b4t remember the last time i laughed like this. Hell, i can\u00b4t remember the last time i laughed at all! But this happiness wasn\u00b4t bound to last. *COUGH* *COUGH*! You put your arm over your mouth to stop the cough. *COUGH* *COUGH*! Oh no! *COUGH* *COUGH*! Not now! *COUGH* *COUGH*!  Emma and the others take a step back at the sudden outburst of coughing. Whats wrong? Emma shouts, worrying about you. I-*COUGH*-Can\u00b4t-*COUGH* *COUGH*! You try to explain, but it was no use. You knew all to well what was happening. It\u00b4s the same as it was back then to. While you were still able to speak, you could only say so many words before your throat sealed closed and wouldn\u00b4t allow you to speak. But you found that you could still push yourself to keep talking, if only a few more words. But if you did, it would lead to an uncontrollable spat of coughing. which would last for several minutes, after which would end with you being unable to talk at all, if you tried it would only lead to more coughing. Then you would have to wait several hours for your throat to heal enough for you to say anything else. over the years you\u00b4ve gotten better at controlling it. Allowing you to say more and more each time. But eventually it would always end the same.*COUGH* *COUGH*! Emma stood there unsure of what to do. It was then that Sarah walked in front of her. Emma, stand back. Let me take a look at him. She says. Uh doc, Amy says walking up to her, are you sure that\u00b4s such a good idea. Don\u00b4t worry Amy, i think i can handle this. Sarah replies. Yeah i know but we may not be sure its still the same thing here. Oh come on Amy, sure he may be a little... different, now. But its still the same human build here. Even so, we\u00b4re dealing with a... she pauses. a \u00a8you know what\u00a8 here, are you sure there\u00b4s anything you can do? To be perfectly honest.... i have no idea. which surprised Amy. But i can\u00b4t stand back and let him suffer like this, She says looking at you while hacking and wheezing away. he\u00b4s obviously proven that he still has his humanity in tacked. and its my oath to help anyone, living, or other wise. Besides, this would be a great chance to get a good first look at him. You know, before everyone else starts poking and prodding at him. Amy seemed hesitant at first before sighing and saying, alright, against my better judgement, I\u00b4ve decided I\u00b4ll trust you on this. stepping back, allowing her to go through. Sarah begins to slowly step closer to you. Hello. She says slowly, my name is Dr. Sarah Miles. I\u00b4m gonna see if i can help you here. Do you understand? She ask. You nod through the spasms. Good, she says. setting her bag with a first aid symbol on the ground. she begins to ruffle through her bag looking for something. Then proceeds to pull out a bottle of water. now before i can do anything, we need to stop your coughing. So i\u00b4d like you to slowly drink form this, and see if that helps. She says removing the cap from the bottle. You then quickly take the bottle from her hand, then proceed to chug the bottle down. Once finished, leaving a little less then half the bottle finish. You notice to your surprise that you\u00b4ve actually stopped coughing! This is the first time it\u00b4s stopped that fast. Good. she says. pulling out a tiny flash light. one use for looking inside a persons ear or throat. now I\u00b4m gonna have to take a look inside, Which surprised both you and Amy. Uh Doc, i\u00b4m not so sure thats the best idea in the world. Amy says with more then a hint of doubt in her voice. Just trust me on this. We need to show him that he can trust us as much as we trust him. Now i\u00b4m going to put this inside your mouth, she says turning the light on. So i\u00b4m going to need you to open your mouth as wide as possible, and say ah. Well, you think, with more then some fear of this event. Here goes nothing! AHHH! you manage as best as you can, opening your mouth as wide as possible. Sarah then slowly begins to put the light in place. looking into your throat while moving the wooden Popsicle stick around from place to place. Hhhmm. she says. Interesting! It looks like some moderate swelling and inflammation. She says, pulling her hands away form your mouth. Calming both you and Amy down. If i\u00b4m right, then if he takes some of these, she says while pulling out a box of... cough drops? Then it should help him, at least a little bit... she finishes as she takes two drops out of the plastic wrapping and hands them to you. Okay? you think to yourself. Well, i\u00b4ll try anything if it helps stop this damned cough, Bottoms up. you whisper. Placing the two red pills in your mouth, sucking and chewing on them everyone in a while. Before swallowing the little of whats left of them down. Now we just wait a few minutes. Then we\u00b4ll see what happens. After sitting for a few minutes, listening to a few of Emma\u00b4s stories of her time in the group. Sarah stands up. It\u00b4s time. she says. Knowing all to well what she means. Its time to figure out whether or not you\u00b4ve found a cure for your throat. You slowly open your mouth. and. . . . </span></div></div>",

You begin jumping around in excitement, you then stop in front of Sarah, grabbing her hands, Thank you Dr. Sarah! You, my dear woman, are a MERICAL WORKER!!! Uh, um. Your welcome! she stammers. I CAN\u00b4T BELIEVE IT, FIRST I FINALLY MAKE A FRIEND AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, THEN I FINALLY GET A NAME THAT BELONGS TO ME, AND NOW, NOW TO TOP IT ALL OFF I GET MY VOICE BACK! THIS! IS! THE GREATEST DAY IN MY LIIIIFFFEEE!!! you scream. SHHHHHH! Amy hisses. ARE YOU TRYING TO LET EVERY SINGLE ZOMBIE IN THE AREA KNOW WE\u00b4RE HERE!!! Oh. right, sorry...you stammer. Got a little to carried away there. You slowly slinked back to your seat next to Emma. No, i, ugh. I Didn\u00b4t mean it like that. she studders, i understand that this is a big day for you, but try to keep it reeled in until we\u00b4re in a safer spot... Of course. my bad. At any rate, Sarah interrupts. we\u00b4re not 100% sure that was a definite cure, we may need to do some more studying just to be safe. In the mean time, we\u00b4ll just assume that the cough drops are a temporary fix. we\u00b4ll just keep an emergency pact cough drops on hand for you. which reminds me. she says, rifling through her bag, after that little out burst of yours. you feel as though your blushing, while Emma snickers at your side. you may need something to help you. she says as she pulls out a red lollipop and passes to you. Ummm. thanks doc. but i don\u00b4t know if i really needs this. Oh come now Link. You really should listen to you doctor. All of a sudden, this dark aura seemed to envelope her. YOU WOULDN\u00b4T WANT TO MAKE YOUR DOCTOR UPSET!!! She said with a dark tone. I suggest doing as she says. Amy whispers in you ear. People who refuse to follow her doctors orders when they come in, always come back out with something worse... ALWAYS... she puts more emphasis on the second always. One time Rocky had to go in for a check up about a bloody knee. Emma joins in, He came back out with a twisted ankle, and a bloody nose... I-I see... you say with a sick feeling building up in your stomach, Then i\u00b4ll gladly take one! Thank you very much!!! you stammer. Almost instantly, the dark aura around her disappears. Glad to hear that Link. She says, smile returned to her face. Holy crap!!! you think to your self. She\u00b4s even scarier then the TANK zombies i fight on a daily basis. You think as you take a red one. remove the rapper, and begin to suck on it. Aawww. i want one too. Emma pouts. oh alright sweety. Sarah says pulling out a yellow one. Here you go. Thank you! Emma chimes, as she begins to suck away. Swinging her legs happily on her spot next to yours. Sarah then proceeds to pull out a blue one, then place it in her own mouth, would you like one as well Amy? Sarah asks, No thanks, i\u00b4m good, Amy states. Alright, suit yourself,she says, putting the jar away. Amy then looks at Sarah, then looks away, although, she starts, if you happen to have a green one in there, i wouldn\u00b4t say no. Clearly blushing as she said this. Sure thing, Sarah says chuckling a little. Passing her a green lolli. You and Emma look at each other for a moment, then start to giggle at what your watching, only to quickly stop as Amy looks back at you. Only to continue giggling as she looked away. so there you were, sitting in a small circle, just you and your new friends. Telling stories and laughing as if with out a care in the world. It was moments like these that would make you think that nothing was wrong with the world, that everything was as it should be, and that life was actually still good and simple. Well for right now, as far as you cared. They might as well be....</span></div></div>",

Soon word of what you did spread threw out the dragon territory's and you were brought before the council<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n\"Draga you have been charged with defending a human from your own kind! This is a serious charge young lady. How do you plea?\" Said the large old dragon on the main rock in the council chamber \"Guilty\" Said Draga boldly with her head held high. This caused all in the chamber to gasp and whisper among themselves till the head dragon banged his fist against his large rock \"Draga do you even understand what you did wrong? you speak as tho you saved a hatchling!?\" The Head dragon asked with anger evident in his voice. \"I don't see why were fighting with the humans when we can make peace with them! If half the things said about them are true then just think at what they can do for us!\" Draga yelled out causing an uproar from most of the council as she can hear most of them cursing at her and some even spiting at her. \"QUIET! QUIET!\" yelled the head dragon as he pounded his rock again causing cracks in it. As the rest of the dragons became quiet he terned back to Draga. \"Draga you have come from a respectable bloodline and that is the only reason you haven't already been given the death sentence! So, you are hear by exiled for 100 years! If by then you realize the foolishness of your actions you may return. But if not, then you will be hunted down and killed for this most wicked of crimes!\" Draga huffed at this and terned to leave getting hateful looks from others as she went along.

Not trying to eat me?\" he asked. \"Yes.\" she said sounding a little hurt that he wold say that. \"Now hold still while I tend to your wound. I'm sorry but this is going to hurt\" She said as she pulled out the dagger that had gone into the bone and used a small flame to stop the bleeding.

Laughter could be heard as the smoke cleared, and a tall dark figure emerged from the smoke.  Dawned in a black cape with a tall collar, the figure turned to face Draga.  She could only see the bottom of his face, which was contorted in a large smile, the mask he wore fitted with his face, giving him the look of a very jolly, if not slightly creepy, figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello young one, looks like you got yourself into a bit of trouble now haven't you\" the figure said with a very jolly voice that varied from high and low pitches.

Was she saved, or just taken by a scavenger to be dealt with later, things still looked very glum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a half an hour though, she heard someone else approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe he pulled it off\" said the person's voice, \"he stole a dragon from right under their noses.\"  Grace squinted as light shone threw the cover that was over her.  Blinking a few times, she saw a young man standing beside her pulling off the green grass blanket that covered her.  \"For a person who can't use magic, he's better than any wizard I have ever seen.\"  The young man, who looked like he was around twenty, looked at Grace saying, \"now, you have the Escapist to thank for saving you.  But I helped... sort of, so I'm going to let you go now.  Just... don't eat me alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man took out a knife and began cutting the net off, and just as he cut the last line he quickly ran behind a tree, fearing the worse.</span></div></div>",

Where is your clan?\" Draga follows him cautiously into a nearby cave. He blows on some gathered drift wood by the back wall and it catches quickly. Draga sits next to it, drying her amethyst scales.

Trying again, to use her powers of illusion for a complete human transformation, but her two bushy fox tails always seemed to be there. She had been trying for over a year to perfect her trick, but before she could learn the final lessons terrible things happened that she wished she could forget. Some beings came in armor and shields to her home where the last bit of her kind sought refuge from the world. Her surviving only by her mother hiding her only precious kit in a basket and letting the nearby river take her. The cries of her family and her kind waking her from her dreams often, the shields with the dragon stabbed with a sword burrowed in her skull for as long as she lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked on at her illusion of a young female, in tight hachimaki clothes with a white and red kimono top, imitating a picture she had seen on a scroll. Her black hair against her pale skin, a tight bun with chopsticks through it. She held a blade saddled to her waist as it was only an illusion of a stick, but to many others her illusions could be quite real. From small flames, blades and other things to about her size, she could trick anyone that something was there when it was not. The biggest illusion she could do was change a donkey into a horse for her to ride. The illusions could only be done at a close proximity and only when she kept her mood and temperament. If she lost focused or her emotions or feelings got the better of her, the illusion would disappear. As a fail safe though, if she was ever in any danger, a kind of natural protection of being a kitsune was being able to turn invisible as a failsafe. Though, after performing intense illusions she would need to rest for a time. She seldom found food, mostly rats and berries, but if there was a meal at the ready, she didn't think stealing was out of the question. She had to survive too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTraveling along the river, taking a boat across to another shoreline, after searching for months of anyone of her own kind, she sought to leave the place of her birth, too scared to returned to the place of her birth and too scared to relive the memories of her past. Anything larger than the fires she created or a campfire became a sudden concern for her and she never liked to stay long in a place as she seemed to only travel by the river's side...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had tried to make friends in the past with humans, by slipping into an illusion, but due to her incomplete transformation, her tails remained and she would run off as a fox to gain distance. She found it was much easier to approach humans at night, to wayward travelers and explorers such as herself. She found it a great chance to learn of tales from far and wide and to see if her kind existed somewhere else, only to hear screaming in the morning when she couldn't hide her two vulpes tails in the shadows of night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWashing off her face, she heard running and screaming nearby...</span></div></div>",

She knows she has gotten deep into human territory and if she can find a nice place she might be able to settle down and make herself a home. And maybe she can get a bath! While on the move stopping only for sleep, food, and helping the occasional human in need, Sara has become less then fresh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sara was walking threw some trees she saw that ahead of her was a cliff with a large waterfall. \"Yes! at long last, a shower!\" Sara thought to herself as she picked up pace for a short while till she saw what stood between her and that shower.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nIt was just another average day in the town of Gandell. The villagers were busy working and the guards were keeping watch for creatures or bandits that might attack there village. threw wise planing the village was built in a prime location with limitless fresh water, fertile land, and the hunting there was good. Unfortunately all those good qualities attract the attention of bandits and monsters. this makes it hard to keep up a good defiance since every time they try to build a wall its destroyed before its finished and they need to work hard just to keep the armory full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the ground started to shack and soon there was a giantess standing over the village. At first everyone just stood there looking up at the giantess as she looked back down at the village. \"Um,I don't suppose you humans will let me get to that waterfall will you? or maybe let me live here? the giantess asked.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nWith all those humans there the shower was out of the question but she cold at least freshen up. As Sara was waiting for an answer she saw that the village seemed damaged around the edge, like it has recently been attacked. She also saw that the waterfall ended in a small body of water just big enough for her to sit back in. But there was no stream flowing out meaning that the water left threw an underground stream. So if she can't get to the waterfall she'll just need to find another place to clean up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Sara felt a slight sting in her leg. She looked down to see a arrow stuck in her leg. \"A simple no wold have sufficed\" she said as a few more arrows hit her left arm. \"Don't make us waist more arrows to kill you monster!\" yelled a human guard as every guard lined up and aimed a bow at Sara.</span></div></div>",

' What do you want?\" wincing from the arrows in her leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \" Why are you here, so far away from all your fellow giants?\" he asked her. Sara didn't want to answer that, she didn't know whether they intended to kill her or let her live; the latter seemed to be the less likely of the two at the moment. \" I-I am an outcast, I thought I'd just stop by your waterfall and freshen up before leaving.\" she said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Well you are always welcome to stay here, you just have to do one thing for us.\" he said.

In an instant, men came forward to pull them out. \" I think they just want to look up my dress.\" she thought, getting down on her knees so they could pull it out. She wore a simple peach coloured dress and her long black hair came down to her back, just below her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  She felt the men grab the arrow and each tried to yank it out, it was stuck alright but they got it out after a few tries.

I'm being watched by a pervert!\" she thought as she called out \"Whose there?! Show yourself!\" Some light footsteps came from the woods just before a ... girl came out.

I can set you two up!\" At this Sara face got a little redder \"Um no that's ok.

Those bad men never leave us alone. I can't wait to see the look on there faces when they see you! There going to pee themselves\" said the girl giggling at the thought. \"I bet they will but I don't think you'll get to see it. I don't intend to let them get that close. But I'll give you all the juicy details when I get back.\" Said Sara happy with this new topic. she hasn't had a conversation in a long time. \"YA! your going to kick there butts! . . .Why do you need to be short to have a skirt?\" Emily asked. \"Um I beg your pardon?\" Sara asked. Emily stood up and said \"My mom said\" Emily suddenly got into a held up one finger like she was about to give a lecture and in her best grown up voice \"That girl my be a monster but she is still a lady and a lady that tall has no business owning a skirt.\" At this Sara turned red again. \"WOW! That's a rely deep shade of red. can you turn yellow to? That's my favorite color.\" Emily asked as she sat back down. \". . .I'm going to need a pair of pants\" was all Sara said as she got out of the water and got dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily got up and ran over to Sara as she clothed herself. \"If you need pants I know lots of girls in the village that might help make you a pair. they all seem to not like that you have a skirt for some reason.

She immediately set off towards thems, hoping to stop them from hurting anyone in the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The bandits were looking for someone to rob but many had somehow fled into their houses, which made it difficult. They felt the ground beneath them shaking and they looked up to see a giantess approaching them, they were armed with swords and a couple carried crossbows. Powerful tools indeed but against a giantess they wouldn't do much good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Sara saw them, on their horses and she easily identified their leader as he seemed to wear gold rings on his hands and even a gold chain. \" Easy boys, not going to be afraid of a woman are we?\" he said to them, there were five of them in total and he didn't mind losing one or two as it meant less to share the loot with. The two with the crossbows aimed it at her, intending to shoot if needed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Sara didn't want to actually fight, she wasn't the fighting type but she could try to intimidate them into running. \" Come on now, lets not make a mess out of this. I'd hate to have wash all that blood off my feet. Of course, I am getting a little hungry and after eating all the villagers here, I still feel there is room in here for more,\" she licked her lips and pretended to gaze down at them in hunger. They seemed to be shaken by this and were having second thoughts about coming here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   She took a step forward, the earth shook and the horses were unsettled by her, she was getting to them as well! \" Great, I won't have to fight them at all!\" she thought. </span></div></div>",

Besides, your with Red Gold Mike! Now lets show this overgrown winch what real men are made of!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara gave a deep sigh. Not only had the leader called her bluff, he got them more riled up then they were before they even saw her. \"Now spread out men and advance. keep a good distance from the others!\" yelled Red Gold Mike. the men slowly advanced on her spread out to wide to get all at once. \"Archers aim for the eyes, FIRE!\" Shouted Red. Sara was barley able to get her arms up in time to block the arrows from hitting her eyes. The swordsmen took the opportunity to attack while Sara was shielding her eyes. Sara felt several sharp pains in her legs as the men stabbed and slashed at her. Sara jumped back a few times and quickly puled a sword that was stuck in her left leg. She saw that some of the men were struggling to keep the horses calm from the earth shacking from beneath there feet and this gave her an idea. Sara bent down and then shot up into the sky, The bandits were backing up not sure what she was doing. As she came down just before landing she kicked her legs down with all her strength sinking her into the grown up to her knees and shacking the grown violently casing the men to all fall down and the horses to throw whoever was on them and take off. Sara took advantage of the situation and quickly snatched up the men shacking there swords from there grips and holding them against her belly with her left arm. When she got the archers she felt pain in her arm and looked down to see that most of the men have drawn daggers and were stabbing her repeatedly. \"Hay stop that!\" Said Sara as she tried to take the daggers from them with her free hand. But the men just moved them around while stabbing so she couldn't get a grip or stabbed at her fingers. \"Fine bee that way.\" She said as she squeezed the humans against her belly to force the air out of them. This cased the men to panic and stab harder and faster for a while and Sara just watched as they grew weaker until they lost consciousness, then she loosened her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Sara realized something. There leader wasn't there. Sara looked around for about 10 minuets before giving up and heading back to town. \"I caught everyone but the leader. Red Gold got away. She said to the captain as she set the bandits down for the solders to arrest. \"Red Gold Mike?\" The Captain asked. \"You know him?\" Asked Sara. \"I've herd the story's. All obviously propaganda. You see some of the more crafty bandit leaders go around disguised spreading wild story's about themselves like how they killed 10 giants all by themselves or in this ones case how hes the son of a ancient god and how he killed an entire nest of dragons with only his bare fists and that hes called red gold for the dragons blood he got all over his rings that day. By doing this they can convince there men to do just about anything and scare some more gullible towns into surrendering without a fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he walked off with a few of his men to take the bandits to the jail they had in the guard house. After having a few of the town guards pull the arrows from her arm and put herbs on her cuts she went back to her guard duty. It was a long and boring job but it was worth the boredom.</span></div></div>",

This place is so well populated because the surrounding mountainous terrain make it all but imposable to get to and since the rocks are to uneven, gaped, and unnaturally hard no one has ever made a path making it hard to get back to civilization with ones catch. As the sun was about to rise the sound of rapid flapping could be heard as a lone, somewhat large bat flapped frantically to get to its destination as soon as possible. As the sun peaked its head over the horizon and the rays of light started to quickly spread over the land. The bat looked back and saw that the sun's light was coming rapidly as if the Sun itself was hunting her down. This motivated the bat to flap faster as she lets out a frightened squeak!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sun's rays were gaining on her the bat saw her cave coming up fast as she struggled to keep 100% speed. as she darted strait for her home, And just as he felt a painful burning in her toes she managed to get into the safety of her nice, cool, dark, cave. As soon as she landed she hopped around in a little dance trying to cool her toes just before a cloud of smoke enveloped her then departed only to revile a girl taking off her slightly burned shoes to revile her badly blistered feet and started fanning them with the end of her black dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I get for spending to much time exploring the areas away from my home\" Said Emily as she stood up, cringing in pain as her feet throbbed as she walked in them deeper into her cave to her well hidden coffin to get some sleep. \"Oh well a good days sleep in my coffin and my feet will be as good as new, tho I'm going to need to get some new shoes soon\" She thought as she threw her now useless burned shoes into a deep hole with no apparent bottom that she used to throw out trash from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed deeply as she puled her coffin lid open with a loud creek that echoed threw her cave as she eased herself in and settled comfortably as she slowly lowered the coffin's lid as set her arm crossed on her chest as she closes her eyes and listens to the sound of the dripping water further back in her cave. As the water from the puddle the droplets formed flowed in a path leading out of the caves mouth, flowing over the rocks like a babbling brook and the thoughts of . . . \"CRAP!\" Emily shouted as she opened her coffin and got back up, moving as fast as her sore feet will allow. to a more privet part of the cave were the water flows into a large hole leading who knows where. \"Typical! when I get comfy I got to PEE!\" Emily shouted as her formed seemingly vanished as the shadows grew darker as she ventures further back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily sighed as she walked back to her coffin with an empty bladder as she thought oh how it came to this. From a castle to a cave. When someone is bitten by a vampire tho they become a vampire themselves they also become there biters slave, unable to disobey. There are only 2 ways to be a free vampire and that is to be born a vampire or to be turned and your master killed. And since a slave vampire cant do anything but help and obey no mater how much they hate there master they can only hope. Emily was lucky enough to be born a vampire so she has never known slavery nor has she ever enslaved anyone. After seeing how slaves rather being turned vampires or humans she cold think of no fate more cruel as she watched her own kind brutally beat them regularly just for fun. and to have everything taken from them. Even the humans kept as pets were treated as lifeless objects. When she tried to get the others to stop she was driven from her home and forced to run far away until she came upon this place. A nice quiet spot with all the animals you can drink tho she had to admit it was lonely up in this cave miles from anyone. She even tried to catch some small animals as pets to keep company bus sense she didn't like the idea of forcing them to stay by enslaving them they always ran away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily again settled down in her coffin and closed herself in to get some much needed sleep.

The moment the hunting party got there they were already pulling arrows from there kills. The only skinned most of them leaving the rest to whatever beast will take it. By the time it was dark all the men has as much fine fur as they can carry back home and they had found a cave to set up camp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had a few fires going and each had a different kind of animal cooking on it, a feast fit for a king for the six men as they took out grog that they brought with them. Everyone was having fun and one was celebrating more then the others. James was wobbling deeper into the cave till he found a hole to throw up in. After finishing up he was about to head back when he saw something hidden in the dark against the wall on the other side of the cave and went to explore it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men that were still sober, at least for now were surprised to hear there friend screaming beeper in the cave. \"A GRAVE! A GRAVE! WE\"RE CAMPING IN A GRAVE!\" The clearly drunk man was trying his best to run back to the others. \"A coffin! there is a coffin back there!\" He said as he came up to them. Despite him being drunk everyone got up to check it out.<br>\r\n************************************************************************<br>\r\nEmily was panicked. a human was right outside her coffin. She had already closed the coffin lid to hide and was hoping he was to drunk to see the coffin in front of him. Closely she listened for a sine. She cold hear his hart beating, thump...thump...thump..thump..thump.thump.thumpthumpthumpthump! His heart was pounding faster and faster and if Emily weren't already dead hers wold be to. \"A GRAVE!\" She heard him scream as he ran off. Emily almost instantly calmed down. She thought she was lucky that the human that her coffin was a grave. She thought that it meant they wouldn't come back here again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily opened her coffin and stretched before getting out of bead. Her feet were well again and she was hungry, she figured that the men were all as drunk as the one before and wouldn't think twice about a bat, even a large one flying out of a cave. Before she cold change she heard all of the men running her way so she cursed under her breath and ran back to her coffin and shut herself in, unfortunately a little to late. \"Holly shit did you see that!? w woman just shut herself up in a coffin!\" Shouted one of the men. \"Its a vampire!\" shouted another in panic. Emily cold head one of them running off as the others piled up on top of her coffin. \"You think we can hold it in there?\" Asked the first one. \"I hope so, I hear they are really strong.\" Said a new one. Shortly after Emily heard the one that ran coming back, with the sound of chains. Before she knew what was happening her coffin was upright and they quickly bound her in chains.<br>\r\n#########################################################<br>\r\nIts been days. Emily overheard the humans say they were going to sell her on the black market. Apparently dark wizards like to harvest vampire fangs for reanimation spells. They figure a live vampire that can regrow fangs wold fetch a high price. They haven't fed her the hole time and she was growing desperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1-   At the black market.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #2-   A thief sneaks up on the hunters at night, sees the expensive looking coffin and opens it hopping to do some grave robbing. (Emily eats human for the first time but after draining the hunters she rips there heads off so they don't tern to vampires as she did with all her kills. The thief is to scared to run and Emily talks to him/her.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #3-   After constant attempts to break free during the night Emily finally gets free, grabs her coffin with her super vampire strength and gets away. She hunts animals.</span></div></div>",

So, he was raised by the other members of his pack. They would travel, feeding off of humans when they found them. The pack only changed into human form to fit in with humans. His whole life, all David knew was what his pack told him. But he always had a feeling in the back of his mind that this wasn't right. Whenever he was around a human, his wolf instincts would kick in and he would kill it. But he would regret it later, feeling guilty and ashamed of himself. The human didn't deserve to die, but he couldn't control himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No wonder the humans are scared of us' he thought one night, 'They see a wolf on two legs running toward them and they scream for their lives because they know we are going to eat them'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe once brought this issue up with the pack leader, Nick, who scolded him for such thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humans are food and nothing else. You may have a human form, but you are a werewolf and those humans were meant to be our food\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid kept his thoughts to himself from then on. But Nick couldn't help but notice that David had started leaving the pack once in a while, coming back with a dead animal. He stopped coming with the pack on trips for \"food\". Finally, the pack leader had enough. After killing a group of humans in the woods, Nick called David over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, have a bite. It won't hurt. Remember what I told you, humans were meant to be our food\". But David backed away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is it huh? You'd rather be more human than wolf?\" The leader hit David on the side of his muzzle, \"You want to defend those humans?\" Nick's fist hit David's stomach. After David was bleeding on the ground, he watched as his pack slowly walked away, leaving him for dead. The young werewolf quickly got up and started walking. He didn't know where but he knew he had to find help. But who would help a werewolf? He didn't have the strength to change himself to his human form. He soon felt his strength leave him and he fell into darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------<b r></b>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid slowly opened his eyes to find himself facing a ceiling. He quickly sat up and found he was in a bed. Looking around the room, he saw a computer, television and trophies. He kenw what all of these were from walking around homes of humans he had previously killed. Before he could get up, he heard the door opening and turned towards it. He saw a boy, who looked around his age in human form, come in. The boy was carrying a plate of chicken and a glass of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the boy looked at the, now awake, werewolf, he....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFemale werewolf story</span></div></div>",

At that moment the food and watter dropped to the floor and the boy ran out the door. luckily the floor had that strange fur humans had on their floor sometimes so the glass did not brake. \"...Oh well\" David thought as he jumped out of bed and started eating off the floor.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------<br>\r\nJack looked on with horror as the werewolf looked back at him and then moved its eyes down to his torso and licked its chops like a dog that just spotted a meat platter.

Where do you live David?\" Jack's dad asked.<br>\r\nAfter thinking about it, David kinda lost his home in a way. After getting kicked out of his pack, he's pretty much unwelcome in the woods now.<br>\r\n\"I...Don't think I have a home now...\"<br>\r\n\"That's terrible! Wait, how about you stay here with us!\" Jack's mom said.<br>\r\n\"WHAT!?\" David and Jack said in unison.<br>\r\n\"That's a great idea honey! He can live here until we can find another home for him.\" Jack's dad said.<br>\r\nImmediately, both Jack and David began spouting out a number of reasons why he shouldn't live there.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I've decided. David will live here until we find a new home for him. David, you can sleep in Jack's room.\"<br>\r\n\"What! But dad!\"<br>\r\n\"Really mister...Jack's dad, I'd rather, uh, stay in an empty room, if that's okay with you...\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry boys, but we don't really have any spare beds in our house, and I know Jack has an extra mattress in the closet, so it's really the only choice.\" Jack's mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid helped Jack carry his sister Sara back into her room. Afterwards, Jack got out the mattress and laid out as far away from his own bed as possible.<br>\r\n\"Okay, now here's some rules. 1. No eating my family. 2. No eating me. 3. Don't ever go near my bed when I'm asleep. And 4. always follow the first three rules. You got that?\" Jack said, getting on the bed without ever taking his gaze off of the furry beast in front of him.<br>\r\n\"Alright, you don't exactly trust me, and I understand. But believe me when I say that I will not try to hurt any of you. Okay?\" David said, practically pleading to his sort-of human friend.<br>\r\n\"Well...Okay, but remember the rules!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack, surprisingly, was fast asleep withing half an hour. David couldn't sleep though. He still kept thinking about his animalistic urges. If it took control of him a few times before, then what if...<br>\r\n\"No...This time, I'm in control. This is how I'm going to live my life from now on. My diet is completely human-free...\"</span></div></div>",

He knew that he might scare her, so he stayed out of the room, standing next to the door. Inside, he could hear them talking about him.<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm sure that I was just tired last night, so I was seeing things.\" Sara said.<br>\r\n\"No Sara! He is a real werewolf! He ate an entire steak raw!\" Jack said.<br>\r\n\"You gave him raw steak? Oh, that's a laugh.\"<br>\r\n\"Sara, I'm not kidding! You saw him eat that chicken off the floor last night, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n\"Well Jack, I guess that's just goes to show how tired I was last night.\"<br>\r\nDavid felt uncomfortable eavesdropping on the two. On one side, he wanted to tell her that he was a real werewolf, but then she might panic and do something stupid. On the other, he could keep faking it and be accepted, but then he'll found out eventually, and that would just make things even worse.<br>\r\n\"Look, I'll even prove it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was so transfixed on figuring out what to do, he didn't notice them exit the room and see him standing beside the door.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, but how long have you been standing there?\" Sara asked.<br>\r\nDavid blinked and looked beside him to see the two humans staring at him.<br>\r\n\"Um, I, uh...\"<br>\r\n\"Were you listening to us?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, truthfully, yes.\"<br>\r\n\"You know it's rude to eavesdrop on people, right?\" Sara said, crossing her arms.<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, it is.\" David admitted.<br>\r\n\"Can you explain why?\" Sara asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, you see, I just didn't want to scare you again by seeing me...\"<br>\r\n\"What? Why the heck would I be scared of--\"<br>\r\nDavid opened his mouth as wide as he could, showing a few strings of saliva covering his razor sharp fangs, and a gaping hole inside leading to his throat. He closed it after a few seconds, seeing and smelling the fear on both humans.<br>\r\n\"...J-Jack?\"<br>\r\n\"Yea-yeah?\"<br>\r\n\"...I-it's real...It's really real...\"<br>\r\nDavid wanted to say something, but he couldn't think of the right words to say. All he could do was look away, his ears drooping flat on his head. After what felt like a year, he heard Jack speak up.<br>\r\n\"H-hey, at least he won't hurt us.\"<br>\r\n\"What?\" Sara asked, looking at Jack.<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah! Believe me, I don't wanna hurt anyone on purpose, really!\" David said.<br>\r\n\"What!? No way, you probably just trying to...\"<br>\r\nDavid had to use his last resort. He went down on all fours, flattened his ears and opened his eyes as wide as he could and looked up at both of them. It was a little trick he learned when he was a pup to lure humans to the forest back then. He was lucky that Sara was a dog fanatic, but Jack was still suspicious of him.<br>\r\n\"Oh! What big eyes! Well...I guess he could stay here for a little while...\" Sara said.<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" David said, closing his eyes since it started to sting.<br>\r\n\"B-but, don't think I'm not gonna watch you! If you lay a claw on anyone, you're gonna get a karate chop of a lifetime!\" Sara said, going downstairs.<br>\r\nDavid was unsure just what a karate chop was, but he knew enough that it was some kind of threat. He watched as Sara went down the flight of steps, then focused his gaze on Jack.<br>\r\n\"Well David, now you've got two people watching you. Now you'd better behave now, or I'm gonna make you wish dad never found you. So, just stay in my room and wait for me to bring you something, in case you get hungry again.\" Jack said, watching the werewolf closely.<br>\r\n\"Got it.\"<br>\r\nDavid walked back into Jack's room and lied down on the mattress. Hopefully, he'll be strong enough to change into a human form when he wakes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jack got to the table downstairs, he saw his parents and Sara at the table, eating. Sara seemed very distracted at the moment.<br>\r\n\"Jack! About time you woke up. What took you so long?\" his mom asked.<br>\r\n\"Oh, well...I was, uh, introducing David to my sister Sara...\"<br>\r\nSara began coughing at what Jack said and drank some orange juice to flush the food down.<br>\r\n\"Something wrong Sara?\" their dad asked.<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing. Just, uh, I've never met someone like David before, that's all.\" Sara said, returning to her food.<br>\r\n\"Oh, well alright dear.\" their mom said.<br>\r\nThere was a knock on the door and Jack left to answer it.

They varied in color and there was a hole in the roof of the cave and at a certain time of day the sun light wold come threw it and onto the shiny waterfall and her cave wold light up and sparkle and she enjoyed it immensely for it was the reason she took it as her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem was that she lived in a highly desired location and her kind lived by the law that might makes right and at least once a week another hydra wold come and challenge her for it. This has made her strong and a powerful fighter, which was the only reason that she was allowed to stay in hydra society sense she only killed and ate humans in self defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuman was considered the most tasty and juicy of foods and a hydra that past up a chance to eat one, unless sick was considered strange and was constantly harassed. The only ones that did not were the stronger hydras, but only because they thought that she was only using the humans, allowing them to cut off her heads, enduring the pain to grow more heads to become stronger and they began allowing humans to cut off a head or two before killing them to gain yet more power. Had they known the true reason they wold have gathered together and drove her off years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jaselin was enjoying her homes beauty with all 13 of her heads looking all around her home she herd something that caused her to tern her heads to her caves entrance to see a human man wearing cloths that told her that he was no warrior as he cowered against the wall looking out without even seeing Jaselin as there were other hydras near by. She felt bad for the little guy and went over to try to communicate with him but when he terned to see what was making the noise and saw her he terned white as snow and reeked of fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi I'm Jaselin\" She said but got no response \"Don't be afraid I wont hurt you\" she tried to ashore him but he just covered his eyes. \"So your trying to be friendly to them?!\" yelled a deep voice. She looked up to see prince Grudas and two of his guards. Jaselin was large even for a hydra as most were about 60 feet and she was 100 feet tall and for this reason the king and queen insisted that there son go for her in order to get stronger offspring so he came up regularly and boasted about all the perks of being a royalty, tho she was never interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrudas was standing there gritting his teeth at her with his only head, he was a cowered and so never lost it in a fight. \"Despicable!, how cold you degrade yourself to food of all things! I order you to eat that thing NOW!\" growled Grudas. \"No, he is defenseless.\" Jaselin replied. Grudas ordered his guards to attack and the two charged her, she faced up to 3 hydras at once before with more heads then her so she had little trouble with them but as she was fighting she herd the human scream and with one of her heads looked over just in time to see Grudas swallow with an arrogant smile on his face. Angry at him for killing a helpless human she pressed harder in her fight and beat off her attackers with her heads. As Grudas saw his guards getting pounded he ran off \"I'll be back with more guards!\" he yelled back to her as he ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaselin groaned sadly knowing she had lost her home and she started to quickly gather as many of her shiny rocks in her mouths as she could before running off.

Also we have no idea what direction she went.\" The king glared down at Grudas \"Weakling!\" he yelled as 4 of his heads bit in around his neck and with a powerful chomp from each of them bit off Grudas's head so quickly that Grudas barley had a chance to react.

She looked down and saw it was laird like steps with 3 ledges and near the bottom of this cliff was a human village. Looking down at the wall of the first ledge she saw a cave that looked like it had plenty of room and with a slope not to fare to the right she can come and go with no problems, there was even a forest with a small lake in it she can go hunting in. Jaselin walked over to the slope and stomped on it a few time to test if it was safe. convinced it could hold her she walked down it to the ledge near the top and walked into the cave. It was had more room then her last cave and it to had shiny walls but unlike her shiny rocks the ones in this cave were yellowish and she she can't see threw them. But there was a problem, the floor of the cave was littered with bones most of witch were human. \"Something else lives here\" she thought. Oh well if its to small to eat a human hole I can take it she thought as she walked in and cleared a spot to spit out her shiny rocks and then saw that there were some shiny rocks like hers deeper in. Jaselin smiled to herself as she started sweeping the bones out with her tail  and when she got them in a neat pile outside she dug a hole pushed them in and covered up the hole. She then went back inside to admire her new home but then she herd something and peeked one of her heads out of her new home and it was.</span></div></div>",

He was the apprentice of the medicine man yet here he was going off monster slaying. \" should have said yes\" he mumbled under his breath recalling what got him into this mess in the first place. He was just finishing up in the herb garden and was about to return to his master when the daughter of the lord of the lands walked up to him and told that he was to take her on a romantic picnic tonight. Jill was the most beautiful girl in the village but she was a spoiled, snooty, control freak. Needless to say she was not his type, so he terned her down and she stormed off shouting about how sorry he was going to be. Two hours later he was drafted and now on the following day with almost no training he was at the front lines off to battle monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to die\" said Dan as he hung his head drawing the attention of the man at his side. Josh looked down at the kid with scrawny arms a helmet that covered more of his face then it was meant to and his armor hung loosely on him as he drug a sward that was to heavy for him to pick up. \"Pore kid\" he thought as he terned his attention back to the path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan's arm felt like it was about to fall off as he looked around and saw that every one ells had bows and arrows. Figures he wold be the only not aloud to have one in a fight against harpy's.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------<br>\r\nJaselin looked out of the caves mouth with one head and saw a small army of about 20 humans coming closer to her new home and Dan caught her attention. \"Beater keep an eye on him. Those little ones have a lot of tricks to use in battle\" she thought to her self as she backed up into the cave.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------<br>\r\nDan and the others were coming up on the cave and they started going over how they were going to hide in the cave and ambush the harpy's and as they approached the entrance they all stopped \"Um... where are all the bones?\" asked one of the men \"The harpy's probably cleaned up.\" another answered \"Harpy's don't clean up they fly over the mess.\" another argued. \"Perhaps someone got here before us and killed them already.\" Dan said with some hope in his voice. \"Perhaps...everyone wait here I'll check it out.\" said the leader as he slowly crept in and vanished into the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone watched and waited. Some even held there breath till they saw him come back. He was walking backwards slowly, keeping his eyes forward. \"Well?\" one of the men asked, almost whispering. \"There's a hydra in there with over 10 heads.\" he answered. \"Did it eat the harpy's?\" asked the man to the left of Dan. I don't think so. I saw no scratches on it\" The leader answered back. \"So what do we do?\" asked Dan hoping he won't haft to fight it. \"We don't really have the right weapons to fight it. But if we hide and let it fight the harpy's then perhaps we can kill the winner without a big fight.\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#1 They hide and wait for the harpy's but the harpy's since the humans first and attack them instead and Jaselin saves them and she can speak human<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#2 Jaselin comes out and everyone runs and someone shoots Dan in the leg with an arrow to distract her while they escape and she can't speak human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...ok I'm stuck can someone add a chapter(more then a few sentences long) to break my writers block?</span></div></div>",

Everyone backed away as it got closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaselin, deciding to show the humans that she was friendly, or at least harmless, slowly approached the opening on the opposite side from where she had heard the group talking. She purposely made a large amount of noise so that they would know that she was coming out and wouldn't get too startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she exited the cave, heads looking in all directions to make sure it was safe, she saw the humans on the other side of her cave entrance, just where she had heard them last. None of them were talking, and all were holding things in their hands, all of them pointed at her. She kept a few of her heads looking around for danger, while her main head and all the others turned to look at the group. She made no move towards or away from them, nor anything she considered threatening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of hunters were incredibly tense, Dan included. He was in the very front, closest to this massive, 13 headed monster. The way it was staring at him made him think that they were no threat to it, a mere curiousity- or even worse, food. Nothing happened for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started with a man in the back. He saw the monster, calculated his odds of survival fighting such a beast, and didn't like them. He decided that the best way to survive was to run. With a thump, he threw his spear to the ground and took off running, tearing off every bit of armor he could to lighten himself. His neighbor saw this, and followed suite half a second later. The more heads that turned, the more ran. The leader himself was about to run when he realized that if they all ran, it would chase after them and eat them all. He needed to give it something to distract it. He saw Dan turn an begin to run, almost running the leader over in his haste to get away from the beast. The leader knocked an arrow, sighted, fired, then began to run as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arrow ran true and pierced Dan's thigh from behind, causing him to tumble forward. He gave a cry as he did so, a cry of pain and anguish. He attempted to stand and run again, but found that his injured leg would not support him- the best he could do now was hobble away, and there was no chance of that. He heard footfalls behind him, very loud footfalls. He slowly turned around, and fell over backwards when he found himself face to face with three hydra heads!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaselin had watched them flee with weariness. No matter what she did, they never seemed to get it through that she wasn't dangerous. Then she saw one of them turn and something leaped from his hands and into the legs of another. They both ran, but the injured one couldn't run anymore. Thinking, she thought that whatever it was that the man had injured him with must be laming him. She approached and was about to pull the small stick out with one of her heads when the man turned and fell. She withdrew her heads slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how do you expect me to get it out if you fall over like that?\" she asked kindly.<br>\r\n____________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan was on the ground, thinking about the last moments of his life. Then, the hydra pulled back slightly and emitted a curious series of hisses, growls and a few small barks. Dan stared up at the creature blankly.<br>\r\n____________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on now, I'm not going to hurt you, I want to help you,\" Jaselin said again, attempting to make the human understand her. The human stared at her blankly still, white faced and reeking of fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> Well, this is rich. He can't understand me. What do I do now? </i> she thought to herself.</span></div></div>",

I'll head back to my castle to make preparations, This is a little more series then over grown birds.\" Lord Mathew replied as he terned to leave town, his men following behind him.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------<br>\r\nJaselin Looked down at the small human at her feet and took notes that he was shacking and smelled more of fear then before and when he dropped his hands away from his ears she saw a little blood dripping from them and tears were flowing from his eyes. \"Crap...\" Jaselin thought as she saw the damage her friendly greeting had done. \"Maby something more simple\" she thought to herself but before she had the chance to think of something she heard many flaps coming closer. Looking up she saw a small army of about 30 strange creatures she never saw before. they looked like humans but they were covered in brown feathers and in place of there feet they had birds talons and sharp beaks where there mouths should be and wings on there backs. She also heard them squawking and some of them were saying things in the language of humans so she cold not under stand them. Soon they flew down and started attacking her. At first they were nothing more then an annoyance to her, only causing a few light scratches on her hard, thick hide But she then heard a scream and looked down to see one of the strange creatures trying to drag off the human at her feet. Angry now she snapped down with one of her side heads and chomped down on the strange creature without touching the injured human.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------<br>\r\nDan was in a lot of pain as the hydra stopped making that awful sound. looking up threw his tear filled eyes he say a mix of guilt, frustration, and sadness on all of its faces. Dan then heard many flapping wings coming near. Looking back he saw the harpies coming, all of them, and they looked mad! \"Invaders of our home!\" one yelled \"And noisy to\" a female one called out. \"Kill it!\" another called as they all flew down and started attacking the hydra with there talons but seemingly only pestering the giant beast. Seeing this as a chance to escape he tried to pull himself along. \"Oh look a sweet to eat.\" Dan stopped and looked up to see a young female harpy standing in his way. \"Come lets go somewhere more quiet for lunch\" she said in a cheerful tone as she grabs his uninjured leg and started dragging him off. Dan screamed in fear as he was being dragged away to be eaten and tried to grab onto something, anything to no avail. Suddenly one of the hydras heads snapped down on the young harpy and ate it. To Dan's surprise the hydra kept its head looming over him protectively.<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** ********************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice #1- Dan crawls to Jaselin for protection.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It took only a moment for Dan to make a decision. Between harpies that definitely wanted to eat him and a hydra that was eating the harpies, he'd take his chances with the hydra. Maybe it would be full after it ate them all. As such, Dan began to crawl as quickly towards the hydra as he could, before another harpy could try to snatch him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaselin noticed the human begin to crawl towards her, as if for protection. <i> Maybe it finally understands that I won't hurt it, </i> she thought to herself. A harpy then interrupted her thoughts with a scream and a dive, forcing her attention back to the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan, now as close as he could get to the hydra as he ever wanted to get, curled up in the fetal position on the ground. He began to say small prayers, to God, or the Gods, or whomever was listening: please, just let him come through this with his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaselin, noticing that the human had stopped, decided to lay down and cover him with her forelegs. More and more harpies had noticed the human and, with their failure to injure her, were trying to get to the human. Even with thirteen heads, she couldn't fend off all the human's attackers at once for much longer, so the best way to keep him safe was to cover him with her harpy-proof forelegs. When she did so, the unintelligible screams she heard from the attacking creatures became louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight ways off, hovering in the air beyond the battle, was an older female harpy. She was the leader of this troop of harpies, and as such was the oldest and most experienced. She watched her brethren attack this strange creature's hide with no effect. She had watched the human crawl to safety, how the creature protected the potential meal. And now, as she watched, she found the weak point of this creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attack the heads! Blind the eyes of the intruder!\" she screamed. The harpies immediately switched their attention from the creature's forelegs, where the human was, to attacking the heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaselin almost didn't notice the change in tactics. She heard a scream, and then the heads that were nearest the human began to get attacked, furiously. Startled, she pulled them back, but the strange creatures kept coming after her heads! Hissing and growling at them, she began to snap wildly at the creatures to keep them away from her head's eyes, and most importantly, her main head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA harpy went first, getting caught by a head, crunched, then swallowed. The harpies nearest the young female that had just got eaten, enraged, attacked that head. With a sudden swarm of 5 harpies for that one head, they managed to make it to that head's eyes, attacking it with the bird claws on their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaselin's heads screamed as one of her heads was blinded. She was angry now at these creatures. She would have to bite off that head to get full use back, a waste of her time and energy. They would pay for that. The wild snapping of her heads turned to precise, pinpoint attacks on the creatures surrounding her. More harpies began to fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the troop leader realized that she would not win this battle. The creature was too strong, its hide too thick, its heads too fast. Nearly half of her troop was gone, and only one more head had been blinded. They would have to find somewhere else to live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Retreat!\" she screamed. The harpies quickly disengaged, then followed their leader as she turned and headed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaselin watched the strange winged creatures leave. An interesting, almost boring fight that had suddenly turned serious. But she had won, as she always did, proving once again that she was the strongest one standing. Carefully, she got to her feet, trying not to disturb the human at her feet any more. And while she could still smell the fear in the human, it wasn't nearly as strong as before. She backed away a few steps, then began to try to think of something that she could do to show the human she was friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan looked up at the bright sun, letting his eyes adjust. He blinked furiously and looked for harpies. Had it killed them all? No, in the distance he could see a small group of harpies flying away. Hearing footfalls, he rolled over to see the hydra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> It protected me. Killed the harpy that was dragging me off, then kept me safe, </i> he thought to himself. The hydra seemed to have suffered a little for her trouble, too- two heads had their eyes closed, and seemed to have been injured. But for now, the hydra was just staring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> I don't know why this hydra doesn't eat me, but I don't care. It saved my life, </i> Dan thought. A twinge in his leg reminded him of the arrow still stuck in his thigh. He knew what he had to do, as an apprentice to the medicine man, and it was going to be painful. Gritting his teeth, he relaxed his muscle as best he could, then pushed the arrow further in. The only way to get an arrowhead out was forward, not backward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was painful, but he finally managed to push the arrow through to the other side of his leg, exposing the head. Grimacing, he broke the bloody head off, then pulled the shaft out through the back of his leg. The wound began to bleed, but he ripped up his pant leg and placed it over the wound to stem the bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaselin, in the meantime, had decided that the best way to show she was friendly was to let the human do the work. Since she had no experience with human customs or could understand human language, she didn't really know what was threatening or nonthreatening. She didn't want a repeat of her greeting scream- that, it seemed, was frightening for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan stood up, and saw the hydra staring at him with all uninjured heads. With the arrow out of his thigh, he could walk and run again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... goodbye?\" he said with a tentative wave. To his surprise, the hydra repeated his movements, lifting a forepaw and waving back at him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> Maybe I should try to help it, I know some medicines that would heal those eyes, </i> he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Dan do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: He goes back to town, his wound is more pressing than the hydra's at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: He decides to try to help the hydra with its injured eyes.</span></div></div>",

There is a rare type of plant that he has been growing for his master that he always carried some with him in a pouch just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Keti plants were able to absorb a small amount of magic out of the earth and store it in there leaves. Dan of course knew nothing of magic but he did not need to. All one needed to do is place one on a wound and it help it heal faster and takes away the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Dan looked into his pouch and saw he only had three. Dan groaned knowing he did not have enough to heal it since it losses its power if damaged. Suddenly Dan heard a loud thump and looked up to find that the hydra had actually bitten one of her injured heads off at the lower neck and had already started chewing away at the other.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n Jaselin was growing more and more irritated. The harpies had a lot of grime under there nails and some of it got in here injured eyes and they itched more then anything she had ever experienced before. Pain was one thing, she can handle that. After all, with all the fights she has been in she was used to it. But this! this irritation in her eyes was new and intolerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n So she did the only thing she could do to stop it. She started chewing away at the necks of her injured heads till they were off. Jaselin let out a happy hum from all of her remaining throat's as she laid down right there and looked down at the human and saw that it had a strange look on its face. \"Oh I hope I did not just accidentally offend it.\" She thought.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n Dan cold not believe what he just saw. The hydra just chewed two of its own heads off and now it was looking down at him with a content look on all of its faces. Dan just stared wide eyed and mouth opened for a moment but then snapped out of it. \"Well at least that solves the leaf shortage\" Dan thought as he took one out and tore off a pies of his shirt that stuck out of his armor and tied the herb to his wounded leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Dan stood up and walked closer to the hydra, preying that he was right about the hydra. \"Um... could you lower your stumps a little please?\" Dan asked only to get a confused look from its heads. \"Um There I want to reach that!\" Dan called up to the hydra as he pointed to the bloody stump.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n Jaselin was confused. The human was trying to say something and she did not know what it was. Then it walked a little closer and pointed to one of the short stumps that had once kept a blind head attached. \"What you want to see?\" Jaselin asked as she pointed to the stump. This got a more positive response from the human as it seemed to smile and bob its head up and down. \"Well ok...\" She replied as she got her stump as low to the ground as it will reach without her getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Jaselin's surprise the small Human took something out and stuffed it into her throat hole. Jaselin was in shock. \"D-Did it just poison me?\" she thought with fear till she saw that the blood has stopped flowing and the pain went away. Before she can think of anything to say two new slime covered heads shot out of the stump that has split into two new separate necks. \"Wow... that should have taken half a day.\" she whispered to herself  \"It seems I'll still need to wait an hour before I can open the eyes tho.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Jaselin got over the surprise she looked down at the human that was now on its butt looking up at her with wide eyes and a wet face. Jaselin can even hear its tiny heart pounding. \"Guess it did not know we can do that.\" she thought. When it calmed down she lowered her other stump down for the human to reach.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nDan kept pointing up at the stump till the hydra pointed to the same stump and made a strange hissing sound followed by a grunt. \"Yes! that's it bring it down.\" he said as he gestured with his head and hands. The hydra lowered its stump till it was within reach and he walked up to it and stuffed a Keti leaf into its throat. He watched as the small amount of blood instantly stopped. \"Strange, they don't normally work THAT fast.\" he thought before something worm, soft, and slimy slapped him in the face. As Dan fell down he looked up in surprise as two new heads  were dripping with slime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dan looked back at the rest of the hydra it had lowered its other stump for him. Dan got up and gave it the last of his Keti and ducked to the side to avoid getting slapped in the face again as two more slime covered heads shot out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nchoice #1 Dan and Jaselin try to communicate. they learn each others names and a storm forces Dan to spend the night in Jaselin's cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice #2 Dan heads back home.

I don't think my master wold let me keep you and I doubt the nabers wold be happy about it ether. Look there is your home, YOUR HOME! I am going to MY HOME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hydra seamed confused for a moment then she seamed sad when she figured it out and terned back around to head home. Dan took a deep breath then started back to town. Because he cold not move very fast do to his leg it was dark by the time he got to the town entrance where two guards stopped him as soon as they saw who he was. \"Holt! how are you still alive boy?\" Asked one of the guards that Dan recognized as one of the men who he traveled up to the harpy's layer with. \"The hydra did not hurt me. It seamed friendly toward me and even protected me when the harpy's showed up. Oh and it drove them off so I think were safe now.\" Dan replied. The two men looked at each other for a moment and the guard that said nothing quickly struck Dan in the back of the head rendering him unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dan came to he saw he was in the old abandoned hut just outside of the village and that he was gaged and tied up on the dusty old floor that creaked with each movement he makes to try to escape. \"So your finally awake.\" Dan looked around for the source of the voice and saw Jack the team leader sitting with the two men that had taken him. \"How did you escape the beast boy?\" Jack asked as he walked in front of him and pulled out the gag. \"I already told them. The hydra did not hurt me.\" Dan replied. Jack just smiled \"Ok kid don't tell me. It changes nothing. I have good news and bad. The good news is I have been promoted.\" Jack said with pride. \"Congratulations.\" Dan said sarcastically only getting a chuckle. \"And the bad news kid is that I'm afraid I can't let you live.\" Dan eyes shot wide open at hearing this. \"WHAT!\" That's right kid. I can't let anyone know your alive. Its your fault really, You should have just been a good boy and let the beast eat you when I shot you.\" Jack said with an evil grin. \"YOU!?\" Dan shouted at the news that it was Jack who shot him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Dan herd heavy foot falls as a shadow comes over him and he looks up to see one of the guards holding a big ax over his head and Dan was petrified. \"No you fool not inside the pore travelers stay in this place sometimes and I can't afford any evidence lying around.\" Said Jack as he re gaged Dan as he squirmed desperately to escape. \"Take him deep into the forest at the top of the cliff and kill him there. And make shore that the body is never found.\" The guard rested the ax on his shoulder as he hoisted Dan up on the other. \"Yes sir\" He replied as he headed out the door and up the path toward the woods as Jack and the other guard headed back down to the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** **************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaselin just sat in her cave hoping that the human now realized she was friendly and wold come back when her stomach growled for dinner as she had not eaten since the harpy's.

I guess you would say that it started when I got lost, or before that when I had a different clever idea, and before that...  Oh bother.  I suppose I should just tell you a few facts, and let you work it out from there.<br>\r\n    I am Enelias, renowned wizard of the great drow city of Xassimar, the most feared in all the underda... Well, I suppose I do have to be honest.  Xassimar barely qualifies as a town, much less a city, and survives mostly by staying out of the sight of larger drow cities that might threaten it, which is every other drow city, and I, while perhaps not its weakest mage, was the least experienced of those free of apprenticeship, and like my city, I was mainly surviving by staying out the sight of those with the power to crush me, which was much of the city population.<br>\r\n    I was fortunately well endowed with the ability to be a craven coward who hid from the least threat.  Most of my fellow apprentices scorned me for that ability, but they eventually learned that standing up to an overwhelming threat has certain drawbacks.  It was a lesson they remembered for the rest of their lives... Not that that was very long in most cases.<br>\r\n    But I had other character weaknesses, at least in the eyes of my fellows.  While my fellow drow spent years remembering each insult and planning elaborate and painful revenge, I was too busy trying to just survive to try for a revenge that was nearly as likely to kill me as my intended victim.  This of course led to me being considered a spineless weakling, but I was a live spineless weakling, and being not worth killing means not being killed.  That is a considerable advantage when you realize that half of all drow die, painfully, at the hands of their fellow drow.<br>\r\n     Being so determined to revenge ourselves on hurts and insults to each other, we drow are equally determined on revenge for having been driven from the surface so long ago, and we try to get revenge when we can and at any cost.  Fully half of all drow die at the hands of surface dwellers who resist our revenge.  <br>\r\n      [Another half dies from the various dangers of the underdark, and virtually none from old age.  If you wonder about three halves, well, Drow women are quite prolific.  They are also said to be quite willing, but I can not say myself, and would not if I could.  Women are not pleased to have their affairs mentioned, and the male who does talk is, if he is found at all, not in any shape to mention her affairs again.]<br>\r\n    When our revenge costs us so many lives, one might ask why we bother.  Those asking would be told that it is dishonorable and unjust to let such crimes go unpunished, and that the surface dwellers are weaklings who can be robbed and killed easily enough, and that anyone unwilling to go is a cowardly weakling who should be beaten to a pulp.  What they would do if you asked again, I of course did not try to find out.<br>\r\n    So it was that I took part in several raids against the surface, in which I achieved my prime goal, of surviving them.  Unfortunately[?] I was not as successful in my secondary goal, of avoiding the notice of my superiors, who decided that someone so apt at evading them must be skilled at evading the surface dwellers as well, and put me on scout duty, where they were proven largely right.    <br>\r\n     So I became a well trusted [to the limited extent a drow trusts anything, least of all another drow] scout for drow forces and was well in the lead of drow forces when we moved against the tiny human kingdom of Fairhome and I was in position for my folly with lovely Sabine.   </span></div></div>",

Still, the possibility of great riches and glory was enticing and if we succeeded, we would return to exalted positions [which would scare those who did not go and cause them to unite to backstab us...  I did mention that drow are the chief cause of death to drow, didn't I?] <br>\r\n    So there was considerable enthusiasm as we set out, our heads filled with visions of murder, pillage, and torture [which was what they had been filled with before we left], and my own head filled with the good news that I would be surrounded by less of of my murderous kin who would kill me as soon as I turned my back, and the bad news that I would be surrounded by the murderous surface dwellers who would try to kill me on sight.  It did not make for restful sleep, but drow do not sleep anyway.  <br>\r\n     The standard plan was to start in the wilder sections of the kingdom and gradually work our way to the vital center.  This did allow easy retreat if the target proved too tough, as it often did.  But of course, it also allowed the defenders to get ready and thus required that retreat.  This time, our plan was to be the reverse.  We were to start our attack with the vital center, the royal castle.  Once it was taken, our looting of the kingdom could proceed unhampered.<br>\r\n      Of course, that meant that if we failed, we would be almost trapped, and our retreat would be a disaster.  However, our commander was rumored to be in serious disfavor with the Great Matron, and had no chance of survival if he did not return with victory, and so was willing to risk disaster if it promised great success.  [That the one who spread this rumor was executed for spreading lies meant it was widely believed.]<br>\r\n     Sadly for me, this strategy required brave and daring scouts to go where nobody could hope to survive and find deeply hidden secrets.  Which means they sent me, their least brave or daring.  [Of course, being told that one's throat would be cut if one failed does wonders in producing courage.]  <br>\r\n    I wasn't told just what our exact strategy was, or rather I was told a great many strategies, many of which quite contradicted each other.  In any case, I was to gather evidence to make all of them possible.  I was told that this way I could not reveal the true plan if I was captured.  I assumed it was because our leaders had no idea what plan to choose and were hoping I would find a way that could work, and that if I did not, well, I would make an easy fallguy...  <br>\r\n     They at least didn't give me a deadline.  Since we live for a very long time [except when we are being murdered] we can be very patient.  So I could afford to take my time and get things right [if I wanted to risk being executed for failing to produce...]  And the first step was to start working my way into a city where every hand was against me.<br>\r\n    The obvious idea was being a merchant.  Trade with the drow was highly illegal, and thus highly profitable.  And thus there were people eager to engage in it.  Of course these people were also the types eager to sell your life for a copper, but with care...<br>\r\n    Of course, there were other ways to get a \"face\".  A really good disguise maybe and then...    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>    The start of my scouting was rather dull, if you ignore that any bad luck or stupidity could have gotten me painfully killed at any time.  But all I did was to disguise myself and then seek out one of the seedier bars and nurse some drinks.  Quite possibly the owner knew I was up to no good, but I was quiet and paid with good coin.  He had not survived by worrying about much else.  So I was not bothered as long as I gave no sign of causing trouble.  [Of course, he likely would have assumed, correctly, I was going to cause trouble if he had known I was a drow, but there are a variety of races on the surface, and if my disguise was not perfect, it certainly was good enough to confuse him, which meant my coin won out.] And I caused none as I sought out future customers.   <br>\r\n    The underdark produces a wide variety of drugs, which have a wide variety of uses.  Not really that much difference from the surface actually, but for good and bad reasons, many of them are illegal on the surface, and thus of great value to the right people.  <br>\r\n    The poisons of course were popular.  Not that there are not many on the surface too, but the drow poisons are not widely known and so the dead body may be investigated in the right way and the death becomes a natural cause.<br>\r\n    And of course new recreational drugs are always popular, whether they are safe or not.  Either way, being drow, they were outlawed.<br>\r\n    Also popular was the Cure, a drug that cured any disease, temporarily.  You would need a renewed dose to continue to be cured, and of course the drug was expensive and rare. <br>\r\n    Love potions are always popular, and we drow have quite a few.  Who has a better chance to kill you than a lover?  And so potions to make sure that love included a desire that one's \"love\" stays alive are common, as are a variety of fakes and ways to get around such potions.<br>\r\n    In any case, I had a wide variety of profitable merchandise.  I needed merely to identify those customers who would not try to kill me.  This was just a matter of time and caution.  <br>\r\n    Talk of the sickness of a small merchant  provided my opening.  A little checking confirmed that he did not have the coin to get the curing he needed, and that he was becoming desperate.  And so he woke one morning to find a potion by his bed, and a note saying \"From a friend who would have you live.\"  <br>\r\n    I am unaware of how quickly he drank it.  But within a week, he was out of his sick bed, and back to work.  I continued to stay quietly at the bar.  I might well need a backup for one thing, and my plan had assumed this was going to be a slow process.  So I had plenty of time to make my preparations.  Only when the potion had begun to wear off did I need to act again.    <br>\r\n    I still had to wait until he was aware the cure had been only temporary.  It would not do to have him still denying that.  But eventually, he had to be well aware of his doom.  So again, I used my magic to produce another potion besides his bed, along with a note to come to a certain quiet location if he wanted more.  <br>\r\n    I had no trouble finding out he had taken the potion.  His return to health showed that.  But what had he decided?  I did not want to expose myself by looking too closely, but I did risk a look that showed him to be nervous and distracted, which left me unsure too.<br>\r\n   But what I had to do was make sure that I would be able to talk with him without his being aware of who, what, or where I was.  This was not all that hard, but I had to be ready.  It was still possible for him to slip the hook if I was careless.</span></div></div>",

This city had enough elves stalking the streets, so I wasn't worried that he would get suspicious.  Besides, disguising myself as a human took much more energy than an elven form.  For pre cautionary measures, I threw a cloak on and stuck to the shadows (The man probably figured out that the source of his cures would be less than legal).  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had it planned out perfectly, I would simply demand a price for the cure (to appear as a simple rogue), hopefully receiving information as an added bonus.  I would be sure to also add that I'm the only source of the cure and killing me will cut off his supply...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, the man came, he appeared healthy but nervous, glancing around as if he were being pursued.  The man held his torch closely, stinging my eyes with it's lumenence.  Did I mention Drow are sensitive to light?  No?  By living in our subterranean cities, we're naturally accustomed to darkness, causing us to have sensitivity to light.  As such, we have a natural fear of sunlight (one of the few things we can agree on).  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, since the man had come, I mad it my business to make my presence known. <br>\r\n\"I'm happy to see you have come.\"  I muttered.  \"I presume you have come for more medicine?\"<br>\r\n\"Ye-e-es\"  he stammered.  \"I have come for more.\"<br>\r\nThe mans previously nervous expression turned to a twisted grin, \"So hand it over, elf!\"<br>\r\nI could then hear arrows being knocked into bows, daggers being unsheathed, and men stepping forward.<br>\r\nDamn, a trap...

There wasn't much pain (after all, my race as a whole loves dishing out pain), but it did cause me to flinch, letting a man armed with a club a swipe at me.  His attack struck home, smacking me square in the stomach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTragically for me, this caused me to lose concentration on my disguise.  All my attackers froze in shock as my hair bleached white, my skin darkened to black, and my eyes turned red.  Fortunately for me, this was enough of a distraction to allow me to limp a few feet from my attackers and bring to mind some arcane fire.  My revealed identity also seemed to demoralize the menagerie before me, as they nervously glanced at each other (there are many a tale told about our kind, most to frighten children into behaving of course).  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A dark elf!  Kill the bastard!!\"  My former dealer ordered, causing all of his underlings to swallow their fears and get back into a fighting stance.  muttering an incantation, I pointed my finger at the leader, and a five darts leapt from it, sticking him in the neck.  He gurgled for moment before slumping to the floor, presumebly dead.<br>\r\n\"He got Garrath,  kill the darkling!\"  another man yelled.  I responded immediately, launching a bolt of fire in his direction, hearing a yelp of pain as he burst into flames.  This seemed to have some effect on my attackers, as three of them turned and fled.  I was about to attack them (it would be unfortunate if some escape to spread the word of dark elves in the city and bring reinforcements), but one of their buddies leapt on me with a growl, and cut my left arm with his axe.  I responded by redirecting the spell toward him, sending a burst of fire, which fried the man to a crisp.  one of the two who had stayed behind threw his dagger at me before running.  I deftly dodged and was about to annhiliate him as well, but the last one who stayed behind took this opportunity to take a swing at my stomach with his shortsword, tearing my cloak and causing a gash across my stomach.  Before he could attack again, however, I zapped him with a minor electrical shock, plucked his shortsword from his hand, and slit his throat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>What?  Oh very well.  No, I did not get so lucky as to find shelter that quickly or easily.  Nor did I look for it.  I had already arranged 3 bolt holes in case things went wrong.  So I started out to the closest one in a bad mood, but not really concerned.  Lie low awhile and then try again.  It was merely a hitch in my plans, not an end to them.  Or so I assumed until I found a swarm of guards around my first hide-out.  Paranoia may be a survival trait among drow, but I [correctly as it turned out] assumed this was just an accident, that nobody actually knew I had a hide-out there, that they were after some other poor soul.<br>\r\n    But that still made it much too dangerous to seek shelter there.  I could be caught reaching it, or in it.  No, I had to move on to another bolt hole, where the same scene played out.  That of course alarmed me.  Did the city have an idea that a drow army was going to attack them?  And that spies were among them?  Had I been spotted and followed?  It certainly seemed possible. And when I fled to my last shelter and found more guards, I was sure of it.  <br>\r\n    Not that it mattered just then.  For I was even more sure that all my sneaking around had been bad for my wounds.  So I had to find shelter, and quickly.  But it had to be good shelter too.  And I had to dodge all these roving bands of guards that seemed to be getting more and more common as time passed.  So I was in quite a state by the time I stumbled onto this one empty house.  I don't like admitting it, but I was about ready to just dive into the next dark hole and hope that nobody found me.  However, luck was with me.  A gate I leaned against swung open and so I staggered in, pausing to lock the gate behind me of course.  <br>\r\n     There I found myself on the grounds of a rather minor manor.  Clearly the city dwelling for some lordling who normally stayed on his estate in another part of the kingdom, but who came into town something concerning him came up at court.  Perfect for me.  If the lordling was out of town now, he might not return for months and in the meantime, the guards would hesitate to invade his manor.  I would have plenty of time to recover and leave ... if the house was vacant now as it seemed to be...  I advanced cautiously to be sure of that.<br>\r\n    The discovery of the open door was good and bad news.  The lordling would have never allowed an open door, or open gate for that matter, at night in this dangerous city.  Clearly he and his servants were elsewhere and not to be expected back soon.  But just as clearly somebody else had taken up residence, somebody who would not like drow [who does?]  Whoever he was, he would have to be taken care of quickly, before I collapsed from blood loss.  I closed and locked the door and advanced cautiously.<br>\r\n    My 'companion' proved to be a fool, but not a complete one.  He had lit a fire, which made his location glaringly obvious to me, but he had had the sense to start it deep in the house, where the flames or smoke would not be visible to those walking by.  At least not obviously visible.  He was still a fool for risking a fire at all.  Oh maybe I am prejudiced by being a drow, and able to see clearly in the darkest dark.  But he did not need to see in the dark.  He needed to avoid being seen and allowing even a tiny chance of being seen was folly and was about to be his doom.  <br>\r\n    He was sleeping in a bedroom, apparently one reserved for a servant senior enough, or relative low enough, to get a room to himself, but not rating a window.  And he had foolishly not bothered to trap the door.  Of course, I would have likely have discovered and disabled it, but one stays alive by bending every chance in one's favor.<br>\r\n     In any case, I was eventually making my way carefully to his bed where he was peacefully sleeping.  I need not have bothered, but I was not going to risk his having put pillows in the bed and himself in some corner.  And soon enough I was poised over him with blade ready to kill.<br>\r\n    That is when she woke up.<br>\r\n    Had she been male, he would have died instantly.  Not that I really liked killing him, but every hand was against me and if he lived, I would die.  It would have been that simple.  Had I been entirely sensible, her death would have been just as necessary.  But drow are ruled by our women and for a mere male to strike one... you do not want to know the punishment for that...  This woman might be a mere human, but at that moment I could not kill her.  <br>\r\n    I could not let her scream either.  Possibly nobody would hear, or at least would pay attention, but I dared not take that risk.  So my knife was reversed and hitting with the blunt end before she could even open her mouth.  She was out before she even realized what was wrong.<br>\r\n    But now, what was I to do with her?  I could not kill her.  But I could not let her live and expose me either.  And my wounds were getting worse by the second.  I doubted I could stay conscious for much longer no matter what I did.  Soon I was going to be at her mercy.  What was I to do?   <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I could have tied her up and then dealt with my wounds in less time than it had taken me to prepare the potion.  And my wounds were demanding immediate attention.  Already they were bothering my mind, making me make mistakes, and it was getting worse.  I started debating stopping and tying her up.  It took me all too long to realize that switch plans was a bad idea, and that debating a switch was worse.  I had to focus and act.  But it was getting hard to focus.  <br>\r\n    But I managed it.  I crept on top of the bed and on top of her, and started to pour the potion into her mouth.  She chocked and spit much of it out, but she swallowed!  There, she was mine!  I would make her drink the rest of it just to be on the safe side, but I was already sure she would love me and do everything to make me happy.<br>\r\n    That is when she slapped me.  And as I was recovering from the shock, she slugged me or at least tried to.  The room was after all pitch black and she was now a drow and could not see in it... So her blows were mostly missing, and were just glancing blows when she did hit.  But why was a woman so in love with me attacking at all?  That potion should have made her love absolutely the first man she saw ...  The first she SAW?  [We drow do tend to forget how blind you surface folk can be.]  Yes, that would be it.  The fire was outside this room and there was no light to see by, and thus no way for the potion to work.  Another mistake I would not have made if I had a clear mind.<br>\r\n    Well, this was easily corrected.  I just had to open the door wide open and she could see me, and thus love me.  So get out of the bed, a task made easier and harder by her kicking me out of bed and flat onto the floor [and on the side away from the door of course].  A sensible lass [when I would have much preferred a scatterbrained fool], she grabbed a club and started swinging it in my general direction.  At least her blindness made that less dangerous than it could have been, but I still had to get to that door, and let in the light I normally wanted to avoid. Getting around her and avoiding her hitting me by accident was not going to be easy, and of course I had to be silent or it would not be by accident.  And I was feeling even more woozy.  I could not wait much longer or I would be down due to blood loss.  <br>\r\n    A quick toss of my dagger made a noise to her left and of course she started swinging in that direction.  So I now had room to get by her to her right.  Now I was only a step or two from the door and could quickly open it and light up the ...  <br>\r\n       The room was dark, not quite perfect darkness, but the fire I had seen earlier was practically out.  Now I suddenly remembered.  Not wanting the sleeper to notice a sudden light, I had put it out, not quite totally, but enough that the open door would not be a square of light.  I had blundered again.  There was not enough light to set off the potion and my idea had been folly from the start.  Now wh...<br>\r\n       That is when everything went black, even by drow standards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       I woke to entirely too much light, and to the most beautiful face I had ever seen.  The fact this face was that of a blond human raised alarm bells of course, but I was worried about how I could protect her, not of this insane attraction for what had to be a deadly enemy.  <br>\r\n      \"Lie still.\" a wonderful voice commanded, \"You are badly hurt.\"<br>\r\n      I had no intention of disobeying this center of my life, and I could not even if I wanted to.  My attempt to sweep her into my arms ended with one arm barely halfway there, Whether she then forced it back to my side or gently lowered it, preventing it from falling, it failed of its objective.<br>\r\n     Or maybe not.  SHE, the joy of life, moved closer.<br>\r\n     \"You need to sleep\" she insisted, \"Or at least rest.  Now I will answer some of the questions you are likely wondering about, but there will be plenty of time later for your story and mind.  Relax as much as you can.\"  Just how I was to do that when she was sliding her body forward until it was right next to mine at first was a major question. My first response was to try to roll over on top of her.  \"No.\" she commanded, sounding almost as sorry as I felt, \"That will have to wait.  You would hurt yourself.\"  Dying in her arms seemed tremendously desirable, but if she insisted...  I did not resist her pushing me back onto my back.  I had not gotten far off the floor anyway ... the stone hard cold floor...  Instantly I was panicked that that mean this darling [who was nude, a fact I had ignored until now, until she was in danger of catching cold,] was also being exposed to that floor too, and that must not happen.<br>\r\n      <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She was so busy covering me with that useless blanket that she did not bother to shrug off the vital cloth I barely managed to drape over her.<br>\r\n      But finally we were wrapped in cloth, and if there was too little keeping her warm, at least she would not freeze now, and the warmth of our bodies clinging together seemed likely to ease any discomfort she might feel.<br>\r\n      Not that she seemed to care.  \"My name is Sabine.  You are ...\"  <br>\r\n      Sabine... I had heard that name before.  But now I was realizing how perfect a name it was and how it fitted her so well.  Where I had heard it before didn't seem worth recalling.  \"... Enelias...\"  She seemed to approve that name more than I did.<br>\r\n      \"I am sorry about hitting you on the head.\"  Sabine seemed quite contrite over such a trivial matter.  \"But I thought you were some sort of rapist.  So when I saw your form at the doorway, I swung as hard as I could.  It was only when I got close enough for another swing that there was enough light to see it was You!  I was quite horrified over what I had done, and even more horrified to find you were bleeding badly.  <br>\r\n      \"I did what I could to stop the bleeding.  Apparently, it was enough.\"  Sabine smiled in memory of her success.  \"But in the process of getting some bandages, I almost stumbled on this potion bottle.  It did not take me long to realize you had drugged me with a love potion.  That was quite naughty of you.\" Her smile suggested my punishment would be minor.  I tried to explain there had been no choice, but she was not listening, and I was not really up to talking.  \"Now my nurse had warned me of all the terrible things a man might do to a helpless lass, most of which I am now looking forward to by the way, But I didn't understand then why she said that the worst thing he would do was to stop doing the others.  Now I understand.  I would be destroyed if you were to ever leave me.  Nothing else you could do to me would hurt nearly as bad.  <br>\r\n     \"Faced with this dire threat to my future, I realized the potion bottle was still half full.  I do not brag when I say I am clever.  So it took me little time to realize you could be my slave just as I am yours.  You would never leave me willingly.\"  [I tried to remember which version of the love potion I had made and could not be sure.  I could be facing a daily task of brewing more potions, or this potion might last years.]  \"I do apologize for being so selfish, tho I already know you will forgive me no matter how terrible my crime.\"  [Quite true I realized.  In fact, I refused to admit there was a crime.]  \"I suppose I could say you deserved it since you did the same to me, tho I very much think you do deserve me.  But it was mostly self-defense.  I could not bear the idea you might leave me.  <br>\r\n      \"Now you rest and recover.  I'll be here for you.\"  With that, and a smile, she went to sleep in my arms.  [She had more snuggled into them than I had managed to enfold her.]  Her smile on her sleeping face did not tell me what she was dreaming, but assured me they were happy one.  My own thoughts were at least equally pleased, considering I was still badly wounded in a city of my enemies who longed for my death.  [Of course, as I have mentioned, that is pretty much par for the course anywhere for a drow, but I was still altogether too happy to be happy about that.]  But my first priority had to be to recover, and that meant rest.  So that I started doing.<br>\r\n      Tho it would have been a little easier if I could have remembered where I had heard her name before ...    <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They can run quickly on their twelve short, powerful legs, or slither by folding their legs close to their body. A behir can breathe a line of powerful electricity or swallow opponents whole. The behir is covered in hard scales and has a keel of spines running down its neck, as well as two on its head. These spines are used for grooming purposes and not combat. Behirs commonly inhabit warm, hilly regions and are often neutral in alignment. Behirs are usually solitary, though they sometimes gather in mated pairs. Behirs will not coexist with dragons, and will take great pains to drive a dragon out of their territory, moving only as a last resort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicture (copy and paste into address bar):<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.iwozhere.com/SRD/images/MM35_PG25.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.iwozhere.com/SRD/images/MM35_...</a> </span></div></div>",

The child becomes half amarok and half dragon which is also known as a wolf-dragon. A wolf dragon is a very strange looking creature. It's a four legged beast and half of his midsection on down its back half is completely wolf with wolf legs, fur, and wolf tail. The wolf-dragon's front half is that of a dragon with dragon front legs complete with dragon front paws that resemble human hands, dragon scales, and a long dragon neck. The wolf-dragon's back is covered completele in wolf fur with dragon spikes down it's spine. The wolf-dragon's head combines the features of a wolf as well as a dragon and the eyes are normally yellow like wolf eyes, but have slitted pupils like a dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wolf-dragon had been raised by his dragon father and his amarok mother for the first seven years of his life. His name is Bleddyn. His parents were compassionate to humans and taught their son that humans weren't food, but people. Though they were kind to humans, it didn't stop monster hunters from finding them and killing Bleddyn's parents. Bleddyn had to fend for himself and though humans had killed his parents, he understood that there were good humans and evil humans out there. So, he only killed monster humans, when running away isn't an option. The other humans he encountered, he tried his best to befriend them and he even helps them if they are in trouble, but Bleddyn didn't harm a human unless they tried to harm him first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you want to read his story and learn more?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bleddyn walked through the forest. He watched as animals scurried and flew away from him with they caught sight of him. Bleddyn only chuckled, \"They should know by now that I don't need to eat them unless I need meat nourishment. And even when I do have to eat an animal, it's one of those over populated deer and its usually the weaker and older one that would normally be killed off by other predators.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleddyn walked over to the nearest tree with fruits. When Bleddyn was there, he placed his dragon forepaws on the tree and forced himself on his wolf hind legs. Obviously, Bleddyn wasn't a human. Bleddyn was a wolf-dragon. A creature that combined the likenesses of a dragon and a wolf would sound strange, but it happens when a dragon and an amarok, a giant wolf, mated. The only reason such creatures could mate was that dragons could mate with anything since they were a combination of many species, though they might look like they were only reptile physically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleddyn was a strange and unnatural looking creature. His back half was that of a giant wolf with wolf legs and paws and wolf fur covering him from half of the midsection down the back end of his body. Bleddyn didn't have a wolf tail though. Instead, he had a traditional dragon tail. His front half was that of a dragon with dragon front legs, dragon forepaws that resembled hands, and dragon scales. The only part of that half that had fur was Bleddyn's back. Bleddyn's entire back was covered in fur. Bleddyn also had the bat-like wings most dragons had. Bleddyn had a dragon neck and spiked ran down his spine all the way down the tail. Bleddyn's head was very unique, having the likenesses of both a wolf and a dragon. Bleddyn was a four legged creature and was about forty-five feet tall and about sixteen years of age. Bleddyn had green scales and black fur since he was a spawn of a forest dragon and a grey amarok (male grey wolves are black furred).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleddyn used the tree for support as he stood on his hind legs. Before he stretch his neck out to get the fruits, he noticed a squirrel hiding in hole in the tree. The squirrel was scared and shaking. Bleddyn didn't mind being a wolf-dragon, he was proud of his heritage. However, he didn't like the fact that everything was scared of him. He was a gentle beast and wouldn't harm a living creature unless he had no other option. It's because of the fear most creatures had of him that he had no friends or anyone who cared. Bleddyn sighed and reached up to eat some fruits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleddyn's parents were a forest dragon and an amarok. His father, the forest dragon, could replenish his energy by lying in the sun. Because of this, his father rarely ever had to eat and when he ate, he usually ate fruits. Bleddyn's father, like most forest dragons, viewed life as a precious thing that shouldn't be taken away from other creatures. His amarok mother was the same way as his father, but she still had to eat to stay alive. She still had to eat meat at times, but she was able to eat other foods as well because she was an omnivore. Bleddyn had some of his fathers photosynthesis abilities, but still had to eat as well. He shared his parents beliefs and they raised him to never harm a sentient being unless he had no other choice. So, Bleddyn has never harmed a human, because he had never yet been in a situation were he couldn't run from those who tried to hurt him or kill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Bleddyn had his fill he walked back to his cave since it was getting dark. Bleddyn entered the cave and walked deep inside. When he got to his sleeping quarters, Bleddyn lied down on his makeshift bed and tried to fall asleep. Bleddyn wished his parents were still alive so that he wouldn't be as lonely as his was. His parents were killed by human monster slayers, and being the pacifist his parents were, they barely fought back and tried to reason with the slayers. Unfortunately for Bleddyn, there were on other creatures like him in the forest and he was the only \"mythical\" creature living in the forest. The only other sentient beings he could befriend were humans. Bleddyn tried to befriend humans every time he saw them, ever since his parents died six years ago. However, all humans were afraid of him and they ran away before he could explain to them he wouldn't hurt them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I just better get used to being lonely,\" Bleddyn sighed, feeling he should give up hope of finding a person that wouldn't be afraid of him. Bleddyn closed his eyes and fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Bruce. It's just a little further,\" Ian called back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if we should be doing this,\" Bruce replied worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This forest is harmless. There aren't any bears or wolves in this parts,\" Ian asured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be fine, Bruce,\" Jake added, \"We'll all stick together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce, Ian, and Jake were three seventeen year old humans that were walking through the forest that night. All three of them were good friends. Hell, Bruce and Jake had known each other since daycare. They knew about a cave system in the in the forest near the small town they lived in and they wanted to explore a little more of the system that night. This was the first time they were taking Bruce along with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reached the cave system known as the Indian Caves and stared at the pitch black entrance before them. The darkness was thick and the flashlights they all turned on only shot through some of that darkness. \"We're really going to explore the caves tonight?\" Bruce questioned nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fairly boring exploring it doing the day, even when the deeper parts are as dark as the entrance is right now,\" Ian stated. He was always the more adventurous type, wanting excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows, we might find for Indian remains,\" Jake commented, \"Since this is such a small town, not many people have heard about this place and only the locals explore it. There haven't been any major explorers who have entered this place.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised you're the nervous one tonight, Bruce,\" Ian commented, \"Usually it's Jake that's trying to back us out of doing something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why I'm nervous, but there is something that feels wrong about this place,\" Bruce replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, we don't have the equipment to explore certain parts of the cave. So, we'll only go through the paths were we can walk through,\" Ian stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That actually shouldn't be a problem. Nearly all the paths are enormous,\" Jake commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the friends walked into the cave with there flashlights. Jake brought his map that he had made as they explored the cave and Ian had chalk to mark the dead ends and the paths. Bruce was at the back and he thought he had heard a noise behind him. Bruce shined his flashlight, but saw nothing. Bruce continued to walk backwards, but he and his friends didn't notice that he took a different path while he walked backwards. Bruce didn't realize this mistake till he turned around and saw his friends weren't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell actually, Bruce thought they had just hurried ahead of him. So, Bruce ran faster down the wrong path and yelled, \"Guys wait up!\" He searched for about thirty minutes till he saw what he thought was light. Bruce rushed in the direction to find himself in a large room with a few glowing rocks on the walls. It didn't brighten up the room completely, but he was able to decipher the dimensions of the room. Bruce continued shining his light in every direction frantically; not realizing what he thought was a large boulder in the center of the room was actually something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleddyn was having a good sleep, but the some light shined through his eyelids and was constantly moving around. The annoying light caused Bleddyn to growl and slowly wake up. Bleddyn stood up on all fours and the light stayed constant on his eyes at that point. Bleddyn growled, \"Where is that stupid light coming from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleddyn had to open his eyes slowly because of the light and his eyes eventually adjusted. What Bleddyn saw completely surprised him and he almost immediately snapped out of his grogginess. Standing before him was a small and scared human looking up at him with a flashlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human stood still for the longest time, keeping his flashlight on Bleddyn's face. The human was about seventeen or eighteen years old, Bleddyn's parents had taught him enough about humans including the human language among many other sentient beings out there. The humans was average for his age, and a little on the skinny side, only about 140 pounds, Bleddyn could easily pick the human up with one hand if he wanted to. Bleddyn's eyes could see well in the dark and could even see color in the dark. The human was pale white with brown medium length hair parted in the middle. The human was wearing a t-shirt and jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why hasn't the human run yet?\"  Bleddyn wondered,  \"Is he not afraid?\"  Bleddyn noticed the human was shaking and reeking with fear and light shook frantically.  \"No, he's afraid,\"  Bleddyn sighed in his mind.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Bruce moved his flashlight around, he heard a horrifying growl. He quickly pointed his flashlight in the direction of the growl and found what he thought was a large bolder began to move. Something moved upward and he followed it with the flashlight. He soon realized the movement was a large head and the outlines in the dark were the rest of its body standing on all fours. Bruce didn\u2019t get a good look at the large body in the darkness, but he did see the head of the creature clearly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a strange and monstrous head with a dragon shape to it as well as wolf-like features and black fur covering the head. It also had horns coming from the back of its head pointing to the back of it. Bruce was in awe of the creature. For one, he was always fascinated by mythical creatures. He always read and wrote stories about them. However, he never really imagined they existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he was face to face against a giant dragon-like beast which was most likely a carnivore. He had always dreamed such creatures could exit and in his stories they were always intelligent and misunderstood. However, this was the real life and Bruce knew that the chances of the creature being intelligent were slim. The creature was most likely a dumb beast that would either eat him because it was hungry or try to kill him for entering its territory. Bruce was starting to wish he had never wished for such creatures to exit. Suddenly, the eyes of the creature opened and looked directly at him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a long moment, Bruce was scared stiff, literally. He couldn't bring himself to run away. The only moment his body would allow him to do was shake and sweat with fear. His brain was very much active, though, and it was split three ways. His instinctive thoughts were telling him to turn around and bolt out of the cave, to get as far away from the large imposing creature before him that could gobble him up in a few bites. Hell, it could probably do it in one bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, his logical thoughts were telling him to stay as still as possible. Bruce was assuming the dragon-like creature was just a simple minded animal and not a sentient being like in the stories. If it was an animal like his logic was telling him, he reasoned that if he ran, the dragon creature will just give chase and easily catch him, because the cave tunnels were large enough for the creature and it had larger strides than he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, staying still and being so close to such a large beast was a frightening thing and Bruce didn't know if he would be that much safer staying still. He didn't know if the creature knew what a human was. If the creature did know what a human was and enjoyed their taste, then he had no chance in surviving the encounter because it would just eat him whether he stayed still or ran. On the other hand, if it didn't know what a human was, it would be curious. This could cause the creature to get closer to examine Bruce and eventually it could try a taste test and just eat him or the creature could just lose interest and fall back asleep. Bruce wasn't really liking his odds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis other thoughts were very quiet compared to the other two thoughts. It was wondering why the creature hadn't attacked or eaten him yet. Logic believed it could be because it was either curious or still tired, but the other thoughts went back to the stories about dragons he had read and written. There were many stories that believed dragons were sentient beings and could be reasoned with. Deep in Bruce's mind, he was hoping this dragon-like creature was sentient and could be reasoned with, which would increase his chances of surviving. However, his instinctive and realistic thoughts overpowered those hopes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleddyn wasn't feeling the greatest as he realized the human was completely frightened of him. Bleddyn had been terribly lonely and sad ever since his parents died six years ago, and all he wanted was a friend and someone who didn't see him as a monster. He knew that he wasn't a monster, but humans didn't know this fact. They didn't know what he was really like, and since humans didn't know what he was like on the inside, they judged him by his looks. Bleddyn understood that he was scary looking to a human since he was such a large and powerful creature that combined the looks of a wolf and a dragon, two things humans feared. Bleddyn just wished that humans would give him a chance to prove he wasn't a monster, but they always ran away before he could ever say anything. Bleddyn understood humans' fear of him, but that didn't mean he liked it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleddyn stared down at the human for the longest time and the human didn't run yet. Bleddyn wanted to speak to the human or at least try to prove he wasn't a monster in some way, because this was the longest a human had stayed without running. However, Bleddyn feared that if he took action, the human would run away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But I have to try,\"</i> Bleddyn thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he opened his mouth to speak, the human turned and ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce's adrenaline was rushing through his veins and once the creature's mouth opened, Bruce bolted because he thought the dragon-like creature was opening its mouth to eat him. Bruce was frightened out of his mind and didn't pay attention to where he was going, as long as it was farther away from the dragon creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleddyn didn't even have a change to use his vocal cords before the human turned and ran. Bleddyn was quickly saddened by the results and he wasn't even going to chase the human. He knew it was wrong to force humans to stay no matter how much Bleddyn wanted someone he could talk to to relieve his sadness and loneliness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleddyn soon changed his mind about chasing the human when he noticed what tunnel the human ran down. <i>\"Oh no!\"</i> Bleddyn realized, <i>\"That's the tunnel that ends with a cliff. Humans can't see well in the dark and in his frightened state of mind, he's going to run right off the cliff!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleddyn quickly ran after the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce continued to run as fast as he could down the tunnel he thought had had come from. Bruce was aiming his flashlight on the ground in front of him to make she there wasn't anything in the path that would trip him up. He could hear the creature's footfalls thumping behind him and Bruce didn't dare look back to see how far it was from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce soon saw something that caught him off guard and it confused him at first. Ahead of him, the light didn't reach the ground. Bruce tried to stop himself, but his momentum was too great. He stopped, but his feet were on the edge of the cliff and his heels were only touching ground. Bruce moved his arms and tried to lean backwards, but the momentum of his run was still in effect and he soon fell over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleddyn watched in horror as the human fell over the edge. Bleddyn ran fasted and outstretched his neck as much as he could. When he reached the edge, he had to reach down and try to catch the human with his mouth because he didn't have enough time and his neck was longer than his arms. He only hoped that he didn't harm the human in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Bleddyn is able to catch Bruce by the back of his shirt. This causes no harm to Bruce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Bleddyn catches Bruce by having Bruce's entire body in his mouth. Bleddyn doesn't cause Bruce harm, but it frightens Bruce even more!</span></div></div>",

The momentum caused his body to somersault in the air and he was upright once again as he fell. Bruce's fear and adrenaline were high causing him to have an abnormal perception in the heat of the moment, something that is quiet common. Time seemed to slow down as he noticed all the sights and sensations. Well, mostly sensations since the only things he could see was whatever his light shined on and the light didn't have a long enough and the darkness was too thick to see what was in the distance. Bruce felt as though his stomach was rising to his chest as though he was on the Power Tower, otherwise know as the big drop, one of those thrill rides that drop their passengers straight down. The only differences were that he didn't have a harness around him, he wasn't in a seat, and there wasn't a way to stop himself from hitting the bottom. This wasn't an amusement ride, it was real!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, something enclosed around Bruce with a rapid snapping motion. All he noticed from the flashlight's light was that the enclosed space around him was pinkish, before his body halted to a stop. Something hard and solid stopped Bruce from falling any farther. The only unfortunate part was that it stopped him at a place he didn't wish to stop. Now he knew how all those skaters felt when they hit the rail at the fork of their legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce groaned and leaned forward against the pinkish wall in front of him. The wall was hard, but it wasn't as hard as a rock wall or whatever he landed on below. The wall had a semi soft surface that seemed familiar. The surface was also wet and it didn't fell like water. The wet substance was almost like a gooey liquid that was sticking to him. Bruce still felt the cool temperature of the cave around his legs, but everything past that was hot and humid with a fairly foul smell in the air. Bruce tried moving his legs, but when he moved one forward far enough, he felt a sharp point, like a strangely shaped sword blocking his thigh. There also seemed to be something past the points that was encompassing his legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce pressed off against the pinkish wall, the liquid sticking to him and causing strands that connected with him and the wall. Bruce found his back against a soft, more mushy and more wet substance. Bruce shined the light down below and saw that the points were actually white razor sharp teeth, and he was straddling one of them. Bruce shined the light upwards and saw the opening for the throat and the uvula. He was in the creature's mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the tongue pressed on his back and he was forced against the roof of the mouth. Bruce tried to struggle, but its tongue was too strong. Bruce noticed there was more saliva now from the glands under the creature's tongue. <i>\"It like's my taste. There's no way out of this. I'm going to die!\"</i> Bruce thought and he felt everything around him move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleddyn successfully caught the human. He only hoped he didn't severely injure him in the process. Bleddyn pressed the human against the roof of his mouth assuring the human wouldn't fall out of his mouth or accidentally tumble to the back of his throat. The human may have been tasty, but Bleddyn would never harm a sentient being, no matter the taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleddyn felt the human struggle against his tongue. <i>\"Please settle down,\"</i> Bleddyn thought as the human struggled against his taste buds, <i>\"I'm trying to save you.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleddyn finally leveled out his head and backed far away from the cliff. Bleddyn then lowered his head and opened his muzzle, dumping the saliva covered human on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce was stricken with fear and he backed against the nearest cave wall covered in the dragon creature's spit. Bruce shined the flashlight and saw the head getting closer. Bruce...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bruce's logic and reasoning left him as soon as he found out he had been in the dragon's mouth. Fear completely controlled all his actions. Bruce feared the dragon-like creature was going to eat him and as the head grew closer, Bruce thought the dragon-like creature would surely finish what it started. Bruce was too afraid to realize that the dragon creature had let him out of its mouth. The creature had the opportune moment to just eat him and it didn't. It instead let Bruce out. So, logically, why would the creature want to eat Bruce if it had the chance before and didn't act upon it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Bruce's fear blinded him of this fact. When he looked upon the dragon-like and wolf-like face of the creature, Bruce could only think about its horrifying mouth which he was in. The only image that was in his head upon seeing the creature was its mouth: its sharp wicked teeth, its large and powerful tongue which was strong enough to overpower him, its saliva which covered the entirety of the creatures mouth, and the horrifying throat of the creature which Bruce feared he would go down in little chew up and mushy pieces. There would be no burial for him. He would just pass into the creature's stomach where his body would be used as nutrients for the creature. It just seemed so wrong. No one would know what happened to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce slid downward against the wall till he was in a sitting position with his knees aiming upward. Bruce then shut his eyes and buried his head in his knees while his has wrapped around his legs. Bruce thought that if he looked away from the monster, the images of his death would stop. However, even with him looking away from the terrible creature, the images of his death still harassed Bruce's mind. Bruce began to shiver and cry, believing the situation was hopeless. His tears mixed with the saliva that coated him as he tried to prepare himself for death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleddyn noticed the human's reaction and brought his head back a little. Bleddyn was hurt by the human's reaction. Not only was he always hurt when he saw people afraid of him, but Bleddyn was also hurt by the fact that the human was still afraid of him after everything that happened. Bleddyn thought it would be quite clear by now that he wasn't going to harm the human. He had saved the human's life and even though he had the human in his mouth, he let the human go. <i>\"You'd think the human would understand that I'm not trying to eat him after letting him out of my mouth,\"</i> Bleddyn thought, <i>\"But it seems as though no matter what I do, humans will always fear me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every passing human encounter, Bleddyn was loosing more and more hope in finding someone who would end his loneliness, Bleddyn saw that this encounter was going nowhere and he wanted to just give up and leave the human be. Bleddyn just wanted to go back to his bed and cry himself back to sleep, but there was a stronger need within him and that need was the need to help the human and make sure the human was alright and could get out of the cave safely. Bleddyn knew that helping the human wasn't likely to change the human's mind about Bleddyn, but Bleddyn just couldn't leave the human only for it to possibly die. Bleddyn had the need to help all sentient beings, no matter the discomfort or how much depression would follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleddyn watched the human shiver in pure fear. Bleddyn looked away from the human for a moment to try and calm himself. When Bleddyn thought that he had enough composer, Bleddyn asked in a voice that was trying to hide his sadness, \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce, who had been scared out of his mind and still scared, looked up in confusion upon hearing a voice ask such a question. Fear still clouded Bruce's mind causing much confusion. \"D-did you... just...?\" Bruce began to question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleddyn sighed and tried to keep himself calm, but his eyes still retained the sadness he always felt when people saw him as a monster. \"Yes, I can speak. My parents taught me how to speak human tongue,\" Bleddyn replied, \"Now please tell me, Are you hurt? Are you injured in any way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce was in shock upon hearing and seeing the dragon-like creature speak. His mind, still rattled by the fear, was having troubles trusting the giant creature even though it spoke and was sentient. The logic and reasoning didn't kick into Bruce's mind just yet and he didn't realize the dragon-like creature was intelligent and didn't mean to harm him. The fear was blocking the two facts, the fact that the dragon could have eaten him, but didn't and the fact that it was sentient, from connecting and formulating the possibility that the dragon had saved him and not tried to eat him. Bruce, however, did examine himself and found no injuries. Therefore, he answered the dragon creature's question by shaking his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I didn't accidentally harm you when I caught you?\" Bleddyn asked, slightly relieved to know he didn't cause harm to the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm not hurt,\" Bruce replied quietly, not know what he should do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleddyn took a step forward and Bruce tried to back up more against the wall, but found he couldn't. Bleddyn stepped back again upon seeing this and asked in a quivering voice that was fighting to keep its composer, \"You think I'm a monster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, please don't hurt me,\" Bruce begged, \"Don't eat me, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I would eat you?\" Bleddyn asked, both saddened and appalled at the very thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had me in your mouth,\" Bruce accused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only so I could catch you and save you from falling,\" Bleddyn informed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the saliva glands,\" Bruce began to argue as he whipped some of the saliva on his jacket off, \"You liked my taste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That may be so, but I would never eat another sentient being, no matter the taste of that individual. It would be murder,\" Bleddyn tried to explain to the human. But then Bleddyn stopped himself and sighed, \"But, I shouldn't waste my time trying to explain to you that I'm not here to harm you. No matter what I say, you'll still fear me and believe I'm a monster. So, I won't try to argue with you.\" Bleddyn closed his eyes, took a deep breath and then looked back at the human saying, \"You seem to be lost. These caves are my home. I know the way out and I can help you find the exit. Follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I know you're not just leading me into a trap?\" Bruce questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I wanted to eat you, wouldn't I have done it already?\" Bleddyn questioned back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could be full now and leading me to a storage room where you'd save me for latter,\" Bruce argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleddyn sighed and apologized, \"I'm sorry, but this is for your own good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleddyn moved his muzzle above the human and bit down on the back of his jacket. The human protested by screaming, kicking, and beating at the muzzle, but Bleddyn just lifted the human up with his mouth and began walking to the cave system exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Bleddyn makes it halfway out the system when two more human voices are heard. Since the humans are coming their way, Bleddyn just leaves Bruce there and his friends find him and they escape the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Bleddyn brings Bruce out of the cave system where he finds two more humans getting ready to go back in the caves to find Bruce. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bleddyn walked slowly through the cave systems to get to the exit. Bleddyn walked carefully so that he didn't shake the human too much from his walking as he dangled the human from his mouth by clamping down on the back of the human's jacket. Though, Bruce was shaking his body without the dragon's help as he kicked and whipped his arms around to hit the creature's muzzle in order to try and make it let go. Now, dropping about forty feet to the ground might not be the smartest of things, but Bruce didn't care. He just wanted to get away from the creature's mouth that he feared so much as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce continued to pound on the creature's muzzle, though his pounding seemed to be in vain. The creature didn't even flinch from Bruce's blows. This made sense since Bleddyn was a large forty-five foot tall creature that was born from a dragon and amarok. The tiny fists of a human just couldn't harm such a creature, unless the human should hit a softer area. One of Bruce's hands collided with one of Bleddyn's teeth behind Bleddyn's lips one two many times and Bruce had to retract that hand. Bruce brought that hand to his chest and rubbed his hand a bit with his other hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt became clear to Bruce that pounding the creature was hurting him more than it. He wasn't going to force the creature to let him go and he couldn't brake free. He was at the creature's mercy. His entire life depended on the creature's decision and there was nothing Bruce could do about it. Bruce started loosing hope and began thinking that this would be the end for him. <i>\"No, I can not give up. I will not let this creature decide my fate. I will not be it's meal,\"</i> Bruce told himself in his mind and he grabbed the zipper on his jacket and pulled it down. Once the jacket was unzipped, Bruce lifted his arms and slid out of the jacket to fall onto the ground forty feet below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleddyn heard the zipper and darted his eyes downward to see the human falling. Bleddyn quickly lifted one of his dragon paws with the palm facing upward and caught the human. Once the human fell into his hand. Bleddyn wrapped his fingers around the human's body. The human tried to squirm free, but Bleddyn made sure that he had a firm, but gentle grip on the boy as he lifted the human to his face. \"What are you doing?\" Bleddyn questioned both angry and hurt by the human's actions, \"You could have hurt yourself. I'm trying to help you. Why can't you understand that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not trying to help me, you're just trying to...\" Bruce began to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not trying to eat you!\" Bleddyn growled, \"I would never eat a human. I'm just trying to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Bruce and Bleddyn could hear voices in the distance. Believing it must be Jake and Ian, Bruce frantically yelled, \"Jake! Ian! I'm down here! Please, help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Those must be the human's friends. I can leave him here,\"</i> Bleddyn thought and with that, Bleddyn lowered his hand to the ground and set the human on his feet before unwrapping his fingers and letting go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce stared up at the dragon-like creature wondering what it was planning now. Bleddyn picked up Bruce's jacket with two fingered and reached it out to Bruce. Bruce stared at the jacket and then at the creature as his friends voices grew closer. Bruce then took the jacket and looked in the creature's eyes Bruce hadn't realized how sad the creature's eyes were until that very moment. There even tears in the creature's eyes. Before Bruce could get a better examination of the creature, the creature backed away into the darkness and Bruce couldn't see it any longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Bruce's friends found him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Bruce told them what happened and began to realize the creature was just helping him and not trying to hurt him. He convinces his friends to come along as he goes back to see Bleddyn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Bruce is still overwhelmed with fear and he and his friends leave the forest as quickly as possible. It's only after they are out of the forest that and at a safe distance that Bruce tells them what happens. </span></div></div>",

Not used to the light after being without it for a while, Bruce had to cover his face with his arm. Soon, Bruce heard the quickened steps of his friends as their shoes hit the rocky ground beneath him. \"Bruce! Bruce, what happened?\" Jake called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, one moment you were there and the next moment you were...\" Ian added. But he stopped talking with they came upon Bruce and saw that there was something on the all over him except his torso and arms, something slimy. (He had worn the jacket when he had been in the creature's mouth.) Bruce's friends also examined the jacket and Ian questioned, \"What the hell happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Bruce took his arm away from his face, his friends saw how freaked out Bruce really was. He was petrified and shaking with fear. \"Bruce, what happened?\" Jake asked with concern. Jake and Bruce had been friends since before kinder garden and were the best of friends. Jake had never seen Bruce like this before. Not even when they went to horror movies together in theaters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to get out of here now!\" Bruce quickly told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, what happened?\" Ian questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you once we're out of this cave and far enough away from here. We're in danger and we have to get out as quickly as possible,\" Bruce told them, \"Now please, let's get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan and Jake did not argue with Bruce. They had never seen him like this and just followed Bruce's instructions and got out of the cave as quick as possible. When they escaped the cave system, they had to walk a bit through the woods till they got to Jake's car. When they got in, Jake again asked Bruce to tell them what happened, but Bruce told them that he would once Jake started the car and they were out of the forested area. Jake complied and started driving the car out of there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the car was out of the forested area, Bruce sighed, \"Alright, I'll tell you what happened, but I don't know if you're going to believe me or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just tell us what happened,\" Ian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think I got lost because I was walking backwards at the right moment where the caves split into two paths and I went down the wrong one. When I noticed you guys were gone, I thought you had just walked faster ahead of me and I ran faster to catch up,\" Bruce explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why you got lost, but what is that stuff all over you?\" Ian questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't want to be whining, but that stuff is getting on the leather seats, whatever it is,\" Jake added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the part you won't believe,\" Bruce told them, \"I eventually found myself in a large room. I was beginning to panic and was shining the light every which way. Then, what I thought were just large rocks started moving. My light must have woken it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was it? Nothing living goes that deep in the caves,\" Ian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was some thing that was mixed with dragon and wolf and it was large, over forty feet tall,\" Bruce answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a what?\" both Ian and Jake exclaimed almost at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I shined the light on was the head and it had a dragon shape to it with horns coming from the back of its head aiming to the back, but it also had wolf ears, wolf fur, and a muzzle like a wolf. It was the strangest thing I've ever seen and it's hard to explain,\" Bruce tried to explain as best as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like some kind of creature you'd write about in your stories,\" Jake commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, something like that can't exist, can it?\" Ian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw it tonight and I was frightened beyond belief,\" Bruce admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did it do?\" Jake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ran before I could find out,\" Bruce informed them, \"I ran down a path, but it chased after me. Suddenly, the path wasn't under my feet anymore and I was falling down a hole. That's when the creature caught me in its mouth.\" Bruce closed his eyes and shivered as he tried to shake his head to forget that horrifying experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what that stuff is that's all over you? Saliva?\" Jake questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce nodded and said, \"Yes, and I thought I was dead for sure but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what?\" Ian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It... let me go,\" Bruce muttered. Bruce was thinking clearer now and was beginning to realize that the creature wasn't trying to harm him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It didn't eat you? But if it's just an animal...\" Ian started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't just an animal,\" Bruce interrupted, \"It could speak. It was trying to calm me down after it let me out of its mouth, but I was too frightened to listen to it. That creature saved my life. I thought it only saved me to eat me, but it didn't eat me. It helped me find you guys and was carrying me out of the cave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would it help you if it's a dragon though?\" Ian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a sentient being. Maybe it was just the fact that I was sentient as well that it saved me,\" Bruce suggested, \"It seemed very hurt when I accused it of just wanting to eat me.\" Bruce remembered the eyes of the creature when it left. Bruce had never seen eyes as sad as that creature's. \"Do you guys believe me?\" Bruce asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. You'd think that is something like that existed, someone would have reported it or something,\" Ian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or they might not because they'd think that person was crazy,\" Bruce suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true, but the cave plays tricks on people's mind, especially when the mind is scared. Plus, Jake said it sounds like something out of your stories. You're an imaginative guy and an imaginative mind that's panicked will see many strange things,\" Ian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the stuff on Bruce though?\" Jake questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Ian replied, \"All this is a little hard to believe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they were at Ian's house and dropped him off. Jake and Bruce were silent as they drove to Bruce's house. When they arrived, Bruce got out, but before he closed the door, Bruce asked, \"Do you believe me Jake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ian brought up good points, but you have never lied to me before. Even though this sounds like something out of your fantasy stories, I believe you because you're my best friend,\" Jake answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Bruce said before shutting the door and walking into his house. Bruce changed his saliva covered clothes into something dry and soon got to bed. All he could think about was that creature and he decided that he'd go back to the caves after breakfast and try to find it again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bruce woke up in the morning with the sunlight shining in the dark room from between the blinds on his window. Bruce got up and did his daily routine he always had to do before he went anywhere. When Bruce had had breakfast, got dressed, brushed his teeth, Bruce walked into the living room. He noticed his mom had already gone to work and his sister was still asleep. <i>\"That girl would sleep the whole day if she could,\"</i> Bruce thought, <i>\"She'll probably sleep till ten O'clock since it is Saturday today. I might be able to see the dragon creature before she wakes up. Besides, she's twelve, she could take care of herself while I'm gone for a while. She'd probably just play the Wii the whole time I'm gone. But, I should still leave a note.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce walked into the kitchen and obtained a sticky note. Bruce wrote on the note that he would be at a friend's house for a while and he stuck the note to the table top. His sister would notice it if she went into the kitchen. Besides, that's where the family left notes in the household. Bruce then got into the Santa Fe and drove out to the woods. The woods wasn't that far away from his house and he soon arrived at the spot that Jake had parked the other night. There was no one around and Bruce left the SUV to head for the caves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Why am I doing this?</i> Bruce began to question his own actions again, <i>\"It probably doesn't want to see me again after what I had said to it. I don't even know if I'll be able to find my way through the cave system again to get to his lair, if it's still there. it could have moved on thinking I would tell the police or people with weapons to hunt it down.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce continued to walk in the direction of the caves. Bruce continued, <i>\"I should at least try though. I have to thank it for saving my life and apologize for the things I've said. I've never seen such sad eyes before and I can't leave it in such a terrible state.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce made it to the clearing where the one of the cave entrances was, the entrance he went through last night. Bruce crouched down behind a large rock and examined the entrance. Bruce had been taking everything one step at a time and hadn't at all thought about what he'd do when he got to the entrance or what he'd even say to the dragon creature when he's see him. So, Bruce waited awhile to think about what to say to the dragon creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleddyn was coming back after he fetched himself some breakfast. He was in need of meat that morning and caught and killed a deer which seem to heavily populate the forest since he was the only predator that was large enough to eat deer and only ate meat when he had no choice and had to obtain protein. Bleddyn gave the dead deer his respects and thanks since it had to die in order to feed him. Bleddyn was finding life quite meaningless now that so many humans had rejected him, even the humans he had saved from death. He almost decided not to kill the deer, thinking it would be a waste of the deer's precious life energy. \"If only mom and dad were still around,\" Bleddyn wished, \"Then my life wouldn't be this lonely and worthless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleddyn sighed and slowly walked back towards his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Bruce thought he was ready to go in the cave and find the dragon creature, he heard something large approaching. Bruce stayed behind the rock peeking out a little from behind it. Some, the dragon creature came out of the wooded area and into the clearing. Bruce had only been able to see the creature's head in the dark cave, but now he was able to see the rest of the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature was a strange and unnatural looking thing. Its back half was that of a giant wolf with wolf legs and paws and wolf fur covering it from half of the midsection down the back end of its body. The creature didn't have a wolf tail though. Instead, it had a traditional dragon tail. Its front half was that of a dragon with dragon front legs, dragon forepaws that resembled hands, and dragon scales. The only part of that half that had fur was its back. The creature's entire back was covered in fur. The dragon creature also had the bat-like wings most dragons had. It had a dragon neck and spikes ran down its spine all the way down the tail. The creature was a four legged creature and was about forty-five feet tall. It had green scales and black fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce was amazed by the creature in the clearing not too far from him. It was a powerful, majestic, yet terrifying creature that he has only been able to imagine in his dreams till now. <i>\"It's a wolf-dragon,\"</i> Bruce realized. Bruce stared at the creature with an expression filled with awe, but something changed his expression. Bruce noticed how the wolf-dragon was walking. It had its head drooped down low with its dragon tail dragging across the ground. The wolf-dragon even dragged its paws against the ground as it walk. Bruce could tell that the wolf-dragon was clearly depressed, and Bruce couldn't let such a creature be so sad. <i>\"But is it smart to confront it when I'm one of the reasons for the wolf-dragon's sadness?\"</i> Bruce questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Bruce could think of any other options, Bruce got out from behind the rock and called, \"Wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleddyn slowly turned his head in the voice's directions only to find the human he had seen the other night. Bleddyn stared at the human for the longest time. <i>\"W-why is he here?\"</i> Bleddyn wondered. \"Why have you come back, human?\" Bleddyn questioned with both sadness and angry in his voice, \"Have you come to call me monster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce saw that the wolf-dragon was angry and he understood why. All the wolf-dragon do was save his life and he had called it a monster. The dragon had no intention of eating him, but Bruce was too stricken with fear to realize that. Though there was anger in the wolf-dragon's eyes, sadness still overpowered the anger. Bruce was still relatively safe around the wolf-dragon. \"No, I came back to talk to you,\" Bruce answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you possibly want to talk about with a monster? Aren't you afraid I'd eat you?\" Bleddyn growled, \"That's what all you humans think I'd do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not afraid you're going to eat me,\" Bruce replied. He was still slightly scared of the large beast, but he knew the wolf-dragon was just sad and hurt and there was a way to reason with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seemed so sure that I would last night. What could have possibly changed your mind?\" Bleddyn questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought about everything that happened, and once my mind was no longer clouded with fear. I realized the truth. You weren't trying to eat me at all. You saved my life,\" Bruce informed the wolf-dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleddyn turned his head away and growled, \"It seems saving you was a mistake. I should have known you would think I'm a monster. Everyone does.\" Tears where falling from Bleddyn's eyes now as he continued to look away from the human. \"Please, just leave. I don't want to be called a monster anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't come to call you a monster. I came to thank you for saving my life,\" Bruce stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleddyn was completely surprised by the humans words. Bleddyn turned to look at the human once again with wide eyes and an opened mouth. \"Wh-what did you say?\" Bleddyn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wouldn't have been there I would have fallen in that pit, and I would be dead right now,\" Bruce admitted, \"You saved my life and helped me when I was lost in those caves. You saved my life. Thank you for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleddyn was in shock. Never in his life had a human come back and actually thanked him for saving the human's life. Not once had he heard a human thank him. Bleddyn was very grateful for hearing that simple thank you. That simple thank you was slowly pulling him out of his depression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also have something else to say,\" Bruce added, \"I'm sorry for who I said to you. I was blinded by fear and panic. I should have realized you were just trying to help me, but I ignored it and accused you of wanting to eat me. I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more words Bleddyn had never heard a human say to him. Had he finally found a human that didn't think he was a monster? Did he finally find a human who could become a friend? \"Well, my mouth probably wasn't the most pleasant place to be,\" Bleddyn replied cheering up, \"Thank you. No human has ever thanked or apologized to me before. In fact, no human has ever come back after seeing me. They always take one look and me and think I'm a... well, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be terrible,\" Bruce replied imagining himself being alone because people thought he was a monster. Bruce knew that if he was in the wolf-dragon's \"shoes\" he would feel awful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been alone for what seems like forever,\" Bleddyn admitted, \"The only creatures I can talk to around here are humans, but they're all afraid of me. No matter what I do or say, they always fear me as a monster.\" Bleddyn looked down at the ground with tears still coming down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce approached the giant crying creature and placed his hand one of the wolf-dragon's front dragon legs. Bleddyn craned his head around to look at Bruce as Bruce said, \"I can tell you're lonely and very sad. I can't bring myself to leave you like this. I may not know you that well and you may be a very large creature that is a different species, but I can't leave someone who is this sad without helping cheer them up,\" Bruce informed the wolf-dragon, \"If you want, I could be your friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would be willing to be my friend?\" Bleddyn asked in disbelief, \"Even though I'm something you humans call monsters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, you seem like a nice dude and I can't just leave you in this state. I'd feel too guilty,\" Bruce replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleddyn moved his head till his muzzle was beside Bruce and Bruce was between the wolf-dragon's muzzle and leg. \"Thank you. Nothing would make me happier than finally having a friend,\" Bleddyn said before he nuzzled Bruce's side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce laughed a little at the wolf-dragon's reaction. It reminded him of the stories he wrote. Bruce patted the muzzle in response and asked, \"What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bleddyn,\" Bleddyn answered while still gently nuzzling the human, \"And yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bruce,\" Bruce replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to met you, Bruce,\" Bleddyn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise, Bleddyn,\" Bruce replied.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bleddyn continued to nuzzle Bruce for a while, and it made Bruce slightly uncomfortable. <i>\"He's just being affectionate and thankful,\"</i> Bruce tried to assure himself. Though he had never been through what Bleddyn had, Bruce could understand what it would be like. He had wrote stories about creatures, outcasts, like Bleddyn and when he wrote, he imagined he was the characters to imagine what they'd feel like. Bruce understood that Bleddyn must have been very lonely without people to talk to and the only people he could were humans that thought he was a monster. Bleddyn was just glad to finally have an actual friend. <i>\"I hope he doesn't become too needy and attached to me,\"</i> Bruce wished. Bleddyn had been alone so long and the wolf-dragon could easily force Bruce to stay and never leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Bleddyn stopped nuzzling and lifted his head away. Bleddyn's expression was had a bit of embarrassment on it as the head lifted away from Bruce. \"Sorry,\" Bleddyn apologized, sounding very much ashamed and embarrassed, \"I don't know what came over me. I shouldn't nuzzled too long I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand. You were just overwhelmed with happiness of finally having a friend, right?\" Bruce asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that was it, but honestly I'm a little embarrassed that I did it for so long. The only other people I've done that to were my parents and...\" Bleddyn started, but interrupted himself and said, \"Never mind, I guess I've just been alone for so long, I was overwhelmed with emotion of finally having a friend. Thank you very much for being willing to be my friend, Bruce.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't just leave you here in such a depressed state. I'd feel to guilty. Besides, when I'm I ever going to get the chance to met and befriend a wolf-dragon? Your species is supposed to be fictional and only in legends,\" Bruce informed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, our species is very much real as you can see,\" Bleddyn replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing,\" Bruce said, \"I can't believe I've actually met a wolf-dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're not afraid of me anymore?\" Bleddyn questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It helps to know you won't do anything to harm me, and well... I've always dreamed of meeting a mythical creature,\" Bruce admitted, \"I've always been fascinated by such creatures as dragons, amaroks, basilisks, wyverns, and any of the supposedly mythical creatures. So, I'll apologize now if I end up asking to many nosy questions. I'm just so intrigued to met a wolf-dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind asking questions. It helps talking to people. I'm very curious of your people as well and I might ask a lot of questions as well,\" Bleddyn informed the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, if wolf-dragons exist, then that means amaroks and dragons exist, but what about the other mythical creatures?\" Bruce questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my father told me that during the medieval days, many species existed. But after that period in time, many of those species have become extinct that the rest, other than humans and regular animals, have been dwindled down to few numbers,\" Bleddyn explained. Suddenly, Bleddyn smelled something with his wolf nose and sniffed the air to conform what he smelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Bleddyn?\" Bruce asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I smell a storm approaching,\" Bleddyn told him, \"I think we better get inside the cave, if you don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather be dry than wet,\" Bruce replied and they both walked into the cave. However, they didn't go too deep, just enough to not get wet. Bleddyn laid down on his underbelly and lied down like any four legged animal did. Bruce sat down cross legged in front of the wolf-dragon as the wolf-dragon looked down at hm with his long neck. Bruce inwordly wondered how long the storm would be, and how long he'd be with the wolf-dragon. It wasn't that he didn't want to stay and talk longer with Bleddyn. It was just that he didn't want his sister or his mother to get suspecious.  </span></div></div>",

In the drivers bench sat 2 men in black cloaks with no visible features as they rode with hast to get to where they were going. In the back was a large cage that held a young puppy just old enough to leave its mother. But this was no average pup. It was slightly larger then a fully grown Grate Dane with three heads. Each head had glowing red eyes and pointed ears. There mouths showed raver sharp teeth that looked like it could cut threw steel like butter...which they could even as pups. one head had her tongue sticking out twice the length a normal dog her size could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the wagon hit a bump a loud ARP! could be heard from the back. \"Ouch I bit my tongue!\" Cried the head on the far left.  \"That's why were keeping our tongues in.\" said the head on the far right with a snicker. \"Shut up! STUPID!\" said the head on the left. \"Make me!\" Shouted the head on the right. \"Make her stop!\" Wined the left head to the middle head that controlled the body. (The side heads only controlled themselves from the neck up) Suddenly two staff heads came down on the side heads as the man that wasn't driving used both staffs to strike down hard. \"ARP!\" \"ARP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs an hour passed the wagon was deep in the mountains when a fireball hit the dead horse pulling the wagon causing it to shatter into burning pieces. The force of the blast knocked the wagon over. The men inside jumped up and out onto the ground but the large three headed dog's cage tumbled over the edge started tumbling down the hilly mountain side. \"NOOO!\" Shouted one of the men as he ran to the edge but another fireball struck in front of him knocking him back. As he got back to his feet he looked back toward the edge and then up to were the attack had come from to see five men in red sorcerers gowns glaring down at them. Griping his black staff ready to fight he said threw gritted teeth \"We actually payed for that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** *****************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three headed puppy was stumbling about trying to clear there heads of the dizziness. Luckily for them there body was a lot stronger then a normal dogs or they could have died. Instead they just got slight bruising all over. Just as there heads were clearing a black bolt struck a bolder near by destroying it with an ear shattering explosion. All three heads screamed in fear and with that they were off. She ran throughout the night and into the late morning. When she could run no more she simply collapsed to the ground. Her and her side heads were breathing heavily as air flowed down there collective throats and into there shared lungs as her heart pounded in her chest so hard she thought it might burst from her chest and every inch of her body screamed in pain. She was tired, hungry, thirsty, lost, frightened, and in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the longest time she just laid there. For over an hour not moving, none of her heads said a word. Finally with effort, she rose to her feet and slowly walked to a near by puddle for a drink. The water was dirty but it was better then nothing. After all three heads moistened there throats they sat up and looked at there reflection. \"So...what now?\" Asked the left head. \"I'm not going back there. We'll find somewhere ells to live. she said to her side heads as she stood up and kept walking. \"I'm hungry\" Complained the right head. \"I know.\" she said. I am to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 10 minuets of walking there herd a repeating banging sound in the distance so she went to investigate. They came across a wagon but this one was different from the last one they were in. For one thing it had two horses that were alive instead of the one dead one. Another in that it looked like it was made badly and the weals were crooked and on the side there was a symbol. It was a shield with white wings and over the shield is a lions head roaring triumphantly while on the shield is a dragon,s head with swards going threw it. Standing behind the wagon was a skinny man in flimsy armor hitting the back of the wagon with a hammer. \"There that should keep it from falling off again.\" Said the man before throwing the hammer in the back with the other tools, weapons, and previsions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the man was reloading what fell out of the back of the wagon the Cerberus pup walked up behind him. \"Please may we have something to eat?\" She asked as all three heads looked up at him with the saddest puppy eyes they cold muster. \"Sorry all the food is for The order outpost I cant spare any. There is a town bout 10 miles just off the right turn up ahead. You can try your luck there.\" The man said without even looking at them. \"10 MILES!?\" Cried the right head. The man only sighed and turned around. \"Look kids I...\" The man stopped as he looked down wide eyed at the Cerberus puppy sitting before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MONSTER!\" Shouted the man as he grabbed a mace off of the ground and started swinging it at there heads. \"ARP! What did I do!?\" Cried the main head as the mace struck her right on the top of her head. The man didn't answer. He just kept swinging the mace with hatred in his eyes. \"Hay stop it!\" She yelled just before lunging forward and taking a bight out of the mace. The man looked at her wide eyed and mouth hanging as the middle head was chewing on a hunk of steel like it was soft fresh baked bread before spiting it out as a small chewed up, drool covered hunk of scrap. \"Yuck! I'm not that hungry\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man quickly dropped what was left of the weapon and picked up a battle ax. and tried swinging that. Seeing no point is continuing at the moment the pup ran off into the woods. After an hour of roaming aimlessly threw the forest they laid eyes on a large town with many people walking around buying and selling. a large open area in the middle with a few trees in it where several children are playing. Near one side of the town were taller buildings that looked like a small part of a city. And the whole thing was surrounded by a thick wall with men in armor on it and there were only two openings. \"That must be the town the bad man said we cold find food! lets go!\" Said the right head. \"But it WAS the bad man who said it. I don't think we should.\" said the left head. Before she cold think on what her heads were saying the choice was made by a painful growling from there stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding down the ledge she was on they quietly mad her way toward the wall. keeping to the cover of trees so not to be seen. When they got to the wall they quickly chewed a hole big enough for her to fit threw. Sticking to the ally ways as she searches for any kind of food she could find. Unfortunately all of the food smells seem to be coming from the crowded areas. Just as she was going to risk going out into public the smell of meat close by caught her attention and she turned around to see a can full of meat siting by a door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing over they dug in to the bountiful meat that was just sitting there in this can. When they had eaten there full they herd the door creak open. \"Doogy!\" They looked over at a very small creature. \"What is that?\" asked the right side head. gasp! \"doogy towlk!\" said the little creature as it waddled over to her. \"I think its a human puppy.\" Said the main head. the small girl came right up to them. The right head turned as far as she cold away from it. \"Well whatever it is it stinks! It smells like poo!\" Just then the child started petting her along her back and all three heads suddenly relaxed. \"But I could ignore the smell.\" Said the right head. \"She's so nice... maybe the humans in this place are nicer then the other humans we've seen.\" said the main head. \"Maybe we can live with her.\" Said the left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue to destroy that hope.  \"Lilith!, Lilith where are you?!\" Called a woman's voice from the building that the girl came from. \"Owt heer wit da big doogy!\" replied the small human pup as she continued petting. Lilith what have I told you about strange animals and leaving your at work playpen withou. . .t.\" The woman with a bloody apron stopped talking in shock as she walked outside to see her daughter petting a big, razor toothed, red eyed, three headed monster. \"LILITH!\" The woman screamed as she ran over to them and grabbed her daughter and ran back inside screaming then slammed the door closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then several other humans came rushing in to investigating the screaming. \"Over hear! Behind the butcher shop!\" called the first man bringing many more. They all had armor and weapons and they all looked very unhappy to see her. \"You were saying?\" Said the right head. Jumping up she ran as fast as she could to get away but she was surrounded. she jumped over the humans as they swung there weapons at her yet was miraculously unharmed.. As she ran about the town trying to find an exit the humans were running around either attacking, trying to hide, or just standing there frozen.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sara is the daughter of a well renown animal trainer and her father taught her everything he knew of the trade. Even the more advance courses of monster training. She had shoulder length black hair and green eyes. She wore patched together shirt and pants and was rather slender.  Now Sara has her own home not far from town where she trains and sells horses and guard dogs. As she was paying for the bundles of hay for her horses as they were being loaded in her wagon by a young farmer man she heard a lot of screaming from down the road. Turning her head Sara was just in time to see of all things a cerberus running down the road at an amazing speed as every solder it ran by as well as a few pedestrians trying to attack it as it ran by. Sara could already see that it had no collar on it and she doubted that an owner of a cerberus wold just let it run about freely. A smile came upon her face as she knew how expensive fresh monster-lings were but they brought in good money when fully trained. The cerberus had just ran down a dead end so Sara grabbed a rope from her wagon and made her move quick before someone killed her soon to be prized pooch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****************************************************************<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" all three heads said at once as they hit a dead end and several armored humans cornered her and started to move in slowly for the kill. But just then a woman in her early twenty's forced her way threw the crowd and stood between the other humans and her. \"Stop!\" Shouted the woman as she stretched out her arms to block the way. \"What are you doing Sara! Get out of the way so we can kill that thing!\" Said one of the men in armor carrying a large sward. \"No I wont let you kill it, Let me have it.\" Everyone in the crowd was looking at the woman like she was insane but before anyone could regain there wits after hearing what the woman just said a new human forced his way threw the crowd. He was a tall 6 foot man wait a neatly trimmed beard and fine armor. He had a sward at the ready and a cape of some kind and brown low shaved hair on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARE YOU INSANE!?\" shouted one of the humans as the new human man looked confused. \"Whats going on? Sara what are you doing? Asked the new human in nicer armor then the rest. \"Shes lost her mind Captain! She wants to keep it.\" The man looked back at the woman a shocked look on his face. \"I can handle it David. You know my father taught me everything I know. He even let me help with some of the monsters he trained for the Coliseum. Let me have it, trust me.\" The woman then turned to the Cerberus and slowly walked over to them crouched and her hand held out. Many of the humans behind her started shouting for her to stop but the man she was just talking to quickly shut them up without taking his eyes off. A combination of worry and fascination in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its ok. No one is going to hurt you.\" As she held her hand in front of the Cerberus the main head leaned down and sniffed at it and her side heads soon followed. A smile crept across the human woman's face as she walked over to her side and started petting her on the back as she leaned down Calming the Cerberus's nerves. \"There there that's a good...\" She stopped to look under the Cerberus's body for a quick moment before lifting her head back up. \"girl, Your a good puppy arnt ya?\" Suddenly there was a shout from the crowd. \"PUPPY!? THAT HUGE DOG IS JUST A PUP!?\" The woman looked back to the crowd. \"Yes and if you think shes huge now what till she grows up.\" She turned her gaze back to the Cerberus smiling warmly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the captain took a few steps forward sheathing his sward. \"Sara what are you going to do with that thing?\" He asked looking somewhat amused. Raise her, train her, And when shes trained well enough... She'll earn her keep. Care to hire a Cerberus captain? A bargain at only the wadge of three guards. Until she gets to a larger size then the price will go up to accommodate expenses for taking care of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting a little greedy don't you think?\" Asked the Captain. \"Hardly, think about this Captain as I give you a little preview from the monster training manual 101. The Cerberus is a loyal and obedient guard dog with human intelligence. Its skeleton is virtually unbreakable when fully grown and imposable to damage by human weapons. Its hide is extremely tough and heals rapidly. They are as many of you seen faster then any horse.\" She reached over to thy left head and carefully opened her lips to show off her teeth. \"Its teeth are so sharp and its jaws are so strong that it can chew steel like we chew melon.\" Sara let go of the head and stood up looking down at the Cerberus. \"May I climb on? it will help.\" She asked nicely. The heads all looked at each other a moment and the right one almost said something but was stopped by the main head with a soft headbutt then the main head shook its head yes.\"See. Human intelligence.\" Said Sara carefully climbed onto there back. \"And its strong so it can carry five times its body weight.\" She climbed off then sat on the grown and started petting there back again. And correct me if I'm wrong but this town has been booming in trade and the mare has been making plans to make this into a city? the crime rate will go up and in times of war it will be a prime target and remember the giant that attacked a few years back? I can have her trained to protect in a month!\" Sara proclaimed proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmm...and is it not also true that they always go for the kill with every attack?\" Asked the Captain of the guard. At that question the woman seamed to lose some confidence. \"well not always...Ok so when they feel what they want to protect is in danger a instinct kicks in but with enough training that wold only be actual threats that you wold probably try to kill anyways. She wouldn't kill say, a pick pocket or something.\" The Captain looked at the Cerberus in deep thought for a moment then turned back to Sara. \"A month you say?\" Sara just nodded her head as an answer and all three Cerberus heads nodded with her. \"...Sara...I had beater not regret this.\" Sara just smiled and took out her rope and with a knife cut it and retied it into a makeshift leash that split into three rope collars and tied one to each neck. The crowd pulled back and watched as Sara led the Cerberus out. Its tail wagging happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There it is sir!\" Shouted the member of The Order that was fixing the wagon earlier. 20 other members with him each looking big and battle hardened witch made the skinny one from before look out of place. \"Good work rookie. And impressive work people capturing that thing. Now stand back We'll handle it from hear.\" Said the largest one covered with scars as he drew his sward. \"NO! I wont let you shes mine!\" The Captain stepped forward. Sorry sir but we caught it first so what we do with it is not your concern.\" The leader of the Order solders suddenly went from calm to volcano in an instant. \"HOW DARE YOU! THAT IS AN EVIL BLOODTHIRSTY MONSTER AND YOU WANT TO KEEP IT AS A PET?! WHO KNOWS HOW MANY THAT BEAST HAS KILLED ALREADY! NOW I DEMAND YOU STEP ASIDE NOW OR ELLS!\" Several of the town guard that have been in earshot rushed to the area encase they're needed. The Captain just gave them a knowing smile. \"As I recall the last time the Order killed a monster that was someones property it was a hydra that was trained to protect a city and as a result all Order members involved were imprisoned and The order was ordered by the king to pay for damages and a replacement guardian. Now are beast trainer may be childish at times but she was taught by her father Beast Breaker Bill so I have every confidence she can keep it under control. So unless she's changed her mind about training that thing your wasting your time.\" To answer Sara knelt down and hugged the Cerberus that everyone just notes was cowering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'YOU STUPID!...\" The man didn't finish his sentence he just stormed off with the rest of his men. \"Thanks David\" Said Sara as she gave him a quick hug and led the Cerberus back to her wagon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sara was walking down the rode to her home about a mile from the town she heard a child's voice. \"Thanks miss you saved our butt back there.\" Sara stopped and looked around. Now that the sound of her wagon's wheels have stopped she calls. \"Hello? is anyone there?\" She asked as she looked around. \"Look down.\" Sara did as instructed and saw the happy faces of the Cerberus. \"Thank you so much miss, for everything.\" Said the left head. AHHHHHH! Sara screamed as she dropped the leach and jumped up onto the wagon. \"You talked! Cerberuses don't talk! how did you do that!?\" The Cerberus seamed to grow worried. \"Were sorry, We tried not to talk before because it makes humans mad. Please don't abandon us.\" The Cerberus gave her there saddest puppy eyes. Sara calmed down at this and came back down and picked the leash back up. \"Its ok I'm still going to keep you... But I think I'll keep you in the house for a while now that I know you can talk. Till you out grow it that is.\" This brought a wag to the Cerberus's tail as they marched on to home. \"You don't have any stinky ones do you?\" Asked the right head. \"What?\" Asked Sara \"She means human pups.\" Answered the middle head. \"Um no I live alone with my animals. well and you now. Do you girls have names?\" Asked Sara and all 3 heads shook no. Sara then stopped and pointed at each head from left to right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Left)-Sue <br>\r\n(Middle)-Boo<br>\r\n(Right)-Zest<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1- A Order member tried to kill Sara in her sleep and frame the Cerberus but the Cerberus protected her when its Killer protective instincts kicked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #2- 1 month later Sue, Boo, and Zest's first day on the job they stop a crime no deaths.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The door to Sara's house creaked open casting light onto a small home with some nice wooden furniture and most of the grown was covered in animal furs to act as a rug except for around the door where the stone floor was smooth. \"Wipe your foo... I mean paws clean on the rug before entering my house.\" Said Sara as she points to a welcome mat in front of her door. After cleaning her paws Boo walked into the house to explore. Turning to the door on the right she found the kitchen. A small room with with a table in the middle and one built into the wall. there was a big metal thing with a pipe going up threw the roof. There was lots of hooks with knives hanging from one wall and a door that smelt like it had lots of food on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In here girls!\" Called Sara from another room on the other side of the fur covered hall. The room Sara was in had a big rocky hole in the wall with a fire in it and a rack with metal sticks .A large chair was near the stone hole and a stool by the foot of the chair. On the other side of the stone fire hole was a large pillow. \"This is the largest pillow I have. Its where you will sleep.\" Sara said pointing at the large pillow. \"Now I need to go unpack everything from the wagon. You girls can go explore the house but don't make a mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************<br>\r\nDeep in the woods in the HQ. of the Order outpost a man in a white overcoat and matching hat was leaning back in a chair with his feet on a table as a large man covered with scars waited impatiently while looking out the window. \"Calm down Bear your gong to have a heart attack if you keep this up.\" said the man in white getting a glare from the large man. \"I CANT HELP IT THOSE FOOLS JUST PISS ME OFF\" Just then another large man came into the room covered in black stealth armor. \"I'm ready sir\" Said the newcomer. The man in white took one look at the newcomer and his weapon of choice and fell backwards in his chair. Quickly righting himself he turned to Bear pointing a finger at the new man. \"That is who your sending? A rookie... with a hammer?\" he said accusingly. \"...Its a big hammer\" The new man said with apprehensive defiance of his weapon. The man in white turned back to the new man with one finger held up. \"One, A cerberus has bones harder then diamonds. Its why there teeth are so unbreakable. Evin in the hands of a master like me or bear a blunt weapon like a hammer is useless. If you find yourself fighting that thing all that's gona do is piss it off. You need a cutting weapon. Two, this is a stealth mission and a hammer makes noise. You'll probably get the beasts attention and then with that weapon you'd be screwed. Three, the point is to make it look like the beast did it and cerberuses don't hit they bight, so who's going to believe a big dog killed someone by beating her to death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new man just stared for a moment then turned back down the hall toward the armory. A few minutes later and the man in black, leather armor returned with two short swards. \"That will work\" Said the man in white as he set his chair against the wall so not to fall over again. \"So if I do end up fighting it what do I do? Do I do what you did to that werewolf Mr. Syth and ram my blade down its throat when its charging at me?\" Said the rookie with excitement in his eyes. \"That wold be the worst thing you can do. The mouth, throat and stomach of a cerberus are to hard to cut with steel. You wold just lose a weapon. Look your a strong guy and tho a cerberus's skin is tough its hardly dragon scales. And its just a pup so just attack its body anywhere that's NOT its face. And remember don't go looking for a fight. Just get the job done and get out. Avoid the cerberus at all cost. Said Syth as he pulled his hat down over his eyes to take a nap. \"YA! That monster is mine! Now get going!\" Shouted Bear. sending the new man running out the door. Syth looked up at Bear for a moment then walked out of the room returning shortly with a large piece of coal in his hand. \"Hey Bear turn around and bend over I wana make a diamond.\"<br>\r\n*****************************************************<br>\r\nAt Sara's house around 10:00 pm. in the living room the cerberus was laying down on its bed next to the fire place with all heads sleeping soundly while Sara was studding her monster trainers book. \"Hmmm so there weakest spot is there underbelly...best teach them how to protect that spot in a fight... There favorite food is bones. Ah hear we go its called Blood eye state because blood flows from the eyes like tears when there in kill mode. Lets see how do you keep it under wraps... It says you can stop it with soft music but nothing about preventing it in the first place. I know I remember father saying hard training to make monsters with this problem skilled fighters helps suppress it since the better they are the harder it is to be a threat.\" Sara closed her book and set it back in its book case and headed for bed. Unaware of the threat that lays in wait for her. A few minuets after she left the living room the eyes of all three of the cerberus's head shot wide open with tears of blood slowly leaking from there eyes.<br>\r\n*****************************************<br>\r\nAs the hunter lay in wait hidden in Sara's closet he could feel himself getting cramped as he kept his 6 foot body crouched in the relatively small closet. Just then he heard the bedroom door open and he pushed his head even lower to watch threw the crack in the door. as Sara simply plopped into bead as if she had a hard days work. As she covered her head and settled in the man grinned as he slowly opened the door so not to make a sound and crept slowly toward her bed as he drew his blades ready to chop her up. Before he could get within range the sound of running paws and then the opening of the bedroom door drew the attention of both the hunter and Sara. Sara uncovered her head and looked at the cerberus standing at the door. \"Sue, Boo, Zest. Have a bad dream?\" Sara asked but instead of answering the cerberus jumped from the door over the bead and right at the hunter that until now Sara failed to notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTho the hunter was excited at getting his first mission now that he faced the cerberus fear started to flow threw him as he jumped back and tried to run for the door. a moment after he heard the cerberus hit the wall he heard it get to its feet and jump again. Moving quickly he kicked the grown as hard as he could to shoot to the side. He felt the fur of the cerberus brush against his cheek as he was making the sharp turn toward the door. He ran down the hall a short distance and turned to get into a defense stance to prepare for the fight but as the cerberus came into the hall and charged at him he remembered the advice Syth gave him before he left. Never attack a cerberus head on. Attack from the sides. Recalling this he quickly tried to jump to the side and against the wall. As he watched the cerberus rush by he thought he saw the open mouth of the side head pass threw his arm like a ghost. as this was happening he swung his other arm around to stab with his blade but it hit its rib cage stopping the blade dead doing almost no damage. As he pressed against the wall he quickly turned into another room hoping to find a window to take this fight into a wider area. As he ran for a window he thought. \"It passed threw me... can a cerberus do that?\" Turning his head to examine his arm he stopped dead in his tracks as he looked wide eyed. \"Oh...my...GOD! MY ARM! ITS GONE! MY ARM IS GONE! I DIDN'T EVEN FEEL IT!\" Turning around he saw the cerberus approaching. one head had a small piece of him still in it but it fell out. not spit out it fell out, as if it didn't even know it was ever in its mouth. The hunter was is so much shock he just stood there as the cerberus came in for the finishing blow and with a swift closing of the jaws cutting so clean that it didn't even make a sound it bit off his head and as his head hit the grown the last thing he saw was the woman he was sent to kill came running in holding a box. And then his head died.<br>\r\n********************************************<br>\r\nSara had just managed to find her music box when she heard the intruder screaming in panic that he had just lost his arm as she got up from the chest she kept it in and ran out the door. She found them in the kitchen just in time to see Boo bight into his neck and his head fall to the grown. Before she cold react they quickly turned around and jumped at her. She let out a scream as she was pined down and she closed her eyes waiting to die. She felt little droplets of the blood coming from there eyes hit her face but Sara felt nothing ells. Opening her eyes she saw that all three heads were looking around, ears flexing in all directions, sniffing the air while trying to shield Sara with there body. \"There not attacking me...there protecting me. Shielding me till there sure the cost is clear.\" Calming down Sara opened her music box letting the lullaby flow out. Sue Boo and Zest seemed to get dizzy for a moment as the blood stopped flowing from there eyes. All three heads shook from side to side to rid themselves of there daze then looking around confused. \"Whats going on?\" Asked boo as she walked back letting Sara up. \"The first problem were going to work on.\" Said Sara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#1- Because the man broke into her house they didn't get in trouble for his death and training starts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#2- Sara and the cerberus are exiled.</span></div></div>",

She had to report the dead man in her house and half the day she stood before a judge defending her girls. With the evidence at hand this wold normally be an open shut case of self defiance, They were just giving her a hard time since shes housing a monster. But in the end the obvious evidence and testimonies from the captain of the guard and the mayor who Sara thought was only doing this because a monster defender wold only make money come in larger amounts. (Towns and city's known to have tamed monsters get more traffic because one people want to see it, two traders feel its safer there.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara had just taken her girls from the cage they were forced to stay in till the trial was over.She knew they cold have easily escaped but she told them not to. \"Good girls. Sorry you had to stay in this cramped little cage for the trial. hears a treat. Sara then produced a cow bone she got at the butchers shop before the trial from a bag. many people watched with fascination and a little fear as the three heads chewed it up like a cracker and devoured every jagged shard. and licked a few bits of marrow that fell to the courtroom floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sara was leaving she was stopped by the mayor. He wore a fine suet made from silk and nice dress shoos. Ne had black hair that went down into a pony tail in the back his fingers decorated with gold, jewel incrusted rings. \"My my how fascinating. I'll need to pass a law that all animal bones be stored for my little money ma... i mean the city's new guardian. I want it growing up big and strong. How fast can you train it to be ready to come into town for everyone to see?\" The mayor asked rubbing his pot belly with one hand. \"As I told the captain of the guard one month. Longer if interruptions like this keep popping up.\" Sara replied \"Oh no worries I'll have some guards station at your house I want no interruptions. I'll be sending up one of the men working on the reconstruction on the town to work out a few things for it like how much room it will need to walk threw the town when fully grown and the details of your new home.\" Sara was taken back by this. \"New home? Whats wrong with the one I have now?\" Sara asked obviously not liking this one bit. \"Tisk tisk my dear for the maximum income, and protection. a place inside the city around its center is a must. It will be quite large but most of it will be to house the beast even when fully grown. And you can forget about your other beasts for a while. I'll get some men to feed them fore you while you do your job. I want all of your focus on the cerberus. Now go get to work.\" Said the mayor as he waved his hand as if shewing her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they left the town Zest spoke up. \"I don't like that fat guy\" Sara huffed. \"No one likes him but hes keeping good to his word about finding ways to boost our economy so everyone just grins and bears it. Besides hes on our side so that makes things that much easier.\" This time Sue spoke up. \" were leaving our new home already?\" She asked. \"No not yet it takes time to build a home. But in time yes we have no choice.\" Sara looked back and saw 2 young men and several guards following them. Undoubtedly the ones the mayor talked about. \"This is going to be a long month.\" Said Boo as she looked back at the men behind them. \"Looks like me and my sisters wont get many chances to talk for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreed can be an ally</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Some time has passed and the training has been going well. The cerberus grew more protective since the strange man tried to kill her and despite Sara's protests has been sleeping in her room every night since then. She fought with them at first trying to push the cerberus pup out of her room each night or trying to beet the pup to her room and shut them out but that never worked out for her. And when the pup had its first growth spurt and got 3 feet taller then a full grown stallions she gave up on it entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSplat splat splat! \"AHHHHHHHHH!\" Sara yells as she sits up in bed and wipes off her face with her hands. As she brings her hands away strings of dog saliva connected her hands and face like spiders webbing. \"How many times do I haft to tell you 3 to stop doing that!?\" Sara groaned irritably. \"But licking you awake is the only way to wake you up, You just shrug off everything ells and go back to sleep.\" Said Boo as Sue and Zest giggled at Sara. Sara groaned again as she slid her feet off the bed and with some effort got up. As always her morning rising was like the rising of the dead, the body moved but no one was home. The pup followed just barely managing to squeeze threw the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara walked outside bidding good morning to the guards by her front door. She got the bucket and drew water from the well and got some bones from a box that men from the town keep filling with the bones from there hunts and kills and filled the pans that have been used as the cerberus's food dishes then started her own breakfast. It looked like another dull day of training ahead. So far they got defending week spots, how to handle and be enclosed by small fragile things so they can work in town and with humans there not to kill, intimidation tactics, and dos and don'ts. They were now working on different fight moves, and were just about pick up were they left off when a young man came riding up on horseback. \"MISS SARA! 2 ogres are attacking! we closed of the gate there at but there getting threw!\" He called as he came as close as he can get his horse to the cerberus. \"If there blocked by the wall cant the guards chase them off with arrows? They do it all the time.\" Sara asked. \"Well yes but the mayor insists on seeing the beast in action. Also word has spread about the beast and lots of people including lords have started coming around to see it and are growing inpatient. You know were going to be the only town, soon to be city to use a cerberus as a guardian and he wants word to spread. Between you and me I thank he provoked those ogres into attacking, they seem upset.\" Sara just shook her head \"It wouldn't surprise me in the least. Common girl lets go.\" At that the cerberus laid down and allowed Sara to mount. Sara clutched the middle rope collar and kept her head low as the cerberus rose to full height. \"Ok lets head to town.\" The cerberus took of at great speed. Sara griped Boo's collar so hard she thought her hands wold start bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn horseback at full speed it takes an hour to get from Sara's house to town. On the cerberus pup at full speed it took less then half that time. \"I'm never going to get used to that.\" Sara said as they slowed when they reached the north gate.<br>\r\n*******************************************************************<br>\r\n\"Whats taking so long? when the ogres attacked you promised you'd have the cerberus deal with it.\" asked a well dressed man by the south gate. \"Oh don't worry lord Fredrick it will be here soon and you wont be disappointed.\" replied the mayor. The villagers have built a barricade around the gate like a small stadium and the wealthiest and most traveled visitors were with the mayor on top of the gate wile others looked from balconies. \"Ah there it is, Excuse me I'll be right back.\" Said the mayor as the cerberus cued be seen coming up the streets with a woman rider.<br>\r\n********************************************************************<br>\r\n\"What the hell is this?!\" Sara yelled as she came onto a makeshift coliseum made of crates and the sound of cheering from spectators up in the balconies. The cerberus lowered to the ground so Sara cold dismount as the mayor ran up to them. \"Ah excellent just in time that gate wont hold much longer the entrance is over there.\" he said pointing to a hole in the crate wall with crates to the side ready to block it off. \"What is all this?\" Sara demanded. \"Oh just a little advertizing now hurry lives are at risk.\" Sara new he was right. It the gates were breaking that flimsy crate wall wont hold long. With an apologetic look and a stroke of the fur Sara sent them in. \"I'm sorry. Remember what I taught you and be careful.\" As soon as the cerberus walked threw the opening the guards outside started blocking it off, and the mayor dragged Sara to the gate were the higher ups were waiting for the battle to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls watched nervously as the gate cracked and groaned at the force of what was on the other side. \"Open the gates!\" They herd the mayor call from above. With a mournful cry the gates screeched as they opened, as if the gates themselves were apologizing to them for whats about to happen. When the gates parted they revealed ugly ,things that kind of looked human but not human there skin was green and there faces looked more pig like with tusks coming from there mouths. And they were twice there size and smelled awful. They both wore hides to cover themselves and it looks like there made from human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ogres stared daggers at the cerberus pup, causing them to whimper in fear. One of the ogres suddenly charged forward with its club held high. To scared to move the girls just stood there till the club came down on there backs. The blow shocked the girls out of there panic and they reacted the only way they knew how, the way they were taught. (Intimidation) The girls gave it a frightful face and gave forth an otherworldly growl. Zest lunged her head forward and bit down on its weapon breaking it into splinters and spiting it out. A loud cheer erupted from the crowd as the ogre looked at what was left of its weapon, its brain working overtime trying to proses this. It looked back up at the 3 headed dog in front of it and saw it giving it looks that wold make a dragon turn tail. But unfortunately ogres aren't known for having the wits to run when in danger. Now the other ogre was running in to help his friend as the first one threw whats left of his club at the cerberus and started swinging his fists. Zest struck again sinking her teeth into its arm but quickly withdrew gagging, then she threw up. \"It taste worse then it smells\" She whispered to her sisters The first ogre was looking at its arm obviously confused again about where its hand went. The other ogre not seeing his friends hand quickly melting in the vomit on the ground, ran forward and stepped in it. A loud screech filled the town as it jumped back hopping on one foot while blood oozed from the other as the flesh melted away. Not wanting this to go on any longer the girls charged forward and barking and growling. Not wanting to taste those things again they started scratching at them with there claws Chasing them off. A loud cheer rang and the gates closed.<br>\r\n******************************************************************<br>\r\n\"Interesting, My kids cold use a new pet. They killed the last dog by mistake, I think this one can last. How much for it?\" Lord Fredrick asked the mayor \"Oh I thank we can work something out\" The mayor replied with a big smile. \"Wait you cant sell my dog!\" Sara shouted \"Relax you'll get a cut\" Said the mayor calmly before turning back to Lord Fredrick, but was interrupted by Sara before he cold say a word. \"NO! I can ignore the guards you posted at my house, I can tolerate this stunt you just pulled, there mine and you cant sell them!\" Sara ran over to the ladder and climbed down whistling when she reached the modem. The cerberus jumped the crates and rushed to her. She quickly mounted her girls and left for home.</span></div></div>",

The potion it took to make it talk takes 5 years to make so it wold be the only one. Still we made extra and its been almost a month and I grow tired of searching. Even if its not I say we take it anyways.\" The first man looked back in the direction the cerberus left in. \"Agreed.\"<br>\r\n*************************************************<br>\r\nSara was enraged when she got home. Instead of going to the house she went strait for the training supplies. Later on in the woods. \"Ok girls in this exercise we go over how to deal with a mad man brutally attacking someone. The lesion will start in a moment.\" She said as she started pounding away at a practices dummy on the ground ranting wildly about the mayor. The pups 3 heads looked at each other in Confucian. \"Did we miss something?\" asked sue getting a look from her sisters that said they were as lost as her.<br>\r\n*************************************************<br>\r\nMeanwhile back at the house the guards were standing guard when suddenly they started to turn pail. They all started falling over in pain as blood gurgled from there mouths as they tried to scream before all died. Soon after all the horses and dogs suffered the same fate. 2 men each with a staff wearing cloths of common men they killed on the way to town. \"Why did you curs the animals to death to? What if you got the cerberus by mistake?\" Asked one of the men. \"Sorry I got carries away.\" The other shrugged. \"Oh well whats done is done. Lets look around for it. If nothing ells its bones can be used to make a strong cage if its dead.\" The first man said before raising his staff and chanting a dark spell causing the dead men to stand. \"Spread out and find us the cerberus in what ever form you find it and bring it to us!\"<br>\r\n***************************************************<br>\r\nSara was squirming on the ground with a large paw on her back. \"Ok girls. Good job. After the exercise started i couldn't touch the target. And you did a great job of restraining me... You can let me up now.\" Sara felt the paw lift off of her but as she was getting up her head hit soft furry flesh. Looking up she saw that the cerberus was standing over her and looking around there legs were slightly spread out like a guard dog about to attack and all heads looking around. This had happened to her 3 times before. The first time was when that man broke in to her house to kill her. Then there was the time that man from out of town tried to force himself on her when she went to an inn in town when she didn't feel like cooking. Then the time when on the road those 5 bandits were stupid enough to attack them. Sara looked around trying to find what had her girls on edge. Looking around she saw nothing bun in the distance she heard a twig snap. A moment later another twig, then another, then the crunching of leaves. Who or whatever is coming isn't trying to sneak up on them. Soon the image of men cold be seen closing in on them but something was wrong. They all seamed to stumble as they walked and there bodies swayed with each step. As they got closer Sara was shocked to see the guards the mayor sent to her house. But they were pail with dark purple vanes showing threw the skin. Blood covered their mouths and their eyes were clouded and vacant. Sara never taught the cerberus how to deal with the undead. she never thought it wold be a problem. She crawled out from under the cerberus and pulled down on their fur to signal to let her climb on.<br>\r\n*************************************************<br>\r\nThe 2 men watched threw the eyes of the dead men from the water in the cerberus's water dish as the woman mounted the cerberus and rode off. \"Its alive. Thats lucky.\" With that the men walked around to the back of the house ready to capture the beast they sought themselves.<br>\r\n**************************************************<br>\r\nAs they cleared the woods Sara saw 2 men waiting with wizards staffs raised high and chanting some strange spell. She felt the body of the cerberus expand beneath her as all 3 heads started sucking in as much air as they can. Sara knew from the lessens she gave her girls on how to deal with magic users what they were going to do so quickly tucked her arms under Boo's rope collar to hang on and brought her hands up to cover her ears. All 3 heads started howling making a loud sound like a ghostly wail. The shutters on the house windows shuddered from the vibrations as if shacking with fear. The 2 men stopped their chanting and dropped their staffs to cover their ears as the cerberus charged at them bowling them over and stomping their staffs breaking them to pieces just as the zombie guards were charging out of the forest only to simply fall over as the spell was broken with the wizards weapons. No longer able to cast spells the to men ran for it but were not fast enough as the cerberus chased them down and pined them to the ground.<br>\r\n***********************************************<br>\r\nThe town was back to business as usual after the commotion at the front gate. After a while everyone got used to Sara bringing the cerberus when she came into town but with 2 tied up and gagged men hanging from its side head's mouths got the attention of a few people as a few guards came up to them. \"More bandits?\" one guard asked. \"No wizards. They used black magic to kill the guards and animals at my house then raised there dead bodies to attack us.\" Sara replies as she threw down the broken wizard staffs. This got shocked gasps from the surrounding citizens and angry glares from the guards as they grab the 2 men and hull them off to jail.</span></div></div>",

But so many centuries bringing destruction has made Botis weary and now he warns of foreboding danger or misfortunes of living counterpart's.<br>\r\nBotis roamed the world missing something. Botis to humans appeared as a shadow person. So even when he would come close to them they shrunk with fear as this black figure towered above them. Botis didn't want to cause harm anymore, wishing only to find that missing thing that would fill the empty shadowed darkness inside.<br>\r\nBotis entered a town not unlike your town or maybe even my town and had no other thoughts of it being different from the millions of other towns and cities he had entered in the past. Gazing from the obscured corners of buildings he walked through the dimly lit streets and lonely less traveled roads noticing only when a small creature would scurry in the opposite direction of him.<br>\r\nThen in the distance he spied a light, no not a light a glowing emanating warmth that beckoned to him from many miles away. Not taking his hollowed eyes from the beauty of the glow which he had never witnessed before this moment he crossed those miles walking in an almost daze closer and closer still to the lovely hue.<br>\r\nAlmost floating on the winds of time he was carried right to the source itself, to a farmhouse where the glow came from a window high above him as he stood in the cold night air. He didn't need to breathe but he let air break loose from the needless lungs from within, and watched as the air hung heavy in the night and seconds held it there as diamond shaped crystals stuck the moisture of his breath together then he watched as they dissipated and fell to the nothingness as silently as they had came.<br>\r\nFor a solitary moment Botis had almost forgotten the glow, but the thought rushed back to him like a raging storm with the whimper coming from the window above. Botis jumped effortlessly to the window sill and perched there peering inside. He saw an older couple hovering over a bed whispering to one another. They blocked the wondrous glow from him. That wonderful inviting brilliant hue was there just on the other side of those two humans.<br>\r\nBotis wanted to know what they said and more importantly what was making that glow that drew him here to this place. Finally the old man took the woman's hand and they knelt to say a prayer at the bedside of a small child. Botis was amazed to see the glow coming from within the small almost lifeless child. <br>\r\nWhen the two had finished saying their prayers they stopped at the door and looked back at the sleeping child and walked out into another room. Botis saw his chance he slipped in the window crack and slinked close to the bed, half fearing what the child would do when he reached him. <br>\r\nFor a second the ghost was afraid when he heard a labored breath come from the child's lips. But was reassured when nothing happened to him he didn't disappear or get dragged to the gates of Hades, he only stood staring at this small framed boy. The boy murmured something Botis couldn't understand. Botis leaned in closer to the boy and listened, he peered hard at the boy but saw no place the light could be coming from. As Botis righted himself he was met by two crystal blue eyes wide in wonderment that belonged to the boy.<br>\r\nThe old couple in the next room had been talking and had started to raise their voices not in anger but in nervousness. The old man had been saying that the boy was a gift that neither he or his wife had ever thought they would receive being as old as they are. The woman had said something about there being a time and place for everything even if they didn't know why. Botis returned his empty eyes to the boy in the bed once more.<br>\r\nThe boy shivered as he looked at Botis. There was no chill in this room that Botis could feel at any rate. So when the boy spoke Botis realized why the child had quivered so under the many hand-made quilts piled atop him.<br>\r\n\"He said you would be here when it was time\", the boy spoke with great effort.<br>\r\nBotis looked puzzled, and like a whistling wind asked. \"Who?\"<br>\r\nThe boy barely shook his little head and asked, \"Don't you know anything?\"<br>\r\nBotis was offended. He knew many things, he knew war, plague, famine, death (personally), he was present during the great deceit and war in the land, and he has known many a man and history so who was this whelp of a soul to ask such a thing to him.<br>\r\nThe boy pulled a little worn faded book from beneath his pillow and handed it toward Botis. Botis reached for it but stopped midway when he realized it was a well read children's Bible.<br>\r\n\"Why are you showing me this? It is of no importance to me, not anymore.\" Botis quietly replied almost to himself.<br>\r\n\"I know who you are because Jesus told me. I know why you are here, but I don't think you know why you are here.\" said the boy.<br>\r\nBotis blinked and started to leave but before he did he looked back and asked, \" What is the light that glows from within, why was I drawn to you this night, and what do you think I am here?\"<br>\r\nThe boy replied, \" Let me say good-bye then you will know.\" <br>\r\nWith that his parents re-entered the room and saw the boy laying awake in his bed and sat on the side of his bed. The old man held his sons hand and the old woman leaned in and kissed her son saying it was a miracle. They both hugged him gently and when he started to speak they tried to quiet him but he spoke anyway.<br>\r\nHe said, \" I love you both it was meant to be but you know I have to go there is a season for sowing and a season for reaping and it is my season. Just don't ever give up on God and we will see it other again up in heaven.\"<br>\r\nHe was about to say he loved them one more time, but as the two parents watched crying as hard as a human possibly can their little boy closed his eyes and died that cold night in his bed.<br>\r\nBotis watched and waited the glowing light had gone. He waited for a moment then thought to himself that the boy was lying to him. He turned and slipped out the crack of the window yet again.<br>\r\nIn the cold night air again he stood but was met by the glow this time in the darkness. What was it he thought.<br>\r\nThe boy spirit had met him out there in the night. He walked up to Botis and said, \" Jesus told me I had to stay behind and help you, and when I am done then I can go into the light that waits for us in the end.\"<br>\r\nWith that Botis took hold of the boys hand confused more than ever before but knowing that he had to. The boy and Botis walked out into the night together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even though Felaryan Angels are usually fallen angels and giants and anything that is a giant in Felarya could be thought of a monster to its people. And demons can't be used in this interactive since they are evil. Even through the demons of Felarya are succubi which are probably the least evil of all demons. (I've always wondered why angels can turn evil, the fallen angels, and why demons can't turn good.) Oh well, that still leaves over thirteen possible sentient races to chose from.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** *****************<br>\r\n(Clockwork)<br>\r\nWell sorry you feel that way but I'm not changing my mind on this, fallen angels are demons. and angels are not monsters, and as fare as I'm concerned there is no less or more evil when it comes to demons. Just different levels of power.<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** ******************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, let's start with the centaurs. Now, from the descriptions of centaurs on Felaryan is seems nearly impossible for Centaurs to see humans as anything else other than food. It doesn't help that they are some of the largest creatures in Felarya. So, let's try a different type of centaur that has the least amount of troubles with seeing humans as something other than food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLayla is a Zebra Centaur from Felarya. She is about eighteen years old, so still very young for Felaryans who have elf-like lifespans. Layla is close to about 100 feet tall. Despite her being 100 foot tall and the world being Felarya, Layla was a very kind and friendly person. Though most sentient creatures from Felarya are kind and friendly, they usually still eat human beings only because they're smaller than them. it seems cruel, but Felaryans don't have the same moral philosophies as humans and believe that its size that makes a difference, not intelligence. Most Felaryans believe they have the right to do what ever they want with little people because their larger than them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Layla doesn't believe this form of ethics. She believes that its unfair to judge on the size of the person in order to determine if they're a person or not. It's not their fault they are born with a smaller size range. So, Layla ran away from the other giant Felaryans and decided to life the life she wanted. She didn't harm humans and even befriended a small village that she protected from other Felaryan that wanted to eat the humans living in the village. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, on her eighteenth birthday she developed something that all zebra centaurs gained, her second personality. Her second personality comes at night and though most zebra centaurs are kind beings that are friendly to humans, the second personality is the opposite of them and devours anything it finds. Layla didn't know about her second personality and woke up one morning to find the human village she was protecting destroyed and the humans living there in her stomach<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLayla know that she was no longer safe to be around humans and she tried to become a recluse. She decided to go to a different dimension where she would be the only sentient being so that her second half wouldn't cause her to kill again. The problem is that she entered our world. Earth during modern time.</span></div></div>",

Now go!\"  To Aldrea's relief, Miranda vanishes as ordered.  Like most children, she could be all too selective about when she obeyed and this is no time for her to suddenly insist she wanted to watch the neat men.<br>\r\n    Now Aldrea must decide if she wants to vanish too.  Staying out of the sight of these men is a good idea in general.  There is always the chance they are just passing thru town and life will go on as normal if she just hides for a few minutes, hours, or days.  But there is a large chance that these knights already know of her, and a small chance that she will distract them from Miranda.<br>\r\n    However, she finds she has no choice in the matter.  The platoon is coming to her store, and almost certainly know she is here.  This is going to be nasty.  Her hand moves towards one of the many tools within reach that would serve as a weapon, but she jerks it back.  She is powerful, far more than the average human, and skilled above the average in using weapons.  But she faces several foes, who are trained fighters used to fighting foes far more deadly than her.  In a fight, she might get lucky and kill one, maybe two, but she would still end up dead.  No, a weapon will be of no use in keeping her alive, and might give them the excuse they are likely seeking to attack her.<br>\r\n     And they are looking for an excuse all right.  They march in and the leader gets as much in her face as he can from his lesser height, \"What are you doing here, monster?\", poking her in the chest as he bellows at her.  Plenty of reason to pick him up and throw him out of the shop.  Which would be enough excuse for them to draw weapons and kill her, so she must remain passive.<br>\r\n    \"I am journeywoman Aldrea, employed by master Garfer, who owns this business.  I assist him at the forge and with sales and with what other duties he may assign me.\"  Some of those other duties are as guard and bouncer, which she decides not to mention.  Too much chance they will regard this as a challenge.<br>\r\n    \"And just why would he hire such an evil creature?  Do you serve as his whore too?\"<br>\r\n    This too would earn him a slap in the face from a human lass, but again Aldrea must do nothing, as much as the remark stings.  The stereotype says that girls of mixed ancestry are all shameless sluts.  And the stereotype is true entirely too often for Aldrea's comfort.  She just can't refute the charge when it's so obviously true in some cases.  She might have been married years ago if the boys would stop looking at her as easy meat. <br>\r\n    \"My master is entirely faithful to his wife.\" Aldrea isn't entire sure of that.  In fact Garter is missing from the shop suspiciously often.  But if Aldrea doesn't know of any legitimate excuse for his absence [which she very much regrets at the moment], she knows of no evidence a woman has much to do with his absence.  She prefers to think that he has confidence in her ability to run the shop.<br>\r\n    The conversation continues along the same lines, with the officer making provocation after provocation and Aldrea refusing to rise to the bait.  The faces at the window, eager to see some violence, work to their own defeat by reminding all parties that the knights are not free to do their \"holy duty\", not in a city with its own officials jealous of their own authority.  Finally the officer acknowledges this and turns to leave with \"We shall be back to put an end to your contamination.\"<br>\r\n    \"Sir.  May I submit that I stay to prevent her escape?\" one of the lesser knights suggests.<br>\r\n    Now what is this?  Aldrea is fairly sure she won't like it, whatever the man has in mind.<br>\r\n       </span></div></div>",

His face is unreadable as he leads the others out the door.<br>\r\n   The face of the remaining knight shows he is quite pleased with the situation as he leans on his big sword.  Just why, Aldrea is unsure, other than that she won't approve.<br>\r\n    \"I am Sir Roland, Knight of the Straight Sword, and winner of the Strong Arm\" [honors Aldrea can't identify, and suspects she doesn't want to know just what he has done to earn them.]  \"May I have the great honor of your name?\"<br>\r\n    \"Since you are waiting for your master to come back with permission to kill me, I don't see why you need my name.\"<br>\r\n    Sir Roland's grin widens.  \"Well, for one thing, it will be some time before he returns, quite some time indeed, if he only returns when he gets that permission.  Captain Adox is the bravest man I know and the best of commanders when one is battling monsters in the wilds, but I fear he is quite hopeless in the ways of the city.  He will be yelling and demanding for hours before he even begins to realize he is only making the petty officials he must deal with angry and determined to deny him.  So we will be alone together for hours at least.\"<br>\r\n    That tips off Aldrea as to the knight's intentions.  \"I would have thought knights like you would have deemed it disgusting sin to have any interest in women.\"<br>\r\n     \"Oh it is definitely deemed sinful by all, and I suppose many would call it disgusting, but a large percentage of knights find those we pursue fascinating.  We speak of those of use who fall to mighty blows, but try not to speak of those who fall to softness, but their number is not small.<br>\r\n    \"It doesn't help that you ladies cheat.  The male ogre meets us with his huge club and tries to kill us.  Him, we deal with with no problem, besides surviving.  But his woman who falls at our feet and proclaims her innocence or eagerness to atone... Much as we might like to, we can't just slice her throat.  No, we must find the evidence of her crimes.<br>\r\n    \"With the ogress, that is not so hard.  The last one was typical in wearing a necklace of the skulls of those she had killed.  But others are less guilty, or better at hiding their crimes.  That means she has time to think of ways to divert us from our duty,   And some of them are quite diverting.\" Sir Roland smiles as tho remembering something very pleasant, \"Have you ever seen a half-dryad?\"<br>\r\n    Aldrea hisses, \"I hear talk of some slut who haunts the baths.  She is not present when decent women like I bath.\"  Aldrea of course knows a good deal more than that, but is not about to admit to such knowledge.

So we are in frequent danger of not upholding our ideals.\"<br>\r\n    \"Well, you can set your mind at ease.\" Aldrea announces, \"I am no man's light love and I am not about to tempt you.\"  [She represses the thought that if the relationship was not totally impossible, it might be rather attractive.  The man is attractive enough, and will likely make some woman a good husband.  The fantasy of that woman being her is hardly revolting.  But no sensible lass should lust for the impossible.  Only sorrow lies that way.]<br>\r\n    \"Oh you do not have to try.\" the knight answers.  He leaves unstated the rest of the statement, but both understand it as implied.  Aldrea may be several times his mass, but somehow she feels like he is looming over her.</span></div></div>",

You can be safe on the street and not bother me.\"<br>\r\n   \"I have three reasons to feel you not dangerous to me.\" counters the knight.  \"The first and most important is that I don't think you will attack, but if you do, we knights are skilled fighters, and I am far from the least of my order.  My captain would be most upset with me if you bested me.  <br>\r\n     \"That is an idea.  Perhaps you would like to spar with me in a day or two.\"<br>\r\n    \"You are not leaving soon?\" bad news for Aldrea and her kin, not to mention every half breed in town.<br>\r\n    \"In theory, we could leave on the morrow, but I doubt we will be here less than a week.  So we will have plenty of time to get in a little practice, or engage in whatever you may desire.\"<br>\r\n     Dodging this idea, Aldrea rashly tries, \"You said there were three reasons...\"<br>\r\n   \"Ah yes, the third is my friend, Norwrack.  He was given the duty of guarding a half-nymph we had captured.  When we returned, she had torn out his throat and killed him.  A truly vicious bitch, she had not tried to escape, but had stayed to make his death long and painful, as well as certain.\"<br>\r\n    \"That's horrible...\" Aldrea sympathizes, \"but how...\"<br>\r\n    \"Norwrack was smiling as he died.\"<br>\r\n    Aldrea is not sure how to respond to that.  So she changes the subject, \"Well, I have work to do even if you can sit around.\"  With that she turns to the forge and its hot fire.<br>\r\n    The clang of Sir Roland's sword falling to the floor causes her to to spin back around in confusion.  She confronts the knight, whose look of shock is turning into a big grin as she watches, and realizes what has happened.  How could she have been so stupid?  OK, granted it was not that hard a mistake to make, but...<br>\r\n   Silversmiths have it better than iron smiths, but all smiths spend much time in front of a blazing hot forge, and wear a heavy, hot, apron to avoid injury from the flames and sparks.  One is just bathed in sweat, and would faint if one was wearing much beyond the apron.  Some smiths wear absolutely nothing besides the apron, which covers enough to be entirely decent, from the front.  But when one turns around...<br>\r\n     And she had just done so without thinking.  Stupid, stupid, stupid.  He may not have seen everything, but he had obviously seen far more than she had any intention of his ever seeing.  She glares at his silly grin.  \"Stand over there, you perverted lout.\" she about bellows as she points to a spot where he will be in front of her.<br>\r\n    Sir Roland is surprisingly quick to move to the indicated spot, surprising enough to make Aldrea wonder.  In a moment, she suspects she has the answer.  She needs to bend over for a good deal of her work, which can make that apron droop, and allow the lucky male a most delightful view.  It is not entirely a delusion on the knight's part.  Aldrea has accidentally allowed such a view at times [and \"accidentally\" allowed such a view a time or two to favored males, truth be told], but there is going to be no accident this time, even if she has to use a hand just to hold the apron up.<br>\r\n    That is not necessary and so Aldrea can concentrate on her work, at least as much as Sir Roland lets her.  \"Tell me about yourself.  Your family, your friends, your goals...\"<br>\r\n    Aldrea hesitates.  Silence is likely the best policy, but there are several things she would like to talk about, if not necessarily to this knight, and which she can do without hampering her work.  It is quite tempting to answer...  </span></div></div>",

She may not be the most beautiful lass in town, but she is at least honorable competition for those who would claim that title.  \"I have standards.  I prefer having no man to having a bad one.  And we mixed breeds often have problems been considered acceptable by either of our parents' types.  And men prefer a wife that looks up to them, a task I find difficult.\"<br>\r\n    \"What are you a mix of?\" the knight continues, \"Giant is hard to miss, and there is a fair amount of elf, but...\"<br>\r\n    \"I am 2/5 elf, 1/5 giant, 1/5 human, and 1/5th ogre.\" Aldrea recites.<br>\r\n    \"Now those are impossible numbers,\" Sir Roland analyzes, \"tho likely vaguely right.  But how did you get such figures?\"<br>\r\n    \"I know only what my parents tell me.\" Aldrea answers, thinking this a safe subject, at least safer than subjects the man might want to talk about.  \"Mother is a half-elf, half ogre.  I think Grandmother was Grandfather's slave, but they parted when Mother was young and thereafter Grandmother spoke very little about him, and that unfriendly.<br>\r\n    \"Father is 1/3 human, 1/3 giant, and 1/3 elf.\"<br>\r\n    \"Now how could he be 1/3 anything?\"<br>\r\n    \"Father has said that Grandmother was so large she needed two husbands.\" Aldrea explains, \"And he always insists he had two fathers.\" <br>\r\n    \"Well, I suppose there is some magic that could do that..., and you do have both elven and human blood in you...\" Sir Roland seems to think for a moment, \"but that would make the percentages 37.5 elf, 25 ogre, 25 giant, and 12.5 human.  Or...\"<br>\r\n     Aldrea is impressed.  Neither giant nor ogre is noted for intelligence and while Aldrea is smarter than either, she was never an outstanding scholar in what little education she received. But she reminds herself that an impressed girl is entirely too close to being a seduced lass, and tries to challenge the figures.  \"Well, that depends...\"<br>\r\n    Probably fortunately, Sir Roland changes the subject a little, \"But how did such a mix come about?\"<br>\r\n    \"In the normal way, I assume.  You would leave me with child if I were so foolish as to let you, and most others will find those of other races suitable, at least when there is a shortage of partners of their own race.<br>\r\n    \"Now as I said, I do not know, but Mother supposes that Grandmother was captured and held captive until Mother was a little girl.\"<br>\r\n    \"I would have thought he would had her for dinner long before she could have a child.\"<br>\r\n    \"Such I have been told too, but in any case, Grandmother was not grateful for any mercy shown.\"<br>\r\n    \"Now Father...\" Aldrea continues, \"He says that his grandfathers were soldiers at a lonely post and a small family of giants were the only neighbors.  Their daughter had no giant boys around and so became interested in the soldiers.  I am not too clear on the details, but when she became pregnant, both of his fathers married her.\"<br>\r\n    \"But what about yourself?\" Sir Roland again redirects the subject.     </span></div></div>",

Every one of the dark fairy's had a stile to there jokes and Leena's was karma. That's why the other dark fairy's messed with her. She only played with those that did bad things instead of everyone she saw. Because of this the others thought her soft and did there best to drive her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeena had light gray skin with glowing green eyes, a slender body and white hair with black hairs scattered about in her hair. She wore a leather shirt and pants with stitches all over her clothes. The shirt has a hole in the back for her wings and she was bare footed. Over her shoulder was a strap holding a leather bag with a few things she wanted to take with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeena suddenly perked up at the sound of crying and beatings. Looking down she saw a merchant wagon with a small family in it. \"I TOLD YOU BRATS TO SHUT YOUR MOUTHS!\" said the father raising his cane causing the children to quiet there crying and huddle in fear. Leena looked about as saw that the wife and kids had bruises all over and she saw that the wife had the look of unyielding hatred in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeena smiled as she stealthily flew around the wagon and landed on the wife's shoulder quickly hiding herself from the kids in the back with the woman's hair. The woman turned her head to see what was on her shoulder and her eyes widened. Leena felt the ground of flesh beneath her feet shake with a strong sent of fear clouding the air around them. \"As much as i like that smell mortal you need not fear me I came to grant you a wish\" Leena said softly into her ear. The woman fearful face turned more toward confusion so Leena said something to better explain. \"I saw what he did, and what marks he left.\" the woman's eyes widened a moment with realization and she glanced over toward her husband, then back toward her kids. As she looked back at the dark fairy standing on her shoulder she seamed to be thinking deeply on it, her face growing in anger with each passing thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Leena got her answer in a whisper. \"I wish he was dead, in a way the children wouldn't see.\" The woman put some emphasis on that last part. Leena side with a frown. When she thinks someone deserves death and gives there victims a wish she wishes they wold be more creative. There was no challenge at all in that wish. Leena sat down on the woman's shoulder thinking of a way to separate the man from everyone ells. She could push something over when they get the the ledge that went down into the steep forest area but what? it would need to be something that he wold go after and not send the wife or a kid after. Something he wold trust no one ells with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeena then smiled as it hit her and she got her shadow ready. She saw that the woman was still looking at her worriedly, never once taking her eyes off of Leena. Just as the man got close to the ledge Leena used her shadow to cut the string of the money pouch and rolled it down the hill. \"NOOOO!\" Shouted the man as he took off down the hill after it vanishing into the trees. As soon as he was out of sight Leena went in after him and saw that he had stopped and was looking at his pouch as it rested at the mouth of a cave next to a sleeping bear. Leena smiled as she watched him try to sneak closer to get his money but Leena saw something ells. A lose stone the size of a human head, over the bears head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the man was trying to get his pouch he froze as he heard the sound of movement overhead and looked up at a rock wiggling slightly and it was tied up in some black, see threw rope. Flowing it with his eyes. the man grew terrified when he saw a dark fairy holding her own shadow like a rope trying to pull the rock down onto the bear's head. The man shock his head no and Leena responded by shacking her head yes. \"Please\" The man whispered. \"I have a wife and kids\" Leena just cocked her eyebrow. \"You beat them.\" She responded. Cursing in his mind he figured she read his mind. \"Then take them instead. There just up the hill but please spare me.\" He whispered back. Leena gave him a disgusted look and bubbled her efforts at pulling. \"No wait i can pay you!\" He whispered loudly only making Leena pull even harder causing the rock to fall on the bears head. The man tried to turn and run but his feet felt cold and he looked down to see they were frozen in a block of ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** ************<br>\r\nThe woman jumped some when she heard a loud roar and her husbands screams. moments later the money bag fell out of the sky landing in the seat next to her with blood splatters all over it. She quickly grabbed the rains and took off with her kids never looking back.<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** *********<br>\r\nLeena was back to flying on her way with a piece of a human finger in her arms that she was eating. A few hours later she came across a human city that she thought looked interesting. After a while of exploring she took notes of a woman going around picking pockets and a smile crossed her face as was grabbing the coin sack of a town guard Leena made a sheet of ice under the rouge's feet causing her to fall flat on her face pulling the coin sack with her getting the town guard's attention. Leena laughed when the woman took off and the guard took off after her but he slipped in the ice sheet on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeena found lots of fun in this city. No end to bad people to play tricks on. Just as she was thinking that she will need a break soon...</span></div></div>",

She was rolling on the floor as she used allusion magic to make a boy that took a girls doll think he was being attacked by a army of zombie squirrels and he was up in a tree swinging a stick crying trying to fend them off. Of course he was the only one that cold see them so he got quiet a few strange looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had her fun and it was getting dark so Leena went off looking for a place to stay, but before she cold get to far off the grown she was surprised when a net quickly swung around her and she was pulled into a dark alley. She felt a hand quickly push her into a cage that was slammed shut and cold water was pored all over her. \"WHAT THE HELL!\" Leena shouted as water dripped from her drenched body. She looked up to see a young man of about 15 just looking at her threw the bars as if he expected something to happen, when nothing did he looked relieved and happy at the same time. Without a word he covered the wooden cage with a cloth and she cold feel herself traveling, she tried to cast a spell but nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeena sat cold and wet with her wings wrapped around herself for warmth, after a while of a ruff ride as the boy seemed to be running Leena felt a welcoming warmth as the cloth cover was removed and the wooden cage was set by a burning fireplace. The young man looked down at Leena in an apologetic way. \"Sorry about the bath back there but, well, you do look like kind of like a demon and better safe then sorry, so I doused you with holly water. Are you some kind of faery?\" He asked, without giving her a chance to answer he went on. \"This is grate! I'm in wizard school. But to move on to the next grade I need a familiar. Most students are just finding animals to cast a spell of intelligence on to get one but wanted something special so I went out looking for something magical! How lucky I didn't even need to leave the city! wait here I'm going to look threw my text book om magical creatures for info on you, this is grate I know we'll be great friends! and don't bother trying to escape your magic wont work inside the cage.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran over to to his books and started skimming threw them but Leena spotted something more interesting. Walking over to the cage door she stuck her hand out and pulled the bare attached to the door threw the slot on the bars next to it and pushed the door opened. \"So big guy just out of curiosity how smart are the creatures this cage is made for?\" Leena asked as she walked over closer to the fireplace to dry off. \"Salamanders.\" he said not taking his eyes off his book. \"Ah here we are dark faeries!\" Leena quickly but quietly glided over to see what was in the book on her kind and landed on the top of the large stack of books on the table. \"Hum, well looks like I brushed with death and didn't even know it. Still I think some of the things in this book about you are exaggerated.\"He said as he staider at the pages. \"Tell me about it her ears are to big his junk is to small and most faeries don't run around naked.\" said Leena looking at a picture, grabbing the boys attention causing him to jump back in surprise knocking his chair and bookshelf over. \"How did you get out of the magic cage!?\" He demanded \"Have you seen the lock on that thing? doesn't take a master thief to unlock that.\" she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a girl about the boys age barged in. \"Jack are you alright? I heard a crashing sound!\" She stopped and gasped when she saw a faery flapping to stay in place midair. \"Is that a faery? Oh is she your familiar? What kind is she?\" The girl then walked close to Leena \"Excuse me miss faery but do you have any friends or family that might be willing to be my familiar? I wold love to have a faery friend.\" She said threw pleading eyes.</span></div></div>",

She already liked the boy but some of the spells in the books were of the highest level and she didn't want to tempt him before he was ready. \"MORNING JACK!\" Jack jumped and nearly fell over before turning to a giggling Leena. \"I wish you wold stop doing that.\" Jack said. \"Nothing wrong with some harmless fun. So what wold I need to do as your familiar?\" Leena asked getting a shocked expression from Jack. \"You mean you wold really do it?\" Leena just shook her head yes but Jack just gave a doubtful look. \"If your worried about me hurting people don't. You read in your book about how all dark fairies have a stile to there pranks?\" Leena asked. Jack gave a nod and she continued. \"Well mine is karma. I only do bad things to bad people and only proportional to the crime.\" Jack seemed pleased with this answer. \"Alright lets start the day. We need to go to mister Mung's classroom before breakfast to register you as my familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jack was sitting at a desk with 8 other students with there new familiars. Leena was resting on his shoulder having a stair down with a bird on the next student's shoulder that was giving her a look she didn't like. An old man rose from his teachers desk with a pen and paper and with a word closed the door to the room. \"Alright kids lets get this over with.\" He went from desk to desk asking the familiars there names and writing down there names and what they were. When he got to Jack he had to squint and adjust his glasses to make sure he wasn't seeing things. \"My word Jack are you sure about this?\" The old wizard asked with worry and fear in his eyes. \"Yes sir I assure you she wont attack anyone that doesn't do anything to deserve it first.\" The old man just shook his head, got Leena's name and went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In the mess hall Leena seemed to be getting a lot of attention from... everyone. A lot of people were asking questions about her and even more were avoiding her. \"Well will you look at that. The roomers are true after all.\" Leena looked over at some kids with magical familiars. \"Its been a while Jack, as you might know we have been forming a, club if you will. Each member representing a different magical element based on there familiar. We need someone on darkness, Care to join?\" Asked the boy with the young sphinx said. Leena didn't like these kids. She cold tell they were spoiled, selfish, and power hungry brats. One of them, a girl even had a poor forest fairy girl in a small cage and using her as a neckless. And she knew that only the most powerful spells require all the types of magic. These kids were up to no good. Jack looked down at Leena questioningly and she answered by shacking her head no. He looked back up at the snobby kids and said...</span></div></div>",

While Jack was catching his breath Leena was checking the class's wide selection of ingredients, each desk had a mini lab. \"Alright class everyone take your seats its time for class.\" Miss Bell said. \"Today we are\" She was interrupted as the boy with the sphinx child came in and sat down in a seat in the back looking over at Jack and Leena as if trying to solve a puzzle. Obviously trying to think of a way to get them to join. \"As I was saying class today we will be be doing level 5 potions. You may make any non-forbidden level 5 potion you like. Your grade will be on how affective you can make it. You may have help from your familiars. Begin.\" Jack looked down at Leena who has already started her own projects with a few small pots cooking. \"You know I'm the one that needs to study not you.\" Jack said. \"I know I just thought I wold whip up a few things for my personal use, Your allowed to do that right?\" Jack shook his head yes. \"So... mind giving me some help with a level 5 potion? This is my worst subject.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Miss bell was walking around the room checking on the students potions. Stopping to check each one. \"Goodness Jack you have quite a project going. This looks fare to complex to be a level 5 potion.\" Miss bell said looking at several empty pots and a few bottles full of new potions as well as 2 pots still boiling. \"No Miss Bell just this one that my familiar helped me with the rest are potions she cooked up herself.\" Miss Bell looked around the table to find Jacks familiar only to see a dark fairy. \"Oh! wha?! a dark fairy!...You Fairy! What are all these potions?! and what did you have Jack make?!\" Leena fought back the erg to prank the woman for the insulting way she reacted to her. \"I just showed jack how to make an invisibility potion. and the things in the pot are A level 20 protection potion, a level 40 anti magic potion, and a level 13 reanimation potion. And whats in the pot boiling now is my lunch.\" Leena replied to the teacher. Miss Bell looked to Jacks potion and took a spoon full out to pore on a plant. The plant turned invisible instantly. \"An excellent potion Jack. And remember fairy you can only use necromancy on animals.\" Said the teacher looking at the reanimation potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n At the end of the class Everyone was ready to get to there next class. \"Alright Class before you go you need to chose your potions partner. Chose carefully because you will be paired up all year.\" Jack was putting the leftover invisibility potion and Leens's things in his magic bag with his book and looked around for potential lab partners. But everyone was walking around him as seemingly all the lab partners were taken except for one. \"Hi partner.\" Said the last kid left for Jack to be partnered up with.</span></div></div>",

There are many different legends and versions of them so I cant give a full detailed description of the nature but I can give some of it threw mix and match. A Snow Woman has pure white skin so to blind in to the snowy areas that they inhabit. They have either white or black hair. And tho they have been known to move about the snow completely naked they also have a white kimono so that's what she will be wearing in the story. They are in every way the image of physical beauty. Its said that they never leave foot prince in the snow and can appear and disappear when in a snow storm. They are considered monsters because they can freeze soled anything by breathing on it and this skill is often used on people. They also lead those lost in a blizzard around until nature kills them and in some story's can even cause snow storms. They are also known to lure men in and suck the life force out of them threw a kiss. They have also been known to enter homes and freeze everyone to death but she needs to be invited to enter. Also they have been known to trap parents by creating the allusion of a young child as bait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow Women are a type of ghost despite being solid. so they wold most likely be fought with exorcisms and talismans. They also don't like high temperatures. so a torch can work to. they only have girl baby's so there are no snow men so when they want to reproduce they abduct human men to make them then they freeze the pore man. Do to the well known deceptive nature of her kind our Snow Woman will have a hard time finding friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********************************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki was a Snow Girl that lived with her mother until she was six. But when she was out playing in the snowy mountains her mother was out looking for people to freeze but was destroyed threw burning when The Order of the Guardian,s Light. set a trap for her. Because she lost her mother at such a young age she was never taught to hate humans so never hunted them. Tho her mother did teach her how to use most of her powers as well as how to talk. Now Yuki is a grown Snow Woman of 19 and in search of someone who will be her friend.</span></div></div>",

The ground was breaking up in one spot as the earth shook for miles. Suddenly a huge amount of water started gushing out like a geyser. When the water stopped flowing it began to take shape and soon a massive woman looking about 20 years old towered over the trees of the forest. she had light blue, moist, skin and long, dark blue hair that reached the middle of her back. her eyes were like murky water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Titan) \"Were am I?... I'm, I'm...\"<br>\r\nHer thoughts were interrupted by a lowed grumbling sound that slightly shook the earth.<br>\r\n(Titan) \"What is this? I don't like this feeling. I'm... Hungry. I haven't eaten for thousands of years...how do I know that?\"<br>\r\nShe looked around and picked up a bolder.<br>\r\n(Titan) \"This is... a rock!... Can I eat it?\"<br>\r\nShe lifted the bolder to her mouth and easily chewed it into bits and swallowed. She looked around for something ells to eat when a strange gurgling sound came from her gut and before she knew what happened she was bent over hurling a lot of water and crushed rocks from her mouth.<br>\r\n(Titan) \"Uhhhhh I can't eat rocks! oh I can't eat rocks.\"<br>\r\nAster getting all of the rocks out of her system her stomach let out an even stronger growl for food. Looking around she saw a tree. She reached down and pulled it from the ground and took a large bight out of it. After chewing and swallowing it she waited for a while and got another hungry growl from her stomach. Her body seams to except trees as food so she quickly ate the rest of it and uprooted a few more before she started walking in some random direction. As she satisfied her hunger with trees she thought about whats going on.<br>\r\n(Titan) \"I, I've been asleep sense I was a baby. I've been kept that way for my protection... But from what? and how do I know this? What am I?...I'm... a Titan, a water Titan... I'm the only Titan.\"<br>\r\nShe said sadly as she knew threw the spell that was placed on her that the others were no longer here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again her thoughts were interrupted when she saw that she ran out of trees to eat. She bent down to get more but before she cold she saw small creatures running away from her. Curiosity took over and she began following the small things. When they came to a clearing she saw that it was a pack of wolves. She quickly caught up with them and plucked them from the ground and placed them in her left hand. when she had them all she stood up strait and kept walking as she examined the little wolves in her hand as they tried to find a way down. She picked one up with her thumb and finger and brought it to her mouth. It was the tastiest thing she ever had. it was soft but had a crunch to it and it was filed with a warm liquid. She continued on her way forgetting her troubles for the moment contently snaking on her wolves. When she ate her last wolf she saw some new kind of trees. these trees had fruits on them. She wondered if those trees tasted different then the others. She was still a little hungry so she decided to try one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******************************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikel and Susan were harvesting there apples. They were each in there own tree dropping there apples into there buckets on the ground. When the ground started to shake. They looked around and saw a giantess among giants. She was huge, and blue, and naked! Her blue skin looked moist like she recently went for a swim. Mikel looked over to his sister who looked to scared to do anything when a giant blue hand reached down and grabbed the trunk of his sisters apple tree and pulled it up into the air. To his horror he saw that this giantess was bringing the tree and his sister to her open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********************************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan was clinging tightly to her tree as she was lifted high into the air. Her fear grew greatly when she saw that she was heading for the giant's open mouth she and the tree entered the mouth and was placed on her teeth. Susan jumped from the tree just in time as the mouth closed crushing the tree with the giant teeth. Tho the mouth was closed light was still getting threw. She saw that the mouth was covered with blood and that there were a few bones stuck between her teeth. She felt the tongue she was sitting on. It was much softer then her own, and the giants mouth seamed wetter then a normal mouth. Then the teeth started doing there job. Up, down, up, down. the teeth continued to smash and grind the tree into past. While the teeth were chewing the giants blue tongue was moving tossing her up and down. Susan bounced up and down splatting against the wet tongue as she came down each time. Then the giants head seemed to tilt down while it was chewing and Susan started sliding on her tongue toward her mashing incisors. Susan quickly put out her arms and planted them against the front teeth to keep from sliding into them but she couldn't hold it and she fell. She closed her eyes waiting for her end but it didn't come, the mouth was still. Susan opened her eyes and looked around and nothing was happening. Then the mouth tilted back upright and Susan landed back on the tongue. All was still, all was quiet. Susan saw that the now liquidated remands of the tree were also on the tongue all around her. Susan was to afraid to move and just stayed there. After a while of waiting the tongue lifted to the roof of the mouth and Susan was pressed tightly against roof of the mouth and the tongue as the tongue started moving in a circular motion. Susan thought that the giant was savoring her food before swallowing and with this realization she mustered up the strength to let lose a defining scream. The tongue dropped back down and without hesitation Susan jumped to her feet, ran to the front of the mouth and started pounding on the teeth with her fists.<br>\r\n(Susan) \"LET ME OUT! LET ME OUT! LET ME OUT!\"<br>\r\nThe teeth parted as the mouth opened wide. Susan fell forward but grabbed the teeth just in time as she was hanging from the giantess's lower lip. Susan then felt the giantess's finger and thumb get a grip on her legs and pulled her away from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikel wasted no time. He jumped from the tree and ran up to the giantess yelling for her to stop. The giantess did look down at him but she was still chewing. He got down on his knees and begged.<br>\r\n(Mikel) \"Please stop my sister was on that tree please don't eat her!\"<br>\r\nTo mikes relief she stopped chewing. She tilted her head up a little and just stood there like she was waiting for something to happen. After a short while he cold see that she was moving her mouth a little and had an expression on her face that told him that she was looking for her. Mikel grew worried again. Had he been to late? Was his sister already chewed up? Suddenly her massive eyes shoot open in surprise and a moment later her mouth opens and Mikel sees his sister hanging off the giants lip. The giant takes his sister from her lip and takes her up to eye level to look at her. Then Susan in her panic blurted out words that she wold soon come to regret.<br>\r\n(Susan) \"LET ME GO!\"<br>\r\nAnd just like that the finger and thumb parted and she fell screaming toward the ground. Mikel quickly jumped to his feet and ran to his sister's aid. He got under her just in time to catch her as he fell over from the impact Susan quickly swung her arms around him hugging him tightly as she shook like a leaf, her face buried in his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Mikel) \"WHY DID YOU DO THAT?!\"<br>\r\n(Titan) \"She told me to...\"<br>\r\n(Mikel) \"She wanted you to set her down gently!\"<br>\r\n(Titan) \"oh... sorry.\"<br>\r\nMikel quickly averted his eyes as the emotion died down in him and he remembered that she was naked.<br>\r\n(Mikel) \"Um... cold you please cover up? Don't you have cloths?\"<br>\r\nThe Titan thought for a moment to see if her mind can tell her what cloths are and how to get some When it came to her she lowered her index finger to the small humane girl and water flowed from it and completely drenched her clothes. She then pulled her finger away and the water came with it in the exact shape of Susan's now miraculously dry cloths. Her hand turned into water and started flowing into the mold and made it grow and grow yet the giant didn't shrink at all. The mold grew until  it was the perfect size for her. Then it solidified till it liked like a giant blue copy of Susan's cloths made from fabric instead of water. The giant clothes then flowed over her and she was clothed in blue work pants with pockets and a blue short sleeved shirt. Here feet were still bare.<br>\r\n(Mikel) \"What kind of giant are you? Your blue, your big enough to carry a normal giant in one hand and you have water powers?\"<br>\r\n(Titan) \"I'm not a giant I'm a Titan.\"<br>\r\nMikel was surprised by this. He didn't think there were any Titans left.<br>\r\n(Titan) \"Will you be my friend?\"<br>\r\nAgain Mikel was caught off guard. He thought about it. She seamed nice.<br>\r\n(Mikel) \"Ok. My names Mikel and this is my sister Susan. Whats your name?\"<br>\r\n The Titan searched her mind but came up with nothing.<br>\r\n(Titan) \"I don't have one. I think I'm just a little bit still hungry and I want some more wolves. want to come with me?\"<br>\r\n(Mikel) \"No I'm taking Susan home. We live in the house over the hill on the other side of the orchard. You can come visit us when your done.\"<br>\r\n(Titan) \" Ok.\"<br>\r\nThe Titan rose up and walked back out into the woods. Shacking the earth with each step.</span></div></div>",

Full list of Splices powers: Spliced has many special abilities that it gains from feeding and the ability to summon, awaken, and control the dead. Spliced also has five sealed limiters ( yes just like alucard.) that can be released but only at times when it is backed in to a corner. Back story: After an untimely death the Judge comes to reap a soul only for the judge to see its not who he came for. The judge saw the coming future through the Book of Time and knew it was time for a Spliced to walk the world again. Spliced has pitch black eye's and ice blue pupils with skin the color of polished granite. It can no longer eat normal food and must now consume life force ( if you have ever watched superman the animated series his way of feeding is similar to the Parasite it only has to touch you skin to skin to steal life force). The life force of tree's and small animals can keep it moving and at the strength of a normal human but the more human life force it consumes the more powerful it can become as well as gaining the memories and small amounts of special skills of whoever he feeds off of. It must feed off of humans to heal if hurt otherwise it will never heal tho no wound will kill it except the complete destruction of its body. The process of consuming life force causes the person who was fed off of to seem ill and weak and if a person is fed off of for to long they die. The creation of a Spliced has happened many times in the past and only when the world needed a hero, a protector, and most of all when it was earned to become a Spliced the greatest of sacrifices must be made. One must give up their life knowing full well that there was no chance of survival and they must do it without regret.</span></div></div>",

An army was charging at the castle and the people of this land were trying to get in before the gates closed. Just as the gates were about to close a teenage boy and his sister were the last outside the castle walls. The boy got in but with the gates closing he saw that his sister wasn't going to make it. Quickly he grabbed a spear and jammed the gate to keep it open. With his sister threw all were in despair to see the spear head break off when a guard tried to pull it out. Needing timed to close the gate the people shouted demands of him to go out and slow them down. Tho it may of seamed unreasonable for his sister, the only family he had left. He walked up to a guard and took his shield and sword, the guard didn't try to keep his weapons feeling it was the boys responsibility to make up for what he did. Grabbing a small wagon he pushed it threw the gate and hopped on as he rode down the thin bridge over the moat. The oncoming men quickly braced for impact as the cart came at them. As the cart came to a stop against the bodies of the invaders he quickly brought his sward down on the men only to have it blocked by a larger sward and pushed back onto his butt against the other side of the cart. Then a large man with a thick beard climbed into the cart with him. He seems to be the leader of the barbarians that were attacking his homeland. A look of amusement on the large mans face showed how black his heart was as he swung his sward down at the boy. He managed to block the large man's blow with his shield and rise to his feet. As he rose his sward to make a strike the large man quickly swung his massive blade knocking the boys sward from his hand into the moat. With a quick motion the large man pulled the shield aside and ran the boy threw. The last thing he heard was his sisters scream at the sight of a large, bloody, blade popping out of her brothers back. With the boys eyes cold and lifeless the large man pushed his body off of his sward landing on the bridge. He then jumped over the other end of the cart and pushed it over the side of the bridge. As he shouted a charge and his men ran on crushing the boy's body under foot the gate closed just in time.<br>\r\n**********************************************<br>\r\nThe boy let out a sigh of relief as he watched. The sky looked as dark as midnight without a star and everything was in black and white. Tho it was clear that the invaders were yelling it seamed as quiet as whispers to him. It was so quiet that he heard the turning of a page behind him. He turned to see a man that was lot in black and white. Tho all he wore was black. He whore an all black dress shirt and pants, he has black slicked back hair and eyes that look like black pearls. And he has a fine black cane with a silver skull top in one hand and a golden book in the other with many fine details. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I dead?\" The boy asked. \"Stone cold\" He responded never taking his eyes off the book. \"Tho I did not come for you.\" The man in black added. The boy looked confused as the man in black closed his book. \"Someone made a mistake. I was to take him.\" He added as he pointed to the man that cut the boy down. \"You weren't meant to jam the gate. Your sister was to get locked out. Out of desperation she was going to jump to that stone sticking out near the gate and out of blood lust the Savage leader wold take a swing at her only to slip and fall to his death. With the leader dead in such a way the army wold have turned back.\" If the boy had any blood he wold have turned pail. he died for nothing and worse he may have doomed his sister  and his people with the leader of the attackers still alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am called the Judge. And normally this wold be a once in a few hundred years mistake and I wold take you anyways but this happened last week to. Someone is messing with people's fates. So I'm authorized to make a deal with you. You see every once in a while someone trys this to change the destination of human souls by altering events. So If you except I can send you back. But you wont be human anymore and you will be working for me. You see me and my partner cant kill. Only take you when your dead, so when this happens again I or my partner will come to you to set it right by making sure we get who we came for. Do we have a deal?\"  The Judge asked as he let go of his cane letting it stand in place on its own. extending his hand. The boy thought about it for a moment before slowly raising his hand but the Judge pulled his away. \"Before you agree you should know that you will feed off of life force from now on. plants and animals will sustain you but humans give you power. Also you need to feed off humans to heal. You can heed on them but don't hang on to long it will kill them. But wont shorten there life. And when you are back in your body you feed from the man that killed you. Don't stop when your healed, for you to walk the land of the living he must take your place as you took his.\" The Boy shook his head slowly in agreement and the Judge extended his hand once again and as they shook a black cloud enveloped the boy and he seamed to disappear. The Judge looked down at his shadow as if listening to something. \"Yes I looked into what kind of person he is. Have a little faith partner... Don't worry if it comes to that I'll take responsibility.\"<br>\r\n********************************************<br>\r\nAs the invading army was bringing up a battering ram something from the ground lifted. The men all backed up from the dead boy there leader had killed. He now had pitch black eye's and ice blue pupils with skin the color of polished granite. The boy gripped were the man had cut him in pain for a moment before charging strait at the shocked man as he pinned him against the gate with his hands on the large mans bare arms. As the large man stood, pinned by the one he just killed, he seamed to get sick rapidly. A dark circle formed around his eyes as he grew paler by the second. \"I...I killed you.\" The man said as he lost the strength to hold his weapon. \"Yes. But death is on my side. And he wants you. Time to go to Hell.\" The large man looked down at him in fear as his life slowly drained away and his soul left his body. When the boy could feel no more strength growing he dropped the lifeless husk and turned to the terrified men behind him. \"Anyone want to join him?\" He asked in a angry tone. The men up front quickly pushed back. Those in the back that didn't see what happened followed thinking a retreat was called. With the threat gone the gates opened and when the people looked at him...</span></div></div>",

Somehow, they were able to give her powerful magic as a weapon(Her spiked fox tail is a warning to this)She rarely uses magic, though preferring to make stuff by hand.

His mother was kidnapped by mad cultists and impregnated with the abomination's essence. Thomas looks mostly human, but he has purple skin, octopus-like eyes, a tail like a scorpion, and claws that can scar metal. He sometimes gains other monstrous features when he is very angry. He has nearly limitless physical prowess, though at first he can barely control it, and magical powers such as necromancy, energy blasts that can destroy large houses, turning one thing into another, and flight (Note: In this setting, necromancy doesn't just mean creating undead). However, using his magic too much risks summoning one of his father's minions. Thomas can heal most non-magical damage, but he is weak to fire and acid. Thomas wants nothing to do with his father, and his dream is to join a team of heroes. However, right now that dream seems all but unreachable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas has a fraternal twin brother who leans more toward their father's side. His brother, who has no real name, is 80 feet tall and looks like a cyllinder of purple flesh that walks on dozens of tentacles and has 4 dragon wings around his middle and 100 dragon heads that face all directions. The only thing he inherited from their human mother is his material flesh and blood. The brother has the same powers as Thomas, but his inteligence is below the human average, so Thomas has one advantage. Thomas hates his brother and will fight him if they cross paths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPossible supporting character: Willow is Thomas's half-sister, but instead of a human woman, her mother was a fairy. She has no siblings. Willow is 8 inches tall and has purple and black butterfly wings, jet black skin, and tentacles for hair. She has the same powers as Thomas, but she focuses more on magic because of her small stature. She is mischivous, but she never harms people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you wish, you can introduce other spawn of Thomas's father (whose true name can not be pronounced by humanoids) as antagonists. Their mothers can be human women or human-like magical creatures. Because of their hybrid nature, they are each unique in appearance, with some being alien horrors and others looking much like normal members of their mother's species with only some monstrous features. The latter type can be redeemed, but the former type can not.</span></div></div>",

She wishes desperately to make friends with smaller, weaker creatures, but most of them are mentally scarred by the mere sight of her. Her body is made of elemental magic bound within a semblance of flesh, and thus she can only be killed with the most powerful spells or enchanted weapons. Zeliark was created by a sorcerer-king who sought to exceed the creator god by making a being mightier than any of His creations, however, she has only hatred for her creator, who can be the main villain of you wish. Zeliark is three times the height of the tallest mountain, and has 6 different forms she can assume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are her forms, listed from weakest to strongest:<br>\r\n#1: In this form Zeliark appears mostly human aside from her size, but she has red, purple, gold, and black stripped skin, 2 stubby horns, draconic wings, and a tail tipped with a spiked club. She can breath fire hot enough to melt gold. She is very beautiful by human standards in this form, but her size overwhelms most people.<br>\r\n#2: In this form she becomes a humanoid dragon with 4 arms and huge muscles, though she still has mamalian female features. In this form, she can move faster by running on her knuckles like a gorrila. Her fire becomes hot enough to melt steel.<br>\r\n#3: This form looks the same as her 2nd form, except she has 10 heads and 20 arms, and she gains unbelievable muscles: her pecs are 15 times the diameter of her heads, she has ten-pack abs, and her arms and legs are brawnier than any natural creature's. She gains a second pair of wings for complex aerial manuvers. Her fire becomes hot enough to melt rock.<br>\r\n#4: In this form she has 100 heads and 200 arms. Her pecs are 75 times the diameter of her heads, she has 12-pack abs, and her arms and legs are much brawnier. Her fire is hot enough to melt gems.<br>\r\n#5: In this form Zeliark is shaped like a centaur, and has a third pair of wings on her quadrupedal portion. She has one million heads and two million arms. Her pecs are 120 times the diameter of her head, she gains 14-pack abs, and her arms and legs are almost as thick as they are long. Her fire becomes hot enough to boil gold, and can burn some creatures not normally harmed by fire. She can also ignite herself to burn enimies who touch her (this doesn't harm her).<br>\r\n#6: In this form her size doubles, and she has fifty million heads and a hundred million arms. She isn't any more muscular than in her 5th form, but she summons a two-handed war hammer that can alter the size of things as well as functioning as a melee weapon (this is the only time she wields a weapon). Her fire becomes hot enough to boil most earthen materials, and she gains the ability to create a firey vortex centered on herself.<br>\r\n#7: Zeliark may have a 7th form she has yet to discover. It should follow the same pattern as her first 6 forms, and her hammer might gain more powers in this state. She should only unlock her 7th form in the most dire circumstances, such as if her first friend is in mortal danger and her first 6 forms aren't enough to save her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeliark stays in her 1st form whenever possible, so as to appear as unthreatening as possible, though that doesn't say much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all of her forms, Zeliark is immune to heat and resistant to cold and electricity. She has the magical abilities of a journeyman wizard, though most of her spells are for defense, healing, and other non-offensive uses, so she mostly uses her physical strength and fire breath to attack. She hates violence, but she will fight for what is right, especially to protect small creatures like humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome tribes of monsters worship Zeliark as a goddess, but she has only disdain for this and tries to tell them she is no diety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSorry if this is kind of long.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Here are some possible supporting characters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh Father Macleod: The head of this world's main church, he is generally wary of monsters, but he is very open-hearted. However, not all church officials share his viewpoint. An elderly human man, Macleod is physically weak from old age, but he has strong holy powers, and his diadem shields him against mental attacks and mind-reading. He dresses in a white frock, and has medium skin and light gray hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeadmaster Platinumheart: An old high elf, and this worlds most powerful magic-user, Platinumheart is the headmaster of Alfhar Academy, a prestigious school of magic. Only neutral or light magic is taught at his school, darker magic is rarely taught in civilized lands. He has taught students of many races, though he is suspicious of large monsters like Zeliark, and he does not under any circumstances trust undead. He has fair skin, silver hair, and wears purlple robes covered with runes of golden thread. He carries an oaken staff topped with a large star sapphire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanis Oakenback: A fearless wood elf druid-in-training, she is a good candidate for Zeliark's first friend, as she has befriended creatures most would flee in terror from, including a young hydra. Tanis wears brown furs and has brown hair and blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrayback: Tanis's wolf animal companion, he follows her through thick and thin, and will defend her to the death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Creator: The supreme being of this setting, also known as the Light or the Holy Force. He should appear personally only briefly, if at all, but He will be mentioned often, and He may take interest in Zeliark's adventures. His true form is beyond the comprehension of created beings, but He can appear any shape or size he wishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPossible villain:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Obsidian: The creator of Zeliark, he is a dark elf sorcerer-king of great arrogance and power and Platinumheart's longtime rival. When Zeliark saw what he wanted her to do to smaller creatures, she said: \"You may have created me, but I will never harm the innocent in your name.\" King Obsidian knows many terrible dark spells, though he no longer has the resources to create a being like Zeliark. His most terrible spell, which he dares not attempt too often, is invoking the direct power of a demon lord to cause a great cataclysm. He requires a sacrifice at an elaborate evil alter to cast this spell, so he will not be using it in the heat of battle. He has dark purple skin, all-black eyes that are very sensitive to light, and hair as black as the darkest night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore on The Church: The Church is dedicated to The Creator, though most temples and clerics also dedicate themselves to one or more saints or archangels, who represent different aspects of nature and civilization. Priests can be either gender, and are allowed to marry, but the High Father or Mother is required to be celibate.Other than the above differences, their organization is much like the Catholic Church. Priests have the typical powers granted to fantasy clerics (think D&amp;D or Warcraft). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore on elves: High elves gravitate towards the heavens, while wood elves are more worldly. Dark elves are descended from a kingdom of elves who turned from The Creator out of arrogance. High and wood elves generally worship saints or archangels of magic and nature, respectively. Dark elves are too arrogant to worship any entity, though they often make pacts with demons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther fantasy races exist in this world, but the details of their cultures are up to the reader.</span></div></div>",

He was created by the lords of the Demon Plane as the ultimate weapon of destruction and evil. He is as tall as Zeliark in her 6th form, and he looks like a monstrous, demonic arthropod. His exoskeleton is as black as a moonless night and harder than diamond. He has a humanoid front half and hindquarters like a great centipede. He has 2 limbs like a praying mantis that can cut through granite like a hot knife through butter, and a billion tentacles growing from his back and shoulders that can constrict like snakes and are tipped with deadly stingers. Zeliark is normally immune to poison, but Cthul-N'galla's venom can affect her. The Great Foe of Life has five hundred million heads that are like every predatory arthropod made as one and made utterly evil. He can spew purple-black energy that obliterates most creatures and objects instantly, though it only moderately wounds Zeliark. His most devastating ability is that he can spread dark magic across the world that kills most creatures on contact; only Zeliark and a few other powerful beings are immune to this ability. Though he has no wings, he can fly similar to a Chinese dragon. Our beastly heroine will need to change to her 6th form to hold her own against The Great Foe of Life, and will need to unlock her 7th form to destroy him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiabolus: The oldest and greatest of the demon lords, he is known as The First and Last Enemy and the King of Darkness. He assumes thousands of different forms, but his most famous forms are a black knight, a many-headed dragon, and a horned and hooved humanoid with draconic wings, sometimes with multiple faces. None of his forms are as big or as physically powerful as Zeliark, but he is cunning, and has vast magical powers and nearly limitless minions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of these villains should be introduced personally until Zeliark has made at least one friend, but they can be mentioned, and minions of the latter will likely make many appearaces.</span></div></div>",

Whatever their origins, it is known that demons are corruption and evil incarnate, and their ultimate goal is to tear down creation and remake it into something unfathomably hideous. They can form either from the fabric of the Demon Plane or from the most vile mortal souls. Demons created in the former fashion are often less humanoid than ones formed from souls, though that is not always the case. Countless different types of demons exist, ranging from the size of a mosquito to the size of a mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10,000 layers of the Demon Plane have been documented, though some belive that the total number is much higher. Some layers of the Demon Plane resemble the harshest terrestrial climates, while others are utterly alien, but all are horrifying to behold, and only the bravest or most foolish dare challenge the demons in their own realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most powerful demons can claim rulership of a layer and earn the title of demon lord. Some rare demon lords control as many as 3 layers, but most control only one.However, they must fight often to maintain their title. Diabolus tolerates this in-fighting as long as he himself is not challenged, as he believes that it is needed to keep demonkind strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemons in this story can be any shape the reader wants as long as it looks monstrous, though some of them may assume beautiful forms in order to decieve the heroes.</span></div></div>",

I've seen some sick chapters some members write and I will make it clear now. KEEP IT CLEAN! Being a little playful is one thing I'll allow that just don't get sick. No further then boobs. Anything beond that I will delete. And any romance must be with the opposite gender. characters of the same gender can go no further then best buds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#2 the monster can't be part demon there can be demons as villains if you want but I just can't see anything that's part demon being kind. That's why I made this new story instead of just adding to the Outcast.(So let me Make this clear since some of you seem to have a hard time grasping this concept. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A GOOD DEMON! I know from experience. demons are real, and they are pure evil! so stop pressing the matter because I will not change my mind. If I can't edit a chapter where someone tried to make a good demon I will delete it! And angels are not monsters while were on the subject, an angel will not have problems finding friends.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#3 no dead ends. the story can end but give the reader the choice to move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#4 If someone feared the monster at first then it will take time or proof like a show of emotion or saving a life to get there trust, humans wont just take the word of something that they think is an evil man-eating beast. except for small children (anyone under 10).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nalso I will give the choice to make your own monsters but I don't want it going on forever. I will stop it when it gets to chapter 20.<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nSome pre-made characters made for this story and a few other things you can find. Characters listed are not main characters but characters that they might come across in the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Judge.<br>\r\ngender,male<br>\r\nage,?<br>\r\nreal name,?<br>\r\nIf you like to read my kind of story then you probably know about dragon riders. where a human and a dragon impress each other and become bound by mind and soul. Well in this story any monster can go threw this with a human so you can do it with the monster you chose. The Judge is the rarest case of this bonding proses as he has bonded with one of the things no one ever thought cold ever be bonded with, The Reaper of souls itself. Upon his death he came face to face with the Grim Reaper itself and ever since he has walked the many worlds out there with all the power of death itself. However as this comes with many benefits, Immortality, invincibility, travel anywhere instantly, being able to read the book of time (Has all that was, is, and will be within its pages) he is also bound by the laws of the reaper. He can't kill anyone. He can only take them when there time comes, he can not under any condition tell anyone the future, and he can't have a romantic relationship with the living. When it comes to a trial or a contest in which a soul is at stake he is always the judge. hints the nick name.<br>\r\nAlso he is considered a bad omen when he enters a town or city where there is no event for him to enjoy, its said it means there is going to be a massacre.<br>\r\nJust remember if you fight him you will not win. You can't beat death!<br>\r\nHe wheres an all black dress shirt and pants, he has black slicked back hair and eyes that look like black pearls. And he always has a fine black cane with a silver skull top with him.<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nThe Order of the Guardian,s Light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn organization of warriors that consider any non-human impure and that it is there duty to wipe all such creatures from existence. They are many in number and some are very skilled at whatever method they use to make there kills. They all bare a coat of arms of a shield with white wings and over the shield is a lions head roaring triumphantly while on the shield is a dragon,s head with swards going threw it. They are widely known threw most of the human world as heroes and parades are often held when they bring evidence that they had just made a kill even if its just a baby of some kind.<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nmore to come...<br>\r\n</td>",
