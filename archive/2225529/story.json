It was clear that she'd rather not get up and just sleep in for the day, since it was summer vacation and she wanted to enjoy her day how she wanted to. But, of course, everybody's got to get out of bed sometime, and it might as well be now. As Stinky tossed and turned in her sleep, she eventually ended up laying on her back. A few moments of silence passed before she was awakened by the sound of her own butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaapp!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Stinky had full control over her farts, but that was just while she was awake - while she was asleep, it was a different story. Stinky didn't actually have an alarm clock in her room, and that was because Stinky's body had a sort of alarm system built-in, thanks to her Stinker abilities. Because of this, Stinky would often awake after her body had gotten enough rest, and since she went to bed early the night prior, her butt told her to wake up early this morning. As the old saying goes, \"Early to bed, early to rise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStinky sat up from her bed and stretched her arms and legs as she let out a long yawn. Once she fully opened her eyes, that's when she told herself, <i>Guess there's no sleeping in today, huh? Ah well, maybe tomorrow.</i> Stinky pivoted her body towards her right and proceeded to jump out of bed. All she was wearing was a pair of bright blue pajama pants, and a light gray shirt that read \"I Heart to Fart,\" with the Heart being the symbol of a heart, rather than the actual word itself. Stinky then walked over to her closet and proceeded to pick out her clothes - she decided to wear an all-black, short-sleeved shirt that was starting to get a bit too small for her now. Her stomach and outie-belly button poked out from under the shirt, which Stinky couldn't help but laugh at. <i>This actually looks kinda cute,</i> she thought. <i>Hope mom doesn't give me too hard a time over it.</i> After she put on the small black shirt, she then followed up by taking of her pajama pants and replacing them with bright blue denim shorts she kept in her drawer. After that, she made her way to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStinky took a good look at herself in the mirror as she was brushing her teeth, since she forgot to do it the night before. Stinky had bold blue eyes coupled with long, blonde hair. Her facial features were simple and round, as to be expected for a girl her age, with the exception of her big eyes. Aside from those aspects, there wasn't else all that remarkable about how she looked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStinky always preferred to have short hair, since it was less of a pain to deal with in the morning, but her mother insisted that she have long hair so that she would look less like a boy when she was out in public. Stinky was against it at first, but then she realized that meant less haircuts, so she decided to follow her mom's advice, since she also - strangely enough - hated getting haircuts, even though she liked short hair. To compromise, Stinky came up with her own hairstyle - a way to keep the long hair, to make it as cool and as stylish as she wanted. What she would do is pull all the hair that hung down her back and flip it over to that it could be seen sticking out from the back of her head, and hold in place with a black hair clip, but still gave it enough slack so that her hair had a loop, and would result in all of that fair getting in Stinky's face. Next, she'd take the hair along both sides of her face and tied them with black ribbons, similar to a character she saw in one of her favorite shows. o her, this hairstyle was the perfect combination of cool, but also kinda cute too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she was done getting ready in the bathroom, Stinky headed to the kitchen, where she saw her mother cooking eggs and bacon for breakfast, and her dad sitting at the table looking at his phone. Her dad pulled his face up to face Stinky as he heard her walking into the kitchen. \"G'morning, kiddo!\" he said with a smile. Stinky's mother turned around and added, \"Good morning, Elueze! Breakfast is almost ready - I got them scrambled, just the way you like it.\" Stinky proceeded to sit down in the chair across from her father and replied, \"Thanks, Mom! Man, I love scrambled eggs.\" Stinky then looked at her dad and asked, \"Hey dad, I thought you were working today.\" Stinky's dad responded, \"I am, but I got up early this morning - heh, I guess we all did, huh?\" Stinky raised an eyebrow and asked, \"It's early? what time is it?\" Stinky's mother responded, \"7:12, sweetie. Dad doesn't go into work until 8:30 on Mondays.\" Stinky's eyes widened. <i>Damn,</i> she thought. <i>I got up at 7:00 this morning... well, thanks a lot, butt, I could have slept in for at least a couple more hours.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStinky's Mom put down a plate of scrambled eggs, toast and bacon in front of both Stinky and Stinky's dad, who told her, \"Thank you, Honey.\" Stinky's mom replied with \"You're welcome,\" and kiss on the cheek. Stinky proceeded to tease them by saying, \"Gross,get a room you two.\" Stinky's dad couldn't help but laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple minutes passed as Stinky and her father ate the food off their plates - Stinky finished hers first, then proceeded to push out a large fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>BRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAPT!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for breakfast, Mom!\" Stinky said with a great big grin. Stinky's mother wasn't as amused. \"Elueze,\" she said, \"I told you abbout farting at the table, right?\" Stinky rolled her eyes and said, \"<i>Yes,</i> Mom, you have...\" Her father intervened, \"Listen to your mother, Stinks.\" Stinky's mother replied, \"<i>Please</i> don't call her that, John, it only encourages her to do it more.\" Stinky's father gave his daughter a wink, and Stinky returned the favor by winking back at him. Stinky's father was always more lenient about her farting around than her mom was - her mom was worried that it would only make her come off as rude to other people, so she tried teaching Stinker proper table etiquette at least. Most of the time, Stinky was compliant, but every so often, she would tease her mother by purposely passing gas when her mom least expects it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStinky then stood up from her chair and said, \"I'm gonna go out for a walk, guys!\" Her mother and father both said, \"Alright, and \"Take care!\" as Stinky went to go and grab her bright red jacket that was hanging on the coat rack next to the front door. She put it on, then proceeded to also slip on her black sandals that were sitting right underneath the coat rack, before opening the front door and heading out to her front yard - Stinky's day had officially begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, as Stinky was walking down the sidewalk, the following occurred:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey there, Stinky!\" a voice shouted. Stinky faced the direction the voice was coming from - a few feet ahead of her was Samuel Rosio, walking towards her from the opposite direction she was headed. Samuel was Stinky's best friend, and has been for as long as she could remember, so she couldn't help but smile when she saw him. \"Hey Sam!\" Stinky replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two kids walked up and stopped in front of each other. Stinky took a quick look at Sam to see what he looked like - Sam was wearing a red jacket, similar to the one she was wearing, but instead of a black shirt and dark-blue shorts, Sam was wearing a bright green shirt with bright blue jeans. He was also wearing white tennis shoes, as opposed to Stinky's black sandals. Sam also had blonde hair and blue eyes, just like Stinky, though his eyes were a darker shade of blue than hers were, and he had shorter hair. Stinky couldn't help but chuckle to herself whenever she saw Sam's hair - his bang were swept upwards and suspended, and she always likened it to a crown, or a four-pronged fork. At a glance, the two looked very similar to each other, almost as if they were related - one of Stinky's earliest memories with Sam involved their teacher almost mistaking them for brother and sister, in fact. With how often the two would spend time with each other, it was an easy mistake to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You going somewhere?\" Sam asked Stinky. Stinky simply replied, \"Actually, not really - just sorta going for a walk, is all. How about you?\" Sam paused for a moment before he said:</span></div></div>",

Man, I love that place.\" Sam smiled and said, \"Great! Race ya there?\" Stinky smirked at Sam and replied, \"Oh, you're on.\" The two kids got into position before Sam started counting down, \"3... 2... 1!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Sam and Stinky raced towards the Hideout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Time: 7:35 AM</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe race finally came to a close in the woods located right next to down - Stinky was the first to arrive, with Sam following shortly after, trying to catch his breath. Stinky shouted, \"Hell yeah! Stinky - 1, Sam - 0!\" as she pumped her fist in the air. Normally, <i>Sam</i> would have actually won the race, since he was a naturally faster runner than Stinky was, but she had a secret weapon that Sam didn't - her rocket-powered butt. Because Stinky could control her own farts, she was able to pick up some speed by pushing out a strong stream of gas that would help make her run a little faster, while leaving Sam behind to catch the waft left behind by her fumes. After Sam took one last deep breath, he rolled his eyes and said, \"I should've <i>known</i> you'd play dirty.\" Stinky looked past her shoulder back at Sam and simply farted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>BRRRRRRrrrrrrrrrp!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not my fault I'm so naturally gifted,\" Stinky said with a wink and a laugh. Sam just raised an eyebrow and responded, \"Yeah, whatever. Anyway, let's head into the Hideout now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hideout was a large treehouse that was built atop an even larger tree in the middle of the woods. Steps were carved out along the tree's trunk that led up to the hatch door at the base of the actual house part of the treehouse. Inside the square-shaped structure were two sleeping bags, a few pillows scattered around, stacks of comic books, a poster of some anime Stinky really liked, a battery-powered lantern for when it got dark, and finally, a couple cans of air freshener. The treehouse did have one window for the sake of ventilation, but if Stinky ever got a little <i>too</i> carried away with her farting, the air freshener was there to help make the place smell less bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hideout was Sam and Stinky's to-go hangout spot, when they weren't either visiting each other's houses, or spending time in town at the arcade or eating together at Balloon Belly Burger, Stinky's favorite burger joint. With the help of both their dads, Sam and Stinky were able to have it be sturdy and strong enough to withstand even the most brutal of weather conditions, though both kids were advised to come home if the weather was really bad. Sam and Stinky have had the Hideout for the last 4 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two kids sat down and settled into the treehouse, Sam asked, \"You have any plans for the day, Stinky?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I am Gassy, the Fart Queen!\" said the tall woman who appeared behind Sam, as she stepped out of the shadows. A moment passed before both Sam and Stinky started holding back laughter. \"R-Really?\" Sam chuckled. \"You sure don't look like any <i>Fart Queen</i> I've seen, that's for sure.\" Stinky laughed out loud in response, and added, \"Hahaha, yeah seriously! What a load - like I'd believe something so stupid.\" Stinky stepped up closer to the tall, decorated woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Stinky didn't believe what she said at all, the tall woman certainly looked like she was royalty - the most noticeable thing about her was her bright white dress with bright blue and red accents, and a long gown that reached her ankles, almost covering all her legs. Just below the gown, the woman was wearing two slippers - a bright red one on her right foot, and a bright blue one on her left. Stinky looked back up to look at the woman directly, and saw that she wasn't wearing a crown - not even a tiara - and she also noticed that her eyes were a bold shade of purple. The last thing Stinky took notice of was the woman's long, raven-colored hair - it was so long, it went past her shoulders, down her back, and reached down to her butt. She was also rather pretty, and looked rather young - Stinky guessed she couldn't be any older than 27, give or take a year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sizing up the tall woman before her, Stinky gave her a confident smirk and told her, \"Look, <i>Gassy,</i> I'm sure you're <i>super gassy</i> and all, but if there's a queen of farts, then it's me,\" as she pointed a thumb to herself. Sam replied, \"Alright, don't give yourself too much credit - at best, you're a princess, Stinky.\" Stinky looked back at Sam over her shoulder and said, \"Awww, but 'princess' sounds a little too girly, y'know what I mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGassy tilted her head slightly and raised an eyebrow. \"Wait...\" she said, before she trailed off in thought. Stinky turned back to face the tall woman as she was kneeling down in front of her. Gassy continued, \"What did that boy say your name was?\" Stinky was caught a little off-guard, but she didn't show it. \"Well, everybody calls me Stinky - it's just a nickname, though. What, is your name <i>actually</i> Gassy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's eyes widened at Stinky's confirmation, before she leaned towards Stinky with a big smile on her face, this one more welcoming than the last. \"Wait,\" she said in an excited tone, \"then, are you like me?\" Stinky asked back, confused, \"What do you mean, like you?\" putting air quotes around \"like you\" with her fingers. Gassy clarified, \"Your farts! I'm asking if you're super fartsy, like me!\" Stinky was taken aback - the woman came off as confrontational before, almost territorial at the presence of her and Sam. Now, she was positively giddy at the sound of Stinky's nickname.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, I guess you can say I am?\" Stinky said, in an unsure tone. Gassy furled her brow, confused. \"Well,\" she replied, \"are ya or arent'cha?\" Stinky clarified, \"I dunno how gassy you are, dude! You haven't exactly demonstrated your abilities, you know what I mean?\" Gassy raised both her eyebrows, as if she had an epiphany, and responded, \"Oh, of course! Sorry about that!\" and got back up on her feet. \"Check this out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGassy poked her butt out and proceeded to unleash a strong, quaking fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>BBBBRR<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAA</font><font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">AAAAAAAAAAAAPPPP PPPPPP</font><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">PHHHHHHHHHHHHTTTTTTT!!!</font></i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuaking was quite literal in this case, as her gas actually caused the ground to rumble beneath all three of their feet. Stinky spread her legs to get into a stance that allowed her to hold herself up, while Sam grabbed onto a nearby tree. Despite the rumbling, the surrounding area was just as still as it was before, stuck on pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Gassy's fart went on for about thirty seconds, it started to peeter out - Gassy stood back up straight, and smiled proudly. Sam straightened himself out and walked away from the tree he was leaning up against, making his way to Stinky's side. \"Wow...\" he said. \"She... she wasn't kidding - I've never seen anything like that. I've never seen you do anything like that, Stinky.\" Stinky shook her head and replied, \"That's because I never <i>did</i> anything like that,\" and then turned her gaze back up at Gassy. Gassy clasped her hands together happily, and exclaimed, \"So you <i>are</i> like me! That's so awesome! C'mon, now it's your turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam leaned in and whispered into Stinky's ear, \"I dunno how I feel about her, Stinky - she seems... a little <i>too</i> weird. We should just get out of here - look for a way out of the woods and back to town.\" Stinky looked at Sam and whispered back, \"She's pretty out there, yeah, but... I dunno. I have this sorta sinking feeling that we're stuck on pause no matter where we go - if she's been here too, maybe she can help us.\" Sam shook his head and replied, \"She's been stuck here too, for whoever knows how long,\" in a hushed tone. \"If she knew a way out, she wouldn't still be here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you two talking about?\" Gassy asked. Sam and Stinky both darted their gazes up at Gassy, Sam responding, \"Uhm, nothing, Gassy... we're, uh, just talking about a way to get out of here, that's all.\" Gassy nodded her head slightly and replied, \"Oohhhhh... when did you guys end up here?\" There was a moment of silence that fell over the three, as Sam and Stinky looked at each other. Stinky turned back to face Gassy and answer directly, \"About ten minutes ago... I think? My watch says it's been 7:35 AM for a while now, so... yeah, for as long as it's been stuck like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGassy put her hand on her cheek and pondered to herself. \"I see,\" she stated. \"That's not too surprising - that's the way it works here.\" Stinky looked up at Gassy and asked, \"So, you know how this place works then? What even happened here, anyway? Do you know how we ended up here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGassy paused for a moment before replying:</span></div></div>",

Sam and Stinky's eyes both widened, and they turned their heads to face each other, as if to clarify to each other that they did in fact hear what they just heard. Sam turned to face Gassy again and asked, \"So, you <i>own</i> this place? Like, you said it's <i>yours,</i> so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sort of, yeah,\" Gassy replied. \"It's mine in that, I <i>live</i> here, and it was made specifically <i>for</i> me, but... I didn't want it. Not at first, anyway.\" Stinky's expression saddened - she couldn't help but feel bad for the tall woman standing in front of her. At the same time, she was also confused, and after a few seconds passed, she asked Gassy, \"Hold up, hold up... I'm not sure I get it - what the hell is a <i>pocket dimension?</i> I've never heard of it before.\" Sam turned to face Stinky and respond, \"It's this idea that there's places throughout the universe where space and time don't act the same way as they should - you can say they're like anomalies, nobody <i>really</i> knows how they work.\" Gassy nodded, then said, \"He's pretty much got it like a nail on the head - except for the part where nobody knows who to figure them out, anyway.\" Stinky stepped up and asked, \"So, you saying <i>you</i> know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only what I've been told,\" Gassy answered back. She felt relaxed enough that she decided to lower her body and sit down, legs stretched out ahead of her, separating Sam and Stinky between them. \"Some of my people were smart enough to crack the code to how pocket dimensions work, at least little ones,\" Gassy continued. \"They stuffed me in this one a long time ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your people?\" Sam asked. \"So, there's more people like you? All, big and tall?\" Gassy couldn't help but laugh. After she settled down some, she replied, \"I guess you can say that! To us, you guys are just tiny.\" Sam smiled back with a concerned look on his face - he was trying to act friendly, but part of him felt intimidated. He tried his best not to show it. \"S-So...\" he continued, \"where do your people come from, Gassy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The planet Pujitre,\" Gassy replied plainly. \"I'm Pujitran.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam and Stinky were shocked, and once again look to each other to make sure that they weren't just hearing things. Gassy looked confused, and after a few seconds of awkward silence passed, she asked, \"What? What's the big deal? ...You guys not a fan of Pujitrans?\" Stinky raised her hands in front of her and shook them vigorously, stating, \"No, nononono, it's not that! It's just... y-you just said you're an <i>alien!\"</i> Gassy looked at Stinky, and gave her a smirk and a raised eyebrow. \"An alien?\" she chuckled. \"What's that?\" Stinky responded, \"It's... uh... it's someone who's from another planet...\" Gassy laughed again, this time much more amused than before. \"Oh my goodness, <i>that's </i>what you call them? I've always called them outworlders! Alien, huh... how'd you guys come up with that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-That doesn't really matter right now, Gassy!\" Stinky exclaimed. Gassy raised her eyebrows in surprise. \"Well, why not?\" she said with a a casual shrug. Stinky stammered, \"I-It's just that... uhm...\" she looked at Sam for a helping hand. Sam decided to finish Stinky's thought by saying, \"It's just that we don't see aliens very often... if, <i>at all.</i> Our people don't even... <i>believe</i> in aliens - life on other planets.\" Gassy held back laughter, but only for a second or two before she reeled back so hard, she landed on her back, laughing rather historically. \"Oh, that's hilarious!\" she shouted. As she was laughing, she proceeded to let out a few stray farts.<br>\r\n<i><b><br>\r\nBRRRRRRRT!<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">BRRRRRRAAAAAAAPPP!!</font><br>\r\nBRRRR-BRT!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam instinctively covered his nose with both hands, whereas Stinky just stood in place, stunned. She was processing everything that was happening before her eyes. <i>This can't be real, right?</i> She thought to herself. <i>I HAVE to be dreaming!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Gassy calmed down, she laid flat on the ground, legs and arms sprawled out. She waited a moment before she spoke up, saying, \"You two are something else! I can't believe you guys don't believe in outworlders... does your race just <i>not</i> have space travel tech?\" Sam took his hands away from his nose and replied, \"It's, uh, more limited - so far, we've only managed to go to our moon and Mars.\" Gassy sat back up and asked Sam, \"What? The heck is Mars?\" Sam was taken aback by Gassy suddenly sitting right back up, so Stinky answered, \"It's the red planet - fourth one from the Sun?\" Gassy's face lit up as she replied, \"Ohhhh, the Dead Planet! That's cool - you guys find any ruins there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, slow down, slow down!\" Sam shouted. Gassy and Stinky both turned to see Sam catching his breath. After he collected himself, he continued, \"We're getting off-track! Just, tell us how you got here, what this place is, and how we can get out! We don't want to be here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGassy clenched her hand up to her chest, clearly taken aback. \"Sam...\" Stinky said in a hushed tone. After a few more seconds, Gassy replied, \"Y-Yeah, gotcha - sorry, I just got all caught up. You were asking about my pocket dimension, right?\" Sam just silently nodded. Gassy let out a sigh and continued, \"So, the other Pujitrans - well, the scientists anyway - they put in this pocket dimension because they thought I was becoming dangerous. Said my farts were strong - too strong - and that if I continued to stay there, I'd... I'd only bring harm. So, they put me on a shuttle towards Terah, set up this pocket dimension, and left me here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-They can just... <i>do</i> that to you?\" Stinky asked in a sad tone. Gassy replied, re-assuredly, \"Hey, it wasn't like that - it's a little sad to think back on sometimes, but they didn't force me or anything. They just laid out what they were worried about, then gave me the choice of whether or not I wanted to go through with it - even let me pick what planet I wanted to go to, too.\" Stinky asked, \"So, why the whole pocket dimension thing?\" Gassy responded, \"Well, you two have already seen it in action - pocket dimensions are sorta cut off from the rest of space-time, so it looks like everything's still. This is so that nothing can be effected here, not by anything - I can fart as much as I want to, as hard as I want to, and nothing will happen to this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... that's, kinda cool,\" Stinky said. Gassy chuckled and said back, \"Yeah, I thought so too - it can get boring, though. This pocket dimension is only so big, it was just a matter of time before I saw everything.\" Stinky paused for a second or two before she asked, \"How long have you been here?\" Gassy shook her head and answered, \"Ehhh, not like you can really keep track of time in this place - because nothing moves, no time passes. I honestly lost track.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to hear that,\" Sam said, looking up at Gassy. \"I hope it wasn't for too long.\" Gassy looked back at Sam and smiled. A few more seconds passed before Gassy spoke up again, stating, \"So, the thing is, every pocket dimension has a way in, and a way out - there's just no way to make it airtight. You two got in after all, so there has to be a way out. But, I could never find it myself. Best we can do is to wander around until we find it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a chance it's at the same place as the entrance?\" Sam asked. Gassy nodded in response. Stinky looked down and checked her watch and said, \"I didn't notice the time until we reached the Hideout - if we came in through there, then maybe we can get out through there.\" Sam nodded and replied, \"Yeah, retracing our steps might be a good idea.\" Gassy added, \"We could also wander around and see if we stumble upon it - it's your call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStinky thought about it before deciding on:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Stinky raised in eyebrow in confusion. \"<i>School?</i>\" Stinky questioned. \"Sam, you know that school is <i>over,</i> right? It's summer vacation, what are you going to school for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Sam said, before continuing, \"haven't you heard? There's been rumors of something going on at school the past couple of days.\" Stinky shook her head and said, \"No, I haven't heard anything - what did you hear?\" Sam crossed his arms and said, \"I can't say for sure, but that's why I was thinking of going to investigate - apparently, a girl was riding her bike down Addams Street, where the school is, when she <i>swore</i> she saw someone go inside through the front entrance.\" Stinky scratched her head and asked, \"Wait, when did that happen?\" Sam replied, \"It was yesterday afternoon - from what I heard, the girl was on her way back home from the park when she turned and saw this happen.\" Stinky's hands shifted towards her hips as she stated, \"But, school's out - why would <i>anybody</i> be going there?\" Sam pointed at Stinky and exclaimed, \"That's what I was thinking! When I heard that, I figured I had to at least check it out.\" Stinky smiled and rolled her eyes. \"You're such a dork, Sam.\" she told him. Sam just shrugged it off, like he heard her call him that several times before. \"Hey, don't knock it - maybe there really <i>is</i> something there this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sam always sort of fancied himself as a detective,</i> Stinky thought. Sam had a history of picking up rumors and other urban legends he heard in town, and taking it upon himself to see if they were actually true or not. Sam thought that, if he could prove any of them to be true, he'd be a town hero - but, as luck would have it, those rumors and legends were exactly what they sounded like: tall tales and the work of some other kid's over-active imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can join me if you want, Stinky,\" Sam added. \"You can be my partner!\" Stinky didn't even need to think about her response. She replied quickly, \"Of course I'll come with ya - what's a town hero without a sidekick?\" After saying that, Stinky gave Sam a wink and then farted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Brrrrrrrrppp!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam couldn't help but think that Stinky was teasing him a little bit. \"Alright, I know it's likely just a longshot, but ya never know until you try, right?\" Stinky nodded and stated, \"Yeah, I hear ya Sam. No c'mon, let's go already!\" Stinky started running towards the direction of the school, with Sam following shortly behind. \"Hey, wait up!\" he shouted at her. Stinky may not have been as into investigating strange goings-on as Sam was, but she was still always open to help Sam with one of his \"cases.\" To her, it was less about the intrigue and figuring out whether or not what Sam heard was true, and more about a sense of adventure. <i>And hey, two kids going back to school during the Summer? There's a story to be told there!</i> Stinky thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Time: 7:34 AM</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took about 20 minutes or so before Sam and Stinky arrived at the school on foot. They stopped in the school's parking lot to catch their breath, as well as form a plan. \"Alright,\" Sam said, \"before anything else, we gotta find a way in, since it'll be locked up tight. Got any ideas, Stinky?\" </span></div></div>",

Stinky turned to face where the voice was coming from - it was Dylan Gasser, Stinky's long-time farting rival. Unlike her, Dylan wasn't a Stinker, but that didn't stop him from trying to find new ways to get himself to be as gassy as possible, just so he could beat Stinky at what she does best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStinky smirked and replied, \"Heya, Bubble Gut.\" As Dylan walked up to Stinky, she took a look at his appearance. Dylan had short, messy black hair that was swept to his right, and pale green eyes. He was wearing a yellow-and-white striped shirt, along with brown denim shorts, long white socks and black tennis shoes. Nothing about what he was wearing was that remarkable at glance, but what drew Stinky's attention the most was Dylan's stomach - it was big and round, distended in a way that made it look like he was sporting a proud potbelly. This was because of Dylan trying to make himself gassy, it resulted in his stomach being stretched out the more full of flatulence it became. Thankfully, though, it never got any bigger than it already was, probably because Dylan kept farting out all that pent-up hot air he was storing. It made sense, of course - Dylan didn't have total control of his farts like Stinky did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dylan stopped a couple of feet in front of Stinky and said, \"You going somewhere?\" Stinky simply shook her head and said \"Nah, just sorta walking around.

Everyone who knew her always called her \"Belchie\" - like Stinky, Belchie was a Stinker, but she was different in one key aspect. Instead of passing gas by farting, Belchie burped, and burped quite frequently, hence the nickname - her belches were so frequent, in fact, she could do so on command. Given enough focus and swallowed air, Belchie could unleash massive burps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked up to Stinky and knelt down in front of her. \"Guess we got a <i>little</i> Stinker now,\" she said with a rather smarmy smile. Stinky furrowed her brow and quickly replied, \"Buzz off, Bev - I'm in no mood to talk to you right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStinky and Belchie didn't quite get along - unlike her and Dylan, who had a competitive, but otherwise friendly relationship, Stinky and Belchie actively disliked each other. Belchie wasn't quite as tomboyish as Stinky was, and would often hurl insults at her for being \"A little <i>too boyish</i>,\" in her own words. Stinky would often fire back with something along the lines of, \"Yeah, well better than being some stuck-up, preppy girly-girl.\" It was like mixing water and oil - they just didn't mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelchie just put her hands up and replied, \"Easy there, wannabe-a-boy - you too good for a joke?\" Stinky just sighed and answered back, \"Look, it's just... ugh, I dunno, I drank something, and now I'm tiny, OK? Being this short isn't exactly what I wanted out of today, and you making fun of me for it isn't helping.\" Stinky then turned her back on Belchie and crossed her arms. There was an awkward moment of silence before Belchie started holding back laughter. \"Wait, what did you drink?\" she asked Stinky. Stinky turned her head to look at Belchie, past her shoulder, before extending her arm out towards her without a word. In Stinky's hand was the now-empty bottle she just drank from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelchie's face shifted slightly - she was less amused and now more curious. She took the empty bottle from Stinky's hand and gave it a look. \"Where did you get this?\" she asked. Stinky paused before she replied, \"I just found it on the ground.\" Belchie just winced and said, \"You have a habit of just drinking random bottles of stuff you find on the ground?\" Stinky said nothing, she just kept her back turned on Belchie and proceeded to fart in her direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>BRRRRPP!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelchie just waved her hand and replied, \"Yeah, <i>real</i> mature, Lulu.\" Stinky quickly snapped back at her, \"<i>Don't</i> call me that.\" Lulu was the name that Belchie gave Stinky, much in the same way Stinky referred to Belchie as \"Bev.\" She wasn't the only one who called her that, but hearing Belchie say it made it sound so much more condescending in Stinky's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Anyway, I think I might have some good news for ya,\" Belchie said. Stinky looked back at Belchie and asked, \"Wait, really?

You always had a certain way of talking to me like I was some pushover, and I don't take that crap, not one bit.\" Belchie said back in a defensive tone, \"W-Well, maybe you needed someone to put you in your place!

Of course, Stinky never took the time to get to know Belchie much at all, seeing as how they often didn't get along. All while Belchie was talking about this topic, Stinky felt a sense of relief pass over her - as though this was the start of a new phase of their relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--and there's even female wrestlers in other parts of the world too!\" Belchie continued. \"There's this Japanese wrestler, Reika Saiki, and she's really pretty!\" Stinky just continued to lay back in her chair, both her hands behind her head. For a moment, it looked as though Belchie was going to say more on the subject, but she caught herself. \"Sorry,\" she said in a somewhat embarrassed tone. \"I just kinda realized I've been talking your ear off for a while now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStinky shook her head and said, \"Nah, it doesn't bother me anyway - if anything, I feel like I kinda learned something about wrestling from you.\" Belchie just smiled and replied, \"Well, I'm glad... thanks, Lulu, for... listening to me ramble.\" Stinky moved her left head from behind her head and gave Belchie a thumbs up. \"No problem, Bev.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of pause before Stinky added, \"Hey, mind if I ask you a question?\" Belchie nodded. \"So, you said earlier that you didn't really have anybody else to share all this with... why not? Don't you have any guy friends who have similar interests?\" Belchie just sat there in silence for a moment, as if she was trying to carefully choose her words. She said, \"I mean, I <i>do</i> have some boy friends, but... I dunno, I guess I worry they'll think I'm weird if I talk about this stuff.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird, even though you're the Burp Queen?\" Stinky replied, slightly sarcastically. Belchie giggled and responded, \"Hey, I know how gassy I can be - the difference is, unlike you, I have a bit more restraint than you do. I'm a little classier.\" Stinky just laughed and said back, \"Hahahaha, well, I'd rather be super gassy than super classy!\" with a wink. Belchie just sighed and responded with, \"Yes, I know you would... I just, don't quite feel that way. I'm not as open about that stuff as you are, and I'm definitely not as open about what I like. Honestly, I don't know why - I guess I'm just a little embarrassed about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't be embarrassed about what you like,\" Stinky said, matter of fact. \"It's what you like, right? Enjoy it! Screw what other people think about it.\" Belchie raised her eyebrows in surprise, before she smiled back at Stinky. There was a few seconds of silence before Belchie asked Stinky, \"But, is that how you <i>really</i> feel about it?\" Stinky just asked plainly, \"What do you mean?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean... if you don't wanna talk about this, then we don't have to, but...\" Belchie paused, then continued, \"you seemed pretty upset about something earlier - something about what somebody said about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStinky's smile faded from her face pretty quickly after what Belchie said. <i>Oh yeah,</i> she thought. <i>I guess I didn't kinda snap at her, huh? ...I dunno, I'm not that big a fan of talking about this sorta stuff... but, maybe I can tell her about it.

Yeah...I guess I don't really do that often do I?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to her own shock, Belchie found that she hated it, and wanted it to go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Whatever happened, it really affected her, didn't it?</i> She thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be sure to do that more often--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Belchie interrupted, making Stinky jump from shock. \"It's alright, you don't have to...around me at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really?\" Stinky asked. \"But you--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can be more tactful when you're gonna talk about something personal.\" Belchie cut in. \"You listened to me ramble about my love of action and wrestling, so the least I can do is listen and accept what you do or don't do when listening to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStinky didn't know how to reply, but her gratitude was clear as day on her face with a simple smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that affirmation, Belchie smiled back and said, \"Go ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another breath, and this time making sure not to fart when releasing it, Stinky talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll just say it - I have ADD.\" She confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelchie blinked. \"ADD?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention Deficiency Disorder, yeah,\" Stinky said. \"It means I have difficulty focusing sometimes. It's like, my mind races and wanders, and it really started effecting my grades in school - once the doc diagnosed me, my parents did what they could to help, including getting me a prescription, which helped. It wasn't any sorta cure, though, it just helped me focus more without stressing out - before that, though, I found ways to help sorta ease my mind.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Like farting?\" Belchie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Stinky replied. \"How long can I go? What would this combo do, or that combo? How deep can I make one? How silent? How stinky? Can I float? Can I blow someone away? Can I fill a balloon? All of that and more I can focus on and figure out like that.\" She snapped her fingers before looking to the side in embarrassment. \"But stuff like math or science or literature, I ccouldn't give two toots about, even if I tried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I getcha\" Belchie said as she put the pieces together in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStinky continued. \"So every day I go to the school library to try and learn more about the stuff my Mom taught me.\" Stinky said. \"Then one kid came up to me one day and said, <i>'Hey, you finally farted your brains out?'</i> At first I ignored him, 'cause it's just one kid.\" Stinky scowled at the table. \"But then another kid said something similar, and then another, and then another, <i>and then another,</i> until they just kept saying stuff like that over and over again, everyday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelchie stayed silent as Stinky looked at her nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she said, \"Promise not to laugh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelchie's jaw dropped at that. \"What?\" She gasped, completely shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise not to laugh?\" Stinky asked sincerely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelchie replied, \"Cross my heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of silence followed before Stinky said, \"I almost quit farting because of all that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then--</span></div></div>",

Stinky's eyes widened almost immediately, as she knew exactly what to expect from a gesture like that. So, she closed her eyes and closed her mouth as she tucked her body into a tight ball and rolled herself away from the wall she was sitting up against, just in time to miss Aggie's large, powerful fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>BRRRRRRRRRMMMMMMPPPPPPPPTTT!!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Aggie farted, Stinky stopped rolling, and uncurled her body, landing on both her feet and one hand - without even really processing it, Stinky was more agile than she was normally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what the hell, man?\" Stinky said at Aggie. \"This how you say hello to <i>everybody?</i>\" Aggie then stood up straight and turned to face Stinky, all while giggling to herself. She put her hand on her hip and replied, \"Only to the <i>Stinkers,</i> if you just gotta know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thanks for at least telling me your name first, before you just shoved your butt in my direction,\" Stinky responded, with a sarcastic smirk. Aggie exclaimed, \"Oooooo, fiery - I like that in a competitor!\" Stinky stood up on both her feet, after pushing herself up off the hand she was putting her weight onto. \"Y'know, if you just wanted a fart-off, you coulda just <i>asked,</i>\" Stinky stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but that wouldn't be much fun,\" Aggie replied. \"Where's the fun in out-farting another Stinker if they're expecting it? Rather catch them off-guard and surprise them!\" Stinky just chuckled, \"Yeah, well then try and not announce yourself first, dumbass.\" Aggie's face shifted to a more annoyed expression. \"Hey now, that's rude,\" she replied. \"No need for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well sorry, not sorry,\" Stinky said directly. \"I'm in a <i>bad mood,</i> and I don't plan on just entertaining you right now - you wanna fart-off, then tell me what time and place you want, but not today, OK?\" Aggie just stood there in silence, as if she was trying to get a read on Stinky. After a few seconds, she sat down and spread her legs in a casual fashion, and replied, \"Alright, alright - clearly sis pissed ya off. I won't add any more fuel to <i>that</i> fire.\" Stinky crossed her arms and asked, \"Who the hell is your <i>sis,</i> anyway? You say that like I should know who that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, shoulda figured she didn't tell ya about me,\" Aggie responded. \"I meant Beverly - y'know, the girl in the library you were just with.\" Stinky's eyes widened. \"Wait, you were there?\" Aggie nodded, then continued, \"I saw you storm out of the entrance, and she was following behind ya - guess she musta pissed you off again, huh?\" Stinky just looked away and said quietly, \"Yeah, you can say that...\" before turning back to face Aggie and asking, \"So, she's your sister?\" Aggie nodded once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, more like my <i>step-sister,</i>\" she clarified. \"My dad married her mom, that sorta thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TMI,\" Stinky said bluntly. \"I don't really care about all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAggie just laughed, rather loudly. \"Hahahahaha! I like your style! You always like this?\" Stinky shrugged. \"Only when I'm having a bad day,\" she replied. Aggie paused for a moment before saying, \"Yeah, I was gonna say - I didn't recognize ya at first, what with you being so teeny-tiny now.\" Stinky put her hands on her hips and said, \"Hey, back off, alright? This whole thing is none of your business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm just saying, it's not like happens everyday,\" Aggie said with a smile. \"So, where were we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStinky put her hands in her pockets. \"You wanted a fart-off. I'm telling you, I'm in no mood for one.\" Aggie got up on one knee as she said, \"Well, I think you're forgetting something... I didn't <i>ask</i> for one to begin with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAggie then lunged her body towards Stinky, mouth closed and cheeks puffed. Stinky stumbled back in shock. <i>What the hell?!</i> she thought. <i>What is WITH this girl?</i> Once Aggie was about a foot away from Stinky's face, she let out a large belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>*BUUUURRRRAAAAP!*</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Aggie flopped her body on the ground in front of Stinky, Stinky instinctively covered her nose. <i>A Belcher AND a Farter, huh?</i> she said to herself. <i>Guess this girl likes to go all out - no rules, no holds-barred, either. This isn't the kinda competition I'm used to - it's more like a straight up fight!</i> Stinky then looked down at Aggie, face down in front of her on the ground, and thought, <i>Well, two can play at that game!</i> Still covering her mouth, Stinky turned her back towards Aggie, then proceeded to unleash a large fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>BBRRRRRAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPT!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was large and powerful enough to push Aggie away, but without lifting her off the ground. Stinky uncovered her face and deiced to make a break for it - she ran pretty fast before earlier, so she figured she could get away from Aggie that way. Without much more thought, Stinky made a dash in front of her, away from Aggie, who was just starting to get up off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, get back here!\" Aggie shouted at Stinky from behind. \"We were just getting started!\" Stinky didn't say anything, and only proceeded to run, all while she heard Aggie's voice grow quiet behind her. \"This isn't the end of this, Stinky! I'll find you, and we <i>will</i> finish this today, you hear me? One of us is gonna knock the other out, and it's gonna be <i>me!\"<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------<br>\r\n<u><b><br>\r\nTime: 8:31 AM</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStinky just kept running and running, her mind racing from everything that had just happened. <i>Ugh, why did today have to be such a pain in the ass?</i> she thought. <i>First Bev, no this Aggie girl? Not to mention I'm a total shrimp now - how could this get any worse?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, while lost in her thoughts, Stinky ran into someone, bumping into their leg, and falling back down on her butt. \"Oh, <i>come on!</i>\" she shouted. \"Can't you just look where you're going?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stinky?\" said the person she ran into.

Stinky just shook her head and said, \"Oh, don't worry about it - this will wear off in, like, a few hours.\" Sam stood there and stared. \"Wait, how do you kno-- actually, forget it,\" Sam stated. \"What happened? Sounds like something's got you upset.\" Stinky put her hands in her pockets and looked up at Sam. \"I, uh... I don't wanna talk about it right now, Sam - just, not right now.\" Sam didn't say anything for a few seconds, then nodded silently. \"OK... but, when you do feel like it, you can tell me, alright? I just wanna make sure you're doing good.\" Stinky chuckled, \"<i>I know,</i> Sam - you always say that.\" Sam laughed back, \"Well, I always <i>mean it.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two decided to walk next to each other - Sam told Stinky that he was going towards their hideout in the woods just on the outskirts of town, hoping to meet Stinky there, since she wasn't at home. Stinky didn't have anywhere else she wanted to go, and she felt better being away from the plaza for the time being - away from Beverly and Aggie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two carried on with light conversation, before Sam asked, \"So, mind telling me <i>why</i> you're so short?\" Stinky just sighed, and smiled back at Sam. \"Yeah, I guess I better tell ya, huh?\" she replied. \"You're gonna think this was stupid - and it was - but I found this bottle on the ground and decided to drink what was in it.\" Sam couldn't help but chuckle. \"Couldn't help yourself, huh?\" Stinky shook her head and said, \"Couldn't help myself - I figured, what could go wrong, and then, shortly after drinking it, I realized I got all tiny. I didn't find out until after the fact that the bottle said <i>Shrink Drink</i> on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch. Would have been a good idea to read that <i>first,</i>\" Sam said, jokingly. Stinky just looked up at Sam with a raised eyebrow and said, \"<i>I know,</i> but... whatever, can't change it now.\" Sam replied, \"Yeah, fair enough - I assume the bottle was labeled though. Did it also say how long it would last?\" Stinky nodded. \"Six whole hours - I drank the thing like an hour ago, so I guess it's just five hours now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you just found it, lying on the ground?\" Sam asked. Stinky gave Sam a confused expression. \"Yeah, why?\" Sam then stopped in his tracks, Stinky stopping shortly after. Sam replied, \"Well, I'm not sure why anyone would just leave something like that, y'know? I mean, <i>an empty bottle,</i> sure, but why leave it full?\" Stinky didn't give it much thought until now. \"Oh yeah... that's a good point. That didn't even hit me until just now.\" Sam put his hands on his sides and remarked, \"Well, what would you do without me?\" with a sarcastic smile. Stinky couldn't help but laugh a little at Sam's response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna look into it more?\" Sam asked. Stinky asked back, \"Look into what?\" Sam pointed at Stinky and confirmed, \"That Shrink Drink thing you drank earlier - maybe we can go around and ask about that, see if anybody knows about it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, it's gonna wear off in a few hours - why not just wait?\" Stinky said. Sam raised both his eyebrows in slight surprise. \"I thought you were always down for this kinda stuff - going on adventures. What's gotten into you today?\" Stinky paused for a moment before she said, \"Well... ah hell, I dunno. You're right, that does sound like a fun idea.\" Sam smiled at Stinky. \"That's good to hear - so, we should start looking for clues, then. Did the label say anything else on it? Like, where it could have come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno - I don't even have the bottle right now,\" Stinky replied. Sam scratched his head and said, \"Alright, great start - do you at least remember where you found it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStinky rubbed her hand on her chin. <i>Let's see...</i> she thought. <i>I was walking down the sidewalk by my house, and that's when I saw Bev.

She didn't feel like she had to give it her all, just to open a door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arcade was lively as it usually was - while not the most bustling arcade imaginable, it was usually a guarantee that at least a dozen kids were there for most of the day, if only because it was a cheap arcade, with simple arcade machines that only needed a couple quarters to play, at most. It was a small, local arcade though, so even if a dozen kids didn't seem like a lot, it felt like a lot, with how they would easily fill space within the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Sam was taller, he quickly scanned the vicinity, trying to look for anyone he knew.

Odd - so, does soda do <i>anything </i>for ya, then?\" Belchie assured, \"Oh, it does, just not as much as you may think - if I really wanted to belt out something big, I'd still have to drink a bunch of soda, all at once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha,\" Stinky said.

Aggie, however, appeared to be very chipper. \"Heeeeeey, sis! How are ya doing? The little squirt tucker herself out on ya or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aggie, go away - now is <i>not the time</i> for this,\" Belchie replied tersely. Aggie's smile only grew, as if she took it as invitation. She stepped closer towards Belchie and shifted her gaze towards Stinky lying there next to her. \"So, what? You knock her out, or--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I did <i>not</i> knock her out,\" Belchie interrupted. \"She... she knocked herself out, somehow.\" Aggie held back laughter, but a snicker or two slipped out regardless. \"Oh, c'mon, you're telling me that <i>Stinky</i> of all people knocked herself out with that piddly little squeaker?\" Belchie turned quickly towards Aggie and replied, \"You didn't hear what she said - she... this one was different, somehow.\" Aggie just raised an eyebrow. Belchie continued, \"Look, if you're not gonna help, can you just go, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, have ya tried slapping her awake?\" Aggie said. Belchie just sneered at Aggie. Aggie shrugged her shoulders and said, \"What, I'm serious - she's knocked out, she's not in a <i>coma.</i> Just slap her awake.\" Belchie shook her head. \"No, Aggie, I'm not doing that.\" Aggie just rolled her eyes, replied, \"Fiiiine, I'll do it,\" then walked up towards Belchie and knelt down next to her. Before Belchie could respond, Aggie swiftly slapped Stinky's face, just hard enough to jolt her awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStinky's eyes flashed open, and she quickly sat up. \"Whoa...\" she said softly. She turned to Belchie and asked, \"Bev, what happened? Was I out long?\" Belchie paused, then shook her head. \"No,\" she assured, \"you were only out for about a minute or so - you sorta, well, <i>knocked yourself out.</i>\" Stinky's eyebrows shot up. \"What?! Now way, you can't be serious! Look, it was some pretty bad gas, but it was not <i>that</i> bad - how could it knock me out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAggie just snickered to herself. \"Oh, this is <i>priceless,</i>\" she exclaimed. \"First you're a newborn midget, and now you knock yourself out with your own farts - you're really off your game today, huh?\" Stinky immediately shifted her gaze towards Aggie and replied, \"Oh, shut up! I don't need you butting in! What do you even want, anyway, a rematch? I already told ya, I am. Not. <i>Interested.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAggie threw her hands up in front of her and said back, \"Hey-hey, slow your roll there, little buddy - I'm not here for a rematch. Honestly, even if I was, it wouldn't be satisfying - I wanna try and beat ya at your best, and with you having a hard time with your <i>own</i> gas? Forget it.\" Belchie and Stinky both looked confused - they both turned to face each other, one eye brow raised. They turned back to face Aggie, and then Belchie asked, \"So, then what <i>are</i> you here for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAggie stood straight up and looked down at both of the girls sitting on the ground in front of her. \"Simple: I wanna help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStinky's eyes widened. \"Help? With what, <i>this?</i> Listen, <i>this</i> is only temporary, and it'll wear off, so if you don't mind, can you just leave--\" but before she could finish, Aggie interrupted her and continued, \"I know that, <i>pipsqueak,</i> but lemme explain!\" Aggie sighed and then extended an open hand towards Belchie. \"Sis, can you hand me that bottle?\" Belchie took the bottle out of her bag and placed it in Aggie's hand. Aggie then raised the bottle up next to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, listen up - I know the guy who makes these lil' potions here. I can hook you up with him, and he can give you something that should help ya get back to normal in no time.\" Stinky got up and stood straight, a skeptical look on her face. \"Wait, seriously? You <i>know</i> the guy who made that?\" Aggie nodded. \"Yeah, name's Chemsy Elttob - weird name, I know - he's a weird old kook who lives somewhere deep in the alleyways. Real back-alley stuff, that's where his store is.\" Belchie stood up and stepped towards Aggie, and asked directly, \"Why do you work for some weirdo who works out of some alley?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis, calm down, it's nothing serious,\" Aggie assured. \"His stuff doesn't hurt ya, it just does weird things to ya - doctors just don't like it, because they don't understand it.\" Belchie narrowed her eyes and replied, \"That the pitch he gave ya?\" Aggie rolled her eyes. \"<i>Yes,</i> but I also know from trying it out myself - it's thanks to him, I get access to drinks that give me and my gas a little... boost, you could say.\" Belchie couldn't believe what she was hearing. \"Sis, you <i>tried</i> that stuff?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, it doesn't hurt ya!\" Aggie yelled back. \"Besides, don't take my word for it, take Stinky's here. Yeah she's having a couple o'side effects, but she's <i>fine</i> otherwise. Listen, not my point.\" Aggie continued, this time turning to face Stinky. \"I can bring ya over to Chemsy, and I'll ask him if he can give ya something to reverse the effects of whatever you drank, alright? If I show him the bottle, he should know what to do.\" Stinky put her hands on her hips. \"OK... but what do you want in exchange?\" Aggie smiled. \"Hey, you catch on quick - alright, I'll tell it to ya straight: I'm not just gonna do this for free. You don't gotta pay me, but I'm gonna ask you to return the favor - after I take ya to Chemsy, you and me, <i>we gotta have our rematch.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStinky nodded, \"Yeah, that's about what I expected.\" Aggie laughed and replied, \"Well, hey, at least we're on the same page!\" Belchie interjected, \"Well, that's stupid! This effect will wear off in a few hours anyway, right? She can just wait that long, and not have to bother with you.\" Aggie waved her finger and replied, \"Not your choice to make, sis - that's up to our little friend here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you <i>please</i> stop calling me 'little,' already? Gets on my nerves,\" Stinky stated. She then put her hand on her chin, and gave it some thought. <i>Hmmmm. Let's see, what do I wanna do?</i></span></div></div>",

I'm not gonna let you drag my butt to some alley for nothing.\" Aggie just chuckled, and said back to Stinky, \"Fair enough, short stuff! We can settle the terms of our rematch after Chemsy's done helping ya out. Now, follow me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a hitch, Aggie quickly turned her body right around and then started walking away from Belchie and Stinky, who quickly followed behind her. \"Just don't gas us out before we get there, OK?\" Belchie said. Aggie looked over her shoulder and responded, \"Wouldn't dream of it - I'm holding it in just fine. Wanna make sure my tank's full for the duel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Time: 9:42 AM</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time it took to get to where Aggie was leading Stinky and Belchie took longer than Stinky expected - the walk from the gym to Chemsy's alley shop took over a half-hour so far. During the walk, Aggie and Belchie would bicker among themselves - it consisted mostly of Belchie bemoaning Aggie for working for such a strange individual, and Aggie arguing back that nothing happened, among other things the two would argue about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStinky didn't involve herself in those conversations, and just kept quiet - she figured getting involved would just lead to nothing but headaches. One thing she <i>did</i> notice was how Aggie wasn't so much as <i>tooting</i> at all - no belches, either. <i>Huh,</i> she thought to herself, <i>guess Aggie's serious about me going up against her - I just hope she isn't just making this guy up just to knock me out in some alleyway... actually, whose to say that's NOT what's she's doing? Maybe this is all a trap or something. I should probably ask her for some details about this guy.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStinky finally spoke up for the first time since the three girls started their walk, and asked Aggie, \"Hey, Agg - this <i>Chemsy</i> guy... what's he like?\" Aggie just looked over her shoulder at Stinky and replied, \"Care to elaborate?\" Stinky took her hands out of her pockets and put them on her hips. \"Look, I've never met this guy before - clearly you know more about him than I do, so I'd like to know what's he's like before I meet him.\" Aggie paused, then smirked. \"Yeah, OK - I should letcha know what the geezer's like. Well, to start, I <i>call</i> him a geezer, but the old fart's not really that old - he's like 60-something, if I had to take a guess. He's tall, scrawny, and has a scar on his right eye, underneath an eye-patch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An eyepatch?\" Stinky questioned. \"He sounds like some sorta pirate - he got a peg leg too?\" Aggie just laughed. \"No, no, no peg leg - no funny hat, either. Just the eye-patch. He does have short, shaggy hair, and a mustache though. Oh yeah, and he also wears a robe, like, all the time.\" Stinky paused, then continued asking, \"OK, so is he a doctor or something? How'd he start getting into making weird potions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, he never told me,\" Aggie said bluntly. \"I wanted to know that too, but he told me it was some secret.\" Stinky started thinking to herself, <i>Well, THAT'S suspicious.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you meet this guy, anyway?\" Stinky asked. Aggie paused for several seconds before she responded, \"Well, I'd rather he'd tell ya - it's too embarrassing for me to say.\" Stinky stopped walking and then yelled, \"Oh, that's convenient!\" Belchie and Aggie both stopped and turned to face Stinky, with Aggie replying, \"What's your problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My <i>problem</i> is that I'm not even sure this Chemsy guy is legit!\" Stinky exclaimed. \"It's awfully strange how there's this guy in some alley who knows exactly what to do to cure my little height problem, and you would know where we can find him, isn't it?\" Belchie then turned to Aggie and said, \"Yeah... not to mention, Stinky just found that bottle on the sidewalk. How do you explain that?\" Aggie looked surprised. \"Sidewalk? Where, which sidewalk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The sidewalk by my house,\" Stinky replied. \"I was taking a walk, and that's when I found it, just lying there.\" Aggie's eyebrows shot up. \"Wait,\" she said, \"Where is your house?\" Stinky just raised an eyebrow and replied, \"Over by Bluestream Street - why?\" Almost immediately after that response, Aggie's eyes widened, and she shouted, \"Ohhhh, <i>shit!</i> THAT'S why I couldn't find it! I thought I just forgot to grab it, like some <i>idiot!</i>\" Stinky and Belchie reeled back slightly, both shocked at Aggie's reaction. Belchie asked, \"Aggie, what's going on?\" Aggie took a deep breath and replied, \"I was making a delivery to one of Chemsy's customers - my route went past there, on Bluestream. I put my box down for a minute, so I could get some pebbles outta my shoe, and right when I was about to pick it up, some stupid kid knocked the box over while he was riding his skateboard!\" Aggie paused to take another deep breath, before she continued, \"I <i>thought </i>I got all of them back in there, but by the time I met up with the customer, he said there was one missing! I tried going back to look for it where that kicked knocked it all over, but there was nothing there - so you're saying that was you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStinky nodded and said, \"Yeah, I guess it was me.\" Aggie put her hands on her face, and couldn't help but push out a large fart in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>BBBRRRRR-BBBRRRAAAAAP!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" she shouted. \"Now Chemsy's gonna chew me out for this too... ugh, whatever - once we get there, I'll explain what happened, and you can tell your side of the story. Right now, I just wanna get there, and get this over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAggie turned and starting walking, but this time, she started farting again - she clearly stopped caring about holding it in after that. Stinky and Belchie just followed far behind Aggie, without saying another word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------<br>\r\n<u><b><br>\r\nTime: 9:59 AM</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls finally made their way to the alleyway Aggie had mentioned - it was between a drugstore and a laundromat, but continued down past them for several feet. Aggie stopped and said, \"Alright, we're here - I'll go on ahead, since I know the code, and then you three can enter after me.\" Stinky and Belchie just nodded, and followed after Aggie. After entering the alleyway, they continued up until they reached and right turn, which Aggie took without a second thought. Continuing farther down the alleyway, at the end was a single door, with a keypad on it - Aggie went up to it and started punching in the number combination right away. After a click and a beep followed suit, she opened the door, and motioned the two others to go inside. Once Stinky and Belchie entered the door, Aggie followed, and closed it behind them. The room the girls found themselves in was bigger than they thought it would be, but well lit, thanks to both the fluorescent bulbs, and the sunlight peering through the blinds on the windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just them, however - no sign of this Chemsy character. Stinky was just about to ask where he was, but that was when Aggie belched loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"*UUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPP!*\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStinky quickly turned and asked, \"What did you do that for?\" Aggie snickered and replied, \"Oh yeah, that's how I let the old man know it's me.\" Right after her response, the three girls heard shuffling coming from another room, followed by the sounds of footsteps entering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh, Aggie!\" said the man who had walked in. \"What are you doing here? ...Who are these two? They your friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStinky couldn't believe it at first, but the man in front of her matched the description Aggie gave almost perfectly - a tall, scrawny, 60-year-old man with a scar one his right eye, obscured somewhat by an eyepatch. He was also wearing a large, white short sleeved t-shirt that was clearly too big for him, with a design that looked like a cartoon dog, and some jeans. No shoes or socks, though, just barefoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, Chem,\" Aggie replied. \"These two are Stinky and Beverly - Bev's my sister, and Stinky's the pipsqueak.\" Stinky immediately turned her head upwards to look back at Aggie and respond, \"Hey, I said quit it with the short comments, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChemsy replied, \"What made you bring them here? This better be important!\" Aggie stepped up and said, \"It is, Chem, I promise - so, Stinky here, she's actually the one who drank your Shrink Drink. Remember when I said I lost it? Well, she found it and drank it.\" Chemsy paused, and them looked down at Stinky. He took a few moments before replying, \"Well... at least I know now that it works.\" He knelt down and asked Stinky, \"Any side effects there, young lady?\" Stinky just shrugged her shoulders and said, \"Eh, just some gas, but, that';s nothing new for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChemsy chuckled under his breath. \"Alright, well there's that mystery solved - and here I thought it had been stolen! Thank you for telling me this, Aggie, but you really need to be more careful next time.\" Aggie just nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChemsy added, \"So, what brings you all here to my humble little Potion Shoppe?\"</span></div></div>",

        "created":1593396720,
        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Thank you for reading and taking part in this Interactive Story - this is an idea I've had for some time, about a character that I came up with back in Middle School. This is the premise:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElueze Robins is an 11-year-old girl who happens to be a Stinker - a Stinker is someone born with the strange ability to produce and control their own natural gas. Elueze loves having this ability, as she uses it to not only fart at will, but to also do other things with her gas as well - because of this, she's more commonly known in her hometown as <i>\"Stinky.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStinky is an out-and-proud tomboy, and makes that known to whoever she meets. Stinky is energetic and often crude, but she is also open and friendly - she's the kind of girl who knows exactly who she is, and doesn't care to hide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStinky is the central character of this story, but she is not the only key character - there are both of her parents, her best friend, and finally, her rival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStinky's mother is Helena Robins, and her father is Johnathon Robins. The two have been married for 13 years, and Stinky is their only child. Helena stays at home to help clean the house and take care of Stinky, while Johnathon works as a police officer during the day. Stinky's relationship with both of her parents is happy and healthy, but they are not without their occasional fights - Helena in particular is sometimes hard on Stinky for being too excessive with her farting. As for Johnathon, he disciplines his daughter as best he can, but he's still there for Stinky when she needs him most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStinky's best friend is a 12-year-old boy named Samuel Rosio. Sam's mother and biological father separated years ago, and Sam doesn't even remember what his father looks like. Thankfully, he and his mom are not alone - Sam's mother, Allison, married a Hispanic man named Julian, hence Sam's last name being Rosio. Sam and Stinky have known each other since they were toddlers, and get along well, despite how different they are from each other - unlike Stinky, Sam is more calm and polite than her, and will occasionally point out when she's being a bit too much. He's also more sarcastic than Stinky is on average, resulting in Sam coming of as occasionally jaded, but still a very overall happy boy. Sam and Stinky care for each other very much, and neither of them can imagine what their lives would be like without the other in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there's Dylan Gasser, Stinky's rival - Dylan is also 11 years old, though he is not a Stinker like Stinky is, but that doesn't stop him from trying to out-gas her at every opportunity, doing what he can to make himself fart as much as possible. Dylan is much more snarky than Stinky is, and also more competitive, but also driven and determined when he sets his mind to something. Dylan and Stinky may not get along quite as well as she and Sam do, but they still maintain a friendly rivalry with each other all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for other characters, that's up to you to decide - during this one day in Stinky's life, you can give her the chance to meet all sorts of new people she had never seen before, or establish relationships with people in her hometown I never even considered. As the story begins, Stinky will start off the day like normal, but through of choices you make as you read, you can have Stinky go on one of many different kinds of crazy adventures! Keep in mind, <i>each of these stories must take place within one day, and once that day is up, the story must end.</i> what happened the day before, or what will happen the day after are not a factor here - this day in Stinky's life is an isolated moment, where anything can happen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>ATTENTION: This story is rated 13+ - while some language and mild suggestive elements are allowed, absolutely NO SEXUAL CONTENT is permitted. The main character of this story is only a child, and thus, any chapter submitted that results in her doing something sexual in nature will be removed. Other questionable content will be removed per my discretion - this story is not at all intended to be something that pertains to a certain fetish or kink, but something light-hearted, fun, and dumb. Feel free to read if you wish, but if you want to add your own chapters to this story, please respect and adhere to these strict guidelines. Anything else is fair game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will make the occasional edit, either in regards to spelling or grammatical errors, as well as small changes in dialogue so that each character <i>stays</i> in-character, as much as possible. With that said, thank you taking the time to read this outline, and please enjoy A Day in the Life of Stinky!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
