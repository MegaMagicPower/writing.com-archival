Send them in!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Majesty\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBradley waddled down the red and blue runner carpet, away from the gigantic, royal dais and beckoned to a sentry outside. He waved a wooden staff and two figures entered the throne room, both dressed in white. They waddled up the aisle and stopped at the bottom of the enormous, gleaming, ivory cream-coloured dais of polished stone. They knelt and bowed their heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are my last audience of the day\", said the king, sweeping his blonde hair back from around his eyes. \"Isn't that so, Brad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" the king's manservant fumbled with a sheet of parchment in his hands, \"Um...yes sir! Last one for the day, sir!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! So let's make this quick, shall we? What is it that you're here for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Majesty! We come bearing our monthly samplers, your Majesty\", said Reginald, a very fat man with light brown hair, wearing a white uniform and cap. It was here that the king noticed, the man was carrying elaborately carved wooden boxes in his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Excellent! I've been waiting for these! Put them down, Reggie! They must be heavy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Each casket is four pounds of my finest, your Majesty\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king laughed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My goodness! Well, your labours will certainly be rewarded by my appreciation! You may leave this here...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king tapped the uppermost casket with his walking-stick. \"And take the second to the Queen...now young Roland...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoland waddled forwards. He was a stout, ten-year-old youth with a full, round belly. He weighed a solid 250 pounds and had darker brown hair, like his mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will take these two caskets...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king pointed to the last two wooden boxes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...to the Princes' Suite. I'm sure they'll be waiting over eagerly for them!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Majesty!\" said the boy at once, his chubby face breaking out into smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king smirked, \"I thought so! Go on, boy! But don't rush! Don't want you breaking anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Majesty! Yes, Majesty!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBradley chuckled as the boy bent over, picked up the two wooden boxes, bowed, and waddled out of the throne room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fine boy you've got there, Reggie\", he said. Reginald smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! He's taking after his father, and he has excellent skills at the craft!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely\", said the king. \"You must be very proud! He is following a noble profession!\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReginald blushed, \"Indeed, Majesty\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king chuckled. \"Now!...Let's see what's inside here, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChandler opened the wooden casket and a rich, tantalizing smell wafted forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four pounds of your finest chocolates, eh, Reginald? Excellent...come along, Brad, help yourself...\" </span></div></div>",

After doing up the leather straps and buckles that held their armour on, the two handsome young princes shuffled down the corridor to another suite, where the fat princes were being prepared for their outing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's your shoes done, Master!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Mason!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here's your stick, Master!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Maxy...alright, I think I'm ready!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a minute!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMason shuffled forwards.

Like his brother, he was dressed in leather slippers, a silken cloak and a soft, woolen cap in red and blue, and carried a stout, silver-topped walking-stick. Neither prince was slim enough to require anything else to 'cover' themselves up, and were used to going out like this...especially in the summertime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Cameron, his two servant-boys Mason and Max, and his brother Edmund, and his two servants, Wilbur and Samson, were all ready to go. A carriage parked outside the palace entrance would drive them into town, with Tiberius and Taurus riding along on the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You boys be careful out there!\" said their father, when he spotted them waddling past the throne-room door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes papa!\" said Edmund, \"C'mon Cameron, or we'll be late!\"</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Separated from each other by great rivers, vast mountain ranges, and enormous, valleys and fjords, the four great kingdoms have coexisted peacefully since the very dawn of time. But which kingdom is right for you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Setting:</b> The Four Kingdoms exist in a High Medieval-Renaissance Fantasy setting, roughly equivalent to 1300AD - 1600AD. </u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>The Kingdom of Arvinia</b></u> - Greed, gluttony, hedonism, obesity and weight-gain! For the average Arvinian, too much is never enough, and the creed of this ancient and prosperous kingdom is Gula et Voluptatum - Gluttony &amp; Hedonsim! Everybody from the smallest child to the largest of full-grown adults embrace a culture of feeding, gaining, obesity and good living, the likes of which the other kingdoms have rarely imagined. Rivers and vast farmlands allow for abundant and limitless foods and drinks for all! Arvinians of all ages range from plump, to chubby, to obese, to virtually immobile, but men are generally taller than women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ruling Family:</b> <u>The Ancient and Immense House of Regia.</u> <br>\r\n<i>King Chandler the Immense.</i> 8,000lbs. 7'0\". 30 years old. Blonde hair, blue eyes. <br>\r\n<i>Queen Regina.</i> 5,000lbs. 5'9\". 28 years old. Brown hair, brown eyes. <br>\r\n<i>Crown Prince Cameron.</i> 1,500lbs. 5'6\". 12 years old. Blonde hair, blue eyes. <br>\r\n<i>Prince Edmund.</i> 1,300lbs. 5'6\". 12 years old. Brown hair, green eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>The Kingdom of Mountania</b></u> - Strength, warfare, industry and great craftsmanship, Mountania prides itself on its fine woodworking, stonemasonry, jewelry and mining. Mountanians stand tall and proud - both literally and figuratively. The tallest, strongest and most bulked-out of all the citizenry of the Four Kingdoms, Mountania provides much of the military protection for its noble and proud neighbours, in return for trading rights and special concessions. Mountain men and boys are much taller and heavier than average men and boys in other countries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ruling Family:</b> <u>The Royal House of Vuurden.</u> <br>\r\n<i>King Albion the Great.</i> 3,000lbs. 7'6\". 30 years old. Brown hair, brown eyes. <br>\r\n<i>Queen Lucille.</i> 170lbs. 5'9\". 28 years old. Blonde hair, blue eyes. <br>\r\n<i>Crown Prince Gabriel.</i> 500lbs. 6'9\". 15 years old. Golden-brown hair, brown eyes.<br>\r\n<i>Princess Sophia.</i> 100lbs. 5ft tall. 10 years old. Blonde hair, blue eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Prince Bastion.</i> 7'6\". 28 years old. Brown hair, brown eyes. <br>\r\n<i>Princess Elvina.</i> 6'3\". 27 years old. Blonde hair. Blue eyes. <br>\r\n<i>Prince Tiberius.</i> 300lbs. 6ft tall. 12 years old. Blonde hair, blue eyes. <br>\r\n<i>Prince Taurus.</i> 280lbs. 6ft tall. 12 years old. Golden-brown hair, brown eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrince Bastion, his wife Princess Elvina, and their two sons, live in the Arvinian royal palace, as Mountanian ambassadors to the Kingdom of Adiposia. They are close friends with the Arvinian royal family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>The Kingdom of Fantasia</b></u> - Magic and wonderment, spellcasting and alchemy, Fantasia prides itself on its mastery of the mystic arts. Spells, potions, enchanted and magical objects, magical creatures, magical experimentation, and the recording of knowledge are all highly regarded in Fantasia! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ruling Family:</b> <u>The Ancient House of Albreon.</u><br>\r\n<i>King Zelthran the Magnificent.</i> 250lbs. 6'9\", 50 years old. White hair, green eyes. <br>\r\n<i>Crown Prince Cyrus.</i> 200lbs. 6'. 30 years old. Brown hair, green eyes. <br>\r\n<i>Prince Orion.</i> 350lbs. 5'6\". 12 years old. Light brown hair, green eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>The Kingdom of Salacia</b></u> - Much like Arvinia, Salacia is a land of shameless excesses and hedonism. Whereas Arvinia concentrates on the pleasures of food, drink, gluttony and obesity, Salacia is all about more...earthly pleasures. Sexual hedonism, fetishistic pleasures and all kinds of kinks and perversions reign supreme! Almost anything goes, and almost nothing is too taboo! Casual sex and teenage pregnancies are so common as to be almost non-entities! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ruling Family:</b> <u>The Seductive House of Maxima </u><br>\r\n<i>King Thorus the Great.</i> 4,000lbs. 7'6\". 32 years old. Golden-brown hair, brown eyes. <br>\r\n<i>Queen Susanna.</i> 250lbs. 6'9\". 28 years old. Golden blonde hair, blue eyes. <br>\r\n<i>Crown Prince Thorwald.</i> 200lbs. 6'3\". 16 years old. Golden-brown hair, brown eyes. </td>",
