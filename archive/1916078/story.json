Tell \u2018er I said sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe <i>paid</i> you! It\u2019s hard <i>enough</i> to go to college on minimum wage at <i>best</i>, and you\u2019re just gonna take her money?\u201d Alan\u2019s brow furrowed deeper; despite his distance from the phone, his sister\u2019s voice remained ear-piercingly shrill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not a goddamn <i>monster</i> Violet, Christ. I\u2019ll give her the fee back.\u201d Alan fished his subway card out of his wallet and waved it across the turnstile\u2019s sensor, looking around the station once or twice. Empty, thank God. \u201cMaybe give her a nice card, too.\u201d he joked, trying to lighten the mood. He winced at the strangled squeak the returned. That didn\u2019t go over well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, she doesn\u2019t need well wishes, you asshole!\u201d Alan opened his mouth to protest but almost immediately thought better of it. \u201cShe needs a tutor!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan\u2019s frustration reached a zenith. \u201cShe needs Albert-goddamn-Einstein!\u201d His shout echoed off the station\u2019s pillars. \u201cShe\u2019s unteachable, and she\u2019s a <i>moron</i>! God knows how she got out of high school! God knows how she\u2019s able to <i>tie her shoes</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegret washed over him almost as soon as the words left his mouth. The other end of the phone was silent, save for a few scattered sobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck. You. Alan.\u201d A heavy sniffle punctuated the condemnation. \u201cI\u2019d tell Hallie what you said, but it\u2019d break her heart. Not that you\u2019d <i>understand what that\u2019s <b>like</b>, you <b>dickhead</b></i>!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cViolet, I didn\u2019t mea\u2014!\u201d But his words only reached the beeps of the disconnect tone. The black call-screen faded, returning to the siblings\u2019 equally vitriolic text chain. Alan slid a finger down the screen accidentally, scrolling past the harsh words and coming to rest on a picture of the argument\u2019s subject \u2014 Hailie Morrison. Her smile was blinding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://external-preview.redd.it/ILmBg4BRrzi-UpwDThuU_AR4-z7IsMRSP11TtyQ_mEg.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=8524d62ae457dad968d687c9679fd1f34d3179ea\" target=\"_blank\">https://external-preview.redd.it/ILmBg4B...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan guiltily stowed the phone in a jacket pocket and speed-walked to his line. He leaned against a nearby pillar, his thoughts drifting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe definitely could\u2019ve handled that better. When his sister had proposed that he \u2018help an old highschool friend with her classes\u2019 he didn\u2019t think that she\u2019d go to the wall for her. And he didn\u2019t think that Hailie would need help with, well, <i>all</i> of her classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan kicked a littered can onto the subway track, frowning. It was his own fault, really. An indefinite tutor job for fifty bucks per session? He should\u2019ve smelled something fishy. But he didn\u2019t \u2014 probably because of the pretty face. God, Vi reeled him in with that pic, hook, line, and sinker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarning bells had gone off when she wasn\u2019t at the library at 3. They rang louder when she rushed in, thirty minutes late, gushing apologies riddled with upspeak and \u2018OMG\u2019s. They rang loudest when her response to \u2018What classes are you struggling with?\u2019 was a shrug and: \u201cI dunno, like, all of \u2018em?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had kept his expression neutral when she gave him her latest tests to highlight her issues. Almost all of them were sub-forties, with one calamitously dropping down to single digits. An aside glance to look for the shame of atypicality was returned with a vacant stare, confirming his fears. These scores were <i>normal</i>; the Hailey Morrison standard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tinny \u2018Please stand away from the platform\u2019s edge\u2019 buzzed out from the overhead speakers, interrupting his train of thought. Alan straightened up, frown still troubling his face, as the silver tube slowly ground to a halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe <i>tried</i> to let her down easily \u2014 and indirectly \u2014 but she was just too goddamned <i>nice</i>. He had mentioned how difficult his classes were going to be this semester, only to have her coo in surprise at how \u2018mega-smart\u2019 he had to be to take them <i>and</i> help her. When he had posed the problem that it would be hard to schedule future sessions around her job, she had assured him that \u2018My hours \u2018r flex\u2014 flexeb\u2014 I can move \u2018em around \u2018n stuff.\u2019 And when their time was up and he was going to bite the bullet and tell her, she had pulled him into a warm, unexpected \u2014 and rather squishy \u2014 hug, and thanked him profusely, tears starting to pool in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHence the sister-proxy-cancellation. Hence the shouting match. Hence the likely-to-be-awkward family get-togethers that awaited him, most likely. He sullenly walked into the open doors of the train, absentmindedly noting that it was just as empty as the station. Weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilty thoughts swirled through his head as the train sped up, blurring the wall outside the window into a dun-colored smear. The next thing to catch his attention was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alan stared at his phone\u2019s lock screen and the all-caps message his sister had seen fit to send. He chuckled nervously and looked circumspect at the empty subway car, half-expecting a black-clad squad of kidnappers to pop out. His sister\u2019s text, though short and vulgar, read like a pseudo-threat, a <i>promise</i> of action rather than a prediction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis muscles gradually relaxed as he thought the situation out. What could she do, anyways? Send embarrassing highschool pics to his friends? Spread salacious rumors? Tell Mom that he had been mean to her? He balked a bit at that; she did usually take Violet\u2019s side, but he could probably reason past her initial burst of anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan was so caught up in the strategy of sororal warfare that he didn\u2019t even catch his phone buzz with an alert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe <i>did</i> catch the repeat alert two minutes later. It was Violet, of course. Curiously, the preview wasn\u2019t a snippet of a vicious castigation, nor sinister promise. It merely read \u2018Link Cannot be Previewed in iMessage\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan pursed his lips at the tiny LCD screen. That was odd. Was it some documentary on the pitfalls of low-wage college education? A link to a study on the career prospects of college-drop-outs? He slid the banner to the left and unlocked the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of <i>not</i> clicking the link barely crossed his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA white flash far brighter than the guttering subway lights illuminated the train car, driving Alan\u2019s vision \u2014 and consciousness \u2014 into darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven before he opened his eyes, Alan could tell that something was <i>wrong</i>. The (presumable) sheets around him felt\u2026 odd, hugging his body in unfamiliar ways. Blood thumped in his ears. Oh God, was he paralyzed? Did he have a stroke?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn experimental wiggle of fingers and toes dispelled any immediate notion of immobility, but brought to light an unusual soreness mixed with numbness suffusing his body. Still, something was <i>wrong</i>. He wasn\u2019t meant to be in a \u2014 unusually large, now that he thought about it \u2014 bed. He was meant to be on the subway, or in his dorm. Had he been under a fugue state?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking heart, Alan finally forced his eyes open. The view was elucidating, even through mysteriously blurry vision \u2014 this was no hospital, unless St Agnes had recently built a teenybopper wing. Faded pink wallpaper coated the walls of the room he was in, frequently interrupted by the occasional poster on the wall \u2014 their general subjects being boy bands both old and new, one particularly rumpled poster spiderwebbed by tape, save for a small quadrant with a signature in silver ink. Stuffed animals stood like wardens on various bits of furniture, save for a (pink, obviously) vanity that displayed an eclectic, if messy, collection of cut-out magazine pictures and beauty products.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA frown troubled his forehead. He could\u2019ve fainted on the subway and been taken in by some good samaritan \u2014 and put in their teenage daughter\u2019s room, by the look of it \u2014 or been kidnapped by some Misery-esque stalker. His heart quickened. First, find his phone. Then, investigation. Silence would be the key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly yanked the ros\u00e9 blankets off of him\u2026 and any coherent plan vanished from his head. His vision was entirely occupied by two pale orbs, wrapped snugly in a balconette bra that seemed to be two sizes too small, forming a great valley of flesh that wobbled with the slightest movement. And wobble it did, for the two spheres were currently attached to the chest of near-hyperventilating Alan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of panicked breathing, Alan managed to recover enough of his composure to obey his fight-or-flight instincts, scooting his rear to the head of the bed and scrabbling to a sitting position. But the weight of what seemed to be <i>his</i> prodigious chest followed him, bouncing with unnatural vigor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes unconsciously roamed over the unfamiliar sights \u2014 or, well, what he could see past the two protrusions. \u2018Soft\u2019 seemed to be the first word that described him: every inch of his body contained only the barest hint of muscle, enough to prevent cellulite, but insufficient to prevent \u2018extra motion\u2019. The boyshorts that he (apparently) seemed to be wearing cinched a ring into the downy flesh of his thighs, all the while supporting the unwitnessed yet <i>very</i> present mass behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick pawing at the front of the underwear confirmed the sense of absence niggling at the back of his mind, as well as the second adjective: \u2018Girly\u2019. His toenails and fingernails were painted pink as the surrounding walls, his ankle accented by an pale pink heart on a silver anklet. The tickle of hair on his shoulder blades did nothing to disavow that notion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the discovery of the loss, an aftershock of fear and disgust struck Alan. In spite of his most fervent wishes, this could not be a dream. Everything was too\u2026 <i>real</i>. Even so, he impulsively shot a hand at his left arm, pinching the soft flesh harshly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe involuntary squeak that escaped his lips sent chills down his back for reasons beyond its abnormality. It was\u2026 familiar. Too familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart managed to find the strength to thump underneath its weighty ballast; Alan quickly swung his legs up and out of the bed, dread mounting in him. He winced as his feet hit the floor; a mixture of revulsion at the mild swing his hips brought to his gait, and dismay at his less-than-impressive height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe half-stumbled over to the vanity, but halfway there, he already saw all he needed to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit,\u201d he breathed, in the squeaky, bubblegum-chewing, none-too-bright-sounding soprano of Hailie Morrison.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hearing Hailie's sweetly bubbly voice swear was almost surreal in itself - beyond the fact that Alan was hearing it from the inside of Hailie's head.  Something about the voice's pitch and Hailie's wide-eyed innocent face suggested that \"shoot\" was as close as the girl was likely to come to expletives.  Not that this affected Alan's choice of vocabulary in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailie's face in the mirror moved at his command, the concerned and thoughtful expressions adding yet another layer of surreality as they were rendered on a face more closely associated with a blissfully uncomprehending lack of concern.  A flash of extra concern ran across Hailie's - now Alan's, apparently - features as a horrifying thought entered Alan's racing mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The current view that a favorable Brexit deal is unlikely makes Britain's moves towards tax and trade policies at odds with the United States all the more concerning as the nation risks finding itself more isolated from the international community that it anticipated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Whew*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailie's voice rendered the commentary rather less somber than Alan would have preferred, but at least the words had still come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK.  I'm still me.  Just, well, also not me.\"  So maybe that last phrase had sounded very on-brand for Hailie, but in Alan's defense, it was at least accurate given the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden disturbance of Alan's thoughts made him - er, her - jump, setting in motion a series of jiggles that felt entirely wrong as Hailie's chest obeyed the laws of inertia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hailie, sweetheart,\" the words and tone of voice from the other side of the door suggested that this was likely Mrs. Morrison, \"are you awake?  You don't want to be late for your tutoring appointment again like you were yesterday honey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVi hadn't canceled the appointment!  Alan's mind shuffled through possibilities.  There was no rational reason to expect it, but somehow he knew that if he was in Hailie's body, she must be in his.  And Vi's text!  That must have been what triggered this!  Maybe he could convince Hailie to help him convince Vi that she needed to undo...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hailie?  Sweetie?\"  The knocking was louder this time and the voice a bit more insistent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that simple was best (and probably most in character) Alan went with a simple \"I'm up!\" in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good.  You've got a couple of hours before you have to go, so don't take too long deciding on an outfit hon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the door, footsteps retreated, leaving Alan alone again with his thoughts and with the need to get dressed presentably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being as disorganized as Hailie's brain, the room was at least clean, and what Alan had initially taken as faded pink wallpaper was, in reality, intentionally pastel.  Searching through the room to find out where Hailie kept various bits of clothing turned out to be an interesting archaeological expedition.  The discovery of a few books was initially surprising - until Alan noticed that they were the \"Twilight\" series.  Still, she did at least read something, which was a start.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe space between the vanity and Hailie's wardrobe turned out to be home to a decently sized pile of what appeared to be academic award certificates.  The incongruity piqued Alan's curiosity and he couldn't stop himself from looking closer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In recognition of achieving the most volunteer hours...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pile contained certificate after certificate thanking Hailie for her dedication to volunteering - at a food kitchen, at a nursing home, in the children's wing at the local hospital...  None of the volunteer positions had been the sort to require much in the way of brains, but the cards interspersed with the awards made it clear that what Hailie gave was what people needed most - someone to talk with and someone to brighten their day.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*KNOCK KNOCK*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hailie, sweetie, you'll need to be ready soon if you want some breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan looked over at the clock.  He'd lost a half-hour contemplating why Hailie never mentioned all her volunteering.  The only answer he could think of was that she simply didn't think it was special - several cards had referenced Hailie saying that she didn't understand why just being nice to people was so much of a big deal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be ready soon mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe footsteps retreated once again and Alan focused his attention on getting dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Hailie only seemed to own clothing designed to highlight her chest.  Then again, Alan thought as he looked into the mirror, struggling with Hailie's bra, Hailie's entire body was designed to highlight her chest.  Setting on a pair of entirely too tight jeans and a similarly too-tight t-shirt that left none of his current femininity to the imagination (and had required entirely too much jiggling to get into), Alan took a deep breath and headed out of Hailie's room...</span></div></div>",

The form-fitting t-shirt seems to be taken as perfectly normal, slightly modest even, but Alan's lack of attention to his hair is definitely noticed.  There's an odd sense of approval about it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/hPlpLtk.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/hPlpLtk.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not trying to look extra cute for your tutor today?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question from Hailie's mom takes a few seconds to register as Alan is distracted taking in the Morrisons' house.  He'd thought that his perception of Hailie's bedroom being quite large was simply due to his perception being disrupted from suddenly being Hailie's 5'1\" instead of the foot taller he usually was, but even accounting for those differences the rest of the house still seemed large.  And very nicely furnished.  No wonder Hailie hadn't blinked at the amount he'd asked, her family had money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hailie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan's attention snapped back to Mrs. Morrison, which wasn't terribly difficult given that it was obvious where Hailie's looks had come from, and gave her a slightly blank look hoping that it would seem in character and mask the fact that he hadn't been paying attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Morrison simply smiled indulgently, as though this sort of situation were common.  Which, given Hailie, it probably was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good that you're not trying to look cute for your tutor hon,\" Mrs. Morrison commented as Alan blinked a little in confusion.  Hailie had a crush on him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, um, I'm not...\"  Alan's confused babbling required no acting as he followed Hailie's mother into the dining room where Mrs. Morrison had laid out a small breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not mad at you sweetie,\" Mrs. Morrison interrupted, obviously not believing Alan's protests.  \"I just don't want you getting your hopes up again hon.  I'm sure Alan's a very nice boy, he's Violet's brother after all, but remember what happened the last time you tried to date your tutor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping that what worked before would work again, Alan tried a blank look between bites of waffle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't let your heart get broken again, ok sweetie?\"  Mrs. Morrison sighed.  \"Remember how we had to fire the last tutor? Just because they act nice at first doesn't mean they are nice.  It's wonderful how you always expect the best in everyone, but sometimes you have to be a bit more careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan blinked in surprise.  Vi hadn't told him about a prior tutor.  Especially not one who, based on Mrs. Morrison's admittedly slightly cryptic remarks, seemed to have taken advantage of Hailie's sweetness and then dumped her rather harshly.  At least there was some relief in the way Mrs. Morrison's tone suggested simply young heartbreak and not anything sinister.

A palpable sense of remorse filled him; he definitely shouldn\u2019t have been so hard on Hailie, even if she\u2019d probably never hear a word of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>There\u2019s still no way I can give her the help she needs on my schedule,</i>,\u2019 he resolved to himself, drowning a puddle of syrup in a stream of warm water. \u2018<i>I\u2019ll just throw some names around for her. Gareth\u2019d appreciate her company, probably.</i>\u2019 He stowed the rinsed plate in the surprisingly large dishwasher, a satisfied smile curling his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Well, that\u2019ll come after Vi undoes this magic bullshit.</i>\u2019 he appended to his thoughts, wincing at the jostling inertia of the two most apparent consequences of the aforementioned \u2018magic bullshit\u2019. The shock at the discovery that, yes, magic was <i>real</i> had faded with his ventures through the anarchy that reigned over Hailie\u2019s room; catching glimpses of the half-dressed bombshell mirroring his every action and expression in the vanity\u2019s mirror was numbing, in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he had an appointment to keep; one that might actually be a ticket into a body that was less hyper-feminine. Alan scanned the room, searching for information that his body should already possess. The view from the window was a fairly benign suburb, maybe a bit richer than the norm. Hailey was thirty minutes late to her appointment, so, assuming that she left around threeish and the trip took around forty minutes \u2014 give or take a few minutes to find parking \u2014  then he should be in\u2026 Glendale! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrivately glowing with the satisfaction of a solved case, Alan looked around the room, once again, searching for a conspicuous hook or any such den for car-starters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis impromptu search was interrupted by a forbearing \u201cHailie, sweetie,\u201d. He swiveled his head owlishly to Mrs. Morrison, who wore the patient \u2018bless-your-heart\u2019 smile that all moms seemed to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour car is still in the shop, snookums,\u201d she continued, wiping the waffle iron with a damp washcloth. \u201cDaddy needs the other one for work, so you have to take the bus again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh. Thanks.\u201d Alan tried to smother the grimace threatening to appear on his face with the blank look that had worked so well earlier. \u201cWhenzit coming?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little bit of long-suffering weariness shone out from Mrs. Morrison\u2019s smile, mixed with a hint of slight concern. \u201cFifteen minutes, Hail-bale, right down the street. Same time as yesterday.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan muttered a quick \u2018Thanks,\u2019 and resumed his search, this time for a bu\u2014 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI put the pass in your bag, dear.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small blush heated Alan\u2019s cheeks. It seemed that Mrs. Morrison had developed a preternatural sense of prediction for her daughter\u2019s antics. He couldn\u2019t tell what was more embarrassing: being treated like a kid again, or the fact that his fumbling bore a resemblance to Hailie\u2019s own routine.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stowed these insecurities to the back of his mind as he picked up and donned the hot pink clutch purse Mrs. Morrison had gestured to. If everything went according to his plan, he shouldn\u2019t have to worry about his self-slash-Hailie\u2019s-image for too much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe briefly checked the purse\u2019s contents as he walked to the front door, managing to produce the lackluster tests that he had been shown yesterday, a small makeup compact, and the promised bus pass, alongside various candy wrappers and loose change. Good enough. He opened the door, taking a deep breath\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cDid you remember your phone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan felt a familiar blush redden his face, as he mumbled a \u2018No\u2019 and scampered upstairs to fetch the pink-cased device and, as per another shouted reminder, a pastel-purple wallet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClawing through the mess of Hailie\u2019s room took a good seven minutes, (thankfully) shortening his farewell with Mrs. Morrison to a hasty \u201cBye!\u201d as he slammed the door behind him. After a few seconds of thought, he threw the door open and appended a hesitant \u201c...Mom!\u201d. You know,Just to keep up appearances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\nAlan always prided himself on his punctuality. He made it a habit to show up five minutes early to any occasion at the very least, car or no car. As such, he had mastered the technique of the light jog and had the requisite muscles to show for it. The bus station was, what, a ten-minute walk away? He could make it in five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd <i><b>he</b></i> probably could. For Hailie, however, it would be a long shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan was no idiot. He knew that Hailie wasn\u2019t built for athletics \u2014 he hadn\u2019t seen many female athletes sixty-one inches tall with two ballast bags stapled to their chests \u2014 but he had been a star on the track team! Surely he could eke out her hidden potential.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut whatever athleticism Halie possessed was stymied by Alan\u2019s clothing choice. The vacuum-sealed jeans condensed any long strides he made into what could only be described as a high-impact mince, rocking his hips from side to side like an accelerated sensual pendulum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe consequences of his gait extended well above waist level: Alan\u2019s choice in clothing was facilitated by haste as well as modesty; he picked out a loose-ish one with a large band to avoid any boob-wrangling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, he was <i>really</i> regretting not putting on a sports bra, or at least something tighter; the loose one he had picked hardly restricted his chest at all, jostling it to the left, right, left, right, etc., heavy flesh painfully <i>schlapping</i> against his ribs with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan managed to continue his jog for a full block before acknowledging the elephant in the room \u2014 or rather, \u2018elephants in his shirt\u2019 \u2014 and doing <i>something</i> to stop the extreme wobbling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held the twin mountains in his hand, which worked surprisingly well for a half block \u2014 before he was met with the offended gasp and gaze of an old lady walking her mini-schnauzer. Red-faced for what seemed to be the nth time that day, he released his death-grip on his tits, opting instead to endure the symphony of slaps another way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe solution he settled on was as humiliatingly feminine as it was cartoonish. Either impuissant forearm stood sentry on either side of his flesh-balloons, wrists limped for simple convenience. If his next pivot-step was to the left, that respective arm would stifle the next imminent <i>thwack</i> into a less painful wobble. This process was mirrored and repeated on his \u2014 much to the joy of nearby gawkers \u2014 until he swished his way to the bus stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiding the bus \u2014 which came about a minute later \u2014 was no better. The bus was packed to the brim; every single seat occupied by some morose passenger, leaving Alan to stare enviously at the rows of chairs as he clung weakly to a stanchion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan spent the twenty-minute journey gazing morosely out the dirty window, trying not to notice the side eyes he received with every pothole. Some fiery part of him wanted to call them out, or at least flip them off, but what would that achieve? A few minutes of averted gazes, at best, and a forty-second section in \u2018TOP PUBLIC FREAKOUTS OF OCTOBER,\u2019 with fifty comments helpfully timestamping the \u2018ditz with the tits\u2019 at worst? Shit, Vi\u2019d have his head for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a relief when his stop came but only in the psychological sense; his shoulders and ribs still duly throbbing with every step up the library\u2019s stairs. A wan smile curled his lips as he glanced at the clock above the reference desk; he was ten minutes early. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady at the desk greeted the approaching footsteps with a picture-perfect customer service and, to Alan\u2019s appreciation, unbroken eye-contact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can I help you, miss?\u201d she chirped, head tilted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m looking to reserve study room B,\u201d Alan said, only slightly put off by the appellation. \u201cUnderneath Al\u2014 Hailie?\u201d He winced internally; the mistake and hasty correction sounded all-too-natural in Hailie\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist returned a jaunty nod and flipped through a nearby binder with a disarming amount of zeal. \u201cOh, you\u2019re Hailie? You can just walk right in,\u201d she cooed. \u201cYour friend\u2019s waiting for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan could only nod numbly and stiffly march in the receptionist\u2019s pointed direction. The lady seemed the type to giggle and simper at the mere thought of a coed study session, and Hailie certainly didn\u2019t seem to be the type to have any guys as \u2018friends\u2019, so that left\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYo, Al,\u201d drawled a very familiar voice from a <i>very</i> familiar person learning next to a door with a large \u2018B\u2019 on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s have a talk.\u201d said Vi, as she half ushered, and half-frogmarched her brother into the study room.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The air inside the room was tense; both Alan and Vi making concerted efforts to not look at one another. Alan dared a look at Vi: she still wore the same smirk she had a moment ago, but with a lot less confidence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything else about her just seemed, well, normal. There were no glowing tattoos or green skin tone to hint at supernatural powers, just the same Violet, with the same dyed-purple hair she\u2019d had since that goth phase that she never quite grew out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVi cleared her throat, making Alan jump. \u201cMan, it\u2019s weird looking at you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 \u2014 You f\u2014 i-it\u2019s weird for <i>you</i>?\u201d The miasma of anger and confusion stewing inside him did nothing to help his articulation, sending his words tumbling out all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d continued Vi, unperturbed. \u201cYou <i>look</i> like her, but you\u2019re obviously, well, not. Your eyes are all dart-y, for one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short, harsh bark of laughter escaped Alan\u2019s lips. \u201cOh, I\u2019m so god damned <i>sorry</i>, Violet. Next time, give me a few days\u2019 notice; I\u2019ll be sure to stare off into space to make you <i>comfortable</i>.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan tried to channel all of his rage into a withering scowl, but by the looks of Violet\u2019s confused frown, it\u2019s not that effective. The quick look he snuck at Hailie\u2019s cracked phone returned a sulky pout, confirming his suspicions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeez-us, someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed.\u201d Vi frowned, tersely inspecting her fingernails.  \u201cYou\u2019re not doing yourself any favors.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want me to <i>thank</i> you, for ripping me away from my life and putting me in Little Miss Du\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>DON\u2019T. START.</b>\u201d thundered Vi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan wisely shut his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m not trying to \u2014 I ju\u2014\u201d Vi let out a deep sigh, combing fingers through her hair. \u201cLet\u2019s just start over again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan gave a hesitant nod, eyes edged with suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTempers flared last night. We both said, or...\u201d She gestured vaguely at Alan. \u201c... did things that we regret.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that supposed to be an <i>apology</i>?! Fine, I said some shit, but you <i>hex</i> me in response?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a <i>charm</i>, asshole, and this is an <b>explanation</b>.\u201d Vi shot back. \u201cYou\u2019re making this way harder than it needs to be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine,\u201d said Alan as he attempted to find a comfortable place to cross his arms, \u201dGo on, then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt \u2014 er, the charm, that is \u2014 is based on connections, bonds, relationships; whatever you wanna call them.\u201d Vi laced her hands together demonstratively. \u201cYou and me are like <i>this</i>, cuz you\u2019ve been nagging me all my life, and I\u2019ve known Hailie since known Hailie since her <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">two consecutive</font> junior year<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">s</font>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCharming,\u201d Alan snorted. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just make pals with her professors, and zap yourself into that oh-so-convenient position?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause she\u2019d <i>know</i>, dickhead! She can recognize that she\u2019s not good at that nerd shit like you are; suddenly getting perfect scores in every subject\u2019d tip her off that <i>something\u2019s</i> up! And she, well, she wouldn\u2019t like that.\u201d Vi concluded, rather lamely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cutting remark perched on the edge of Alan\u2019s tongue died and was replaced with genuine curiosity. \u201cIs she okay with this, then?\u201d He gestured vaguely to his figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVi squirmed uncomfortably in her seat. \u201cI, um, kinda <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">told her</font> <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">that was</font> <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">your idea.</font>...\u201d She blanched at Alan\u2019s blackening expression. \u201cYou get to see what her classes are like to help her out and maybe a bit of your egghead lifestyle\u2019ll rub off on her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, it was Alan\u2019s turn to shout, or, rather, squeak loudly. \u201cYou turned me into a fucking <i>exchange program</i>?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, you\u2019re mad and I get that, but Hailie really, really, really <i>really</i> needs your help. I visit her at work and she\u2019s all smiles, but she\u2019s hurting, deep down. The girls tell me that she spends all of her breaks studying, but it\u2019s just not helping.\u201d She reached across the table and took Alan\u2019s small hand in hers. \u201cThis is the only time I\u2019ll ever admit it, but you\u2019re smart as hell, Alan, and you\u2019re not a complete piece of shit. I <i>know</i> you can help her so, please, for me, can you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan stared back at his sister, her face knitted into a supplicating pout he hadn\u2019t seen since they were kids. The hard edge that he was cultivating slowly wore away, and he responded with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m <i>really</i> sorry Vi, but I can\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Vi released his hand as her face set itself into hard lines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy schedule, my classwork\u2014\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBull<i>shit</i>,\u201d snarled Vi. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t struggle with four APs and mock trial club during senior year, you\u2019re not gonna break a sweat here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-well, I can\u2019t take the time to meet her constantly,\u201d Alan attempted. \u201cI live on campus and this library\u2014\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2014 is a fifteen-minute subway ride away. And I\u2019m a witch, not a Luddite, I know that Skype exists.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the second time that week, Alan's rage cresendoed and erupted <i>spectacularly</i>.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cChrist, can you not read between the fucking lines, Vi? Or do I have to say it: I DON\u2019T WANT TO! Is that clear, or do you want me to write it down?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVi stood up and Alan belatedly realized how tall she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can read between the lines better than you can, apparently,\u201d she spat, stepping closer to Alan with every word. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to teach her because you\u2019re a shallow bastard who doesn\u2019t give a shit about people other than himself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan opened his mouth to return a tirade of his own, but no sound came out. The lights in the room flickered and the blinds rattled as Vi smiled wickedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine then. You say tutoring someone\u2019ll waste your semester? I\u2019ll gladly oblige you.\u201d Her fingers twisted and though she didn\u2019t touch him, Alan could tell that something had changed, like some rope he that he had been in had suddenly broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUntil Hailie Morrison passes her finals, get used to bras and panties, shortstuff,\u201d she jeered, \u201cAnd I like that exchange program idea of yours, so I\u2019ll just\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes and formed her lips into soundless, unfamiliar syllables, her hands dancing in the air like possessed spiders. Alan\u2019s head flashed cold, as though doused with a bucket of ice. \u201c... enforce it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan hurled soundless curses at her as she walked to the door, waving a cruel goodbye, \u201cHave fun with your tutoring session, \u2018Hailie\u2019!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan, to his credit, managed to hurl a \u201cFUCK YOU!\u201d after he regained use of his lilting soprano. As his anger waned, his current situation dawned on him in its entirety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit,\u201d he moaned, burying his face into his matchstick arms. \u201cI\u2019m so <i>fucked.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The thing about deep, calming breaths is that they don't work nearly as well when all they really do is remind one of his or her situation - as Alan discovered thanks to the way his own calming breath mostly just reminded him of the tightness of Hailie's shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it helped enough to get him back into a mental space where he could consider his options.  Running out to search for Vi didn't seem promising - she had a head start and her own car, which meant that finding her would likely amount to blind luck at best.  Plus, Alan thought as he shook his head, still trying to clear the odd sensation of having just had ice water run in one ear and out the other, even if he did find Vi right now there was a nonzero chance that he'd only make things worse.  And he definitely did not want to find out what \"worse\" might mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK Alan,\" he winced slightly at the girlish tone, \"you can get through this.  Make nice to Hailie, convince her to take the quarter off so she's not overwhelmed by my classes, and then pass her classes for her.  That should defuse Vi...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock on the door of the study room pulled Alan out of his reverie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, this is, like, the right study room, right?\"  His own head poked through the door with a quizzical expression that brightened into the sort of carefree and excited expression that would have been more at home on a small child receiving candy.  \"Oh good!  I got the right one!  I couldn't remember if Vi said room 'B' or room 'D' 'cause they kinda sound the same and then I got here and the rooms only went up to 'C' and I got a little confused until I thought that since there wasn't a room 'D' that meant it <i>had</i> to be room 'B' unless I had the wrong library but that wouldn't have made sense 'cause why would Vi be at the wrong library...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yes...  Good job...\"  Alan tried to blink away the surreality of hearing his own voice babble away with Hailie Morrison's characteristic cheerful babbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right?\"  Alan's former face positively radiated happiness as Hailie clapped once in emphasis before settling down at the study room table.  \"I'm super sorry I'm late and stuff, but, like, I had to take the bus 'cause I can't do the whole stick shift thingy and you know how <i>buses</i> are so never on time.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailie waved a hand in a manner so feminine that Alan winced a little at the thought of the damage she might do to his reputation over the course of the quarter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well, I'm sure we can work something out to let you borrow a less complicated car until we fix this...\"  The distracted nature of Alan's comment was clear even through Hailie's generally-slightly-detached vocal tones as he settled into the chair next to his former body.  For just a moment, he studied his former body with a slight frown as it organized a few books on the table.  \"You're certainly taking this well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailie blinked at him.  \"Well, yeah?  I can't change it so, like, what good would it do to be all worried about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...\"  Alan paused as he processed his surprise, \"...a good point...\"  Thankfully, Hailie seemed not to take any insult from the way he obviously hadn't expected such a deeply coherent sentiment.  \"Anyway,\" Alan shook his head slightly, \"since it seems like we're going to be like this for a while...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vi said you were going to do my whole quarter for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...  Um...  Well, you see, that means you're going to have to pretend to be me for a while and I'm going to have to pretend to be you, so I think maybe today I should start with...\"  Alan trailed off as the pink-cased iPhone on the desk in front of him pinged with the sound of an incoming text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;&gt;  Remember to listen to your tutor, HAILIE.  Alan is much smarter than you, after all.  Well, maybe not yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final clause of Vi's text dominated his attention to the point that Hailie's babbling went unnoticed until she tapped him on the shoulder, causing him to jump in his chair and her to giggle at the way he reached up to stop the resultant jiggling in his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said that since I'm, like, you or something, that means I'm the tutor and you hafta learn from me!  Vi said it was some kinda experimental learning or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Experiential you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!  That thing!  Anyway, she said I should teach you all about bein' me and that'd help me learn how ta be you?  I kinda don't get it, but I usually don't get it, so that's, like, not really a big deal, ya know?\"  Alan couldn't suppress his nodding.  \"So.  The first thing she said I gotta teach you is that you're Hailie Anne Morrison now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor just a moment, Alan's head swam.  It was as though every memory of anyone calling his name, every memory of him telling someone his name or writing his name down, was being played back at once and in one instant, each instance replacing the name 'Alan Michael James' with 'Hailie Anne Morrison'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\"  Shaking his head, he looked up to see his former body glancing down at him with a slightly concerned expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you OK Hailie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine Alan.  And you don't need to teach me that.  I'm not going to forget that I'm Hailie.  That's what everyone always... calls... me...\"  The former Alan trailed off what he'd just said sank in.  He knew he'd only been in this body since this morning.  He knew he used to be Alan whatever-his-middle-name-was James.  But when he thought about his name it was Hailie Anne Morrison that came instantly and instinctively to mind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo!  This was too much!  He was going to fight this!  Vi couldn't just make him respond to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hailie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"  He was already looking up at his former body before he consciously realized that he'd snapped to attention in response to the name Hailie.  \"Damnit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis former body giggled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vi said you'd prob'ly be a little upset, but, like, trust me, it'd be way bad if you accidentally forgot you were Hailie, right?\"  The newly christened Hailie nodded grudgingly.  \"'Kay!  So, um, I know you gotta work tonight, but I s'pose we can spend a little bit more time studyin'...  I think I should teach you more about...\"</span></div></div>",

Time seemed to slow \u2014 though it probably wasn\u2019t necessary, with the way that Alan was dithering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took his <i>name,</i> for Chrissake! Sure, being called Hailie just felt <i>right</i>, but that fact, er, feeling alone was <i>freaky</i>. Plus, who knows what else she\u2019d take? The implications chilled him to his core. Alan could disassemble him, piece by piece, bit by mental bit, leaving him no better than the original, some kind of Ditz of Theseus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. He wouldn\u2019t let that happen. Hailie surged up with all the strength that his soft legs afforded him, clamping a hand over Alan\u2019s mouth\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOw. Did his chest, uh, hit something? And why did his feet feel wet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them looked down at the spilled water bottle and its contents pooling on the floor, Hailie\u2019s hand still on Alan\u2019s mouth. It took a few seconds for both of them to take in the damage, but when they did, both seamlessly transitioned into damage-control mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, sorry, Alan, I didn\u2019t mean to \u2014 ohgodit\u2019salloveryourpantsimsosorry\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOopsies, I def\u2019ntly shouldn\u2019t \u2018a left the bottle there. Are you, like, hurt at all, Hailie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailie almost instinctively retreated from his copy\u2019s wide (obviously practiced) puppy-dog eyes and shockingly large outstretched arms \u2014 the nth reminder today that he was just <i>small</i> now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2014 I\u2019m all good,\u201d Hailie assured, gently pushing Alan away to avoid the alien sensation of being hugged by one\u2019s own body. \u201cJust\u2026 could you go get some paper towels?\u201d He gestured vaguely at Alan\u2019s pants. \u201cAnd you, uh should dry that off before you sit in anything. Might ruin the chair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan\u2019s eyes lit up with joy at the prospect of something to do to help, and just as quickly fell into abject despair at the thought of inconveniencing library staff. It took a few seconds for the direct request to register, but once it did, she shot right up to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotcha, Hale-bale.\u201d Hailie masked his nauseous expression as Alan tittered in delight. \u201cOoh, that feels <i>mega-weird</i> to say.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailie watched his former body flounce out of the room, elbows tucked tight to the ribs and wrists limped in a chillingly familiar display. He groaned again: maybe he could tell his friends that he got lead poisoning or something \u2014 at least it\u2019d be easier to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailie shook his head \u2014 that wasn\u2019t important. What was important was \u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan\u2019s head poked its way through the ajar door. \u201cUh, do ya, like, know where the bathroom is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... I think there\u2019s one on the second floor. Take a left at the top of the staircase.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan grinned and shot a thumbs up before once again taking her leave. Hailie watched her go, inchoate thought forming in the back of his head. Was he forgetting something\u2026? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Oh god</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran to the door and hissed as loudly as was socially acceptable. \u201cThe <i><b>guy\u2019s</b></i> bathroom, Alan!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan, in response, shouted \u201c\u2018Kay!\u201d, heedless of standard librarial conduct. Before he shut the door, Hailie could spy a matronly librarian making her way over to the cheery Alan, mouth set in a stern line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed the door with a sigh. Not much he could do about that. Or, really, anything Hailie wanted to do in his body. He couldn\u2019t really\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailie pinched the bridge of his borrowed button nose. <i>Don\u2019t panic. Just think.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe strode over to Alan\u2019s side of the table, running his hand over his old knapsack half-affectionately. Unless Alan packed the whole thing with pink cupcakes and confetti, there should be\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuccess! Hailie pulled out a yellow legal pad, the corners dogeared from months of eager use. There were only a few unscored pages left, but they would do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe word \u2018flowchart\u2019 was the quickest way to Hailie\u2019s heart that one could find. Organizing his thoughts, hopes, and fears into list form was a great comfort to his rigid <i>logos</i>-oriented brain. And sometimes just free association brought a degree of calm, writing down things that instinctively registered as \u2018bad\u2019 and \u2018good\u2019 into an ersatz pros and cons list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe mostly kept this organization to himself, though. Girlfriends didn\u2019t react well when you showed them a cost/benefit analysis of your relationship thus far, and they got more than a bit tetchy when they realized that the whole thing was leading into a break-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailie, smiling for the first time in a long while, began with a perfect ellipsis of a start-point, almost humming with delight as he drew a wonderfully straight line connecting to a now-unknown process step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was ritual-like for the stodgy Alan, the kind of relaxation that other people got with a bucket of ice-cream, a spoon, and an overcrowded Netflix queue. He\u2019d never boast about it (in public), but he prided himself on having a <i>productive, logical</i> means of stress relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan wrote in the terminal bubble, \u201cVi turns me into Alan,\u201d before glowering at the paper and crossing out \u2018Alan\u2019 in favor of \u2018Hailie\u2019, then, with a pained expression of concession on his pretty face, crossed out the name and wrote \u2018Alan\u2019 below the scribbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorribly intrusive mind-magic aside, it was better for instinctive recognition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bubble was then connected to \u2018I get pissed at Vi\u2019. A mistake, to be sure, but it <i>had</i> happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting pen to pink lips, he connected it to \u2018Vi establishes \u2018exchange program\u2019, resisting the puerile urge to include a frowny face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, frowning for real as he moved his pen, he wrote \u2018Alan trades names\u2019 in the fourth bubble. Yup. That was what happened. Hailie allowed himself ten seconds to let the wave of existential dread wash over him, then shook it off as best he could with a small whirlwind of copper hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe past was the past. Time for plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t even bother putting \u2018Find Vi\u2019 as an option, despite the consideration he gave it before. Sure, if he <i>begged</i>, or considering the wide-eyed innocence of Alan, simply asked, he\u2019d probably get a cheerily-delivered exact location of the gothy girl. But twenty-odd years and the very strange last twenty minutes didn\u2019t leave him feeling safe and secure about the lengths she\u2019d go if he pushed the wrong sister-button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, he put the option he\u2019d decided upon before in a potential path. \u2018Convince Alan to drop classes\u2019. That was a normal thing, right? His friends \u2014 no, more importantly, his <i>record</i> wouldn\u2019t be marred by one teensy tiny semester off, right? There wouldn\u2019t \u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailie stopped his catastrophizing with a small slap to a soft cheek, and a deep, diaphragm-centred breath (to avoid any shirt-stretching). Panicking was <i>bad</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd maybe it wasn\u2019t all bad. Maybe he could liiiightly push Alan into taking the time to volunteer in the place of classes, given that she apparently had an affinity for the act. He\u2019d just have to try to frame it in a way that would <i>absolutely not get back to Vi</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich, given his two-hours-total with Alan, and one whole morning to learn how other people treated her, seemed outright goddamn impossible. Persuading Alan to drop the semester was the easy part \u2014 she was, for lack of a better word, dumb; dumb people don\u2019t like doing hard things, explain to Alan in no uncertain terms that the classes were hard, bish bash bosh \u2014 but the chatterbox would probably gush effusively to Vi about how easy things were now that she didn\u2019t have classes if his sis ever decided to check-in. And, judging from Vi\u2019s her near-mother-hen tendencies, she\u2019d probably do so <i>immediately</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd who <i>knows</i> what Vi would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe added an annotation to the path, \u2018Too risky\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat left, as far as Hailie could see, one option. He\u2019d have to, <i>ugh</i>, <b>teach</b> her. Not the innate understanding he had of the entire curriculum, just, well, the basics. How to take notes, maybe some formulas for the maths-core he took \u2014 God, why had he opted for the advanced class?~ And then it\u2019d be up to Hailie to cobble together the stuff from her loopy-handwritten notes, write some essays, do the math problems...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it would be a lot of work, but Hailie\u2019s classes were pretty easy. A basic math class, some English Lit I, some History and\u2026 well, he\u2019d need to check out the rest. Still, he\u2019d had more plates in the air before. He could do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailie wrote, \u2018Teach Alan\u2019 and added a little sketch of a thumbs up next to the bubble, before stowing the flowchart in a pocket with a grunt of frustration. Why did they have to make the things so damn <i>small</i>?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he\u2019d need to distract Alan from doing that ice-water-trade-whatever thing. He needed to lead the conversation, not just blithely be swept along into Alan\u2019s rhythm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to, against all odds, <i>teach</i> the airhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailie sourly noted the irony as he started sketching out the basics of a lesson plan.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hailie bounced a denim-clad leg under the table, drumming a pink nail of the table for added effect. Initially, he had sped-wrote the plan, establishing vague concepts that he\u2019d flesh out on the fly, but Alan was taking a <i>loooong</i> time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike, twenty-minutes-total-long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong enough for him to refine his plan with a dizzying array of talking points and a small amount of (web-searched) math problems for practice, so he wasn\u2019t especially complaining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Alan knocked on the door, Hailie had mentally prepared for it enough to nod politely at his old body, rather than start at the surprise and start another symphony of chest-sloshing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Al\u2014,\u201d He frowned at the automatic response, but managed to plaster the same placid smile back on and kept chugging on; \u201cHey, Alan, I just thought we cou\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhmi<i>gawd</i>, Hailie, I\u2019m so sorry, cuz\u2019 first I went to the bathroom and then they didn\u2019t have paper towels so I kinda haddta hold my leg up like this \u2014\u201d This time Hailie <i>did</i> start as Alan <i>thwacked</i> a leg onto the unstable table \u2014 \u201cto the air-blow-dry-thingie, which took a <i>looong</i> time, and then when I got out, there was this sweet ol\u2019 lady trying to get something on a shelf, so I got the thingie and she said \u2018Oh you sweet young man\u2019, an\u2019 I laughed a little at that, then haddta explain, like, <b>why</b> I laughed, but not, like, the <i>real</i> reason, cuz \u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Alan,\u201d interrupted Hailie, beatific smile on his face. Apparently, entering the room late with a meandering explanation seemed a Hailie Morrison staple. Put it down on the lists of mistakes <i>he</i> would never make. \u201cI thought I\u2019d just go over some Alan basics before we wrapped up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe awfully contrite expression on Alan\u2019s face slid into one of unabashed confusion. \u201cBut, like, I thought I was the tutor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailie had fielded this question five times in his head. \u201cTrue \u2014 the experiential learning and all that \u2014\u201d Alan nodded sagely \u201c\u2014 but you need to learn what to do before you can teach it, yes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess, but \u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood!\u201d Best to keep her from ditz-ing herself out of a logical conclusion. \u201cWe\u2019ll start off with note-taking. I like to have a memorized list of mnemonics, er,\u201d The unabashed confusion was back. \u201cI like to\u2026 remember things in a <i>special</i> way. For example, if the teacher keeps repeating a certain phrase \u2014 let\u2019s say, um, in World History, they keep saying that the causes of World War One were alliances, militarization, nationalism, and imperialism, we just need to make an anagram\u2026\u201d The same look. \u201cWe\u2026 just need to, um, move the letters around and we get M.A.I.N.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went on like this for thirty more minutes, Alan (surprisingly) rapt with attention, scribbling down notes in messy, looped-letter handwriting. It surprised even Hailie that, well, it felt kinda good! Sure, he didn\u2019t exactly command authority with sixty-two inches of height and a voice that sounded like it was promoting a new lip gloss but having someone interested in what he had to say was, well, nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to move on to the topic of note-taking, maybe gently pointing to Alan\u2019s notes as an example of what <i>not</i> to do when the subject at hand cut in with a coo that sounded like it should be two octaves higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d breathed Alan. \u201cLike, this is <i>so <b>cool</b></i>. I wish I could do this kinda thing for <i>my</i> job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like a small pinch, a brief moment of electric heat in his head that sent Hailie a-wobbling for a second. A hot flash? Was Alan old enough to get hotflashes? Anyways, it was distracting enough to necessitate a small peek down at his yellow-papered lesson plan, underneath the -NOTES- section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHm. That was odd. He couldn\u2019t read the handwriting. Well, sure, he could still read the <i>letters</i>, but, uh, they <i>clearly</i> weren\u2019t words. What did \u2018shrt stncs\u2019 and \u2018abbr.\u2019 mean? He must have been writing too fast near the end. No matter, he could work from memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Alan, when you\u2019re taking notes, you, uh, need to write down what they say.\u201d That didn\u2019t seem right. Well, it <i>was</i> right, but something was... wrong. Hailie combed his mind for a few seconds before snapping to with a chastened smile. \u201cSorry. That is to say, you need to write what they say, but not really.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan let out a too-petulant grunt of frustration and looked down at the plan. Actually, now that he looked at it, the same not-words were <i>everywhere</i>. A sheepish chuckle (that sounded more like a giggle) escaped his lips as he turned to Alan, tucking a strand of fiery hair behind an ear. \u201cSorry, uh, again. I j\u2014 I seem to have written this incorrectly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, lemme see,\u201d burbled Alan, taking the yellow sheet of paper before he could tell her not to. Her eyes scanned the paper before turning to Hailie once more, face twisted into the same vague bewilderment. This time, it was a <i>deserved</i> bewilderment: how could he write so much nonsense?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, it <i>totally </i>makes sense to me.\u201d The blood ran cold in Hailie\u2019s veins. \u201cIt\u2019s, like, the same thing you said earlier about the anemomnic thingy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMnemonic,\u201d Hailie automatically responded, despite his utter lack of recollection of the definition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I said! You just hafta, write in smaller words \u2014 like small enough so that they <i>aren\u2019t</i> words! See, you wrote here that your brain just <i>zwoops</i> in the meanin\u2019 if there aren\u2019t any vowels, like, uh, P-L-S, an\u2019 S-R-S!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that makes sense,\u201d mumbled Hailie, his head chin-down on the table\u2019s cold wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the tutoring session was mercifully brief, but followed the same humiliating routine: Alan cheerfully explaining all of Hailie\u2019s written concepts back to him in a mess of upspeak and \u2018like\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was able to pass his numb shock off as a dizzy spell and wave off all of Alan\u2019s concerned efforts to get him \u2018like, <i>anything</i> to eat,\u2019 by citing the study room\u2019s \u2018NO FOOD OR DRINK\u2019 sign. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe realized specifically <i>why</i> it had happened on the bus ride home, and couldn\u2019t help but think about that magic was a <i>bitch</i>. Weren\u2019t spells or charms or whatever supposed to have a <i>consistent</i> verbal component? Shouldn\u2019t Alan have had to look him in the eye, and say \u2018I teach you something something something?!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. Apparently not. Apparently, magic only had to interpret any of Alan\u2019s vague \u2018I want\u2019 statements as absolute commands, like some asshole genie out of some stupid tropey cautionary tale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried continuing his existing flowchart to destress and sort things out, but it didn\u2019t help at all. The first five minutes of the attempt were spent doodling a flower-studded box to put the next step in, and the next six involved hi nibbling on the pen\u2019s plunge like some secretary pinup model while thinking of what to put down, and the ensuing three were wasted on adjusting the box\u2019s area after he had underestimated his handwriting\u2019s size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took <i>work</i> now, which, coupled with distinct memories of accomplishing the same amount of work in less than half the time, just made him feel like complete and utter <b>shit</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t even produce a good option. \u2018Don\u2019t meet up with Alan,\u2019 written in a loopy, girly font. It\u2019s not like it was even an <i>option</i>. If he decided to welch on a meeting, Vi would be on him like white on rice, and if she wasn\u2019t vengeful, she\u2019d be <i>smug</i>, which almost seemed worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk back to Alan\u2019s house was better than the run to the bus \u2014 no urgency means no running means a <i>massive</i> reduction in chest-rebounding \u2014 but Hailie\u2019s feet dragged the whole way back.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

These were apparently his \u2014 er, Alan\u2019s friends. Were they going clubbing? Did community-college girls go clubbing on Wednesday nights?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind racing to think of excuses \u2014 could he say that he was on his period or would they know? \u2014 he walked into the bustling living room, where he was greeted by a tanned, leggy blonde\u2019s cool wave; a gothy-looking brunette\u2019s sharp nod of acknowledgment; and a pear-shaped Asian girl \u2014 who still had three inches on him, Hailie bitterly noted \u2014 jumped up and encircled him in a tight hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how was your <i>date</i>?\u201d \u2014Kimmy, he thought \u2014 mischievously whispered into his ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTher\u2014 It wasn\u2019t \u2014\u201d Hailie\u2019s stammering, once again, was eerily in character as the girl sat down with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you say, Kim?\u201d shot the goth girl, her voice edged with suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was just a <i>joke</i>, Judy, <i>relax</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me to relax, <i>you</i>\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe potential-catfight was interrupted by another laugh from Mrs. Morrison, who gave the girls another practiced affectionate smile. \u201cYou remind me of my girlfriends back in college,\u201d she sighed wistfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s lovely to hear,\u201d said the blonde with her own serene smile to match, \u201cWe\u2019re pretty tight knit at\u2026 our job, but Hailie\u2019s the glue that keeps us all together.\u201d Another smile, this time aimed at Hailie, who returned a shaky one. Job friends? This was new information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you girls are so sweet,\u201d cooed Mrs. Morrison. \u201cMeeting at a grocery store of all places!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that remark, Judy and Kimmy exchanged a meaningful look that was then aimed at Hailie. The blonde didn\u2019t seem to be as waylaid at the quarrelsome two, though, and brushed a lock of hair behind her ear before continuing: \u201cYeah, retail brings the unlikeliest of sorts together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailie\u2019s silent-listener role seemed to be over as Alan\u2019s mom turned to him and said, \u201cWell, dear, it\u2019s time to get changed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Were moms supposed to encourage their daughter\u2019s parties, or was that a rich-parent thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Morrison gave him a \u2018come-on-dear\u2019 look as Kimmy giggled. \u201cYour job, dear. Remember yesterday? You talked for <i>ages</i> about carpooling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan put a hand to his cheek in fake realization to maybe recover some dignity. Alan <i>did</i> say something about a job. \u201cOh, um, yeah! I\u2019ll just, go\u2026 and get changed.\u201d Which grocery store did Alan work at? The one with the green apron or \u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>glk</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis unsteady totter for the stairs was interrupted by a Judy-snagged shirt. \u201cHail, uh, forgot her uniform at work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, Hailie could tell that something was up. Something that these girls \u2014 or, more likely, Alan \u2014 wanted to keep hidden. So, in an attempt to not ruin the complex web of confidentiality that he was apparently caught in, he did what the original owner of this body did best: play dumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s right!\u201d he faux-exclaimed, and judging by the thumbs up that Kimmy surreptitiously gave him, that was the right response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we should, uh, get going n\u2019 stuff,\u201d said Kimmy, driving Hailie by the hips towards the door, waving the other girls with her. \u201cIt was <i>really</i> nice to meet you, Mrs. Morrison!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou too, Kimmy, Judy, Rebecca! Feel free to come back anytime!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks!\u201d exclaimed all three girls as they went out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimmy continued shoving Hailie all the way to the minivan, where he was packed into the backseat alongside the bubbly girl. Judy took the passenger seat, and \u2018Rebecca\u2019, the driver\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence prevailed in the car until Kimmy turned to Hailie with a serious expression that looked plain <i>wrong</i> on the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know, Hail, you really <i>should</i> tell her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy snorted from the front seat. \u201cNo she <i>shouldn\u2019t</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimmy bristled once more at the dark-makeupped girl. \u201cAnd why not?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKim, if you could see your thirteen-year-old self, would <i>you</i> tell her tha\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019d think it was bad<b>ass</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailie could practically <i>hear</i> Judy\u2019s eyeroll. \u201cFine then; would you tell your mom back then what your dream job was?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimmy deflated. \u201cI guess not\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe keys turned in the ignition, bringing the car to life with a rumble that made everyone but the blonde jump. \u201cIt\u2019s fair for Hailie to not want to tell her mom, <b><i>but</i></b>\u2014\u201d She turned back to level a look of grave importance at Hailie, \u201c\u2014 you <i>should</i> tell her eventually. Honesty is important.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-alright.\u201d For one femtosecond, Hailie weighed the benefits of telling them that he was actually the tutor \u2014 and see how they liked <i>that</i> honesty \u2014 but getting Hailie locked up in an insane asylum probably wouldn\u2019t get him any points with Vi or Alan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe traced vague shapes on the car window\u2019s condensate as the car traveled down the neighborhood\u2019s road, hoping that the ingenuous activity would discourage conversation \u2014 and it did, for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy did the airhead attract maternal friends like flies to honey? First Vi, then this Freudian trio of attractive girls! Was it some kind of pheromone or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat aside, this was <i>not</i> an auspicious turn of events. In the magic-trade-statement, Alan had made reference to her <i>job</i>. Tutoring was the only thing that Hailie could ostensibly call his job, and now, all of his (considerable) skill at the subject was gone, presumably replaced with an affinity for\u2026 whatever Alan did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hoped to <i>God</i> her job wasn't stripping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What really scares you is that each time you mixed up your names it took a little longer for you to realise that you'd done so.  Were you actually slowly starting to consider the switch normal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike, you stay here, I'm going to go find mom.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you leave the car to find your mother, it's still bothering you that you're still calling your little sister by your name, but you can't help it and decide to let things go for now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the station had seemed abandoned when you came through it initially, the subway cars are reasonably well populated now.  Not packed by any stretch, but certainly not deserted.  As you wander through the cars looking for your mother you notice some of the people are watching you closely.  Mostly it's women watching you with looks of slight concern on their faces, but you also notice the very occasional creepy-looking man watching you too, which worries you a little as you remember Mike's -- no, Missy's, you correct yourself -- comment about everyone playing along with mom before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you exit the first car you searched, a very attractive young woman walks up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you lost sweetie?\" Her voice is gentle, in the tone mothers use when trying to comfort a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" you reply, a little un-nerved by the fact that this woman seems to think you're a little girl, especially since you think she's quite hot, \"I'm just looking for my mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, little girls like you shouldn't be wandering through the subway all alone, especially not between cars.  That's dangerous; you could get really hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just need to find my mom, I'll be OK,\" you're more than a little annoyed that this eminently date-able girl seems to view you as a little girl, but she seems to take your annoyance as fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we find your mommy together?  Is that OK dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realise that she's not going to give up on this any time soon and decide it's just going to be easier to let her lead you through the train until you find your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady smiles, \"Such a polite little girl.  But you can just call me Rachel.  And what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you don't want to answer and hear yourself say what you know is coming, you decide that it's better to be polite.  \"I'm Missy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a precious name!  It's perfect for a pretty little girl like you,\" Rachel beams as she walks with you through the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh a bit inside.  Missy's name always had fit her perfectly; she was the sort of perfectly adorable little blonde girl who loved her dollies and her dresses and anything pink that everyone expected to have a name like hers.  And now you had that name, and treatment from other people to go along with it.  At least you still remembered your real name, you think, wondering how you'll manage to remember to respond to the right name...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MISSY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instinctively react to your mother shouting your new name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young lady!

It's as though your brain is slowly re-wiring in order to make you think your name actually is Missy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have been hurt or someone could have grabbed you!\"  Your mother is clearly upset with you, but she calms herself to talk with Rachel, \"Thank you so much for helping Missy find me.  Her brother was supposed to be watching her, but she has a real talent for wandering off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel just smiles, \"It's no trouble.  I'm a nanny to help pay for college, or at least, I was until my last family moved.

You can't get off the train until it stops moving anyway and all you'd accomplish by forcing yourself free would be to make everyone think a child was throwing a temper tantrum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel,\" you ask, deciding to try to at least see if people actually saw a small girl when they looked at you or if they still saw you and just reacted as though they expected you to be a small girl.  \"How tall am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly girl,\" she laughs, \"I don't know without measuring you, but I'd guess you're about 6 feet of adorable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at least you haven't changed, even if everyone else is treating you weird.  It's a partial relief anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally get back to the original tram car, it's still deserted except for your sister, Michael, er, Missy, you remind yourself.  It's getting harder and harder to remember to use the \"right\" names, even in your own head.  You remember that you used to be Michael and that your sister used to be Missy, but now it just seems natural to call yourself Missy and her Michael.  And now that Rachel's here, you can't even really force yourself to use your old names without your new nanny thinking something was weird.  Lovely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel sits down next to your sister and motions for you to sit down too.  As you sit down, Rachel starts up a conversation with with your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi!  I'm Rachel, you must be Michael,\" Rachel brushes some stray hair out of her face and smiles brightly at your sister.  \"I found your sister after she wandered off and your mother asked me to help you look after her.  I'm really glad I said yes.\"  Rachel blushes slightly as she says the last sentence and you realise that Rachel's flirting with your sister.  Wonderful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation goes on for a while and you can tell that your sister is completely oblivious to what's going on, but is enjoying the fact that people are still treating her like you.  Finally you've had enough and you tug on Missy's sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike, can I talk with you for a second?  Sister to brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel handles the interruption surprisingly well and lets the two of you retreat to the other side of the tram car while she stays put.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike, she's flirting with you.

I don't wanna date date her,\" she whispers back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I do,\" you protest.  \"Honestly, I just wish thought about her like I do so you wouldn't screw things up and I'd have a shot with her when we fixed whatever's happening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the words leave your mouth, you're suddenly confused.  Why would you want to date your nanny?  When you think about Rachel, all you can think about now is hanging out and playing together; any idea of romance seems gross.  You remember that only moments ago you were wondering what she looked like beneath her tank top, but now that doesn't seem important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister is looking equally surprised, but is now stealing glances back at Rachel with obvious interest.  You realise that whatever's going on, it works regardless of whether it's your or your sister making the wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden idea seizes you and you try to wish that your sister would think of Rachel the way a seven-year-old girl would.</span></div></div>",

You have to do something to keep this whole situation from going even further downhill and in the increasing panic you blurt out the first thing that comes to your mind in an attempt to switch at least something back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish Missy only knew what a seven-year-old girl should know about romance and the birds and the bees!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There,</i> you think, <i>that should take care of things.</i>  Even better, you'd been able to call your sister by the correct name.  Oddly though, you notice that she's still stealing glances back at Rachel and smiling at her.  Oh well, at least the wish made sure that she didn't know about the stork bringing babies when a mommy and daddy made their special wish for one...  Wait, was that right?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Missy, I think you were right about Rachel,\" your sister interrupts your confusion as you're trying to figure out why the whole stork thing seemed like it wasn't what you'd been thinking just a moment before, but with the interruption it all suddenly makes sense.  Thanks to the earlier name switch, you're Missy!  Instead of calling your sister by the correct name you'd accidentally wished yourself into thinking like a seven-year-old girl, at least as far as relationships and...  you struggle to think of the word... kissy stuff with boys was concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly your face is telegraphing your confusion as you sister giggles a little bit, \"Forget something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scowl at him, uh, her, you correct yourself, as she continues.  \"Don't worry, I promise I won't screw anything up with Rachel, OK?  I definitely don't want to now anyway.  Do grown-up boys think like this a lot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...  I don't remember,\" you're forced to admit.  \"Just be nice to her, OK?  She was really nice when I was looking for mom and she'd be a really cool nanny.\"  You find yourself thinking of how much you want to be like Rachel.  Even though you know it's just because of the earlier wish that your sister thought about her like you did the feelings are still very much there.  This whole situation was getting very confusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise.\"  Your sister smiles at you.  Clearly she's still enjoying whatever's going on.  You, on the other hand, are increasingly worried.  Not only does everyone seem to think you're your own little sister, you've got the worldly knowledge of her as well.  Plus, when you look at Rachel you can't help but see her as someone you want to be like; she's all grown up and cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, it's really cool to learn how you think Missy,\" your sister continues, standing up to head back over to Rachel, \"But I kinda wish...\"</span></div></div>",

You still knew how to write your name. You were relieved that the knowledge was still there, you remembered (her) first elementary school year... how hard it was to learn to write your name, even though you still have a hard time with the numbers and wished you knew how to tell time. So far, all those days with Miss Beckett, learning how to write, the P.E class, practicing ballet with the other girls, and playing with your girl friends from elementary school were still in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess Mike didn't get her wish. Good,\" you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile your sister's head was filled with new school knowledge. She now remembered (your) high school years, how she was not the top of the class student but one of the best, her days as quarterback of the male football team, all those years working out in the gym developing muscles and strength, hanging out with her teammates, great days! All that to be good enough to get in college to study the undergraduate major Exercise and Sport Science as she had always been interested in fitness and becoming a personal trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at herself after making the last wish and suddenly she asked angrily \"What did you do that Missy?!\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean Mike?\" you said. \"You were the one that wished to take away my education level.  Luckily for both of us, it didn't work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it would have been really weird. I mean not to be rude Missy, but I wouldn't like to know all those girly ballet courses,\" said your sister.<br>\r\n\"Well Mike, I wouldn't like to remember playing football.  That sport is for dirty dumb boys,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to you, your sister was asking why did you had her muscled body as she remember having it. She worked hard for it when she was in high school and you tried to steal it. So she was planning to get it back, plus how weird it would be for her to practice with his small and frail brother body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Rachel interrupted...</span></div></div>",

Maybe it's because you didn't exactly wish to swap something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish Mike would think about Rachel the way I do,\" you try. Still nothing. You rapidly attempt several other permutations of the wish, including forcing yourself to say \"Missy\" instead of \"Mike\", but none of them work, leading you to the unnerving conclusion that you're not allowed to undo your wishes. You almost feel foolish for thinking it could be that easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point Missy, seemingly oblivious to your mumbled wishes, is outright staring in confusion and wonder at Rachel. Rachel giggles quietly and waves, clearly enjoying the attention from what she thinks is an attractive young man. You scratch your head; you're pretty sure you ought to be frustrated by this, but now it's hard to convince yourself you should want the treatment your sister is getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is what you were thinking about her?\" Missy asks quietly, finally turning back to you. \"I don't get it. Why would you wanna see her with her clothes off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't want that anymore, but when you think about it you still know the answer to that question. Well, this is just about the most awkward thing ever. Not wanting to teach your little sister about the birds and the bees, you avert your eyes from her expectant face and refrain from answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, I'm all confused,\" she pouts, glancing at Rachel again. \"I wish I understood this stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the words \"I wish\" fills you with dread. You really hope Missy can't just steal your knowledge of... uh... whatever you weren't telling her just now. Crap, you can't remember. The wish must have worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy's eyes widen. \"Whoa,\" she says. \"So you... so that's how... wow, I'm really not supposed to know this stuff, am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems a bit disturbed by whatever secret of yours she just learned. You desperately try to recall what it was. All you know is, you wanted to see Rachel naked for some reason. You wanted to do... something with her. You're at a loss as to what you'd be so intent on doing with some lady you just met, even if she does seem nice.</span></div></div>",

Another day of working yourself to the bone, you were desperate to get home and into a comfy bed. But you got out later than usual, forgetting that your usual train didn't run so late. And so you took a chance on this train in this lesser known station. Never set foot in it until today, and while you otherwise might have been worried about the unfamilair territory, that ended quickly once you took a seat. And then started to lay down. And then closed your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hello? Please, wake up!</i> The voice was getting clearer now, and you could feel someone poking your back repeatedly. A nice, peaceful nap interrupted by some well-intentioned but annoying individual. But now paying attention to the sensations hitting your body, you feel one arm is very numb. You must have slept on a nerve or pinched it somehow. And then you get your face off of the seat and realize your left arm and leg were both hanging off the side of the seat this whole time. You could've been easily confused for a passed-out drunk in this position! But finally you take the opportunity to sit up and stretch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, phew! I was worried you fainted or something.\" Turning to your left you see a young woman with green hair, probably in her twenties. She's dressed in an orange tracksuit and black shorts. \"Huh, now that I got a better look at you, you don't look like you're from around here. Hmm...\" She pulled out a red device and held it in front of you. A new phone, maybe? Nah, too wide... \"Wow, you're from so far away! Cool!\" You had to admit, after being forcefully woken up, this one-sided conversation was starting to get on your nerves...how would she even know where you're from? The girl definitely didn't notice the look on your face, though. \"It's weird to see you all by yourself, too...is your Trainer with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA personal trainer? Were you being confused for some famous athlete, maybe? You finally decided to speak up. \"Listen, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops! I forgot it was pointless to ask, sorry!\" She says dismissively. You're almost in shock at her response. <i>That was pretty rude!</i> \"Welp, just in case, let me try...THIS!\" With swift movements, the girl grabs something from her pocket and throws it- directly at you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW! What the-?!\" You're distracted by the pain for a second and don't see what the object was. You vigorously rub the side of your head while glaring at the girl, unaware that your previously short hair began growing and making its way to your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so you're not wild. My bad. Your cry sounded pretty cute, though!\" The girl sheepishly grins as the train grinds to a halt. \"Oh, there's my stop. Nice meeting you!\" And as quickly as you had met this girl, she vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...what the hell just happened?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alright, so your first encounter on this strange subway was really weird. But who doesn't have their fair share of weird subway stories? You decide to put it past you as you notice the sun has already started to come up. You try to take another nap, but are quickly distracted as you notice the next set of passengers boarding the train. The young woman you first saw took small steps in her short-heeled shoes as she made her way to a seat several feet next to you. As she sat, she took a moment to smooth out her green sleeveless dress and take off the sun hat she wore, blonde hair shining beautifully. Overall she gave off an air of wealth and class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment of surprise came when she pulled out what you recognized to be a Pok\u00e9 Ball; as it opened, a red light coalesced into a humanoid shape, until it became obvious what it was- a Gardevoir! An actual Pok\u00e9mon! As it was already sitting down, the woman- presumably its Trainer- took the opportunity to lie down, resting her head on her Pok\u00e9mon's lap before quickly shutting her eyes. The Gardevoir smiled as she started to caress her Trainer's hair, much like a parent would with a young child. This went on for a few minutes, and all you could do was stare in confusion and awe at the impossible sight. Or at least, previously-impossible sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Good morning,</i> a distinctly feminine voice called out from inside your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell?\" Your heart jumped as you looked around, trying to understand what had just happened. This time you notice the Gardevoir making eye contact, with one digit on her lips. <i>I apologize for startling you, but please try not to disturb the Mistress while she rests.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to follow her example, you continue the conversation inside your head. <i>Oh...so that was you who greeted me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Indeed,</i> the Gardevoir replied. <i>It's quite strange to see a foreigner in Hoenn, but welcome all the same.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your old days of playing Pokemon, you remember that's where one of the games takes place...none of this is making much sense to you, but you figure it'd be better to play along for now instead of going crazy on a train. For all you know this might just be a crazy dream! <i>Thanks...so, what's there to do around here?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Plenty. But for someone like you...</i> she put a hand up to her chin and thought for a bit. <i>I'd recommend a Pok\u00e9mon Contest. You'd be a top contender for the Beauty category, most certainly.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer suggestion was strange- if you remember correctly, those contests were for Pok\u00e9mon, not people. And yet you couldn't help but feel a certain level of pride from the Gardevoir's compliment. You held back a weird urge to pose in front of her. <i>You're joking, right?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>As a three-time winner of that exact category, I am completely serious.</i> The Gardevoir smiled. <i>In fact...from one lady to another...</i></span></div></div>",
