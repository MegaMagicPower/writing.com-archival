Her mother Moira felt the same way as Thea, Ollie was back but still away from them, which was frustrating at some point. Thea loved her brother, and expected they'll get time together so she could tell him everythings that happenned to her when he was gone, but she didn't get the chance too. What Oliver could possibly do on day and nights ?  She didn't know, but what was certain was that thea's brother actually \"died\" on that island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea decided to live her life as if Oliver was dead, and did her best to convince herself that the new Oliver was not her brother, but still, this morning she needed for some reason to check his room, after all, she hoped to see her brother still sleeping in his bed, thought she was certain than once again he was not there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to Thea's surprise, something was different this time. She actually found her brother in his bed...but he was at the size of a bug ! at first she couldn't believe it and it took her sometimes to realize that this was reality and she was not just dreaming..Oliver Queen..shrunk, at her mercy. Thea couldn't think a better opportunity to make him stay close to her. She first wondered how was that possible, but at the end she didn't really care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver oppenned his eyes, and realized the same strange thing than his sister : he was shrunk ! He quickly noticed the figure of his giant sister next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Thea ? What happenned ? Why am i so...small ? \" Oliver asked worried. After all it's been years he didn't feel so..helpless. He only started to chase all the names on his father's book, and now he was shrunk, this couldn't be a coincidence !<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I...don't...know...ollie\" Thea replied honestly. But something in her gaze was making Oliver more worried than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thea, i need you to help me.  I have...some contacts that can help, \" Oliver said, his fear about his new size was enought to make him feel the need to tell his sister all the truth, thought that he tried to keed secret his identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Contacts ? Ollie will you finally tell me what's going on ?! \" Thea said almost angry. \" You disappear for days and nights, and now i find you shrunk in your room, and all you say is that you have contacts to help you ?! I don't know who you are !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver didn't know what to answer, maybe telling her the truth was the best option after all. But he didn't know how Thea would react, and with her giant size, he was competely at her mercy now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea hesitated for a moment, but she decided to grabbed Oliver in her giant fist. Oliver get caught, his arms all along his body, by his own sister and was raised to her giant confused face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I'm not sure you're truly my brother...\" she began . \" I don't recognize you, what are you doing every nights ? Why don't you spend your days with me and Mom ? \" The girl asked sadly. It was a strange feeling to have her brother trapper in her hand, but her frustration with him, was taking over everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver then..</span></div></div>",

Thea asks, not sure where this was going and hoped it wasn't an attempt to distract her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That... was me. There's a notebook on my table filled with names, given to me by our dad before... before he shot himself' he shudders, still unable to get the image out of his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait, you said ... dad really killed himself?' Thea bites her lip, eyes misting slightly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah Thea, whatever these people did or are going to do, the guilt drove him to kill himself after telling me to fix his mistakes. and that's what I've been doing, taking out one name on that list at a time, sometimes more permanently than I would like. And the annoying thing is I don't even have all the names 'he mutters the last part but he's close enough for Thea to hear him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why?' she asks causing Oliver to sigh once more<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Dad didn't exactly explain any of this to me, and I ended up on a deserted island so tried to make a fire. Some pages were sacrificed from what I thought to be a blank notebook before I noticed the names were written in a heat reactive ink. But all that means is I need to take out as many as I can, so the ones that remain don't get any bright ideas'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea whistles 'Damn Ollie this is insane, and let's not even begin with the fact you've got quite a few skills you definitely didn't have when you left'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver chuckles mirthlessly 'Of the things I gained from that island, the ability to survive almost anything I am glad for, the fact I know at least 50 ways to kill you... not right now obviously  but in general... not so much'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea nods as she walks over to the desk and the book, seeing several pages crossed out 'Jeez Ollie you've been busy' she gasps to which he nods<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I know, I've ben trying to send a message, hit hard and fast so they don't try anything funny before I'm done. There's also the chance one of them is the cause of my shrinking'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Depends, is palmer on the list?' Thea asks mostly as a joke, then has to explain when Oliver looks at her like she's grown a 2nd head (and given she's technically a giantess to him it wouldn't surprise him as much) 'If you weren't my brother Ollie, this situation would be really... intense' she blushes in embarrassment which Oliver mirrors and coughs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If it makes you feel any better, were you anyone but yourself or mom, I'd probably agree with that statement. Still doesn't explain Palmer though'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Palmer tech specialises in miniaturisation tech, or miniaturising the necessary components so they can do more with the space they have. So are there any?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver slightly hates himself a little but he shrugs 'I honestly don't know, I tend to research about 2 pages ahead of myself, but there are a lot of pages in that notepad' Thea nods, putting Oliver down and flicking through The List<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Palmer, Palmer, Palmer... There it is, Anna Palmer' she cheers, googling with her phone then frowning 'It says she's dead, been dead a couple years now. Guess that's a bust'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver nods 'Yeah but it's one less name on  the list and one less person wrecking the city. Will you help get me to Fe... my contacts now?' he asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) This is all way to much for Thea to process, needing time to get her head around everything and not trusting Oliver not to do something stupid at his reduced size, she decides to keep him with her, calling it a chance for them to get <i><b>reacquainted</b></i> after so long apart<br>\r\n2) Thea agrees to bring him to try get help... on the condition he trains her and allows her to help. These bastards are wrecking her city too, now she knows she can't just sit back and let them get away with it (Oliver flip-flops between annoyed and proud at Thea's reaction to all this)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Oliver thought Thea's answer would be obvious and that she would help him, but the girl seemed hesitant. Ollie guessed it was probably too much information for his sister to accept, and this was indeed a great part of what was in Thea's mind right now. But there were another part that he forgot,  it was that Thea wanted to have her brother close to her, at last for a whole day. She knew she couldn't be so selfish, the city needed the Hood after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Thea what's wrong ? \" he asked uncertain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Ollie, here's the deal. You stay with me for a whole day, and please, just PLEASE try to be yourself and relaxed during that time. Then we will focus on your small problem. \" She offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Thea, i don't know who's after me but considering i've shrunk in my own bed, that personn knows my identity. So we don't really have time to waste before he tries to attack our Mansion. \" He explained, feeling sorry that he had to disappoint his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Don't you trust our bodyguards and our securities system ? \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Not since i became The Hood. Please Thea, i can promise you a whole day together once i'll be normal sized again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea thought for a moment, Ollie had a point, but her heart was talking more than her brain right now. Oliver was small, in her hand, and she wanted just a single day, who could possibly attack the Queen's Mansion till then ? As she was about to give her answer, both Ollie and Thea heard a familiar voice as Moira Queen entere the room, forcing Thea to turn back, keeping her hand holding Ollie hidden in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oliver don't make me...Thea ? Where's your brother ? \" The mature woman asked, not surprise thought that her son was not there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" He...didn't spend the night at home, as usual. \" The girl replied, knowing that sadly, it was probably one of the firsts night that Oliver slept at the Mansion, but she couldn't tell the truth to her mom, not yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well, at last i have you for the lunch. We'll have some guests and i'm counting on you, since i can't count on your brother. \" Moira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Sure.\" Thea's answer was suspicious. Moira thought she would have to fight again with her daughter, but for some reason she just accepted. \" I'll see you later then...\" the mother left the room, and Thea brought back Oliver in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Thea, please next time don't squeeze too hard, and don't keep your hand near your...ass. \" Oliver said with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Sorry about that, i was just too scared mom finds you like this...Plus, i've choose to...\"</span></div></div>",

Thea chuckles at her own joke '...I never said you were going to make a public appearance' she then grins, one that sends a shiver down Oliver's spine, he'd seen that same look on Walker and Talia, but due to her size, his little sister scared him the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That are you planning?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You you're going to attend the lunch, in my butt' she patts her cute ass with her free hand, smiling widely as she does<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Are you kidding me? I don't want to spend the day in your ass' Oliver yells and this time even Thea knows it's definitely anger<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Really Ollie, it's just for the lunch, that's like an hour tops. Besides it's the best option you have, the others being my bra or my shoe. I don't know if you're any more durable at this size, and don't want to find out you're not by stepping on you and hearing you go crunch' Thea explains<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Makes sense, and your...' Oliver can't say it so just mines her general upper body. causing her to laugh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'My brother, can kick the shit out of street thugs but can't say breasts around his big little sister. But really, you don't want to be near my ass, if I'm being honest I don't really want you there either, but there was no way I was going to let you touch my breasts... unless you want to?' Thea smirks, bringing him rather close to the small amount of cleavage she was sporting<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'NO, NO, I'm fine, really don't need to see my sister's breasts any time soon or ever at all' Oliver quickly relents causing Thea to chuckle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Exactly. So as you can see, my ass is your only option, so try not die back there' she teases lightly before using her free hand to peel back her pants and underwear, revealing her rather pale ass to Oliver. Internally she's cackling that even considering how much of a man whore Oliver used to be, the biggest ass he'll ever see belongs to his little sister, just before she slides him into her crack, then lets go of the clothing, letting it snap back into place. A quick shimmy of her hips and she's back to normal, as though she doesn't have a bug sized vigilante in her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver just couldn't catch a break could he: shrinking down to bug size, getting caught by his (rightfully) annoyed little sister, being forced to reveal himself to her, and now he's trapped in her ass for at least the next hour or so. And it was not going to be pleasant for him, sure Thea took good care of her body so even her ass smelled of fruits and flowers but her strong gluts slammed into him quite strongly with every step, at least in his mind answering the increased durability question: if her were normal sized doing an equivalent of this he'd be dead by now. He hoped he'd have a reprieve when she sat down but NOPE, not only did she flop down rather carelessly but Thea Queen was if nothing else queen of the fidgeters, constantly shifting her positon and seat as things went on, some she probably didn't even notice she was doing, but Oliver did, when her every move basically drops a mountain on top of him he couldn't not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea sighs as she listens to her mother drone on and on about something she really didn't care about, which didn't help with trying to keep her mind off playing with the helpless being trapped between her ass cheeks, at his size it didn't matter to her subconscious he was her brother, as long as he didn't go anywhere '<i><b>naughty</b></i>' it didn't matter to her, he was just something to toy with. Which was why she was trying to subtly do some of the iron buns exercises she'd seen on the tv, tone her perky rear and play with little Ollie, 2 birds, one butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You okay there Thea?' the youngest Queen turns, seeing Malcolm Merlyn beside her looking concerned, she smiles, since the ship sank him and Walter had been a real help with this family, she felt she could tell him anything... didn't mean she was going to tell him everything though, this was her little secret to keep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm fine, just dealing with somethings, plus these lunches bore me to tears' she answers quietly, mostly so Moria can't here her and give her the patented 'disapproving stare' that had become common between them these last few years. Merlyn nods and puts his hand on her shoulder<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You know if you need anything, I'm there for you right'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea smiles and nods 'Yeah, I know. You've been good to our family. You're a good man'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the lunch ended Thea couldn't leave fast enough, if it had been a few years later there would be speculation Thea had become a speedster, but for now it was just weird she was gone in like a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now she's done with her obligations and it's just her and Oliver in her room, what will she do with Oliver next?</span></div></div>",

This isn't a game...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's not only your problem either Oliver' Thea retorts, the shrunken vigilante slightly cowed by the fact she's calling him by his actual name 'He was my dad too, this burden is left on his children's shoulders and I'm not letting you do this alone. So either let me help or I'm just going to keep you here with me till you do, there's no way I'm letting you go anywhere at your current size alone'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver's mouth opens and closes a few times without sound coming out before finally sighing 'Speedy... fine we're doing this, but you're not going out on missions till I think you're skilled enough to handle yourself, especially if I'm not back to normal size by then. Agreed?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You got it Ollie' Thea cheers, nuzzling the shrunken Hood to her cheek, making him blush at the awkwardness or Thea's random affections at her current size 'So, where to?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Verdant. I have a base beneath the Club, once their my contact should either be there or there will be working coms to get in touch with her' Oliver explains, Thea nods and quickly drops him into the breast pocket of her shirt before running out the door, unfortunately due to his size and location there was nothing Oliver could or would grab so he was bounced around in her enthusiasm to get there, until she got to her motorcycle, then the bouncing stopped and was replaced by a gentle though constant vibration of the vehicle as she speeds through traffic to make it to the currently empty nightclub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was inside, only then did she remove Oliver from her pocket 'So, what now?' she asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Go to the door to the basement...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You don't have a basement'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes I do, it's just used for vigilante duties. Anyway, go to the door and enter the code I tell you, then we can see if she's there or not'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Can't we just get her attention through the cameras?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, it's quite possible she's not watching them, no need to when the club should be closed after all' Oliver replies, to which Thea nods. following the instructions and entering the 'Arrowcave' (Okay that was probably the other one, but it still counts), where she see's a surprisingly familiar face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Felicity?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Thea?!' the blond yelps 'You're not supposed to be down here, I mean, what are you doing here I missed you' she blabbers on before getting pulled into a hug by the brunette. While trapped in Thea's clenched fist, Oliver was glad he'd been moved, as otherwise he'd have been smothered under Felicity and Thea's combined boobage from the rather tight and squishy hug they were giving, Oliver glad the hand that made it's way to cup Felicity's butt had been the one he wasn't in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So, I'm guessing you're Ollie's contact in his Hood duties?' Thea asks after finally letting go of the blond<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yep, though why he told you I'll never know'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He has a small problem, and needed some help getting to you' she teases, placing Oliver on the table directly in front of Felicity 'It dd take letting me join the team to convince me to come, though mentioning you'd be here could have helped' she winks and Felicity blushes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ssssoo, what happened?' she asks, both Queens explaining what little they knew, the techie frowning at the lack of useful information<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, this is going to be difficult' the mutters<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But you can fix it right?' Oliver asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I think so, it'll probably require hacking Palmer Tech and Mercury Labs for any miniaturisation research but we should be fine... in a month or so'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'A MONTH! What am I supposed to do for a month at this size?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Keep in shape, train Thea, offer yourself up to Laurel as an apology and hope she doesn't smush you like the bug you appear to be' Felicity offers as suggestions, not really sure herself on their timeframe, though wasn't going to mention it to Oliver given his reaction to the month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Oliver is examined by Felicity, trying to find something that could help with changing him back to his original size<br>\r\n2) With nothing better to do Oliver has Thea badgering him into training her, working her through: archery, precision, strength training, flexibility, reflexes, etc some of which he was actually able to assist with (her reflexes and accuracy were improved trying to catch him to example) while others he was about as much help at his size as an instructor as an insole (something that came to mind for Thea during one time when his yelling was very unhelpful.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Ray's untimely demise in a fiery explosion Palmer Tech was left to Felicity, who during a lull in the insanity that came with being tech support for The Arrow (the joking title for her job, as Oliver has refused to give her a codename yet) decided to have a proper look at what remained of Ray's A.T.O.M. suit. The coding was simple for her, though the exact specifics were unfamiliar as Ray hadn't really explained what he had planned for his suit to be doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up a piece of the arm guard she weights it in her hand 'What do you do?' she mutters tiredly, before setting it down and continuing to work through the system 'Hm, A.T.O.M. beam? Did Ray actually get some of this suit finished before he died?' Felicity asks herself, nudging the enter key with her pinkie and getting a bolt of seep blue energy right in the chest, tossing her back and causing her to hit the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe comes to a little while later with a headache and a chill 'Ah, Ray if you weren't dead I'd... try and fail to kick your ass' she gives up trying to rant midway through and just sighs, only then did she realise something else was wrong (I blame head trauma for her slow reaction time). She was nude, practically buried under the blue dress she'd been wearing when she had last been conscious; Ray's beam had shrunk her... and only her, not even her glasses had shrunk with her (though she guesses that if she'd been wearing contacts she THEY would have, mostly because she didn't like to imagine her eyes exploding). Peaking her head out of the cloth of her dress and giving her surroundings a once over the blond guessed she was about 3-4 inches tall, not that big but workable, sort of. She was just glad she had all Ray's stuff brought to her office/lab, as otherwise she'd have been found by someone and most likely used as a test subject by now, the thought of being poked and prodded like she wasn't a person made her shudder, even if something about the current situation excited her. She just needed to get to her phone, which just typical for her was on the desk rather than on her person and therefore now on the floor because that would have been useful, and call Oliver, or maybe Laurel as she had a better grasp on subtlety, plus no offence to Oliver but Laurel seemed gentler, something her small body might just need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer plans fell apart the moment she heard yelling of her name, shortly followed by a brunette entering her office without knocking. Standing in her office, her current size looking more majestic than Venus or Artemis, was Thea Queen, aka Speedy, aka Oliver's sister, as well as another person who if they weren't all on the same crime fighting team Felicity was sure was too hot to admit she even knew her. While this made her plan to get her phone pointless it gave her a new and possibly better plan of getting Thea's attention. Sure her current situation meant she wasn't going to be running up to the younger Queen, as while her training/torture with Sara toned her a little it was nothing compared to Oliver, Sara, Nyssa or even Thea, plus the self conscious nerd inside her never went away and did we not just do a Greek Goddess comparison near the start of this paragraph. No instead she had to scream and yell while waving her arms, hoping Thea situational awareness was acute enough to pick up her small movements, or at least notice her dress in a messy clump right where she shrunk out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'THEA! THEA I'M DOWN HERE!' the blond techie screams as Thea passes her by, stopping only to pick up her phone (there goes that option) and turn to leave when her foot catches one of Felicity's discarded/lost heels, which in turn drew her attention to the dress and the shrunken Felicity partly hidden within<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What the?' she mutters before moving to investigate, the speed causing Felicity to speak in fear and shut her eyes tight 'Felicity! Is that you?' she feels Thea's warm breath on her skin as she opens her eyes, the girl leaning over her filling her entire field of vision<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond nods 'Yeah Thea, it's me'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Holy shit, how'd this happen?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I was working on Ray's old suit, the thing has a shrink ray built into the glove. Guess that's one of the reasons it's called the ATOM suit. I really need your help Thea, there is no way I'm going to be able to fix myself alone, will you help?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOptions:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Thea is happy to assist however she can, such as packing up Ray's suit parts and Felicity's clothes (as well as the blond herself), and brining everything to the Arrow Cave so they can be worked on privately. Whether everything reaches the lair intact and unbroken is up to the writer<br>\r\n2) Thea's had a crush of Felicity for a few years now, but the blond has always been pining for Oliver to the brunette's annoyance. But here it is, a chance for Thea to prove herself, show Felicity she's the better Queen to be the girlfriend of. And if that doesn't work, she's sure Felicity's cute little tush would be better served at her current size as her love pet. And she would be a kind and fair mistress, just like when she accidentally walked in on Sara with a shrunken Nyssa curled up in the younger Lance's deep cleavage.</span></div></div>",

Kara had to find a way to reason her, but this was going to be difficult to be heard from the place she was. All she could do for now was to endure every steps, and move of the giantess.

The giantess didn't take too long before she placed her foot in front of the car, but Dinah was expecting this, and managed to get around it a first time...then a second time...a third time. After 5 minutes Laurel decided she should put her foot directly on the car, not carrying about the fact Dinah could be heart. This was the most difficult part for the tiny woman who didn't know where's the foot was going to land, but somehow she managed to avoid every other stomps.

So she slinks up behind Nyssa, just as she'd been taught, her bust against her spine and her hands ghosting over the shorter woman's hips 'I know, but I worry, even if you're supposed to be a Demon, you're still my Nys' she whispers, kissing along her neck, feeling Nyssa relax just enough, before jamming the needle into her neck.

She had already packed everything, so she was able to leave rather quickly and be in Star in under 3 hours, which was lucky as she was beginning to feel movement between her breasts, Nyssa was coming to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip between the airport and Laurel's was quiet, Sara could feel Nyssa squirming and most likely screaming, demanding answers and cursing her name, but she needed this to be done somewhere private, and Laurel's apartment was the closest place. Luckily her sister was actually working so they had the place to themselves for the moment (Though in case they weren't Sara had already called Laurel on the ride over so she knew her baby sister as coming for a visit). The second the door closed Sara reached into her bosom and pulled out a fuming Nyssa<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sara Lance!' she growls and Sara knew if she was normal sized she'd be in the dog house, being called anything but beloved to her face meant Nyssa was annoyed with her 'What the Hell have you done?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well the obvious part is I took a leaf out of Stein's book and drugged you, then shrunk you and brought you to Star City so you could have a vacation. We could have a vacation. No assassins besides each other, no weird time anomalies, just some fun and relaxation' Sara smiles brightly before pouting, at which point Nyssa knew she was sunk, normal sized Sara pouts she had developed a resistance to, this thing, she could be asking Nyssa to get in her mouth as a midnight snack and the woman would still consider going through with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sigh, fine. I hope you have something nice planned' Nyssa grumbles to which Sara grins widely<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Sara uses the vacation as personal bonding time, sneaking around with Nyssa on her person, having secret, private moments together and occasional odd places to sleep together such as where Sara stayed as the Canary the first time she came back to Starling.<br>\r\n2) Sara tells as the Team Arrow girls about the vacation and Nyssa's shrunken status, hoping together they can make it fun and enjoyable for Nyssa, the woman needed some time away from having people flinch when she looks at them, at her current size even Felicity wouldn't be too worried about being killed by her, other than chocking on her if for some reason she eats her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everyone is talking and getting along and a few drinks are had, nothing major but just a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that everyone?\u201d Thea asks Sara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot quite.\u201d Sara smiles. \u201cLadies, I have a very special guest for you all.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone turns their attention to Sara, Sara smiles and pulls Nyssa out of her breasts. The girls run over to Sara as they see a naked tiny woman in Sara\u2019s hands. Caitlin and Felicity's mouth\u2019s drop as they wonder what could have done this, they try to think of all the possibilities on how this could have happened. Lena, Kara, Laura and Thea just stare at the tiny girl with a smile. They just can\u2019t believe that they are seeing a tiny woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d Kara smiles. \u201cLook at her, she is so adorable at this size, hi cutie.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyssa rolls her eyes, while she is flattered by Kara\u2019s comment she feels undermined by it at the same time, it makes her sound powerless and useless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did this happen?\u201d Felicity asks. \u201cI mean shrinking possibly is not really possible, what am I saying it\u2019s right in front of me but how did it happen, the only thing I can think of of this actually happening is through Palmer tech.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re correct,\u201d Sara smiles. \u201cI just used Ray\u2019s shrinking teach to shrink her, luckily for me it\u2019s very easy to use.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara smiles as all the girls stare at her tiny wife, she can tell that everyone wants to grab her and examine or play with her.

Nyssa bit her lips at the mix of pleasure and pain Kara's rough fondling and groping was doing to her, this was obscene, she was the Demon's head not some toy to this girl, but still... she was reaching a peak from how easily this girl has handled her. Luckily for her dignity Nyssa had a guardian angel to save her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kara darling, I don't think she's as durable as you think\" Lena whispers in her ear, breasts pressed against her spine and her long fingers try to gently loosen Kara's grip, luckily without leaving bruises on the Demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara blushes at her mistake \"Sorry Nyssa, I kind of got a little carried away, it happens sometimes when I'm excited\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyssa groans as she can now sit comfortably in the girls hand \"It's fine, I've been treated worse, not at this size but in general\" she hand waves, only then getting a proper look and her tormentor and saviour.... and holy shit they were stacked. While Sara was her one true love and the bustiest girl she'd ever known these 2 were doing a pretty good job, Kara just shy of her wife and Lena was large enough they'd be more than a handful to Nyssa's small hands even before her shrinkage. The orbs were intoxicating, particularly the ravenette's ivory cleavage her clearly expensive dress was showing off, she hoped Sara would find a way to get these women into the bedroom with them tonight, they hadn't actually managed to lure a couple before but these 2 seemed like a good option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you want to hold her?\" Kara offers, but Lena shakes her head with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you darling but I'm fine, watching you act like a child at Christmas was enough for now. Though I will definitely be taking a look at the device Sara shrunk her with\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do that tomorrow, or when the vacation is over, for now just enjoy yourself\" Sara says as she comes back in, passing the CEO a glass of scotch \"Kara says you like it?\" she grins as Lea necks it \"One of those days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you have no idea\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn\" Kara happily passes Kara onto the next girl and all Nyssa's arousal leaves her body in terror as the ice cold digits of Caitlin Snow become her newest home \"This is quite fascinating, I would love to examine the long term effects of shrinking on a person's vitals, though Ray refuses to let me perform any tests on him, not even Gideon and having her send me the data\" Caitlin frowns \"The breakthroughs we could achieve if human miniaturisation was safe and easy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't bore the girl to death Caity\" the scientist is teased but simple rolls her eyes and Nyssa is passed to the next one, the voices source which was Thea Queen, Sara's brainwashed murderer and right now someone looking at her like she wanted to eat her, let her have a guided tour of her reproductive system or simply rearrange her internal organs by putting a finger up her tiny ass \"My, Sara sure won the lottery with you, sexy, badass and willing to do all kinds of kinky shit with her no problem\" she grins and brings Nyssa on line with her plump lips \"We're going to have a lot of fun together, I promise\" she says, then pulls Nyssa into a kiss which envelops her entire head for a few seconds. \"Who wants a turn now?\" she calls, waving the shrunken woman in the air with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, oh me next, I'd like the chance to handle her, I mean well I suppose I would be have her in my hand...you know what just give her here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyssa rolls her eyes at the familiar rambling of Felicity Smoak, though when she finally did get a good look at her she was surprised to see the IT girl with her hair a wavy mess and her glasses askew. Then there was the smell when she was brought closer to her face, the deep scent of spirits, how much did this girl drink, or is she just that much of a lightweight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I always feared you, mostly for the ability to kill people without breaking a sweat, you could have probably killed me with your pinkie, or my own computer if you were feeling bitchy. But now, seeing you so small and helpless, I don't feel fear, if anything you should fear me\" at this point the blond opens her mouth wide and Nyssa finds her upper body put inside, lips closing around her hips. The moans rumble through her like thunder as Felicity's tongue bats her tits around and tries to violate her mouth by forcing it's tip in, all the while Nyssa practically swimming in alcohol diluted saliva. Finally, just when she was beginning to worry she would be passing out she was pulled free, flicking her spit soaked hair out of her face she see's it to be Sara with her hand on Felicity's wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as I hope we have a lot of fun during mine and Nyssa's vacation, I'd prefer you not use my wife to practice your skills for Ollie\" Sara growls and Nyssa suddenly feels dirty at the very idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity laughs \"Oliver? Please, he's with that whore who got knocked up and hid it from him, the fucking idiot. Girls are so much less of a hassle\" she gives a crooked grin as Sara lets her go \"I'd actually forgotten she was your wife now, didn't think to send any of us an invitation?\" Nyssa was surprised when the next thing to happen was Felicity pressing her against Sara's clothed vagina \"Such a sexy thing isn't she? In hind sight I'm not surprised you put a ring on it\" she purrs into Sara's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara chuckles as she frees Nyssa from Felicity's grip \"Why did nobody tell me Felicity was such a forward and fun drunk? We could have had a lot of fun, maybe even fucked before now. Or maybe we'd have shrunken you to use as a strap on while I had my way with Nyssa's little rose but, or she'd use you to plow me into the mattress\" she gives her a kiss before nuzzling Nyssa against her cheek \"Have fun love?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have very beautiful friends, I don't think I'll mind experimenting with them\" Nyssa replies honestly, to Sara's joy and amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, because that's part of the evening. Also for my lady\" Sara reaches over to the table and produces a shot glass of her wife's favourite drink \"For you\" Nyssa grins at her and gulps it down rapidly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) For the moment Nyssa is the only shrunken person and as such has free reign on all the sexy ladies at the party, some who are very happy to feel her rub(bed) against their breasts, sex and asses, as well as a few who take a little taste<br>\r\n2) Sara pulls out the shrink ray and quickly zaps a few of them, so they can all have some fun with tiny nude ladies.<br>\r\n3) For the moment things are too quiet and sober for any real fun, so Sara bides her time, with a few normal party games before getting to the hot and heavy stuff ;)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nyssa remains on the table and watches all the girls talk and drink. It's been a hour since anyone has grabbed her and that was Lena. Lena didn't do anything major to Nyssa as all she did was hold her on her hand and gave her the occasional pat on the head. She got a few rubs and squeezes on her ass and breasts but that's about it. She's surprised that no one has grabbed her and used her for more despite Sara's requests. Nyssa had to snap herself out of it, she can't believe that she wanted to be used for a toy in that manner. Nyssa smiles to herself as she knows that she is lying to herself. She loves being held with the occasional feeling up, all of the girls hands are nice and warm so their giant fingers curled around her body actually felt quite nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyssa sits down on the desk waiting for something to happen. While the thought of being forgotten came to mind she knows that can't be true because of their reaction to her earlier. Nyssa sees Caitlin and Thea whispering and giggling to each other. They would give Nyssa the occasional glace with more whispering. This can't be good. Nyssa sees that Caitlin doesn't look to happy she looks quite distressed. Thea's eyes lock onto Nyssa with a smile and she starts to walk towards her. This can't be good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea arrives at the table and curls her giant fingers around Nyssa's tiny form. Nyssa let's out a moan as she loved her warm fingers against her body. Thea brings Nyssa to her giant face with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Nyssa.\" Thea grins. \"Enjoying the party?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not to bad actually.\" Nyssa says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good.\" Thea smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea doesn't follow her conversion with Nyssa any longer. Thea tightens her grip and heads out of the party room into the hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea smiles as she sees Caitlin leaning against the wall nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got her.\" Thea grins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to do this any more Thea.\" Caitlin says. \"Its wrong to take advantage to Nyssa like this, not only that but we are stealing her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are not stealing,\" Thea reassures. \"We are just doing what Sara told us to do. Have fun with the tiny woman.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea rolls her eyes at Caitlin's reaction, she's hoping that Frost would come out a some point instead of Caitlin as Thea thinks she could be more fun. Thea gives Caitlin a smile as she is hoping that she can have some fun with Caitlin. Nyssa on the other hand is conflicted on all of this. She's annoyed and angry that Thea had pretty much kidnapped her and are taking advantage of her but at the same time she found the two quite hot and seeing what they would do to her would be interesting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in Caitlin,\" Thea smiles. \"This will be fun, I promise.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea pulls Caitlin's shirt down a bit and slides Nyssa between her breasts. Caitlin can't help by smile seeing the tiny woman trapped their. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll even let you have first play.\" Thea smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is so sweet of you Thea,\" Caitlin smiles. \"It really is, but I'm still not sure we should be going though with this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea rolls her eyes, she places her hands on Caitlin's hips and pulls her in tight. Thea locks lips with Caitlin and passionately kisses her. This one kiss is enough to get Caitlin going. All the doubting thoughts in her head are now gone and what's left is the thrill and excitement. Caitlin moans and kisses Thea back, she wraps her arms around her and holds her too. Thea's hands slide down Caitlin's back and squeezes her ass. Caitlin moans as Thea starts to play with her ass. Thea removes herself from Caitlin's face and gives her a smiles. Caitlin blushes back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think I haven't forgot about you cutie.\" Thea smiles as she brings her face closer to Nyssa. \"The fun is only just starting.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin let's out a giggle, Thea takes Caitlin's hand on hers and takes her to the spare bedroom for some fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea opens the door and the two walk inside with Caitlin slamming to door behind them. Thea smiles as she can't believe how excited she was. Caitlin and Thea wrap their arms around each other and lean in for a kiss. The two moan as the slide their tongues into  each others mouths. Caitlin let's out a squeal as Thea grabs her ass and gives his a good squeeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we let Nyssa join?\" Thea giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyssa looks up and sees Thea grinning down at her. She's scared but somewhat interested. Thea reaches between Caitlin's breasts and grabs Nyssa. Nyssa let's out a squeal as Thea's grip is quite tight. Thea pulls her out and lowers Nyssa's tiny form to get open mouth. Nyssa screams as she sees Thea's giant tongue get close. Thea lowers  Nyasa inside her mouth and wraps her giant lips around her waist. Nyssa let's out a moan as she feels Thea suck of her bottom half. Nyssa looks up and sees Caitlin's mouth slowly open and get closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck.\" Nyssa grunts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin's giant mouth takes Nyssa's torso and she wraps her giant pink lips around her stomach. Caitlin slides Nyssa inside more and presses her lips against Thea's. Nyssa let's out a squeal as she feels both of the girls suck on her body while still trying to kiss each other. Nyssa let's out anther squeal as she feels the tip of Thea's tongue run up her thigh, Nyssa screams as she feels Thea's tongue make contact with her pussy. The giant tongue laps at the tiny pussy while also licking and tasting her ass. Nyssa starts to moan as it is feeling really good. She notices that Caitlin's tongue is surprisingly still. She expected Caitlin to poke and prod her torso with her tongue but all she can feel is Caitlin sucking. Nyssa screams and cums inside Thea's mouth. Caitlin pulls herself off Thea and Nyssa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't do it.\" Caitlin says. \"I can't take advantage of Nyssa like that, she's so small.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Thea sighs taking Nyssa out of her mouth. \"I'll put her away.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea stands up with a smirk. She brings Nyssa to her ass and slides Nyssa down her waist band. Nyssa yells as she slides down Thea's ass crack. She lands at the bottom causing Thea to giggle. Thea slides her hand down her pants and presses Nyssa's feet against her ass hole and pushes her inside. Thea and Nyssa squeal as Nyssa sinks into the giant hole, Thea pushes her until she is up to her neck. Nyssa moans with Thea as she had to admit that it was cosy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There,\" Thea smiles. \"Now she won't be taken advantage of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin rolls her eyes. Thea giggles and pushes her down on the bed. Thea climbs on top of Caitlin and kisses her. Thea places a hand on the back of Caitlin's head and the other on her breast squeezing it and pleasing Caitlin. The two of them moan loving every moment. Caitlin can't believe how frisky the young girl is. Caitlin completely forgets Nyssa in Thea's ass as she's too distracted by Thea's amazing experience. Caitlin just lays there and let's Thea make out with her, she wants to feel Thea but she's too distracted to do so. Caitlin moans and slides her tongue inside Thea's mouth. Thea smiles to herself as she has an idea. She removes her hand from Caitlin's breasts and reaches into her pants. She takes Nyssa out of her ass hole and pulls her out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank god,\" Nyssa coughs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's glad to be out of Thea's ass. While she was enjoying herself out first she was struggling to breathe and Thea's ass was crushing her. Nyssa looks up and sees Caitlin's giant pussy looming over her, Thea had ripped Caitlin's pants and panties off quite quickly. Without hesitation Thea shoves Nyssa head first into Caitlin's pussy. Nyssa manages to hold her breath before being inserted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\" Caitlin squeals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin goes to reach down to pull Nyssa out but Thea stops her from doing so. Thea grabs her wrists pinning her to the bed and sticks her tongue inside her mouth. Caitlin squeals and moans as not only was Thea a good kisser but Nyssa feels amazing inside her. Caitlin has never had an experience like this before so it doesn't take her long reach her climax. She cums and Nyssa shoots out with her climax. Thea giggles and breaks her kiss with Caitlin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See why I wanted to have some fun with her.\" Thea asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm,\" Caitlin whimpers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go back to the party before everyone starts to wonder.\" Thea smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea gives Caitlin a kiss and climbs off her. She grabs Nyssa and brings her to her face with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get you cleaned up,\" Thea smiles. \"We don't want anyone to see you covered in cum.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea tosses Nyssa in her mouth causing Nyssa to squeal. Thea swirls Nyssa around her mouth moaning. Nyssa tastes amazing not to mention the extra taste from Caitlin. Thea  spits her out with a smile. While she is no longer covered in cum she is covered in Thea's salvia. She had to admit she kind of liked it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin puts her clothes on and the two head back out to the party pretending like nothing happened. Thea then... </span></div></div>",

Noticing the slight glisten the woman gave off Sara brought her up to her face and kisses her, letting her tongue out to wriggle all over the tiny girl's head<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she pulled back Sara wrinkles her nose for a moment before asking \"Did those idiots raid the fridge already? You kind of taste like vanilla, didn't even know Laurel still had any\" the blond muses mostly to herself, until Nyssa chuckles<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No beloved, no snacks were had other than a rather pleasantly cool pussy I had the privilege of partaking in\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara laughs \"Really? Caitlin's cum is like ice cream!

Think we should make another playmate or 2?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyssa grins widely, as much as she was aroused by the thought of cleavage and pussy's able to swallow her whole, she wanted another chance at domination, whoever Sara chooses to shrink will taste her power.

The two are standing quiet close with the two occasionally blushing at something the other said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which do I choose.\" Sara smirks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe holds the gun out and aims it at someone at pure random, she doesn't mind who she shrinks, she just wants some hot tiny girl to play with.

Sara can\u2019t help but giggle at Felicity\u2019s drunken state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at you Sara,\u201d Felicity giggles. \u201cYou are so small, how did you get so small?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Sara sighs. \u201cThe device I had\u2026.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re very cute Sara,\u201d Felicity smiles with a hick. \u201cI mean you were hot before but now you are just cute. Want to go have some fun cutie?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d Sara smiles. \u201cWhatever you want.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean fucking,\u201d Felicity says with certainty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.\u201d Sara smirks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity giggles and heads off to the bedroom with Sara at her side. Felicity swings her arms side to side swinging the tiny Sara around. Sara liked the swinging at first but she quickly gets nauseous. Sara closes her eyes and tires to imagine what Felicity plans to do with her to stop her from throwing up. Sara lets out a little giggle, she is actually excited to have some fun with Felicity, sure she would have preferred it if was under different circumstances but never the less she is excited. This is why she wanted everyone here for some fun with tinies so there\u2019s no point trying to stop Felicity from having some fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity walks into the same bedroom that Thea and Caitlin had occupied earlier. Felicity slams the door behind her and stumbles towards the bed with a huge grin on her face. Felicity trips over her own feet again and lands face first on the bed. She starts to howl with laughter and rolls onto her back holding the tiny assassin to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like the tables have turned Ms Lance.\u201d Felicity smirks. \u201cI\u2019m not longer the weak and powerless one.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t hurt me Ms Smoak.\u201d Sara smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to do more than hurt you.\u201d Felicity giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity bites her bottom lip and grabs the bottom of Sara\u2019s shirt and rips it off her body like it\u2019s nothing. Sara giggles as Felicity then removes her bra as quickly as possible. Sara helps out a little and slides her pants down slightly, Felicity finishes her up and removes pants and panties. Sara lets out a moan as Felicity's warm fingers feel incredible pressed against her bare skin. Sara places her hands on Felicity's giant finger that\u2019s curled around her body and rubs it to show her that she\u2019s ready. Sara looks at Felicity\u2019s giant face and sees that she is practically drooling over her. Sara giggles and gives her a flirtatious wink. Felicity smirks and brings her close to her face. Sara smiles as she sees that Felicity's pursed lips is getting closer. Sara moans as Felicity's giant pink lips press against her tiny face. Sara places her hands on Felicity's lips and does her best to kiss her back despite their size difference. The two women moan as they do their best to kiss each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity removes her lips after some time, she then slides her tongue out of her mouth. Sara moans as Felicity's giant wet, spongy tongue makes contact with her face. Felicity runs the tip over her face a few times before trailing down her neck. Sara moans in anticipation. Felicity runs the tip of her tongue down between Sara\u2019s breasts. Sara lets out a moan. She runs her tongue all over Sara\u2019s breasts doing her best to coat them in saliva and tasting every bit. Sara moans, she is loving this. Felicity's warm tongue running over her erect nipples causing her to squeal and shutter in delight. This is almost enough to make her cum. Felicity removes her tongue and slides it back inside her mouth with a moan. The tiny woman\u2019s breasts tastes incredible. Sara throws her head back and starts puffing, she can\u2019t believe she got exhausted just from that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara hears Felicity giggle at something, she opens her eyes and sees that Felicity\u2019s eyes are locked onto her wet pussy. Felicity licks her lips and moans at just the sight. Sara lets out a moan, this is just turning her on a lot more. Felicity purses her lips and gently blows on Sara\u2019s wet snatch. Sara throws her head back and moans, the thrill is intense as well as the warmth of Felicity's breath. Sara lets out a moan as she feels Felicity stroke her thigh with her index finger. It\u2019s nice and warm not to mention smooth. Felicity's finger gets close, she only brushes it before stroking Sara\u2019s other thigh. Sara lets out a moan, she wants the giant finger against her. Felicity gently brushes past it a few times. Sara can tell that Felicity is just teasing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Sara groans. \u201cPlay with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity giggles and presses the tip of her finger against Sara\u2019s snatch. Sara throws her head back and squeals, it doesn\u2019t take her long to start moaning as Felicity starts to rub as lightly as she can. Sara loves this. Felicity's warm finger doing it\u2019s job. Sara can feel her climax building up inside her. She throws her head back and starts to screaming giving the giantess the indication of what\u2019s about to cum. She\u2019s almost there but Felicity stops. She removes her finger with a giggle, Sara\u2019s body calms down quite quickly, she hasn\u2019t reached her climax yet but somehow she felt like she had already. Felicity places her finger against Sara pussy again and starts to rub. Sara throws her head back and squeals. She desperately wants to cum this time. There is not as much build up this time as she feels like she is just about there. Sara starts to scream as she is close but Felicity removes her finger once again, now she is just giggling like crazy. Sara enjoyed this at first but is now getting sick of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop being such a fucking tease and make me cum!\u201d Sara screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then.\u201d Felicity grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity places her finger on Sara\u2019s snatch with no hesitation. Sara throws her head back and squeals, this is a lot better than last time. Sara lets out a louder squeal as she can feel Felicity's sink inside her. This is heaven, Felicity's finger is just bigger than a dildo but incredible none the less. Felicity pumps her finger ever so slightly causing Sara to squeal. Sara\u2019s enjoyment dials down less and less as she feels Felicity\u2019s finger sinks deeper and deeper. Sara screams of pleasure turn into screams of pain. She was enjoying this at first but Felicity is stretching her out and hurting her. Felicity doesn\u2019t stop, she keeps going. Sara starts to panic as it feels like Felicity\u2019s entire index finger is inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCum for me little slut.\u201d Felicity moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara screams, Felicity starts to thrust her finger fucking the tiny woman best as she can. Sara would love this except Felicity is too far inside her. Sara screams and begs for Felicity to stop but she just giggles and carries on. She licks her lips as she can feel her entire finger slowly be coated with the tiny woman\u2019s cum. Sara throws her head back and screams cumming all over Felicity's giant finger. Sara lets out a huge sigh of relief as the giant finger gets removed form her. Sara closes her eyes and does her best to calm herself down, to her it felt like she had just battled an entire army and had only just survived. She expects a few tears to roll out but all that comes out is a whimper. Felicity sides the cum coated finger inside her mouth and moans as she tastes it. Sara gives Felicity a weak smile. At least someone had fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara feels herself getting lowered down Felicity's body. Sara lets out a little whimper, she needs a little more time to process everything. She comes face first with Felicity\u2019s giant pink lips, she had become extremely wet from playing with Sara. Felicity starts to giggle like crazy as she brings Sara closer. Sara lets out a moan as the heat coming off her is just unbearable. She is pushed in head first with a loud squeal and moan. Sara lets out a moan as she can feel the wall around her tighten, she can hear Felicity moan and squeal though the vibrations of her body. Sara takes a few seconds to put herself back together, she\u2019s still a little shaken up from earlier. She takes a deep breath and starts to wriggle around doing her best to make Felicity squeal. Sara smiles and wriggles around climbing deeper inside the giantess. The cavern starts to fill up quite quickly but that doesn\u2019t stop Sara. She holds her breath and continues to wiggle around. She can feel Felicity scream and the cavern empties out quite quickly. Sara giggles and moves around a lot more, another explosion quickly follows as the caravan fills up and empties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust one more,\u201d Sara whispers with a smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara moves around rubbing her cum coated naked body against the walls of the giantess. Felicity lets out another squeal and cums quicker than she did before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think my job\u2019s done.\u201d Sara smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara does her best to wiggle down but the walls have trapped her in place. She\u2019s stuck inside Felicity until the giantess pulls her put. Sara sighs, it was fun while it lasted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity lays down on the bed dripped in sweat and completely out of breath. She can\u2019t believe how much fun she had with the tiny Sara and how educated she was in pleasing a giantess. Felicity\u2019s too exhausted to do anything else. Energy or not she still wants to keep Sara inside her as even the littlest movements from her is enough of a pleasure. </span></div></div>",

Felicity sort of wants to take Sara out of her and continue to play with her tiny form but she decides to keep her inside herself, Sara remains still but would occasionally wiggle causing Felicity to let out a little moan. The little girl is doing enough to justify her stay. Felicity noticed something out of the corner of her eye. She can\u2019t help but smirk as she sees that there is a face peering in. It takes Felicity a few seconds to realise that it is Laurel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t just stand there,\u201d Felicity smirks. \u201cCome in and say hi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel slowly opens the door and takes a step inside with a smirk. Laurel\u2019s smirk quickly drops as her eyes scan Felicity's half naked body and a wet patch between her legs, Laurel blushes a bit and Felicity's giggles a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what have you been doing?\u201d Laurel asks a little hesitant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust having some fun with a little girl that\u2019s inside my pussy that\u2019s all.\u201d Felicity giggles. \u201cCare to join?.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel giggles at Felicity's comment about the tiny girl. While she wants to believe her she knows that Nyssa is still in the lounge with the rest of the girls. Besides, Felicity is clearly drunk so she is bound to spout more babble when she\u2019s drunk. Laurel smirks, the encouragement form Felicity is great as she is giving her a flirtatious wink and a smirk. Not only that but she\u2019s running her hands up and down her thighs to tease her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Laurel,\u201d Felicity whispers. \u201cCome over here and have some fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel giggles and walks over towards Felicity. Laurel climbs on the bed and climbs on top of Felicity with a huge smile on her face. Felicity giggles and places her hands on Laurel\u2019s shoulders as Laurel makes her way up Felicity's body. Laurel\u2019s face hovers over Felicity's with a smile, Felicity does her best to smile but at her drunken state all she can muster up is a goofy smile. Laurel giggles and kisses Felicity. Felicity lets out a moan and kisses Laurel back. Laurel presses her body against Felicity\u2019s as the two kiss. Felicity's arms drop to her side as she doesn\u2019t have the energy to make out with Laurel, she\u2019s still drained from Sara but that doesn\u2019t stop her from enjoying herself. Laurel is loving this just as much as Felicity as their lips collide. Despite her drunken state Felicity's kisses are very soft and sensual. Laurel runs her hands up Felicity's stomach and trails them under her shirt. Felicity moans as she can feel Laurel\u2019s fingers creep around her breasts. Laurel cups her hands over Felicity's fabric covered breasts and gives them a squeeze. Felicity goes week as she\u2019s never had anyone grope her like this before, her arms remain at her side as Laurel has her way with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Laurel,\u201d Felicity moans as she breaks the kiss for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel smirks and gives Felicity a more passionate kiss causing the two of them to moan in delight.

Felicity's lets out a moan and her body shutters. Laurel brings herself back up to Felicity's face with a smile. Felicity giggles and the two lock lips again this time their tongues slide into each other\u2019s mouths. Laurel runs the tip of her fingers up and down Felicity's thigh teasing the hacker. Felicity starts puffing, Laurel smirks and gives Felicity's thigh a gentle squeeze. Felicity lets out a scream and cums all over Laurel\u2019s hand. Laurel giggles and removes her tongue from Felicity's mouth with a moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas I really that good?\u201d Laurel whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm,\u201d Felicity moans with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel giggles and kisses Felicity, Felicity giggles too and Laurel strokes the side of Felicity's face.

Felicity shivers and Laurel sticks her tongue side Felicity's pussy. Felicity throws her head back and screams as Laurel proceeds to eat Felicity out. Felicity loved Sara squirming around inside her but she had to admit that Laurel is doing a better job. Laurel closes her eyes and moans as she plays with Felicity's pussy. Laurel sides her tongue inside as she wants to taste Felicity's wet cavern. Felicity shivers as Laurel\u2019s tongue explores. Laurel\u2019s tongue brushes over something that feels like tiny feet.

Laurel can feel Felicity\u2019s body tense up. She lets out a huge squeal and climaxes inside Laurel\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel moans and cleans up Felicity's mess licking up every splotch. Felicity's hips buck again and she cums, this some something shoots out and Laurel and feel it land inside her mouth. It feels like some sort of doll. Laurel raises an eye brow, she tosses the tiny thing in her mouth and runs her tongue over it to try to figure out what it is. She could spit it out and see what it is but that\u2019s no fun. Laurel smirks as she can feel that it\u2019s some sort of doll. She runs the tip of her finger up its thigh and presses it against it\u2019s surprisingly we pussy. The doll then squeals. Laurel sits up and spits the doll onto her hand. Laurel\u2019s jaw drops as she can see the little thing move. It spits something out of it\u2019s mouth and does it\u2019s best to get some air. Laurel brings it to her face and studies the tiny thing with her giant eyes. The doll rolls onto it back and awkwardly smiles up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Laurel,\u201d It smirks. \u201cHad fun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSara?\u201d Laurel gasps. \u201cHow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I tried to shrink someone and it kind of backfired.\u201d Sara sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s very convenient.\u201d Laurel smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is that?\u201d Sara asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause when you showed Nyssa to us the thought I had on my mind was, I wonder what it\u2019s like to see you this tiny.\u201d Laurel smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now you got your wish.\u201d Sara sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI sure did,\u201d Laurel smirks. \u201cLet me guess, this is the part where you realise that my dream is coming true and you\u2019re dreading to find out what I plan to do with you so you beg and plead with me to not to and change you back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d Sara smirks. \u201cI can\u2019t let my little sister be happy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel lets out a little giggle. She looks back up at Felicity with a smirk. She\u2019s still dazzling in and out. Felicity still looks awake but could fall asleep at any moment. Laurel giggles and tightens her grip around her tiny sister, Sara lets out a little squeal. Laurel climbs up Felicity\u2019s body and drapes herself over her. Felicity giggles as their eyes lock and she pulls her in for a kiss. Felicity lets out a moan and does her best to kiss Laurel despite her haziness.

She\u2019s never had an orgasm this good before and she can\u2019t believe that it\u2019s coming from her own sister. Sara lays there exhausted as the giant suck on her body.

She lays down and feel Laurel\u2019s warm chest against her naked body. She looks up and sees that the lesbian lovers are still kissing each other. Sara looks around and tires to find a way to join them as she is feeling a bit horny herself. The giant\u2019s breasts are occupied for now as their breasts are pressed against each other with no way of playing with a nipple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like I\u2019m going to have to go solo.\u201d Sara smirks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara lays back and grabs her breast with her hand and starts to play with it. She gives her nipple a squeeze and watches Laurel\u2019s and Felicity's giant tits rub together. Sara runs her hand down her stomach and sticks two fingers inside herself. She throws her head back and watches the two giants kiss, saliva drips down Laurel\u2019s cheeks as Felicity looks to be a little sloppy at her drunken state. Sara starts moaning, she looks down and sees Laurel\u2019s hands trail down Felicity's back. Sara lets out a moan and fingers herself more. Laurel cups her hands over Felicity's bare cheeks and gives them a firm squeeze. Felicity lets out a moan as well as Sara. Sara throws her head back and moans as she watches Laurel fondle Felicity's cheeks. Sara screams and cums all over her fingers. She pulls them out of her and lays there trying to catch her breath back. Felicity and Laurel are still going at it with tongues darting in each other\u2019s mouths as well as fondling each other\u2019s body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity makes her way down Laurel\u2019s neck with a few hicks along the way. Sara looks up and smiles as Felicity's face gets closer. Sara lets out a little moan as she can feel Felicity's warm breath flow over her bare body. Felicity's lips get close to Sara, Sara doesn\u2019t mind, she lays there and waits for them. Felicity presses her giant lips on Sara and starts kissing her. Sara starts gigging as she knows that Felicity still thinks that she\u2019s kissing Laurel. Felicity removes her lips and gives Sara an odd look. Sara starts giggling and gives Felicity a wave. A huge grin comes across Felicity's face. Sara felt mixed on this, on one hand she wanted to have some crazy fun with them but the last time she did this with Felicity it backfired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity curls her giant slender fingers around Sara\u2019s tiny form, Sara lets out a moan as Felicity\u2019s fingers feel amazing pressed against her bare skin. Sara feels herself being lifted away from Laurel\u2019s body. Sara closes her eyes as she wants to be surprised for what Felicity does with her. Sara gets trailed down and she stops. She can hear Felicity giggle and an extensive heat coming off something near her. Sara opens her eyes and sees her giant sister\u2019s pussy right in front of her, wet and ready to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Sara mumbles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity brings Sara closer and presses her tiny face against one of the moist lips. Sara closes her eyes and mouth as her face gets covered almost instantly. Sara can feel Laurel shiver as Felicity teases her with Sara. Sara smiles a bit as she is happy that she is bringing Laurel a little bit of pleasure. Sara feels Felicity gently part Laurel\u2019s lips apart. Sara tenses up, she knows what\u2019s coming next. Felicity pushes her inside as much as she can, Sara excepts Felicity to let go of her but Felicity's fingers remain warped as she sinks in. Felicity starts to pump Sara with her fingers still wrapped around her. Sara smirks to herself as she can feel that Laurel\u2019s pussy is slightly tighter than Felicity\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope you\u2019re having fun sis,\u201d Sara whispers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel throws her head back and screams as Felicity fucks her with Sara. Laurel loves that Felicity's fingers are inside her her too as it gives her that extra thrill. Felicity brings her head up and locks lips with Laurel, her hand is still inside her. Laurel pulls Felicity close and passionately kisses her as she fucks her. Laurel moans ands starts to scream Felicity's name down he throat. Felicity moans as she loves this. She picks up the pace causing Laurel to scream louder and more. Laurel throws her head back and screams and cums all over Sara and Felicity. Felicity giggles and pulls Sara and herself out of Laurel. She drops Sara between Laurel\u2019s breasts and cleans up her cum coated hand with her tongue moaning. Laurel wants to pick Sara up and lick her clean but she is too exhausted. Felicity looks down at Sara and Laurel who are laying there out of breath and covered in sweat. She giggles and gives Laurel a kiss before laying down next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel giggles as she can\u2019t believe how much fun she is having with Felicity and he tiny sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Laurels breasts are smooth and warm and feel great pressed against her naked body. Sara smiles and rolls around a bit rubbing herself against the warm giantess. She could get used to this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara ears perk up as she hears the bedroom door slowly creak open. She sits up to see who it is. Short brown hair and a thin figure. Its Thea Queen. A wave of curiosity washes over Thea's face as she enters the room. Her eyes scan the two naked ladies laying on the bed who are almost asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is where you all went?\" Thea smirks. \"I thought I was being ignored.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity and Laurel spring away, they sit up quickly with Sara almost falling out of Laurels breasts. Luckily for her she is able to keep herself in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thea!\" Laurel and Felicity announce with a huge smile on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This could be fun.\" Sara smirks to herself. \"Or this could go horribly wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what have you all been doing?\" Thea asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it obvious?\" Laurel smiles giving her breasts a bit of a squeeze with her forearms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea smiles as her eyes lock onto Laurel's perfect rack completely unaware of the tiny woman between the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come join us.\" Felicity smiles with a hick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea giggles and makes her way over to Laurel with her hips swaying back and forth. Laurel smiles as she gets closer. Thea places her hands on the side of Laurel's face and leans in locking lips with her. Laurel moans and kisses back almost instantly. Laurel doesn't hold back and places her hands on Thea ass giving it a good squeeze. Thea let's out a loud moan and runs her hands run down her neck. Laurel gasps as her hands get closer and closer. Felicity interrupts their fun by grabbing Thea's hands stopping her from reaching her goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Thea squeals breaking the kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a rule around here young lady.\" Felicity smiles. \"No one has any fun unless they are naked.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did we decide that rule?\" Laurel asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you questioning me?\" Felicity says as serious as she can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No miss Smoak.\" Laurel smirks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea smiles and does as she is told. She backs up from Laurel and undoes her pants with a grin on her face. Laurel and Felicity start whistling and cheering as Thea removes her clothes piece by piece. Thea grins ear to ear as she baths in their compliments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara watches Thea strip from between Laurel's breasts drooling. She thought that Thea had a nice body but never realised how great it looked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea is now down to her bra and panties, she looks over at Laurel and Felicity who are drooling over her. Thea smirks and shows off her body swaying her hips side to side. Laurel and Felicity whistle and cheer just like before. Thea grabs her panties and slides them off. She gives Felicity a wink and tosses her panties to her. Her panties land on Felicity's face square on. Thea and Laurel giggle as Felicity takes a big inhale. Thea takes off her bra and tosses it to the side. Thea sees that Laurel is disappointed that it wasn't tossed to her. Thea smirks and gives her something better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what you see Laurel?\" Thea asks as she shakes her ass in Laurel face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel moans and nods as she can't muster up any words. Thea giggles and turns around. She pushes Laurel back onto the bed and climbs on top of her. Laurel let's out a loud moan and pulls Thea in close. Their breasts collide and Thea forces her tongue inside her mouth. Laurel whimpers and gives Thea's ass a good squeeze. Thea moans into Laurel's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity feels a little left out so she decides to join the fun. She climbs on top of Thea and drapes her naked body over her. Felicity doesn't care that she's giving Laurel more weight to deal with. She's horny and wants some action. Felicity buries her face into Thea's neck and Laurel and her kiss. Felicity's hands run down their sides and does her best to feel and fondle both their breasts. Being pressed together makes the fondling so much easier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel can't believe that she's taking all this weight. The two girls on top of her feels like they just weigh the same amount as one. Thea's passion picks up as Felicity nibbles and kisses her neck. Laurel moans and continues to fondle her ass. Felicity crotch hovers Laurels hands as she lays on top. Laurel does her best to get a feel off her pussy with her limited room. Laurel is loving Thea's pleasure. Her thin warm fingers trail and pitch her breasts all over. Laurel moans into her mouth as Thea pinches Laurel's nipples. Thea removes her lips from Laurel's and makes her way down to her neck. Laurel gaps as Thea gently sucks on her. She makes her way down lower and lower with Felicity moving herself down too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?!\" Thea squeaks. \"Is that Sara in your tits?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup.\" Laurel smiles with a goofy nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does little Sara want a kiss too?\" Thea asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love one.\" Sara smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara gets all giddy as Thea's giant lips descend towards her. Sara closes her eyes and prepares herself. Thea's lips press against her tiny face and does her best to passionately kiss the tiny girl. Sara places her hands in Thea's pink warm lips and does her best to kiss her back. Its everything she imagined. Thea removes her lips and gives Laurel's breasts a few kisses. She brings her attention back to Sara and kisses her more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck.\" Sara moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea slides her tongue out of her mouth and gives Sara a good lick. Sara moans as she body gets covered in saliva. Thea's giant spongy tongue travels up her naked body again and bounces off her large round breasts. Sara make sure that Thea's taste buds ran over her erect nipples, as Thea moans Sara can tell that she could taste them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea gives Sara a good kiss before giving her another lick, only this time Sara gets attached and sucked into Thea\u2019s giant mouth. Sara lets out a little squeal due to the shock. She smirks when she feels and hear Thea giggle. Sara lets out a little moan and wriggles her torso around inside Thea\u2019s mouth. Thea starts moaning as she loves the taste of the little woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyone want to taste?\u201d Thea says with a muffle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do.\u201d Felicity squeals as she stumbles off Thea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity lays on the bed next to Laurel and pulls Thea onto her. Thea giggles and lowers Sara\u2019s lower half into her mouth. Sara lets out a loud moan and squeal as she feels Felicity\u2019s giant lips wrap around her, she\u2019s getting flashbacks from last time she was in Felicity's mouth. Laurel and Felicity kiss each other with Sara between them. Sara lets out a moan and wiggles as she is loving this feeling, having the two girl\u2019s salvia flow back and forth and over her body is amazing. Sara wiggles more as she can tell that they are holding back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity and Thea take the hint and bring their tongues into action. Felicity\u2019s tongue poked and prodded at Sara\u2019s lower regions while Thea\u2019s tongue poked at her breasts. Sara throws her head back and squeals and this is amazing. The tip of Felicity's tongue presses against her ass hole and pussy quite a few time and Thea's tongue runs all over her tits. Sara lets out a loud scream and cums in their mouths. Sara shivers as her cum is passed between their mouth flowing over her own body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara is removed form Felicity's mouth leaving her head in Thea\u2019s mouth. Thea spits Sara out and puts her between Felicity's breasts. Thea looks down and gives Sara a devilish smile. She\u2019s beyond excited to see what\u2019s coming next. </span></div></div>",

She is having so much fun in her new position she doesn't want to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what I want.\" Felicity moans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity sits up and grabs Sara out from her breasts. Sara squeals as Felicity's grip is a little tight. She hands Sara back to Laurel and lays down on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want the Lance girls inside me.\" Felicity purrs as she strokes her thighs. \"And Ms Queen to kiss me again. Get to it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mam.\" Thea smirks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMove it bitch.\u201d Felicity grins at Laurel who is just giggling. \u201cI don\u2019t have all day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea climbs up to Felicity's face with a huge smile. Thea kisses Felicity and Felicity wraps her arms around Thea and pulls her in tight so their naked bodies are pressed against each other. Felicity moans as she can feel there's an effort from Thea to rub their tits together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a good bitch.\" Felicity whispers as gives Thea a smack on the ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea giggles and continues to make out with the drunk woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel licks her lips as she watches the two girls make out in front of her own eyes. It's an exciting watch. Laurel looks down at Sara who is smiling as much as she is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready little girl?\" Laurel asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Sara has a chance to answer Laurel lays down on the bed. She comes face first with Felicity's wet pussy and Thea's right above. Sara looks up at her sister in glee. It's a marvelous sight. Laurel giggles and brings Sara closer, as she gets closer she can feel the heat coming off it, it is intense. Sara braces for impact but she is heading in a direction she never thought. Laurel misses the pussy and is heading to Felicity's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could be worse.\" Sara thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara's head is placed against the giant rim and is slowly forced inside. It\u2019s a very tight squeeze, the walls around her vibrate due to Felicity's moaning. Sara can tell that this is the first time Felicity has ever had something in her ass before. The slightest wiggle from Sara would make Felicity moan. That could be from Thea but Sara would prefer to think that it\u2019s from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel looks down at Felicity's wet lips with a smile. She runs her fingers over her lips causing Felicity to shiver. Laurel slides her fingers inside Felicity, Felicity squeals and moans into Thea mouth. Laurel smirks and thrusts her fingers in her doing her best to finger fuck her. Felicity squeals and Thea is doing her best to keep her in place. Laurel smiles, Thea deserves some kind of reward. Laurel smirks and shoves two fingers inside Thea's pussy. Thea squeaks and moans just like Felicity as Laurel finger fucks both women. Laurel tenses up herself as she can feel the girl\u2019s pussys clamp around her fingers. This doesn\u2019t stop Laurel as she continues to thrust till her heart desires. Thea and Felicity let out a loud squeal and moan and cum all over Laurel\u2019s hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood job girls.\u201d Laurel smiles removing herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel looks down and sees Sara squirming around in Felicity's ass. She giggles and helps her out a little. She pinches Sara\u2019s tiny feet and gives her a little pull. Sara shoots out like a cork, Laurel giggles like crazy at this. Thea rolls off of Felicity and the two lay there trying to catch their back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo time for rest girls.\u201d Laurel grins as she sits up towering over them. \u201cIt\u2019s not over till the last lady cums.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just did.\u201d Felicity groans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel giggles and gives Felicity's thigh a slap. She looks down at all three girls and smirks, she has an idea. Laurel snatches up Sara and crawls up the two girls resting. She pushes Thea and Felicity's heads together and sits on both of their faces at the same time with her thighs pressing on the side of their heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want you sluts to finish me off.\u201d Laurel smiles tightening her grip around her thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel grins as she is enjoying her power over the two. She reaches back and shoves Sara in her own ass head first. Laurel moans and Thea and Felicity get to work. They slide their tongues out and both start lapping at Laurel\u2019s pussy furiously. Laurel moans, this is amazing, having two tongues plow her pussy is worth it. The two tongues interlock a few times and it is a delight. Laurel\u2019s juices drip onto the girls mouths making their tongues and mouths every spongy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara groans as she is pushed into her sister giant ass. She\u2019s had enough of being shoved in tight spaces, she wants someone to please her for once and maybe enter her. Sara deals with it and wriggles around hoping that Laurel can at least get some enjoyment out of all of this. Sara feels something brush over her feet, it doesn\u2019t take her long to figure out that it\u2019s a tongue. At first it was pleasurable but after a few times it becomes ticklish. Sara starts laughing and wriggling trying to get away but there\u2019s nowhere to run. She\u2019s being tickled and there is no way to stop it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel throws her head back screaming, Sara\u2019s wriggling has increased and so has the girls enthusiasm. Their tongues enter her pussy a few times but they fight for entrance. Laurel feels her climax build up inside her. Felicity gives Laurel one good lick, this is enough to set her off. Laurel screams and cums all over Felicity and Thea's faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow it\u2019s over.\u201d Laurel puffs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel falls back and lays down between Thea and Felicity's legs with their feet at her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said it\u2019s not over till the last lady cums.\u201d Thea grins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea sits up and reaches down to Laurel\u2019s ass. She grabs the tiny feet sticking out and pulls her out with ease. Laurel moans as Sara is removed. Sara is brought up to the giant\u2019s face with a huge smile. Her prayers have been heard. Thea licks her lips as her eyes travel up and down Sara naked cum coated form. Sara blows Thea a kiss and squeezes her breasts together showing them off to Thea. Thea brings Sara closer and gives her a good lick. Sara lets out a loud moan as the wet spongey tongue feels incredible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we go little one.\u201d Thea purrs as she strokes Sara\u2019s thigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe temptation is killing her, Thea has been stroking for too long and Sara wants it now. Thea giggles and presses her finger against the tiny woman\u2019s pussy. Sara squeaks as Thea tries to force her finger in more. It was pleasurable at first but the more finger gets inside her the worse it was feeling. Sara is getting bad flashbacks from her time with Felicity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThea.\u201d Sara gasps. \u201cStop.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea doesn\u2019t hear her and and pushes her finger in more. Sara screams at the top of her lungs, not in pleasure but pain. It feels like half of Thea\u2019s finger is inside her. Sara can see Felicity grinning out of the corner of her eye. She whimpers as she can see Felicity\u2019s hand get close. Sara goes to protest as she feels Felicity's finger on her ass but all that comes out is a little whimper. Felicity's finger slides between her butt cheeks and circles her ass hole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Sara gasps as a tear rolls down her cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s too late. Felicity giggles and shoves her finger inside, almost half. Sara screams and a few tears roll down her cheeks. She\u2019s been though a lot of traumatic things in her life and this has to be up there. Sara screams trying to get the girls attention but they just think that all this is fun and games. Sara squeaks and cums all over the girls fingers. Not much cum drips out. Thea and Felicity giggle and pull their fingers out of Sara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow its over.\u201d Thea giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea and Felicity kiss Sara at the same time with a huge grin. Sara goes white and feels drained, she doesn\u2019t react to the kiss at all. She is shoved between Thea's perky breasts with a little squeeze. While she has always wanted to be in-between these she\u2019s not in the right mind set to enjoy herself. Sara just lays there letting all of this sink in. She hears Felicity throw up over the side of the bed and she instantly passes out. Thea drifts off not long after leaving only Sara awake.</span></div></div>",

The lustful part of her would love to shrink everyone and carry them back inside her, but knows she can't, there was no way she could make that many heroes disappear and not get noticed, so she decided to stick to one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem was there were so many cuties to choose from, from the 3 starling locals (Felicity, Thea, Laurel), the ice cream tasting CC meta \"Caitlin/Frosty), and the 2 busty and adorable other earth visitors (Kara and Lena). Sara wondered who would fit, then realises it probably doesn't matter in that regard as Nyssa would have fun breaking them to her will, especially after being used as a sex toy herself tonight she's going to need to remind their new toy, Sara and possibly most importantly herself that she is a badass bitch who answers to nobody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Sara will let her, the shrink ray will be coming out every now and then so she can fuck that tiny ass, as well as get the turn on of the century from using the most powerful woman on the planet as a dildo/butt plug (1 point for Supergirl then). Of course she'll leave it somewhere her wife can find it, after all the blond does have her own shrunken fantasies, one of which was being Ra's Al Ghul's (aka Nyssa's) fairy slave, something she's sure she'll need to make her beloved mad in order to get her to behave properly for, else she'll be to gentle to her, treating her like a doll or pet than a slave to someone as fearsome as the Demon's Head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking those thoughts from her mind Sara slips away from the festivities, thought she can guarantee Nyssa watched her leave and wondered where she was running off to, before returning with the shrink ray hidden behind her back. Biting her lip to hide her smile Sara aims the device and fires, turning the woman into a more permanent 4 inch plaything for her and Nyssa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question is who did Sara choose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Sara was aware of how Thea looked at her, as well as Nyssa, the younger Queen wanted to join them, find her place in their love, and now she will, just in a much smaller position than she probably expected<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) From what she's overheard, Lena doesn't really have much to go back to on Earth 38, everyone bar Kara thinks she's secretly evil or moments away from snapping and going on a killing spree and she's tasked herself with a job even more intense than Oliver had, restoring a name she hates, after 2/3 of it's living members turned out to be mass murders. It would be a mercy and a gift to find her a new purpose, where she is cared for and respected... and loved. Sara knows Nyssa would approve, the blond seeing bits of her wife in the ravenette already, they should get on wonderfully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Didn't have enough slots, so Caitlin and Laurel can be another option slide</span></div></div>",

And that's what was happenning now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in her couch and lost in her mind while removing her shoe, she almost forget the two tiny ones on her table who were still a bit confused about what was going to happen to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey huh..Kara ? Or should i say Mistress Zorl-El \" Barry began, getting Kara's attention. \" as...much as i like the game we are playing, it would be even cooler if you could help us with....\" the tiny Flash didn't have time to finish his sentence as he got caught in one firm first of Kara who brought him to her giant face, placing her lips on him and gave a wet kiss.

You and i are going to have so much fun and i'm sure you d'love this ! \" Kara replied before turning to Oliver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" As for you....\" She caught him in her other hand and lay down on her couch with her two captives.

Oliver's expression was clear : he didn't like his new situation, and hated it when Kara said \" i suggest you to rub my feet while i'm playing with Barry \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver wanted to say something, but didn't have time as Kara focused on Barry.

And after all he couldn't do anything to resist it anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the meantime, Oliver continued to rubb but tried to think : how to stop a giant Kryptonian ? Even with some kryptonites in his hands, it was almost impossible. But he couldn't accept it, no way. That's when, Kara's foot landed on him, pushing his tiny body against the couch. Obviously, Kara intented to rub him with her foot since she was not satisfied by Oliver's insignificant rubs. She did her best to not put any strenght on him, moving her foot forward and back, again and againt, while she put Barry between her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" hmmm you like the place ? \" she asked to Barry who wanted to say : \"YES\". But here again, there's no time and she began to rub him between her mountains !<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the giantess herself, there were no words to drescrib how she felt about the situation. She had Oliver forced to serve her feet, knowing how much he hated to be powerless against her. And on the other, she got a man she loved for herself. A part of her hoped that her new toys were not her friends, but someones coming from another dimension or something, so she could keep them secretly and still working with the real Barry and Oliver. That's why she didn't want to ask any questions to them. For now, she deserved this. She deserved to be a goddess to two tiny superhero, and she intented to enjoy her times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.What happen ?</span></div></div>",

And this night she went to a party, which reminded her the personn she was before. Things were improving for sure, but she didn't expect what was going on next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she woke up on the next morning, she found herself laid on a gigantic surface, she wondered where she was, but the answer came quickly as the whole environnement seemed familiar to her. She was still...on her couch, with only one major difference : she was really small ! Her whole appartement was bigger, and Thea had to face the truth : she has shrunk somehow !! The now small woman couldn't remember what she did last night, beside drinking and dancing...maybe that was the problem : she probably drunk something able to shrink her down to an isignificant size. But who would do this to her ? And why ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and so, she's finally awake \" a voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea looked at the direction of the voice, and saw a gigantic Nyssa Al Ghul, from the league of assassins, sat on a chair, as if she was standing there for the whole night, waiting for her to wake up. Thea knew what was going on, but she had to ask :<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Did you...do this to me ? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yes. You're so predictive, it was easy to find a way to make you drink my shrinking potion.\" the dark woman said, walking to the couch Thea was standing on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Listen, Nyssa if this is all about Sara i....\" she started before being cut off.  \" I kow. You've been influenced by your own father, but still, your body is responsible of my lover's death \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea felt she was in danger. No words could convince Nyssa for whatever happenned. \" Are you going...to squash me like a bug ? \" she asked worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Nope. This would be too much nice for you. I'm going to make your body pay for what you did, conscious or not. I'm going to pick you up now. You're going to be me slave, that's my decision and there's nothing you can do to change it. \" Nyssa said with determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" This...is unfair ! just please listen to me....\" Thea tried to protest to her cruel fate.  Being the slave of a woman because she killed Sara Lance against her own will, was  cruel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I don't want to listen you. My mind is up \" Nyssa caught the small woman in one hand, allowing only the head to stick out her fist, and raised her to her face, holding Thea enought tightly to hurt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was surprised by the response... laughter, genuine, sweet, almost innocent giggles escaping from the woman who Thea had once thought had no soul (it unfortunately took seeing her cry over Sara's dead body to correct that belief)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You're serious aren't you? You couldn't be able to beat me before now, never mind at your current size. Though the ... brass balls you have on display, I can see why Sara liked you' at this she smiles sadly, causing another thought to slip from Thea's lips<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey, the Lazarus Pit brought me back to life, why can't you use if on Sara?' this question got a more hollow laugh from the assassin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm sure you know by now the side effects of using the Pit to restore someone, it's a fate I wouldn't inflict on my beloved. Better she remain in Paradise than experience that Hell' at this point she places Thea on her table and begins to remove her armour, to the brunette's shock (and slight arousal)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Um what the fuck?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm accepting your challenge Brave One, and given your disadvantage I thought a removal of all barriers would be appreciated, as well as give you a proper view of your mistress. Oh and don't try to run away because if you do then when, and believe me it's a when not an if, I find you, I will be biting off all your limbs and you will get a swift demotion from slave to buttplug, and we'll get to see just how long you last. But don't worry, I'll make sure to keep your head peeking out of my asshole, so you have a fighting chance at survival' Thea pales at Nyssa's feral smirk, she hadn't planned to make a break for it anyway but that speech made her glad she'd already made that decision, she was hoping to get by and survive this encounter, maybe see some massive middle eastern breasts and pussy before the rest of the team rescue her, but if Nyssa went through with her threat she'd rather die than be found and have to live like that, after experiencing THAT for how long. She was snapped out of her brain frozen panic by a loud click overhead, looking up Nyssa was staring at her, dressed simply in a deep red bra and panty set 'Strip' she orders and Thea blinks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Excuse me?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Strip, this is as much a show for me as my stripping is for you' she leans over the shrunken archer, nearly hitting her with her swinging bust 'Now, before I remove it more forcefully than you would like' given her last threat that one was pretty tame, but Thea still pretty much tore off her clothes to please the giantess before she got more annoyed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay so how do we start this?' Thea asks and Nyssa grabs her, placing her between her bare feet<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The trial starts now, if Thea Queen can defeat the Heir, she wins her freedom and earns a title, if not then she is the property of the Heir, to do with as she see's fit' Nyssa announces, Thea unable to see her face from her position  but imagines a smug grin, especially when referring to herself as the heir. Seeing as she had no other options Thea threw herself at the enormous assassin, her plan while unlikely involved mostly striking at her ankle bone in the hopes of unbalancing her and knocking her over, Nyssa clearly wasn't trying to kill her as she couldn't have a slave if she were dead (then again the Pit is still a thing so...) so Thea thought if she could knock her down she could get it counted as a win. She should have realised something was wrong when Nyssa didn't try fight back, even when an annoyed Thea climbed her foot and bounced on the joint of her pinkie toe, which only had be knocked off and nearly pinned by the small digit. Eventually Nyssa got bored, and gave a small kick, which still sent Thea flying across the room. With a brisk pace she walks over and pins the shrunken Speedy under her foot, Thea's face peeking out from between her first and second toes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Do you yield Miss Queen?' Nyssa asks, calling that as calling her Merlyn would most likely end with her cleaning Thea's bloody corpse off her foot and resurrecting her back in Nanda Parbot<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't have much of a choice do I?' ever the snarker Thea asks/wheezes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You have a choice, submit or...' Nyssa leaves the other option in the air, but shifts her weight so more is rested on Thea who bites back a scream<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay, okay I yield. I'm done' Thea yells, her pride taking a back seat to her physical pain<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Excellent' Nyssa purrs ' And quite an interesting and spirited pet you will be. Now to bring you home, but how?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Nyssa secures Thea in her bra cup, sure the fight and domination got her horny but Thea deserves a rest for actually trying to fight, which amuses the assassin as well as earning her a little respect, not enough to let her go but enough to not always be a bitch to her.<br>\r\n2) The detailed description of what she wanted to do to an escaping Thea had the assassin beginning to fantasize about putting Thea in her ass. The trip back home is long and her ass might get lonely now Sara isn't around kiss it, rim it and snuggle up to her muscular gluts, besides I'm sure Thea would like to makes some new, highly affectionate <i>friends</i> given her world has just been turned upside down</span></div></div>",

There's no other choice, they will find a cure for you. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Don't want to annoy you, but i feel like i will probably end up as a freak for some governement's scientists.\" Tommy stands up on Laurel's palm. \" Look at me ! I'm the first shrinking man in the world !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel thinks. \" Do you have another plan then ? Maybe Oliver can help ? Is that what you think ? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Maybe. But for now i just want to go home, so if you can just help me with that....\" the tiny guy asks as if things were normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Seriously ? Merlyn i'm taking home with me for tonight and this is my last offer \" The blonde retort, making Tommy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Good because i was expecting you to invite me \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura can't help but laugh. Tommy's problem apart, she has to admit he is really cute at this size, but still arrogant and charmer. She delicately put him in her handbag, ready to leave the restroom and the nightclub. On the way throught the dancing crowd, someone grabs her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Laurel did you see Tommy ? \" Oliver asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" huh...yeah. He didn't feel good so he had to leave, i'm going to check if he's ok \" Laurel improvises thought that she also wants to tell about Tommy's tiny problem, but it was not the time and the right place for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Fine. I'm going to close the Verdant, tell him to give some news. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Sure i will \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel then finally leaves and joins her appartment, pulling Tommy out the handbag and placing him on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh...that was the weirdest ride ever \" Tommy says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yeah sorry for that but i don't have any pocket in that dress, and i'm sure you would rather being in my bra or something, but don't push your luck. It's already a miracle that i brought you here considering your situation. Now...\"</span></div></div>",

Felicity tires to push the giant fingers away but it is useless, he's just too strong. Felicity doesn't give up as she keeps trying, putting all her force into the push. Still, nothing. Felicity's grunts of force slowly turns into moans of pleasure, she can't believe that she is moaning.

William grabs the top of Felicity's blue dress and gives it a tug. Felicity tires to push his fingers away but it was useless, he slides it over her head like it is nothing. He let's it drop to the ground and his eyes travel  over her almost naked body. Felicity tries to cover herself but William pins her arms to the side. He smiles admiring the blonde beauty. He smile turns into a frown as he sees Felicity shaking. Felicity closes her eyes and winces as William's giant forefinger  descends on her. The forefinger makes contact with her head and he starts to stroke her hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mean to scare you Felicity,\" He says. \"I just want you to have fun like I am.

She let's out a gasp as he takes off her panties as well. Felicity shivers as she realises she is naked in this pre teens hands. William's eyes lock onto Felicity's exposed breasts and smiles. He runs his giant finger over the erect nipples with a smile. His giant finger explores very inch on her exposed breasts, William smiles as he can't help but give the tiny breasts a squeeze. He runs his finger down her stomach to her exposed crotch. Felicity let's out a squeal as she can see where he is heading. William's giant finger makes contact and Felicity let's out a moan. William smiles and starts go gently rub the tiny woman's snatch. William smiles as he can feel the spot become wet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god,\" Felicity moans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam smiles as he can feel himself get hard. He continues to rub the tiny snatch and notices Felicity 's breathing pattern change. William feels the tip of his finger slowly sink in, Felicity let's out a squeal and continues to moan.

Felicity's heart sinks as William dangles her over his giant cock. Once William discovered Felicity, Felicity had hoped that William hadn't discovered jerking off or any kind of sexual inter course yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity looks down and sees the giant cock get closer. Felicity opens her mouth to scream but nothing comes out. William sits Felicity at the base of his cock and smiles down at her. He had let her go and is just waiting for a reaction. Felicity sits at the base of the cock and stares up at it in awe with her legs wrapped around the base. Despite being six inches tall and sitting down the giant cock is looming over her. Felicity's jaw drops and the size of it was incredible to her as well as the heat coming off it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive isn't it?\" William says with pride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity doesn't respond, her jaw is still dropped. William smiles and presses his finger against Felicity's back and pushes her against it. Felicity's face and chest collides with the monster and William let's out a moan. William wraps his fingers around his cock and Felicity and gives it a squeeze. William let's out a moan while Felicity let's out a scream. William smiles and starts to jerk off. William leans back on the couch more and enjoys the sensation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity closes her eyes and waits for it to be over. Her face is pressed against the cock so it was hard for her to breathe. While Felicity was hating every minute William was loving every second. Felicity wrapped around felt incredible for him, he warm body being pressed against as well as her breasts rubbing up and down. William let out a loud moan and climaxes. A few splotches land on Felicity's head  and run down her face. William let's go of Felicity and himself and lays back on the couch enjoying the moment. Felicity falls back on William's pubic hair and tries to catch her breath back. Drops of cum fall from the cock and lands on Felicity's stomach and chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing Felicity.\" William says. \"You make an amazing toy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity's stomach drops, hearing that makes Felicity realise that William will probably never give her up so she's stuck as his sex toy forever.  </span></div></div>",

Felicity manages to keep her moans to herself this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go Felicity,\" William smiles. \"You're nice and clean.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now,\" Felicity whispers to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam picks his clothes up off the floor and heads to his bedroom. He slams the door behind him and drops his clothes on the floor. William walks over to his bed and gently places Felicity on his pillow. Without hesitation Felicity sits down and wraps her arms around her legs covering herself from the giant. William smiles as he sees Felicity do this, while he does want to flick her arms away to see her tiny tits he shrugs it off as he'll deal with it later. William reaches into his draws and pulls out his pajamas. It doesn't take him long to get changed. Felicity sighs as she's glad she no longer has to see the giant cock. William climbs into bed and lays his head next to Felicity. He smiles and stares at the shrunken woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so pretty Felicity.\" William says. \"I'm glad I've got a toy as pretty as you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity sits there in silence still hugging her legs. William leans in and kisses Felicity's tiny head. Felicity shivers as he makes contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night Felicity.\" William yawns. \"I'm going to let you sleep up on my pillow with me tonight and if I catch you trying to escape I will punish you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity gulps, while William's definition of pleasure is punishment for her she is dreading to find out what William's definition of punishment is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam reaches over and switches off the light. He shuffles down and tries to go to sleep. Felicity remains sitting, even though she can see that William has his eyes closed she is not going to risk it. Felicity lays down on the pillow and curls up in a ball. It doesn't take long for her to fall asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up sleepy head.\" William says gently poking Felicity's stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity slowly opens her eyes and sees William's giant face smiling down at her. She can feel his giant fingers wrapped tightly around her waist and sees William in his school uniform. Felicity's heart sinks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not taking me to school!\" Felicity screams. \"No way! I'm not a toy for you to share around with your fiends.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to share you with anyone.\" William smiles. \"You're my toy and I'm not handing you over to anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity has no idea how to feel about this. On one hand William would never let anyone hurt her let alone hurt her but at the same time she was never going to get free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there is one friend that wants to meet you again,\" William smiles. \"He's missed you so much and I think you two should spend the day together.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What frie....\" Felicity cuts herself off as it hits her. \"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam uses his free hand to stretch the waistband of his pants and underwear out. He starts to lower Felicity down into the cavern with the monster. Felicity starts to kick and scream. William smiles and places her between himself and his cock with Felicity's legs apart so she's sitting on the base. William becomes more erect with the her being on this cases his dick to shoot up more and trap Felicity against him. William let's out a moan and closes the waistband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You feel great Felicity.\" William smiles as he pats the outside of himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam throws his bag on his back and heads out the door. Felicity remains trapped, there is no way to escape. William's cock is pressing her against William and he is wearing tight underwear so that doesn't help either. Felicity closes her eyes and tries to sleep. Even though she is trapped she is still able to escape somewhere else in her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight floods Felicity's prison as it wakes her up. William reaches down and wraps his giant fingers around her and pulls her out. Felicity takes a deep breath and gasps for air. It was starting to smell terrible in there. Felicity looks around and sees that they are in a bathroom stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had a good time with your new friend?\" William asks. \"I know you are, I'm just checking up on you and I've brought some food.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam hands Felicity a bit of chicken. She takes a big bite out of it. Felicity let's out a small moan as the chicken tasted amazing. She took another bite a scarfed the whole thing back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" William smiles. \"You mush have been hungry.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam smiles down at the tiny woman. His eyes scan her body and he licks his lips. Felicity shivers as she sees this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I've got some time before I have to class I think you deserve a reward for being such a good girl.\" William smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Felicity screams. \"I mean you don't have to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam uses his forefinger finger on his free hand to make contact with Felicity's tiny pussy. William smiles and rubs, Felicity closes her eye and can't help but moan. William smiles and picks up the pace. His eyes light up as he gets an idea from the last time he played with the tiny woman's snatch. William slowly slides the tip of his finger inside her. Felicity let's out a squeal as it sinks in. William smiles and sinks his finger in a inch. Felicity tires to scream against but nothing is coming out of her mouth. William slowly pulls his finger out then sides it back in. William grins as he starts to thrust his finger in and out of her. Felicity let's out a squeal as this was happening, she can feel her pussy being stretched out as William finger fucks her. Felicity let's out a scream and climaxes all over his giant finger. William pulls his finger out and sticks it in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tasty,\" William says licking his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam looks down at the Felicity who is drenched in sweat. William pulls his waistband out and slowly lowers Felicity inside. This time there is no reaction from her. William sides Felicity's legs apart and places her on his dick. William closes the waistband and puts himself together. He leaves the bathroom stall and carries on with his day. Felicity remains on William's giant cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He lets his pants and underwear drop to the ground. He looks down and sees Felicity holding onto his cock with dear life. William can\u2019t help but laugh. He wraps his fingers around Felicity and brings her up to his face with a smile.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>William opens the door and sees a woman standing there in a black jacket. William notices something in her hand, it looks like a gun. William looks up at the woman\u2019s face, while she is smiling Williams could see that it was a fake smile. Something about her looks familiar, William had seen her on the news and around the city. It was Laurel Lance, Black Siren. William's heart sinks, he know how much of a threat she is. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHi sweetie,\u201d Laurel says as politely and sweetly as she could. \u201cIs your Daddy home?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo he\u2019s not,\u201d William says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a shame,\u201d Laurel smiles as she raises the gun. \u201cI guess you\u2019ll have to do.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel aims the gun at William and smiles. The gun lights up and William can see it charging up. William tenses up and closes his eyes. He braces for impact as he can hear Laurel pull the trigger. There\u2019s a loud bang and a flash of light. William hears something fall on the ground. Everything is silent. William slowly opens his eyes, he was expecting to be dead but he was still standing at the door. William looks around, Laurel was gone. He notices something standing in the doorway. It was the gun and a doll standing beside it. William smiles as he sees what it really is. It\u2019s Laurel, she somehow shrunk herself. William\u2019s eyes lock onto the tiny woman, William can see that Laurel notices his giant eyes locking onto her. William smiles and crouches down. He wraps his giant fingers around Laurel\u2019s wait. He stands up and brings her to his face with a smile. Laurel stares up at the giant boy shaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so cool,\u201d William says. \u201cI have another toy for me to play with, how did you get so small though? Was it the gun?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel doesn\u2019t say anything. She\u2019s just freaked out that William could do something to her knowing that she was going to shrink him. Laurel has an idea, she smirks as she stares into the giant boy\u2019s eyes. She opens her mouth and screams at the top of her lungs but the only thing to come out of her mouth is a petty scream. Laurel had lost her Cannery Cry from the shrinking process. For once in her life Laurel feels powerless, especially in the hands of a giant boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas it the gun?\u201d William says. \u201cDid the remote shrink you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes it was.\u201d Laurel says nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is so cool,\u201d William says picking the gun up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam brings his attention back to the Laurel, he gives her a smile and Laurel stares up at him with her jaw hanging. She can\u2019t believe she is in the grasp of a young boy. William walks into the lounge and places the gun on one of the tables and sits on the couch. He brings Laurel up to his giant face with a smile. He places his giant finger on Laurel\u2019s head and starts to stroke her long hair. Laurel starts to shake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be scared,\u201d William smiles. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you, I\u2019m just going to keep you as my toy and all where going to do is have fun.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel shivers at his remark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are my manners?\u201d William says. \u201cI forgot to introduce you to my other toy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam places Laurel on the coffee table. He stands up and undoes his pants. Laurel is confused by this. William drops his pants and pulls his underwear down. Laurel gets a clear view of the giant boy\u2019s penis. Laurel can\u2019t believe how huge it is, especially from a distance. Laurel notices something wrapped around William\u2019s cock. It was a woman. Laurel\u2019s stomach drops. William pulls the woman off his cock and places her on the table next to Laurel. Laurel sees that the woman is familiar. She can\u2019t help but laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFelicity?\u201d Laurel laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re this boy\u2019s sex toy? This is too good to be true.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSays the one who now a sex toy.\u201d Felicity says trying to spit bits of William\u2019s cock sweat out of his mouth. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m spending anytime with this bitch.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d Laurel smirks. \u201c Little Miss Sex Toy Kitty\u2019s got claws.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad to see you two know each other.\u201d William says sitting on the floor in front of them. \u201cBut I would prefer it if you two would get along.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you crazy!\u201d Felicity screams. \u201cI\u2019m not getting along with her! She\u2019s tried to kill us so many times and incase you forgot, she has a deadly scream.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm your tits Felicity,\u201d Laurel snarks. \u201cThe shrinking process got rid of my scream.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProve it,\u201d Felicity says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel rolls her eyes. She takes a deep breath and lets out a scream. Felicity covers her ears as it was quite loud but no cannery cry follows it. She stops and Felicity removes her hands and gives Laurel a nervous look. Laurel gives Felicity a smirk. They hear William laugh above them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you being such a grumpy bum Felicity?\u201d William smiles. \u201cAre you jealous that you have to share me? Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll still give you the attention you deserve, especially with you sexy breasts.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel can\u2019t help but laugh. William runs her giant finger over Felicity\u2019s breasts. Felicity squeals as William gives her breasts a squeeze. William brings his attention to the two girls. His smile turns into a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I want you two to behave.\u201d He says. \u201cI want you two to get along and be nice to each other or else \ti\u2019ll have to punish you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll behave,\u201d Laurel says. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure about blondie.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of bitch screamer setting me off.\u201d Felicity says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d William snaps. \u201cCalm down you two! Do I have you punish you two. Now kiss and make up!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Laurel and Felicity scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard me,\u201d William smiles. \u201cKiss and make up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity and Laurel give each other a frown. William pushes the two girls in closer to each other. The two stare into each other\u2019s eyes nervously. They can feel William\u2019s giant finger on the back of their heads. They take a deep breath and close their eyes. They lean in and lock lips, they hold it for a second and break it with disgust. William can\u2019t help but laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was pretty hot.\u201d William smiles. \u201cNow Felicity, I want you to play with my dick while I play with Laurel.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity lets out a squeal as William warps his giant fingers around her waist. William lowers Felicity down to his giant cock. Felicity screams as she\u2019s getting flashbacks from the last time she was pressed against his cock. His cock gets closer and closer but William places Felicity on the ground between his legs and lifts his cock and testicles up. He slide Felicity underneath and drops his balls on his stomach. Felicity lets out a squeal as his testicles land on her stomach. They are warm and heavy. Felicity tries to wriggle free but she can\u2019t, she\u2019s trapped. Felicity gives up and lays there. She knows that William will be focusing on Laurel so she doesn\u2019t bother doing anything.  </span></div></div>",

William wraps his giant fingers around Laurel\u2019s waist and slowly raises her in the air. Laurel closes her eyes and winces as William brings her up to her giant face. She\u2019s expecting him to toucher her or do something bad to her since she tried to shrink him. Laurel feels William\u2019s giant finger make contact with her head. Laurel shivers, William starts to stroke and play with her hair. Laurel slowly opens her eyes and sees William smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re very pretty Laurel.\u201d William smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Laurel smiles back nervously. \u201cYou\u2019re not so bad yourself.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d William smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to hear that from a pretty girl.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t Felicity think you attractive?\u201d Laurel asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d William says. \u201cYou know what she\u2019s like.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I do,\u201d Laurel smiles. \u201cShe\u2019s really ungrateful, it\u2019s not everyday you get to be cared for by such a handsome man.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d William blushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo where\u2019s your girlfriend?\u201d Laurel asks. \u201cI thought you will want to share your new toys with your girlfriend.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a girlfriend.\u201d William says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d Laurel smiles. \u201cHow could someone as handsome as you not have a girlfriend?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d William blushes. \u201cAre your trying to say that you want to be my girlfriend?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm,\u201d Laurel says nervously. \u201cNot your girlfriend exactly but I would like to be with you. I want to be your toy master.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will make a great toy Laurel.\u201d William smiles. \u201cA very sexy toy.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam brings Laurel closer to his giant face. Laurel tenses up, while she does know that William has been gentle with her she is still a bit nervous. William places his giant lips on the top of her head and gives her a kiss. Laurel can\u2019t help but smile. William places his lips on Laurel\u2019s face and kisses her repeatedly and gently. Laurel moans as he kisses her. His giant warm lips feels nice against her tiny face. Laurel closes her eyes and enjoys the sort of make out session with the giant boy. After a bit of kissing William removes Laurel from his face with a smile. Laurel can\u2019t help but blush.  Laurel feels something tug at her jacket. She looks down and sees that it\u2019s William trying to remove it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Laurel asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d William smiles. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to take your jacket off.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll you need to do is ask.\u201d Laurel smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you take your clothes off for me?\u201d William asks as he places her on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d be happy to.\u201d Laurel smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel grabs her jacket and throws it off her body. She looks up at William who is watching her with a huge smile on his face. Laurel smiles back and kicks off her boots and socks. She turns around and shakes her butt as she slides her pants off revealing her panty covered ass. She turns back to William who is smiling. Laurel counties to shake her body as she pulls her shirt over her head. William feels himself getting hard. He looks down at himself and sees Felicity struggling to move. He looks back up and sees that Laurel is standing there naked with her hands on her hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee anything you like master?\u201d Laurel asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I do,\u201d William says almost drooling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reaches out and wraps his giant fingers around Laurel\u2019s tiny waist. Laurel lets out a moan as William\u2019s fingers make contact with her bare skin. William brings Laurel up to his giant face and lets his giant eyes wander. Laurel gives William a smile as she can see him smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead master,\u201d Laurel smiles. \u201cPlay with my breasts, I know you want to.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam places his giant finger on Laurel\u2019s breasts and runs them across. Laurel lets out a moan as William runs his giant finger over her breasts. William brings his thumb in to the fun and gives Laurel\u2019s breasts a gentle squeeze. Laurel moans and William plays with her tiny nipples. Laurel throws her head back and moans. She is in heaven. William removes his fingers and gives Laurel a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs my master hungry?\u201d Laurel asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am a bit,\u201d William says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a bit of sweet honey for you,\u201d Laurel smiles. \u201cAll you need to do is put your tongue inside to get it out.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam smiles and lifts Laurel in the air with no hesitation. Laurel looks down and see William has his head tilted back and his mouth open. Laurel moans in anticipation. William lowers Laurel and wraps his lips around her pelvis. Laurel hangs her legs on the side of his mouth and closes her eyes. Laurel squeals as William\u2019s giant tongue makes contact with her tiny pussy. William starts to poke at Laurel\u2019s snatch and tries to get the sweet honey Laurel is talking about. Laurel squeals with pleasure and excitement, she has never had anything like this happen to her before. William\u2019s giant tongue was incredible. Laurel feels her climax building up, she lets out a loud scream and climaxes in William\u2019s mouth. Laurel feels William\u2019s giant tongue try to lick up all of the access juice. William runs his tongue across Laurels\u2019 pussy a few more times and this causes Laurel to climax again. William smiles and sucks up all of Laurel\u2019s juices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam removes Laurel from his mouth and face. He brings her down and holds her at his chest level. He smiles and sees that Laurel is drenched in her own sweat and is completely exhausted. Laurel does her best to give William a smile. William brings her up to his face and gives her another kiss on her tiny face. Laurel giggles and William places her on his chest like he would holding a baby. Laurel closes her eyes and lets out a moan as William strokes her back with his finger. She can\u2019t believe that he had given her an amazing experience and that she feels safe in his hands. Laurel had to admit that she is looking forward to being William\u2019s toy.  </span></div></div>",

William removes her from her chest and places Laurel on the table in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to admit,\" Laurel says. \"You really do earn the title of master.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" William smiles. \"You're right about your honey too, its nice a sweet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's more where that came from.\" Laurel smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam states at Laurel's snatch with a grin and licks his lips. Laurel giggles at him. William looks down at his cock and sees that he's will hard. He pushes himself aside and sees Felicity laying there. William smiles and wraps his fingers around her pulling her out. He places Felicity on the table next to Laurel. Laurel can't help but smile, seeing Felicity drenched in sweat was amusing to her since its hard to figure out of it's hers or William's. Felicity shoots Laurel a dead shot grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was your time under William's massive cock?\" Laurel asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you think?!\" Felicity snaps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing it was pretty good.\" Laurel smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was your time with William?\" Felicity asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was really good thanks for asking.\" Laurel smiles. \"I can't believe you're acting like such a bitch when a handsome man is being nice to you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being nice?\" Felicity says. \"This isn't being nice, William is doing nothing but having his way with me despite my protests. That's not fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel doesn't respond to Felicity this time, all she does is smirk and look at William. Felicity turns to William and sees him with tears rolling down his cheeks. While Felicity wants to feel bad for him she's not taking anything back since what she said was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right Felicity,\" William says wiping away his tears. \"I shouldn't have done that, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry I got carried away, I just thought that you would have liked what I was doing to you. I wasn't trying to hurt you I was only trying to make you happy like Laurel was when we were having fun. I didn't mean to, I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity doesn't know how to respond. She never thought that he would apologize because he has the stronger hand and now that he has she is speechless. Felicity gives him a nervous smile and they sit in silence for a bit. Laurel tries to hold back a smile, seeing Felicity speechless was just amazing. Laurel turns to William and sees that he feels bad, she understands where he was coming from, he's only doing his best to please the two girls, he's young a curious. She loved everything he did to her and wants more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what she's on about but I love every you have done for me.\" Laurel says. \"Its not every day you get someone who wants to nothing but make you feel good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" William smiles as Felicity rolls her eyes. \"I've been though quite a lot and just having you two around me and playing with you has made me happy again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad I've made you happy master.\" Laurel smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suck up,\" Felicity snarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At lest I don't have a stick up my ass.\" Laurel smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I have more than one person in my life who actually like me.\" Felicity snaps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel doesn't snap back. She knew that is was true but having William showing her this much love and affection makes her realise how lonely she really is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not nice Felicity.\" William says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true though.\" Felicity smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right it is.\" Laurel sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel does her best to explain everything to William and Felicity. She explains that her life hasn't been easy with everyone around her trying to kill her and even hate her no matter what earth she is on and how William made her feel safe and liked for the first time. Felicity doesn't butt in with a comment, she's starting to genially feel bad for her. While Felicity can tell when Laurel is lying she sees that Laurel is really pouring her heart out. Felicity takes a small step towards Laurel, she wants to give her a hug. Laurel turns to Felicity and Felicity gives her a little smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity can't believe that she is doing this but she pours her heart out too. She explains how scary it is to know that her and everyone she loves could die at anytime and how her upbringing with her father has affected her. Laurel doesn't snark or comment either. She let's Felicity pour her heart out and not give her shit for it. The three of them go back and forth for the next hour talking and confessing about personal things. Laurel and Felicity let each other speak and not interrupt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was good getting those things off my chest.\" William smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it was,\" Felicity says.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Laurel giggles to herself and gently pushes Felicity to the ground. Felicity sits down and Laurel counties to rub her shoulders. Felicity can't believe how good it was. Laurel moves her hands down to Felicity's back and rubs. Felicity moans again as Laurel gets to work. William can't believe how well the two are getting along. He leans back against the couch and watches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Felicity,\" Laurel whispers. \"I won't hurt a hair on that pretty little head of yours.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel runs her hands down Felicity's back and continues to rub. Felicity counties to moan and feels Laurel hands moving around to her front. Felicity let's out a gasp, Laurel cups her hands over Felicity's breasts and gives them a squeeze. Felicity let's out a moan, she wants to pull Laurel's hands off but there's something inside her stopping her. Laurel kisses the back of Felicity's neck and gently massages Felicity's breasts and pinches her nipples. Felicity let's out a little squeal as Laurel works Felicity's breasts. Laurel smiles as she can feel Felicity's nipples become erect. Laurel kisses the back of Felicity's neck, both Laurel and Felicity moan, Felicity closes her eyes and enjoys it, she knows it's wrong but it feels so good.

Laurel pinches her nipples giving her a harder squeeze. Felicity squeal, Laure moves her head down to Felicity's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like that don't you,\" Laurel whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm,\" Felicity moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you do little slut.\" Laurel grins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel locks lips with Felicity and the two kiss. Felicity moans as Laurel shoves her tongue inside her mouth. She wraps her tongue around Felicity's and the two moan as Laurel dominates her tongue. Felicity brings her hands up to Laurel and tries to push her off. Laurel grabs her wrists and pins her arms against the table. Felicity tries to move but she is too weak. Laurel is now dominating her. Laurel scoots up and rubs her snatch against Felicity's stomach. Felicity moans as she feels Laurel's snatch run up her body. Laurel removes herself from Felicity's face and moves up more. She sides her crotch up so that she is practically sitting on her face. Felicity looks up with wide eyes and sees Laurel's pussy looming over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be the good little bitch that you are and eat me out.\" Laurel whispers as she lowers herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel sits down on Felicity's face with a moan. Felicity tries to grab Laurel again but Laurel grabs her hands and pins them under knees trapping them. Laurel let's out another moan as she feels Felicity kiss her lips. Felicity sticks out her tongue and starts to eat Laurel out. Laurel moans as the tiny IT girl is doing a great job. Laurel never expected Felicity to actually go though with it let alone be good at it. Laurel smiles and gently grinds herself against Felicity's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel grins as she has an idea. She spins herself around and lowers her face to Felicity's snatch. Laurel feels Felicity's hands escape her knees. Much to Laurel's surprise Felicity grabs Laurel's ass giving it a squeeze and counties to tongue fuck her pussy. Laurel let's out a moan and brings her attention down to Felicity's pussy. She smiles and sticks a finger inside her. She hears Felicity's moans through her pussy. That's not enough, Laurel grins and does her best to slide four fingers inside Felicity. Felicity let's out a squeal and removes her mouth from Laurel's snatch and starts to moan repeatedly as Laurel thrusts her fingers in and out. Felicity has never had anything like this happen to her before but she has to admit that it feels incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say stop.\" Laurel says removing her hand. \"Get back to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity does what she's told and counties to tongue fuck Laurel.

Felicity let's out a loud scream and cums all over Laurel's hand. Laurel smiles and removes her fingers from Felicity. She looks up at her and sees that Felicity is laying there trying to catch her breath back. Laurel grins and sits back up, she grinds her pussy against Felicity's face and moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get back to work little slut. Stop being such a fucking tease.\" Laurel demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity takes a deep breath and does what she's told. She sticks her tongue back inside and tongue fucks Laurel. Laurel throws her head back and moans. She has to admit that Felicity was doing a good job. Laurel screams and cums all over Felicity's face. Laurel grins and climbs off her face. She lays down on top of Felicity and brings her face to Felicity's cum coated one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see that your good at your job Felicity.\" Laurel whispers. \"You're more useful than I thought you'd be. Be a good girl and clean up this mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity doesn't respond, Laurel smiles and gives Felicity a quick kiss. Laurel stands up and stretches. She looks down and sees Felicity who is drenched in her own sweat, face covered in Laurel's cum and is exhausted. Laurel smiles and looks up at William who has a huge smile on his face. Laurel can't help but laugh a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" William smiles. \"That was amazing, what did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just helped her loosen up a bit,\" Laurel smiles. \"She just needed a good time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was she?\" William asks. \"I mean it looked like you really enjoyed it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh she was amazing,\" Laurel smiles. \"She's not as good as you master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam smiles and looks down at Felicity. Felicity can't believe it, she had just been fucked by Black Siren. What was more shocking is that she enjoyed it. Felicity lays there and let's everything sink in.</span></div></div>",

That's also why she gave her personnal cell phone number. All she had to do was to wait for Oliver to call her, which happenned a few days later. Susan was a patient personn, and did the things step by step, first she invited him to take a drink, then Oliver did it too, and later, she was finally invited to his home, the best place to check for something, anything she could use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she didn't expect, was that she started to feel something for him, but she remained professionnal. And after a night sleeping with him, Susan wasn't sure to know where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I need to go now, being a Mayor makes things complicate for, but you can take your time to leave. \" He said, dressing up as Susan just woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Are you sure ?

I've enjoyed this night. I'll see you later then \" Oliver then leaves, allowing Susan to check freely his home. At first she wasn't sure she still wanted to do this, but this was for the best. After all, if she had to continue her relationship with him, she needed to know what he was hidding from her. This was not professionnal anymore, but personnal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately after some few minutes checking desks, drawers and closets, she found nothing suspicious but a small strange device with a button to push. Susan had never seen anything like this before, and wondered what was that, when she decided to push the button creating a portal next to her. At first she was scared, and had a step back but she realized enought soon what it was. What she didn't know was, where this was leading to ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oliver Queen...you seem to have a really interesting secret. \" She said to herself, taking her cell and took a picture of the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happenned now  ?</span></div></div>",

In fact, she was a giantess and realized ita soon as she saw the tinies buildings surrounding her, and screams coming with her entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh my...is that a tiny civilisation ? \" she wondered, scared and curious at the same time. Susant bent down to check if the screams were coming from some tiny people, and she was right. With some hesitations, she decided to grab one of these tinies personns in her hand, she held him tight mostly because she was scared, and with her other hand she took her cell and took a picture of her tiny captive before letting him go. It took Susan several minutes to accept the reality. This was definately a tiny civilsation, they were humans, they had feelings, well they were just tiniy people and Susan knew she had the scoop of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I'm going to be rich....\" she thought to herself, when suddenly some helcopters arrived, followed by some soldiers on the groud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a loud speaker, a tiny woman from the soldiers began to speak :<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" My name is Alex Danvers.

And besides, we saw you take a photo, is that not enough?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan rolls her eyes 'This photo, any macrophilia fetish site can do something about the same. What I need is something that can't be simply dismissed as fake. And that is you' before Alex can form any kind of argument she picks up the agent and brings her up to her face 'Quite a cute one, better keep you safe, who knows how much you'd sell on the back market' she jokes but Alex feels a shiver go down her spine regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was this moment that Supergirl appears, striking her usual epic pose 'Put the agent down and return to your home dimension.

Still it could be a LOT worse and Susan did smell very nice a feminine, a rather enticing mix of jasmine and lilies which while a little strong due to her size was still quite pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the key to future fame, fortune and awards secure she pressed the button on the device once more, the swirling portal opens and she steps through, closing behind her just before Kara was able to reach it and fly through, much to her annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>Earth 1</i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow back home and the right size, Susan peaks down her blouse to make sure she hadn't hallucinated the entire thing, and there was Alex proving everything that just happened was true.

Maybe even get a Pulitzer for it<br>\r\n2) Decides to forgo subtlety like everyone else in Star City and just pull Alex out of her top live on air, no way she can fake something like that after all.</span></div></div>",

Or you gay or something ? \" She teased.  Alex didn't respond, but the only fact she blushed at the question, was enought to tell Susan what she needed to know. \"Well, i think i got the best specimen ever. A special agent considering your outfits, gay and mostly...tiny. I'm going to be rich thanks to you \" the giantess added while she took a sit on the chair in front of the desk.  She then took a pen and a paper, ready to write the best article she ever wrote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Now let's talk about serious things.What's your name ? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" If you think i'm going to help you after you just have kidnapped me in front of my friends and my sister, you'll be disappointed ! \" Alex replied trying to remain strong. It was a matter of time before Kare uses her device to come and saves her. Susan had no other reaction but smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh...I think we have some little things to make it clear. First, this is not a kidnapping, someone like you has no rights on my Earth. I'm not even sure we can consider you as human \". Susan said ignoring how painfull her words sounded for Alex. \" And second, maybe you should reconsider your situation. You are gay. I'm a giant woman, sexy by the way. So if you get to help me with the interview, i might consider to do something for you, even if i myself prefer men. But stills, in my profession i know how to make sacrifices to get what i want, and so you can get what you want to. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex blushed once again, but in any cases she had to gain times so Kara can come and saves her. So she just nodded to the giantess who smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good girl. Now let's start again : What's your name ? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Alex Danvers, DEO agent  \" Alex replied, forced to watch her captor writing while she talked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" How does that feel to be so pathetic ? \" Susan asked cruelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Pathetic ? \" Alex said with anger. \" I'm saving my world everyday from humans and aliens coming to our Earth ! I'm a strong agent and proud to be a part of the DEO ! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan took notes of her words again. \" I see \" She said almost amused by the fact Alex thought she was a \"strong agent\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Susan questionned her prey for almost 30min, many of the questions were normals, but a few of these, were hard and Alex couldn't help but feel humiliated during the whole interview, thought that she trained to not show any emotions. There were nothing that could prepare her for being questionned by a giant bitch that didn't show any remorse about capturing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think i have everything i need, thank you Alex \" Susan said, putting her papers inside the drawer. \" I'm going to show you to the world on tomorrow, but first, a promise is a promise, so, if you have something in mind you want me to do for you, just tell me. And don't be shy, this will be only between us. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bad news for Alex, Kara won't be around to save her for a while, also she's not getting home without help)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was trained to be stoic at all times... but her training didn't include a sexy giantess offering to 'do things' to her. She hadn't done anything since Maggie left, didn't even approach Sam for fear of rejection from the lovely Milf, so Alex was a little backed up sexually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Anything, right?' she asks almost timidly, causing Susan to laugh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yep, so what do you want little one?' she asks, Alex twitches as someone else uses Astra's nickname for her, but shoves it aside before answering<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI want to feel you, I want to feel that sexy body of yours rub against me' Alex confessed, to which Susan just smiles before reaching for her blouse<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Then who am I to deny such a request' she teases before beginning to strip, liking the way Alex stares at her, a tiny bit of drool escaping her lips. She turns as she removes her panties, jokingly threatening to drop her ass on her little toy, but she has no intention of doing something like that just yet. Finally nude she stands in a pose similar to Kara, before ordering 'Strip' which snaps Alex out of her sexy daydream<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Skin to skin little agent, that's what you want right?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex blinks before smiling and quickly pulling off her uniform shirt, but she was apparently taking too long as Susan got bored of waiting and just picked her up and yanked her pants off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Time for some fun Alex' she coos, just before pressing the agent into her breast, rubbing her along it's underside. Alex felt like a passive spectator, right until she was pressed against Susan's nipple, at that point Alex understood, pressing her breasts against the nub and nibbled the tip, the correct option given she was pressed harder into her breast when she did that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh you feel delightful' Susan moans, before dragging Alex down her body till she reached her butt, at which point she's slammed into the jiggling flesh with a smack, to the reporter's amusement before she rubs her in like a massage device, humming to herself as she does so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was surprised by how much she was enjoying this, being rubbed against the soft parts of this giantess, but she honestly didn't care, she was enjoying her time just letting go and having a little fun with a sexy lady. Hopefully when she gets back to Earth 38 she'll get to do something similar with Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Alex and Susan are both worked up enough the agent gets shoved into her pussy<br>\r\n2) Time skip to the next day, where Susan shows Alex to the world.</span></div></div>",

She was knocked out from the powerful strange blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyla looks around expecting to be back at ARGUS but she was far from it.

Lyla's eyes remain on the door, louder and louder, they stop but still no one is there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?!\" Someone says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyla turns around and sees a giant brunette woman standing over her with her jaw hanging. Lyla's stomach drops as she can't believe her size compared to herself. Her face get closer and the giant brown eyes studies her tiny form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mam,\" Lyla stutters. \"My name is Lyla Mitchells and I am the director of ARGUS.

It\u2019s obvious that Ruby choses to ignore Lyla\u2019s pleas as if she helps her that means Ruby has to give up her new doll. A tear rolls down Lyla\u2019s cheek as she know there is no possible way out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d Ruby asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Lyla gasps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d Ruby asks again. \u201cI\u2019ve never kissed anyone before I really want to.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyla\u2019s jaw drops, she doesn\u2019t know what to say to that. Ruby purses her lips and brings Lyla closer. Lyla\u2019s stomach drops, she tries squirming her way out of Ruby\u2019s grip but it\u2019s useless. The giant pink lips are pressed against her tiny face with a bit of force. Lyla lets out a little squeal as she feels a bit of pressure coming from the giant lips. Lyla tires to pull away but Ruby just holds her closer. Lyla freaks as Ruby doesn\u2019t remove herself after a second. Lyla\u2019s expecting a kiss lasting no longer than a second but Ruby is holding onto for longer and more passion. She can\u2019t believe that she is giving this preteen her first kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d Ruby gasps as she slowly removes herself from Lyla. \u201cThat was nice.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyla remains quite, a thousand thoughts are going though her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I had my first kiss.\u201d Ruby smiles. \u201cHow did you like it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyla doesn\u2019t say anything as she\u2019s too embarrassed to say anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you like it?\u201d Ruby asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Lyla squeals. \u201cI mean I sort of did but\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of disappointment washes over Ruby\u2019s face, Lyla feels horrible as she looks like she broke this girls heart. Ruby takes a deep breath and screws up her face, Lyla doesn\u2019t like the look of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me try again.\u201d Ruby sighs. \u201cAnd this time I want you to kiss back.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lyla has a chance to react Ruby presses her face against her lips and passionately kisses Lyla. Lyla lets out yelp, she has no way of breathing. Ruby removes Lyla with her face still screwed up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to keep kissing you until I feel you kiss back.\u201d Ruby says with her voice raised slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyla squeals as she is forced back against the giant pink lips, if she wants this to stop she has to do as she\u2019s told. Lyla shivers and purses her lips against Ruby\u2019s giant upper lip. She does her best to kiss her lip as passionately as she can so that Ruby can feel her. Ruby\u2019s lips remain so Lyla guesses that she can\u2019t feel her. Lyla places her hands against the lips and runs them all over trying to kiss and feel the giant lips. Lyla feels disgusted and embarrassed with herself as she is trying to make out with this giant preteen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby lets out a little giggle and removes Lyla from her face. Lyla lets out a sigh of relief and she is free. Lyla looks up at sees Ruby grinning ear to ear. Lyla turns bright red feeling embarrassed from what has just happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps we should kiss more often?\u201d Ruby smiles giving Lyla a seductive look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyla hangs her head in shame, did she really just make out with this preteen and make have left her wanting more. Lyla shivers and what\u2019s about to come. </span></div></div>",

Ruby pats her head like she was doing before. Ruby\u2019s eyes dart up and down Lyla\u2019s body checking her out. Lyla shivers as she sees Ruby licking her lips. Ruby\u2019s finger travels down Lyla\u2019s head to her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d Lyla screams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby giggles but doesn\u2019t stop, her finger make contact with Lyla\u2019s breasts causing her to scream. Lyla tries to push Ruby\u2019s giant finger of her but Ruby pins her arms to her side. Lyla squeals again with Ruby rubbing her breasts. Lyla bites her bottom lip trying not to let out a moan. Ruby brings her thumb into play and gives both breasts a good squeeze. A moan slips out causing Ruby to giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou like that don\u2019t you?\u201d Ruby smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Ruby moans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby smiles and continues to fondle the tiny woman\u2019s breasts. Ruby wants more, she grabs Lyla\u2019s shirt and pulls it over her head. Lyla tries to fight back but Ruby removes her shirt before she has the chance. Ruby licks her lips as she sees Lyla\u2019s cloth covered breasts. Lyla lets out a little whimper as she does this. Ruby then rips off Lyla\u2019s bra with no effort. Lyla turns bright red as her bare breasts are exposed to the preteen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice tits.\u201d Ruby giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyla looks away whimpering. Ruby\u2019s giant fingers creep up Lyla\u2019s half naked body, she presses her giant finger on Lyla\u2019s breasts and drags them all over feeling up as much as she can. Lyla moans as Ruby\u2019s fingers brush over her nipples. Ruby licks her lips more when she feels that they are erect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder what they taste like?\u201d She whispers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Lyla squeals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby purses her lips and brings Lyla right up to her face. Lyla tries to squirm away but Rubys grip is too strong. Ruby presses her giant pink lips against Lyla\u2019s breasts and gives them a kiss. Lyla can\u2019t help herself, she lets out a loud moan. Ruby moans and kisses her breasts a few more times. Lyla starts panting, she has to admit that this feels kind of nice. She loves how soft and warm are on her breasts. Lyla lets out little moans, Ruby\u2019s lips curl as she can tell that she is enjoying herself. Ruby slowly opens her mouth and slides Lyla\u2019s breasts inside her mouth. Lyla lets out a gasp as Ruby\u2019s lips curl around her breasts and lock on firmly. Lyla bites her bottom lip and Ruby starts to gently suck on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god!\u201d Lyla moans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation is incredible, the gentle force on her breasts is breath taking and Ruby\u2019s salvia coating her adds to it. Lyla squeals as Ruby brings her tongue into the mix. The giantess\u2019s tongue explores all over, between and brushing across her erect nipples. Lyla throws her head back and screams. She\u2019s never had a sexual thrill like this before and she is surprisingly loving it. Ruby moans just as much as Lyla is, she\u2019s loving the taste of the tiny woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a solid ten seconds of sucking and tasting Ruby removes Lyla\u2019s breasts from her mouth with a moan. Lyla lets out a sigh of relief as she is removed. Lyla throws her head back and starts puffing, that too a lot out of her. She opens her eyes and sees Ruby smiling down at her. Ruby licks her lips and moans. Without thinking Lyla smiles and giggles a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see that someone is having fun.\u201d Ruby smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyla\u2019s eyes drift, she turns bright red feeling a whole lot of embarrassment due to her enjoyment. She would have loved all this if it was John, someone else older or someone who gave her permission to do all this to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d Lyla squeals as Ruby tugs on her pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby giggles and slides Lyla\u2019s pants off followed by her underwear. Lyla turns bright red as she is now butt naked in her hands. She has never been so embarrassed in her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have such a sexy body Lyla.\u201d Ruby smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyla blushes and looks away. Ruby brings her towards her giant face with a huge grin. She slides her tongue out of her mouth and gives Lyla\u2019s tiny form a good lick. Lyla lets out a shiver and squeal as her body gets coated in saliva. She\u2019s just glad that Ruby had missed her vagina. Ruby spins Lyla around and sticks her ass in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCute butt.\u201d Rub giggles as she gives her cheeks a firm squeeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyla lets out a loud moan as she\u2019s given another squeeze. Ruby trails the tip of her finger over each cheek very softy. Lyla moans as it does feel really good, the smooth gentle nature of it all was very nice and soothing. She can\u2019t help herself and lets all her moans out not holding back. Lyla bushes when she hears Ruby giggle, the sensation is slowly taking over her. Lyla bites her bottom lip as Ruby gets dangerously close to her vagina. She can\u2019t tell if the near miss is deliberate or not. Ruby places her giant lips on Lyla\u2019s cheeks giving them a kiss. Lyla lets out a loud moan, the giant wet and pillowy lips pressed against her rear end. Lyla squeals as Ruby\u2019s tongue runs down her crack. It\u2019s so wet and warm it\u2019s hard not to get a thrill out of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really do taste as good as you look.\u201d Ruby moans as she removes herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby spins Lyla around with a huge smile on her face. Lyla just lays there with Ruby\u2019s giant warm fingers wrapped around her naked body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so much fun Lyla,\u201d Ruby smiles. \u201cI just love playing with that sexy body of yours. You\u2019re the best girlfriend ever.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby presses her lips against Lyla\u2019s tiny face and passionately kisses her. Lyla closes her eyes and unintentionally kisses back enjoying herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck am I doing?\u201d Lyla thinks. </span></div></div>",

The laptop is badly broken and what could lay in the hard dive is all the maps and plans for that the next target could be. All Felicity needed to do was recover what is on the dive and hand it over. The bad guys will be caught and it\u2019s over until the next person comes along and threatens team arrow or the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity falls back in her chair exhausted, she hits a few keys to hopefully be done but her decryption. A few things popped onto her screen and she could hardly make out what they are as her eye lips are getting heavy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did it?\u201d Felicity says, she leans in to get a better look.

Everything around her is huge, she looks down at herself then back around the giant room. She\u2019s still sitting on her chair that feels like a throne now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit!\u201d Felicity squeaks, \u201cI must have shrunk to four inches somehow.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity can hear footsteps approaching.

That laptop data better be worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning \" she tries to sound cheerful, but it probably sounded like she was smoking heavily this morning \"Hm, damn I must be early if there's no Felicity, which means I could have stayed in bed\" she sighs deeply and makes her way to the computer, hoping something useful was on it as she could see the displays were still active.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity gulps as she watches Thea enter the room as well as approach her, normally the younger Queen would be considered small and lithe, especially compared to Sara, Laurel or even Felicitys own rather cushy rear, but right now she was a Goddess, or at least one of their champions, Merlyn was a bastard but him and Oliver (separately of course) trained the girl good, she had firm muscle, contrasted with fat only in 2 specific places, her well formed bust, and perky ass. Felicity snapped out of her fantasies when the girl was close enough to cast a shadow over her, kick starting her brain to try get the girls attention and hopefully her help \"Hey! Thea, I'm right here, it's Felicity! I'm shrunk but it's still me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea squints as she tries make sense of the blueprints, some she recognizes but others will need work to decipher, hopefully Oliver and the others will arrive soon so they can get started, when she hears squeaks that on a longer inspection turned out to be words, and when she turned her head she saw it was their resident hacker and tech support, only doll sized \"Felicity? How'd you get so smoll?\" She asks with a slight coo in her voice, hunckering down to see her better, and unintentionally giving the blond a nice view of eye level cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a clue, one minute I was at my desk, decrypting the piece of junk you guys gace me, it's done by the way, I close my eyes for a second, and I woke up tiny just  few minutes ago\" Felicity explains, maintaining eye contact so as not to be tempted by the valley below Speedys face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea frowns \"that's not much to go on Lis\" she says, getting a nod from the shrunken nerd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Thea suggests she checks Felicity and the lairs footage, maybe someone broke in and did this too her, or something weird happened and they'd have something to go on?<br>\r\n2) Thea has had a crush on Felicity since she met the glasses wearing cutie, now here she is palm sized and all alone, maybe this is her chance to admit, maybe get some play time in before the other show up and ruin it all?<br>\r\n3) the elevator dings and Thea panics, meaning Felicity gets to experience her fine ass first hand when she sits on her. Good thing Felicity has such a nice chair due to all the time spent down here on it, or this would be even more uncomfortable for her than it currently was. At least the data was processed, meaning they'll leave and she can find a safer place to stand and not get smushed at.</span></div></div>",

Wearing the suit gives me a wedgie quite often, so I found it easier to go without, the skirt hiding that fact wonderfully\" she cants her hips forward as she says so, the skirt flapping and giving an eyeful of wet vaginal lips to little Felicity. Before she could comment on that Thea had scooped her up and sat down again, still smiling \"now what to do with such a little cutie like you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Thea checks what happened to cause Felicity to shrink, as well as if it can be reversed and/or done to other people <br>\r\n2)Not wanting to waste the opportunity Thea confesses her feelings for the blond, hoping for a girlfriend, but sex toy will work as a close second<br>\r\n3) Seeing Thea as someone who won't be much help Felicity says the mission is more important, and so she'll work through it at this side, and try get in touch with Ray the next chance she has free</span></div></div>",

Still weird to see someone torn apart and Thea still just throws popcorn in her mouth or drops them in Felicitys direction, or sips her wine and smirks.

Thea tilts her head back and slides Felicity's legs inside her mouth curling her lips around her wide hips. Felicity smilies and purrs as Thea starts to suck and lick on her lower half. The giant warm tongue laps at her thighs and pussy before moving to her ass. Felicity moans like crazy as Thea's giant tongue does it's best to explore everywhere. Felicity absolutely loves this, she doesn't care if Thea is drunk as this is heaven. It makes Felicity wonder if Thea would go this far if she was sober. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity's eyes widen as she feels Thea's teeth graze against her pussy.

The tongue starts to get rougher. Licking Felicity's pussy and ass hole switching between he two while also trying to force the tip inside. Felicity screams, she cant take it any more.

Before Kara could speak to try to clam the man down he pulls the trigger and blasts her straight in the chest with a green beam blasting her.

She is freaked out by the possibility of a giant finding her and keeping her but then she corrects herself thinking that this giant can help her. Kara stands up and turns to the giant; she is going to get the giant\u2019s attention. Kara sees the giant and couldn\u2019t help but wimpier a bit as they are huge compared to her. Kara waves her arms and screams the giant\u2019s name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant is\u2026..</span></div></div>",

Sam could easily hurt her without even trying. Sam walks over to the hole in the wall and sighs. Her office is completely destroyed. Sam sits down on the remains of her chair. She looks around her office and sighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d Sam sighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam scans the room and sees something on the ground. It looks like a small doll. Kara smiles as her friend sees her but her heart sinks as well. Sam gets up and walks over to her. Kara leans back a bit to get a better look at the giant. Sam\u2019s giant feet are inches from Kara, she looks up and sees a giant hand coming from her. Sam wraps her giant fingers around Supergirl and slowly raises her in the air. Kara\u2019s stomach drops as Sam holds her up to her giant face. Sam studies the tiny girl with a confused look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho would leave a Supergirl doll in my office?\u201d Sam asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara wants to scream to Sam telling her that it is really Supergirl but she is paralysed with fear. Sam places her giant finger on Kara\u2019s head and gently pats her like she is some sort of pet. Sam smiles and runs her finger down Kara\u2019s body. Her giant finger makes contact with Kara\u2019s tiny breasts and Kara gasps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d Sam gasps. \u201cIt\u2019s so soft and life like.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s because I am.\u201d Kara whimpers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara expects Sam to hear her plea for help but Sam doesn\u2019t hear.

Ruby studies Kara\u2019s tiny body with her giant eyes. She places her giant finger on Kara\u2019s head and gently runs it down her body. She feels her shiver and makes contact with her breasts. Kara lets out a squeal and smacks Ruby\u2019s giant fingers away.

She sits down on her chair and gently places Kara on her desk. Kara looks up at Ruby in shock and she sees her reaching for something behind her. Kara tenses up as she hears Ruby bringing the object closer to her. She closes her eyes as Ruby places the object right next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStand up straight.\u201d Ruby instructs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara slowly opens her eyes and does what Ruby said. She looks to her side and sees that Ruby is pressing a ruler against her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Kara asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to see how small my baby is,\u201d Ruby smiles. \u201cSix inches, my baby is quite small.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara winces a bit. Having Ruby call her a baby seems a bit strange to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you calling me baby?\u201d Kara asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause silly,\u201d Ruby teases. \u201cYou are my little girl which makes me your mother and as my responsibility as a mother it is my job to look after you which makes you my baby.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not your baby!\u201d Kara screams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk back to your mother young lady!\u201d Ruby says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby brings her hand behind Kara and pucks her finger with her thumb and releases it sending her forefinger onto Kara ass. \tKara howls in pain. Since she has no powers this is the first bit of pain she has ever experienced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow say sorry.\u201d Ruby says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Kara sobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood girl.\u201d Ruby says. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you baby it\u2019s just you don\u2019t need to talk back to your Mommy okay. Now give Mommy a kiss.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby presses her giant lips of Kara\u2019s head and gives her a gentle kiss. Ruby wraps her giant fingers around Kara\u2019s waist and slowly brings her up to her giant face with a smile. Ruby places her giant finger on Kara\u2019s head and gently strokes her hair like she would an animal. Ruby notices tears rolling down Kara\u2019s cheeks. Ruby uses her giant finger to wipe away the tears. Ruby places her lips on Kara\u2019s tiny face and gives her a kiss. Ruby looks at Kara\u2019s Supergirl outfit and smirks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the costume like?\u201d Ruby asks. \u201cIs it comfortable to wear?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSort of,\u201d Kara says. \u201cIt can be a bit uncomfortable to wear at times.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you get any rashes from it?\u201d Ruby asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d Kara regrets her words as soon as they leave her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe better get you out of it then.\u201d Ruby says. \u201cI don\u2019t want my baby to get a rash.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby grabs Kara\u2019s costume and gives it a tug. Kara tries to stop Ruby but she can\u2019t, she\u2019s too strong. Ruby manages to rip Kara\u2019s costume straight off her body like it is nothing. A few tears roll down Kara\u2019s cheeks. Ruby smiles and places the costume on her desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow where does my baby get her rashes?\u201d Ruby asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby brings her attention back to Kara and her eyes lock on to her breasts. Ruby smiles and Kara does her best to cover them up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t hide them.\u201d Ruby smiles. \u201cI want to see.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara slowly removes her arms as she doesn\u2019t want another flick in the ass. Ruby places her thumb and forefinger on the side of Kara\u2019s breasts and gives them an gentle squeeze. Kara lets out a gasp as Ruby\u2019s giant forefinger traces around her breasts. Kara closes her eyes and does her best not to moan. She doesn\u2019t want Ruby to get any idea that she is enjoying is. Ruby giggles and continues to play with Kara\u2019s little tits. She runs her finger over and she can feel Kara\u2019s erect nipples through the fabric of her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy baby has such a pretty pair.\u201d Ruby smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara gasps as Ruby gives her tiny breasts another squeeze. Ruby smiles, she has an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs my baby hungry?\u201d Ruby asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm,\u201d Kara tries to choose her words carefully. \u201cYeah a bit.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby smiles and gently places Kara on her desk. Kara runs over to her costume and tries to put it back on. Ruby grabs it from her and throws it on the ground beside her. Ruby smiles down at Kara and pulls her shirt over her head. Kara\u2019s stomach drops, she had figured out what Ruby is planning to. Ruby unclips her bra and throws it on the ground. Ruby strikes a pose showing off her young breasts. Kara\u2019s eyes lock on. Ruby sees Kara starring and smiles, Kara turns red and looks away. Ruby wraps her giant fingers around Kara and raises her in the air. She holds Kara at chest level and brings her in. Kara starts screaming as she sees Ruby giant nipple getting closer. Ruby tightens her gip a bit causing Kara to squeal. Kara stops struggling as she doesn\u2019t want Ruby to hurt her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay baby.\u201d Ruby coos as she places Kara\u2019s head against her nipple. \u201cEat up, I know you are hungry.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara closes her eyes as Ruby presses her face against the giant nipple. She tries to turn away but Ruby forces her on. Kara decides to play along as she doesn\u2019t want more pain. Kara opens her mouth and Ruby slides her giant nipple inside. Kara starts to suck on the giant nipple trying to please Ruby. Ruby giggles as she is enjoying the sensation. Ruby\u2019s giggles slowly turns into moans. She had never felt anything like this before so this was amazing for her. Ruby places her giant finger on the back on Kara\u2019s head and gently strokes it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of minutes Ruby peels Kara of her nipple. She brings Kara up to her giant face with a smile. Kara is shaking a bit and Ruby can\u2019t help but moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat felt great Supergirl.\u201d Ruby moans. \u201cDid you enjoy your lunch?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara doesn\u2019t say anything, she is just happy she no longer has to suck on Ruby\u2019s nipple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow where does my baby get her rash?\u201d Ruby asks. \u201cI bet it\u2019s on your butt.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara squeals as Ruby spins her around. Ruby holds Kara\u2019s ass up to her face and smiles. Ruby places her giant thumb and forefinger on Kara\u2019s ass and gives it a squeeze. Kara lets out a squeal and Ruby runs her finger down Kara\u2019s crack. Kara lets out another squeal as she feels Ruby slide her panties off. Ruby licks her lips and brings Kara\u2019s ass up to her face. Kara screams as she can feel Ruby\u2019s warm breath on her ass. Ruby places her lips on Kara\u2019s ass and gives it a kiss. Ruby smiles and gives it another kiss. Kara lets out a moan. Ruby removes Kara\u2019s ass from her face and spins Kara back around holds her back at eye level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have such a cute butt Supergirl.\u201d Ruby smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby stands up and walks over to her bed. She gently places Kara on her bed and kneels down in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to go to the bathroom baby,\u201d Ruby says. \u201cSo I need you to stay here until I get back.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby gives Kara a smiles and stands up. Ruby puts her shirt back on. She swings the door closed and goes to the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara waits a couple of minutes to make sure that Ruby is gone. Without a second thought Kara sprints to the edge of the bed. She looks down and sees a pile of Ruby\u2019s clothes on the ground. Kara has fallen from taller highest before so this is nothing for her. Kara jumps and plummets to the ground. She hits the pile of the clothes and rolls of onto the ground next to her. She jumps up and sprints towards the door. Kara makes it after a couple of minutes but she is out of breath. She waits a minute to catch her breath back. Kara sees that Ruby didn\u2019t close the door properly. She uses all her strength to swing the door open. She squeezes though and runs out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara lets out a sigh as she looks back at Ruby\u2019s room, she is just glad she is out of there. Before Kara can turn back she runs into a giant leg. She falls over and looks up and tries to see the giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant is\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She places her hands on her waist and shakes her head like a disappointed mother. Ruby reaches down and curls her giant fingers around the tiny woman. Ruby storms off into her bedroom slamming the door behind her. Kara\u2019s stomach drops and a few tears roll down her cheek. She knows what is coming. Ruby drops Kara on her desk and places her head next to Kara. Kara shivers as Ruby\u2019s giant face looms over girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a naughty girl,\u201d Ruby says in a booming voice. \u201cYou tried to run away from me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Kara apologies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA sorry won\u2019t be enough,\u201d Ruby says. \u201cYou need to be punished.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Kara begs. \u201cPlease no,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby ignores Kara\u2019s cries and pushes Kara back onto to the desk.

She know how to make it up to Kara. Kara\u2019s eyes are locked onto Ruby\u2019s giant ones. Ruby held a smile for her and Kara was trying to figure out what Ruby was going to do. Kara feels something between her legs. She looks down and sees Ruby\u2019s giant finger get closer. Before Kara could fully react Ruby\u2019s giant finger makes contact with Kara\u2019s tiny pussy and she lets out a gasp.

Lena Luthor, the woman taking one look at the mess the room was in and sighing tiredly 'Well so much for a private place away from the hate' she mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her plan revolving around getting the attention of whoever came into the room now she saw the giantess Kara froze in fear, with her powers gone she hadn't actually been this vulnerable since she was a child on Krypton. Not the best time for this as Lena had spotted her just a moment later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What the, you shouldn't be out here' she says under her breath before picking up Kara, her long fingers wrapping around Kara's torso as she's brought up to her face 'So not only has someone wrecked the place they've gone through my things, just fucking great' she pinches the bridge of her nose as her thumb runs along Kara's breasts, getting a whimper from the overly sensitive Kryptonian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Lena' Kara meeps, though the woman doesn't appear to have heard her, instead making her way into her room, her hands absently playing with the doll sized superhero<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This shouldn't do at all, you were meant to be our little secret my dear' she coos before bopping Kara in the chest, knocking the wind from her and causing her to choke, outing herself to the giantess 'Oh you...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Lena please help' Kara wheezes, quite certain Lena may have damaged a rib or two<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe CEO quirks an eyebrow but nods 'Okay, explain'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Kara does, about the man in the hood and his laser gun which managed to hurt her, how it was him to caused her to crash into Lena's little hidden apartment as well as shrink her, and how she lost her powers and froze up when she saw the enormous giantess that was Lena Luthor. 'Please Lena, I need your help, you're the only one I can turn to' Kara pleads, laying it on a little thick but she couldn't exactly tell her to call Alex or the DEO to help her, they most likely assume Lena had a hand in this and arrest her or worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Lena do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Worried but also intrigued by the ability of this person's device to shrink even a Kryptonian, Lena smuggles Kara into her private lab in L Corp (how is the choice of the chapter uploader) in order to examine her and try find an antidote/reverse to her shrinkage<br>\r\n2) This takes place just after their little fight so Lena's still angry, therefore she's going to take her anger out on Supergirl before she even considers helping her if at all.<br>\r\n3) Her feelings for the blond, probably combined with her severe abandonment issues see Kara's current situation as a blessing in disguise, deciding to keep Kara with her, fulfilling the role the Supergirl doll had been a placeholder for: someone to care about her and never leave her, someone to really love her and not just use as a means to an end.</span></div></div>",

Say hello to Supergirl' Lena coos as she pulls out a Supergirl doll from the safe, bringing it up to her level Kara is surprised by the eerie likeness, she was a dead ringer in face and hair, the only alteration was the creator had decided to give her firm G-cups, which the shrunken hero had the <i>'pleasure'</i> of feeling completely overpower her DD's 'Kara, Supergirl's going on a long trip, why don't you show her how much you'll miss her' Lena's voice was higher than normal, making Kara imagine her talking to a child, but she had more important things to think about, like the surrealism of kissing your doppelganger, especially when they're made of plastic and silicone. After the kiss Lena returns the doll to her safe and locks it still grinning like a loon<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Um now that's over can we get...' Kara was interrupted by another kiss... this time it being Lena's pillowy lips enveloping her entire head, a loud and wet kiss which lasted several seconds. Kara takes a deep breathe when she's finally released, but Lena just whispers 'perfect' and proceeds to pepper Kara with kisses, as well as occasional licks to the face. Finally enough is enough 'LENA!!!' Kara screams making the giantess stop 'What the Hell?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ravenette grins widely 'Oh Kara if that man wasn't obviously a criminal I'd hug him, this is everything I've ever dreamed of: my love, small and ultra cute, helpless and unable to leave me ever. You will be mine, you will never abandon me, you WILL love me' Kara gulps, maybe Lena's issues ran deeper than she thought they did, even more than her own it would seem<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Lena come on I would have never abandonnnnOw!'

She's the Girl of steel, surely she can survive a human sitting on her lap... well entire body ;)<br>\r\n3) Today was one of Lena's rare days off, something the CEO is very happy for as it means she has nothing else to do but play with Kara, looking forward to feeling the former goddess writhe and squirm under her fingers.... and tongue.

Same with Season 6 of Arrow but that's for different reasons, kept missing season 5 and am now really confused about what's going on in the current story. Any who, be gentle]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo we begin this storyline just after Supergirl and co manage to take out both Purity and Pestilence, with their powers being absorbed into Reign. We now focus on Reign in her hideaway, when a flicker of movement in the corner of her eye has her fire a blast of heat vision, the chuckles that follow proof she missed her target<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If that's your best my dear, it's no wonder you continue to fail' a voice purrs as a small, lizard like creature slinks out from behind the rocks, before the sounds of snapping bone and tearing flesh accompanies the creature swelling and expanding, finally reaching Reign's height and overall scale. It was a reptile like being, clearly female from it's voice and proportions, some small, backward pointing horns glowed due to the light grey against the deep midnight of her scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So you finally come out of hiding Singularity' Reign sneers, to which the final World killer smirks around her long snout, spreading her arms and briefly revealing her retractable spines in her wrists, as well as the hand sized non retractable spike on the end of her whip like tail 'Because of your cowardice we were beaten, your powers would have ensured our victory'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's called strategy my dear, plus you going out half cocked to bust up blondie wasn't a plan, so it was destined to fail, the deaths of the others are on your head' she actually laughs at Reign's anger right until she gets the Kryptonian's fist through her chest, surviving just long enough to see her heart ripped out of her chest before everything went black<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I am surrounded by cowards and incompetence, you didn't deserve your gift' she snarls before bending at the hips, gritting her teeth to avoid a scream from the pain as Singularity's powers were added to her own arsenal, as well as growing an entirely new appendage, that being the reptid's spiked tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch's had given Singularity a relatively simple power that like Pestilence tied into her name, the spines in her wrists as well as the more formidable tail spike produced a substance which when it finds a target enables the world killer to compress their form to anywhere between their original size and that of a small rodent, making threats much easier to deal with. It was also reversible and for lack of a better word, alterable on a whim. She had also been able to use it on herself with near perfect control, other than severe discomfort, but that was true for her victims as well so it was less of a side effect and more just part of the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with Singularity's magic added to Purity and Pestilence, Reign had all she needed to to deal with this world. She just needed to pick her first target... but who?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Kara</b>: Supergirl may be a soft hearted idiot, but she was also the only person who could stand even a chance against Reign if she ever got her head out of her ass and fought her for real. So why take the chance when she can shrink her, and either kill her at her reduced size or simply take her out of the equation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lena</b>: While no physical threat to the Kryptonian she was a genius and stubborn enough she wouldn't give up until she had a way to stop Reign or at the very least separate herself from Sam. She couldn't be left to do as she pleased, the question would be whether she could actually go through with killing one of the few people who cared about her/them/Sam or if she'd keep her around for her own amusement and maybe even get her to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Alex</b>: There was enough of Reign that was identical to Sam that the human agent kept slipping into her thoughts, plus she was beginning to become a pain in the ass in the real world too. Killing 2 birds with one stone Reign could shrink and kidnap Alex, then see what draws them together, maybe even keep her as a plaything or a memento of her first conquest/annihilation</span></div></div>",

She then walks over and pins her legs with her boot, a smile just starts to form<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is exactly what you deserve, justice is about to be served' Reign whispers as she moves her boot so it covers Alex's entire body, then begins to apply pressure, Alex's screams were music to her ears, the pathetic human in her true place before her demise, and now to break her for good... until she feels her muscles lock up<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex whimpers as her breathing slows, in pain but confused as to why she stopped, Reign wasn't exactly someone known for mercy 'The Hell is going on?' she wonders, not complaining, besides Reign basically standing on her hurting like a bitch<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'What are you doing?

Alex wondered what was going to happen to her now, since Reign couldn't kill her according to her own words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Sam ! I know you're still there, you have to help me ! ' The agent yelled in despair. But something happenned and Reign remained herself. She smirked. \" Don't waste your saliva. I suspect Samantha can interfer with me only when i'm about to kill you, or simply hurt you. And this is what i'm gonna check right now \". The dark giantess said before raising an hand and pressed one of Alex's arm with one finger, making her scream like hell, thought that Reign was holding her strenght as much as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hmmm...you can be hurt. Or maybe she just doesn't care about you \" Reign teased. Wich was not true. She felt the presence of Sam fighting to stop her, but as Alex's live was not directly in danger, she wasn't enought strong to interfer with her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Let's try something else then \". This time, the cruel woman tried to press her thumb on the agent's tiny face which was about to explode, when Reign stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\" I told you to not kill her. You might loose your control on my body and i will come back</i> Sam's voice said.<br>\r\n<i>That's not what you want ? Being in charge again of your body ?</i><br>\r\n<i>There will be another way, and if not then i would rather stay your prisonner forever than going back to see you have killed<br>\r\none of my friend. Beside, you won't waste anything only because you need the feel to kill an helpless woman who is already unable to fight you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nReign knew Sam had a point. But there was another problem : Ruby. If Reign couldn't kill Alex, then her second weak spot is certainly Ruby. Maybe she can even lost control of the body only by seeing her crying, the love of Sam for her daughter was too strong. Looking around her, Reign wondered if she could find something that could help to face Ruby, her biggest threat. Maybe she just had to ask someone to kill the girl for her, it might work this way if herself was not directly involved in her death. But she couldn't tell if Sam could read her mind or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happen ?</span></div></div>",

Alex explain' Kara demands, the agent hearing Lena try calm the blond down from the other end, explaining why Reign hung up, Lena and Kara were in the same place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We need to find a new approach to dealing with Reign and the witches' Alex  began, as that was the most important part, or at least the biggest statement she needed to get out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why? Is she threatening you?' Kara asks, a mix of worry and anger palatable in her voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No she isn't. Well she tried but Sam stopped her from doing too much damage, then healed me. From there the 3 of us realised Reign had always been part of Sam, she had a split personality and the witches were able to use her Kryptonian programming to override the more aggressive, impulsive side to carry out their orders. With that piece of information you'll see why finding a way to breaking the conditioning rather than simply kill Reign is the priority' Alex explains as best she could, Reign chipping in whenever possible, mostly about times in Sam's life when it was actually her or the situation was resolved because of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's the reaction and outcome of this new piece of information?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Kara doesn't trust Alex with Reign so flies down to get her back, only for Reign to shrink her down to the same size as Alex and shorting out her main powers (flight, heat vision and super breath). The problem for Reign is with Kara being Alex's sister humiliation, particularly making the smug alien kiss her boots didn't appeal to her any more, so she brings her up to Lena, informing her Kara would be like this for quite a while and to indulge as many fantasies as she desired. Kara worries about the hungry look in Lena's eyes just before a more aggressive than usual kiss envelops her face<br>\r\n2) The new information will need a lot of research and as the only person who knows anything about Kryptonian physiology and the Matrix Lena needs Kara to assist her, leaving Alex to deal with Reign's idea of fun and flirting.</span></div></div>",

There's a loud smack as Kara is freed from Lena's kiss who grins widely before looking up to Reign 'Thank you' she says quietly then turns her attention to Kara 'I have a list of things I always wanted to do to a tiny woman, I'm really glad she's you Kara' Lena coos before pulling open her shirt, exposing her ivory coloured breasts to Kara and Reign, then dropping the blond between them.

Lena asks, Kara blinks, Lena's nipple was bigger than anything they'd tried to play with, and was wider than any of Lena's quite large selection of sextoys, so unsure what else she could do, licked and nibbled on the tip, while she rubbed her breasts against the growing nub.

The ravenette's climax coats Kara in Lena's cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wow, that was, really intense' Kara sighs contently, smirking up as she rubs the human's cum all over her perky tits, to which Lena groans<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Tell me about it.

She thought she was different, that she wasn't a stuck up asshole like her cousin, but no the second there's even a rumour Lena had green kryptonite Supergirl acts like she was already as bad as Lex and Lillian, demanding the kryptonite, the DEO not far behind but content to let their pet do the dirty work for them. Never mind that so far only her and Clark/Kal/ who care she knows, were the only semi-good kryptonians, that National City had been nearly destroyed by kryptonians 2 years ago, Hell Reign is more or less half Kryptonian, this shit would at least hurt her even if it were less than Supergirl. Kara had finally fallen from grace and believed the rumours her little cousin started, that they were god like beings with the moral superiority to lord over the primitive humans, she wanted there to be nothing that could show her up to being anything less than perfect... and it pissed the, if we're being honest, morally grey Luthor off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was why she was sitting in her <b>'Evil Lair' </b>(actually a private lab built along side her office that not even Kara had been allowed access, but Jess and Sam had jokingly referred to her lead lined haven as her evil lair so many times even she started calling it that in her head, good thing never in front of the telepaths) tinkering with something to poke a hole in Supergirl's over inflated ego. It was an inhibitor, designed to shut down her active abilities and stop them being jump started, and was a little on the small side if not for the other part of her plan, eyes flickering over to a small sample of purple kryptonite: she knew what it was, having seen her brother use it on Clark, it reduced the so called God to the size of an action figure, only the fact the shrinking made him more durable (not something he had expected) stopped the missile from killing him, enabling him to escape, heal and find a way to restore himself, as unlike say Red K which usually has a time limit of 48 hrs (according to the comics, Red K is also Russian roulette of what it does in that canon, not just 'make them an asshole/evil'), Purple was basically permanent. It also meant she didn't need to worry about having to use it on her at regular intervals or over exposure like with Green, and with the dampener she shouldn't be able to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a couple of days later Lena arranged a meet with Sueprgirl through Kara, not wanting to think about the woman who she thought was her best friend and maybe more stabbing her in the back like she had (Sam was bad enough) so waited with a ring box in her pocket as the hero landed on her balcony<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You wanted to see my Miss Luthor?' Supergirl asks and Lena bites her tongue at the hurt and anger of her greeting, she hadn't called her anything but Lena since the 1st month they knew one another, but here she is, doing exactly what she promised she never would and judging her as 'A Luthor' rather than 'Lena'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, I wish to reconcile' she practiced this speech so she could do it convincingly without throwing up or punching Kara in the face and wrecking all her knuckles 'I see where you're coming from, as well as the fact I got worried and defensive after the Reign attack and thought I could simply arm myself so I wouldn't be that vulnerable again. It was then I realised that was how Alexander started, collecting tech and materials to defend himself, before he got it into his head that with all this stuff her could launch the first strike. I don't want to go down that road, I've seen there's nothing there but pain for me and joy for the jackels that torment me day in and day out' she sighs 'They can have the kryptonite' she sighs deeply, praying the end would come soon<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara jumps for joy 'I knew you'd see sense, that's great Lena. I'll tell Alex she can send a team later in the week when I get back to the DEO' her chipper attitude at disarming her much more fragile friend tightened the ravenette's resolve<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey Supergirl' the hero turns in confusion ' Seeing as we're not fighting, can I get a hug? Please?' she spreads her arms looking every much the kicked puppy she knows Kara can't resist so is unsurprised when she'd engulfed in blond space puppy. With Supergirl sufficiently distracted she pulls out the box 'Hey Supergirl?' she calls<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I prefer Kara Danvers to Kara Zor-El' she whispers, smirking when she see's Kara's frozen shocked expression before opening the box, the purple light framing the alien quite beautifully, before her eyes glaze over, flicker and she drops forward in a dead faint. 2 or more weeks ago Kara face planting into her chest would have the green eyed CEO jumping for joy, but she knew her job wasn't over, she had a few more things to do<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>A few hours later</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara groans as she comes to, a throbbing in her mind and an unpleasant feeling on her skin, her hand moving up to rub her neck and finding what could only be described as a collar around it, with semi metallic cords or straps coming from it and into her suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh good, you've found it already, well part of it' a loud voice purrs somewhere above her, opening her eyes Kara looks into the eyes of a highly amused Lena Luthor, hair free of it's usual constrictions, but there was something wrong... she was massive. She looked to be some kind of giantess now, until Kara took a look around, they were still in Lena's office, and it hit her like a ton of bricks would hit a human: Lena hadn't grown, she'd shrunk, to about 5-6 inches if she wasn't mistaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What did you do to me?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's simple really I locked you out of your powers, and what's better is thanks to the level of complexity I built into the design there is absolutely no way that you can remove it unless I am the one to do so' Lena chuckles<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But why? And wait, this thing is under my suit... you didn't'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena grins wickedly 'Strip you? Oh I did, but don't worry all I did was fondle those now grape sized tits and flick that tight ass, no need to worry about my pinkie stealing your virginity, well not yet' she teases, mostly to get the deep red blush on Kara's face 'As for why I shrunk you, I was sick and tired of your attitude, thinking you're better than everyone just because you fell from the sky. And here I thought you were better than Kal, self righteous jackass' Lena scoffs and Kara's cheeks burn with shame, she'd always said Kal was cocky and disrespectful of what made the House of El great, had she really gone down that same path, had she dishonoured the House of El and Ze with her attitude?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh and before you ask Kara, you'll remain toy sized...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[For the record, option 3 is inspired by this fic <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/12293850\" target=\"_blank\">https://archiveofourown.org/works/122938...</a> one of only 2 of these kinds of stories I could find outside of writing.com, most of which I've contributed to.]</span></div></div>",

All thanks to what was now an ingrained reflex: whenever she was going to see Kara she unbuttoned her shirt, just a little but enough to give the blond a good eyeful of her pale cleavage, which reminded her Kara dived nose first into it when she fainted, the warm Kryptonian breath sending her system into overdrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling seductively she slowly lowers Kara online with the deep chasm that is her cleavage 'You seem to only be seeing the negatives of this Kara, of a wrathful God angered by disobedient pests, you forget that by following their orders... they can gain the goddess' favour' she purrs and Kara is mesmerised by the snow white mountains that were Lena's large bust, bouncing with every breath 'If you play nice little one, they would love to meet you, after that first kiss they just can't get enough' she teases, mostly so Kara to blush when she realised the dream she had of motor boating Lena's breasts were partly true and not hallucinations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Um, I' Kara is unsure how to respond and Lena's know that so shushes her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm not done, that's if you just behave and play nice, if you show just how devoted to me you are... well I think you'll like my cave of wonders a lot more than the Fortress of Solitude, especially as it's clearly warmer' Lena jokes and Kara finds her way under Lena's skirt, being pressed none too gently into Lena's dampening panties: she may have tried to hide it but there was a part of her that was getting off on her dominance over Kara, the small part of her that was a REAL Luthor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Kara it was a different story, having physical proof of how much her friend was enjoying tormenting her, down to feeling her engorged clit rub her cheek through the silky fabric and let's not forget the scents, oh the smell was making her beyond woozy, she was glad when she was pulled out, but the scent still lingered and made her head blurry, almost like green kryptonite<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena grins internally, seeing the effect of her own pheromones on the great Supergirl. The idea came when she'd overheard an alien complaining about why humans produce so many pheromones if their sense of smell was so weak they couldn't even smell them. After that she decided to add it to another side project she didn't need. She correctly theorised that Kara's enhanced senses (one of the few abilities not suppressed, along side her invulnerability and to a certain extent her ability to 'leap tall buildings') coupled with her own arousal (which should kick production into high gear) and the blond's tiny size would overwhelm her and help make her subservient to her goddess, as well as kick her libido into overdrive, which was going to be fun for them both<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So darling, want to prove your love for me? Hmm?' (Or the real question how strongly did the pheromones affect Kara)</span></div></div>",

It was not that reason though, it was so she could make Kara view her as the goddess she now was to the Kryptonian, through a mix of seduction, brute force, humiliation/embarrassment and hopefully some sexy stuff too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Kara already in hand it was easy to slide her into her blouse and more importantly in her bra under her right breast, just because Kara was going to be her toy forever didn't mean she was going to let her know how to enter her safe haven. Luckily with the Purple K and inhibitor suit Kara was at around human strength, so she had no chance moving the hill sized tit, meaning Lena was free to deactivate her security system and enter her lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the door sealed itself Lena slowly pulls out the still dazed and confused Kara and dropped her onto the bed, amused to see her fall so gracelessly without her powers. Her giggle though had the effect of drawing Kara's attention, shortly followed by the rest of the room<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Where am I?' she squeaks to which Lena grins<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Welcome dear pet to my inner sanctum, my home away from home. Though in saying that given how much of a workaholic I am I've probably spent more time here than in my actual home' Lena muses as she waves her hands dramatically to show off her lab, Kara noticing the level of sophistication in some of the items, as well as blueprints for the semi metallic mesh that made up her inhibitor 'Now I believe it's time to meet your maker' she smirks before grabbing Kara and striping her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken hero struggles but Lena's long fingers were stronger, easily removing her top and moving to her legs, though not before giving her perky, braless breasts a teasing pinch/squeeze (hard to tell given the size difference). Lena was a lot gentler for some reason with her lower half, removing her boots and then tights and undergarments by sliding one of her nails between the alien's still unbreakable skin and her clothes, then bringing them slowly down her legs. Once Kara was nude and blushing up a storm did Lena put her back down... and unbutton her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile being forcefully stripped was an experience she didn't want to feel again, watching Lena strip was something she believed would be featuring in her more pleasant dreams of the future, provided she gets to sleep tonight, The CEO's perfect tits were held just barely by a dark blue bra, which as she let her pants fall Kara noted was matched by the panties  which were getting darker by the minute. Finally after a moment of staring between them Lena smirks before unclipping her bra and stepping out of her panties, crawling onto the bed in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Like what you see pet?' Lena purrs, liking the almost black eyed look on her former friend, future pet/worshiper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara was at a loss for words, Lena was breath-taking for the young hero on a normal day, but now, Lena was more a landscape painted by the greatest artists now, something which even Kara can't quite comprehend<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Whamp</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently she wasn't here to gaze dopily, with the impact being caused by one pale tit slamming into her and knocking her from one side of the bed to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Too long, when I ask a question I expect an answer, so do you like the body of your goddess?' Lena asks again, this time with anger in her tone, causing Kara to pale slightly and nod 'Good, now I know you want to play with my tits and pussy, but a) that's for good girls which you aren't and b) you need to start at the bottom 'adjusting her position, so she was sitting cross-legged 'you start by showing my feet the love they deserve, then we can see depending on your skills, where you get to go next'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what happens?</span></div></div>",

Lena groans and her hands reach for her own breasts and pussy, Kara was warm and tight just as she'd imagined, and even if it was clenching around her toe rather than her fingers, hand, or tongue it was still brilliantly exotic, Kara's sounds were unintelligible, or at least it was until Lena feels something she hand' expected: a barrier<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena blinks and peers down from the bed to the blond on the floor 'It's intact, I didn't think you were still a...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm not' Kara wheezes, her body fighting an inner war of the pain of penetration by Lena's toe, versus the pleasure from the nearly unthinkable fullness from Lena stuffing the blond's innards 'One time, the only other time, he was a guy I knew and loved or at least I thought I did. We eventually did the deed, but he wasn't strong enough, under a yellow sun my hymen is quite a tough thing to breeeay!' Kara screams as Lena pushes through, nearly bottoming out as Kara's cervix kisses her toe in a way her face mouth had already rejected. Smiling almost drunkenly Lena partly removes her foot from Kara's body, just the tip remaining to keep her body open and receptive, same as how her fingers were already slid past her own pussy lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'There we go, just perfect' Lena moans as she pumps both her fingers and toe, her insides quiver as Kara's mixed screams of pleasure and pain reach her ears, not to mention how her pussy was so tight but also able to easily accommodate her own toe, and while her own were long and bony, they were still big enough if Kara were human she'd have gotten stuck, but it slid in and out like it was made for the hole. Mixing all that with Lena's own stamina and it wasn't too much of a surprise that by the time Lena had finally come, Kara had peaked 3 times, the CEO proud to remove her toe and release a deluge of alien cum from Supergirl's battered cunt. She would have lifted her left away from Kara with the same nonchalance as her right, but with all the squirming and shaking Supergirl did, it was no wonder she managed to get her hair caught between Lena's long toes, meaning she had to physically untangle herself from the whimpering girl., who curled up on herself the moment she was finally free, whimpering as holding her knees, the saddest and most broken Lena had ever seen the supposedly unbreakable Kara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was probably why Lena picks her up, the blond not making any real sound that could be considered words, instead more whimpers as her brain tries to co exist with 2 conflicting thoughts: On the one hand she'd been violated, quite forcefully, On the other her and Lena just had sex, Lena had been inside her, she had taken her purity and ruined her for anyone else to ever try out do what happened tonight. Even her Kryptonian brain was playing catch up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Lena places Kara in a box so she can't escape, having more things for her to do/have done to her by the woman who was once her best friend, still crush and potentially future mistress<br>\r\n2) She feels bad for the traumatic experience she walked Kara through, so as a little reward/apology, Lena allows Kara her to sleep in her cleavage, before turning in herself.</span></div></div>",

She remembers that a bright blue bean had hit her but does not remember what happened after besides blacking out. Luckily for her this was only in her office but Lena thinks that she could be dead. She sits up and rubs her eyes. Something doesn't look right. She looks around and let's out a scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?!\" Lena screams. \"What the fuck?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena is standing in her office only 6 inches tall. It must have been from the gun that had hit her. Lena is surprised that they didn't end up taking her with them. Lena stands up and runs into the middle of the room, she can't believe how huge the office is compared to her. Lena takes a deep breath as she doesn't want to stress herself out. A loud click comes from the side of the room, Lena's stomach drops. She slowly turns around and sees Kara towering over her. Kara doesn't notice Lena standing in the middle of the room as she is too districted by her phone. Kara walks closer and closer towards Lena without realising. Lena's heart sinks and the giant gets closer, she looks up and sees Kara's pink panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kara!\" Lena screams. \"Kara!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara looks around, she thought she heard someone shout her name. She hears it again. She looks down and sees something standing between her feet. She bends down a and wraps her giant fingers around the woman's waist. She stand back up and brings it to her face with a smile. It doesn't take Kara long to realise that it is Lena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lena? Oh my god.\" Kara squeals. \"Look at you, you're so small.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kara,\" Lena begs. \"You need to help me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at you! You're so cute Lena.\" Kara giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara sees that Lena is shaking. Kara's smile turns into a frown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Lena,\" Kara apologizes. \"I didn't mean to scare you or upset up, its just that you look so cute.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara walks over to the couch and sits down. She brings Lena up to her face with a smile and starts to stroke her long black hair. Lena starts to shake as Kara's finger travels though her hair and down her back. Lena looks up at Kara who is smiling down at her. Lena smiles back nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happened?\" Kara asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really remember,\"  Lena says. \"I'll I remember is......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena is about to explain what she remembers but Kara is rubbing her back sensually Lena gets caught up in it. Lena closes her eyes and let's out a moan. Kara giggles, she smiles as she has an idea. She grabs Lena's shirt and rips it straight of her body like its nothing. Kara's eyes focus on Lena's tiny breasts and rips her bra straight off. Lena blushes as Kara's  giant eyes lock onto the tiny pair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have such a cute pair,\" Kara smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena blushes. Kara places her giant finger on Lena's breasts and gives them a gentle rub. Lena let's out a moan. Kara's soft warm finger feels amazing. Kara runs her finger over Lena's erect nipples and Lena throws her head back and moans. She was in heaven. Lena feels a bit disappointed when she feels Kara's finger leave. Lena opens her eyes to see what was going on, she sees Kara's mouth opening as it gets closer. Lena squeals in anticipation. Kara wraps her lips around Lena's breasts and slides them into her mouth. Lena let's out a loud moan as she can feel Kara gently sucking on them. Lena closes her eyes and enjoys the moment. Kara runs the tip of her tongue over Lena's erect nipples causing the tiny woman to squeal. This is the greatest thing to ever happen to her. Lena's breathing picks up, Kara can't help but enjoy her friends squeals. Kara pulls Lena away sliding her breasts out of her mouth. Kara looks down at Lena with a smile as she is out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the tastiest breasts I've ever tasted Lena.\" Kara giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena doesn't say anything as she's out of exhausted from what had happened. Lena blushes as she thinks about Kara's comments. Kara brings Lena back up to her face and presses her giant lips against the tiny woman's face. Lena let's out a moan. Kara's giant lips feels amazing on her face. Lena looks up and sees Kara's eyes dart down to Lena's crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it,\" Lena smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara smiles and gives Lena's pants a tug. She manages to take Lena's pants and panties off in a matter of seconds. Lena let's out a moan, Kara's warm fingers wrapped around her body being pressed against her bare skin feels amazing. Lena let's out a squeal as Kara's finger makes contact with her snatch. Lena squeals as she feels it sink in. Kara giggles and pushes her finger in deeper. Kara starts to thrust her finger in and out of her tiny pussy finger fucking her. Lena throws her head back and screams. While she is being stretched out by Kara since her finger is bigger than her she doesn't care, she is having the time of her life. Kara is loving ever second too, seeing her tiny friend enjoying what she's doing had her happy. Lena let's out a scream and climaxes all over Kara's giant finger. Kara doesn't stop though, she continues to finger fuck Lena. Lena let's out another scream and cum all over Kara's finger coating the giant finger in more cum. Kara listens this time and slides her finger out. Lena moans as the finger exits. Kara sticks her finger in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you're tasty Lena,\" Kara moans as she licks her lips. \"I'm still a bit hungry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara smiles down at her sweat covered friend with hungry eyes. She brings Lena up to her face and spreads her legs apart. While Lena is exhausted she still wants more. Kara places her lips on Lena's pelvis and sticks her tongue out, she brushes it over Lena's lips trying to clean up Lena's cum. Lena moans and shivers, this was incredible. Kara presses her giant warm tongue against the tiny pussy and start to lap it. Lena let's out a squeal. Kara can't help but laugh. Kara and Lena start to moan together as they are enjoying every moment. Lena screams and climaxes in Kara's mouth. Kara let's out a moan and swallows Lena's juices. She runs her tongue over Lena's pussy again hoping to clean up any access cum but this causes Lena to cum again. Kara giggles and removes her tongue and lips. Lena let's out a sigh of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was yummy,\" Kara moans. \"Perhaps I should keep you for whenever I'm hungry. You produce some yummy cum.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena is weak from her experience. She's naked and coved in sweat, head to toe from having her pussy prodded over and over. Lena looks up at Kara and smiles. Kara smiles back, She can tell Lena has hand enough for now. Kara stands up and sides Lena between her breasts. Despite being six inches tall Kara's bra and breasts manages to keep Lena in quite comfortably. Despite not having much wriggle room or any room to move Lena didn't really care, Kara's warm breasts squeezing against her felt incredible against her naked body. Lena rests her head against Kara's breasts and falls asleep. Kara looks down at her new doll with a smile, she can't help but give her breasts a squeeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara leaves Lena's office and heads.....</span></div></div>",

Just give up Supergirl, you're finished' Reign gloats, looking contradictingly composed and smug as she floats down to the crater she'd just formed with the blond's body, and she was just crawling out of<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Never, I will stop your plans, I will end you' Kara swears, throwing herself at Reign who smirks and catches her arms, proceeding to head-butt her repeatedly, until she was sure that once she let go Kara would fall. Once the hero's back hit the dirt Reign smirked and straddled Kara's hips, pinning her to the round, one hand holding her arms to stop her trying to escape<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now, now Supergirl, no need to squirm just yet' she taunts, reaching into her suit with her free hand to produce a vial of red liquid 'I didn't get a chance to use this on you last time, what with all the people around, but you dealt with that much more easily than I would have, so at least the humans live another day. Now open wide'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara glares before spitting in Reign's face, the Worldkiller twitches, places the vial on the ground by her hip and proceeds to grab Kara's head and slam it into the ground, until the Kryptonian was seeing stars, her head lolling around as her eyes and brain try to regain focus. During this time she feels Reign turn her head to face her as well as part her lips, allowing her to pour the entire contents of the vial down her throat. She could blame the dizziness on the multiple concussions (is that even possible) Reign gave her, but even her idled mind could feel Reign getting heavier, see her get larger... no Reign was staying the same, Kara was getting smaller<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'There we go, not a problem any more' Reign whispers when the process ended, picking up the 4 inch Kara just before standing to her full height 'Weak, powerless, quite literally so in fact, it's not even really worth killing right now. At least you'll be able to witness your world desolated by my hands, only then will I kill you slowly, until then, well, you're about to be what a lot of humans consider a lucky bastard' she smirks at Kara's confused expression before it morphs into fear 'Exactly, now don't squirm too much, or you might wake up a hungry quim' she teases before pulling open the front of her suit, exposing her large breasts in a tight bra, shoving her in upside down so that most of her upper body was pinned under her right breast, and her legs were splayed by the brunette's nipple between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReign bites her lip as she readjusts her suit, she wasn't entirely honest with her new captive, yes she would love to kill her slowly, probably by crushing her limbs and eating the rest, but she didn't have the time, she could feel Sam's subconscious fighting to return to the surface, she needs to make sure nothing is out of place besides some lost time, that way she can chalk it up to exhaustion and leave it alone rather than try investigate. Which was why once Supergirl was restrained she shot up into the air, heading straight for L Corp<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>20 minutes later</i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam woke with a start 'Ow did I pass out again?' she groans, rubbing her neck and wincing at the crick that had formed before checking the time on her laptop<i> 'Fuck 3 hours? Why didn't anyone wake me? Lena? Jess even?'</i> she rubbed her eyes and groans into her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara blinks cobwebs from her brain as she hears the sound of the giantess she was trapped on, only it wasn't Reign, it was her friend Sam, this is brilliant, the two got along rather well (not as well as either did with Lena but they still thought of each other as good friends) so there was no way she'd ignore Kara's pleas for help, she just needed to get Sam to notice her and free her from her nice smelling, fleshy prison. So going against Reign's order Kara began to wriggle and squirm, hoping Sam would notice quickly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Kara's wriggling gets Sam's attention, but also excites her. What could Sam possibly do with a helpless Kryptonian, that was just rubbing herself against her breast?<br>\r\n2) Sam remembers Lena invited her over for drinks tonight, a day away from work and Ruby (she made a mental note to text Alex a thanks for minding Ruby), so in her rush she doesn't feel anything, attributing Kara's attempts at getting her attention as her own movements. What follows is some heavy drinking by both Sam and Lena... is Kara really sure this is the best time or situation to make herself known?</span></div></div>",

As soon as Sam realized that the girl was...alive, she had a little scream and let her fall on the ground between her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Kara, the fall was ok as her passive powers remained, which meant that she was still invincible...probably.

I passed out before waking up in what I now know to be Sam's bra. I was worried Reign had decided to move me somewhere for her to break or play with, until I heard Sam's voice and I realised this was my chance to get help, so I did what I could to get her attention' Kara explains, leaving out the being shoved in Reign's bra part of the story, as it would make things very difficult to explain away without revealing that Sam and Reign were the same person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hm, guess Reign wants to make sure you don't get in the way of her plans, whatever they are' Lena muses with a slight smirk 'So, did you like it?' she asks Kara splutters and blushes a hot pink<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Leena!' Kara shrieks causing both giantess to laugh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh Kara, I'm just teasing' she chuckles 'Want to tease me love, I think these are starting to sag already' Lena smirks as she opens the first couple buttons of her shirt, exposing her ivory coloured cleavage and stepping into Sam's personal space. Kara yelps and tries to skirt back, inadvertently pressing herself up against Sam's breasts. Lena and Sam' eyes meet, Lena seeing a flicker of red in her left eye before the brunette steps forward, pinning Kara between their busts 'There we are darling, I was hoping you'd join in' she purrs, internally curious whether this was Reigns plan, to have her enemy toyed with by her other half and Lena 'So how did she feel?' the ravenette asks, curious to the idea of having a tiny woman in such a sensitive place (well for her at least)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam blushes lightly 'Reealy good, though it's inconsiderate of Reign to only give me one, my left boob is being ignored because she couldn't catch another sexy gal, like maybe Agent Danvers?' the brunette giggles and Lena smirks as the 2 seperate<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I hear she's single you know?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe we can get lucky and Alex finds herself in you panties later in the week' Sam smirks but there's no red so Lena just accepts it as the joke it is<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey, I tried to get your attention in the hope you could help me' Kara yells up at the 2 women, finally returning their attention to the matter at hand, or more in Sam's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should they do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Lena agrees to help fix Kara's size, her and Sam bringing her to Lena's private lab and running tests on her, partly scientific, partly so Lena can run her hands all over Kara's perfectly sculpted, miniature form<br>\r\n2) Sam clearly wants to play and Lena see's Reign is actively pushing for it, so who is she to argue with probably the one thing both sides of her oldest friend agree on, plus she gets to play with a tiny Kara so why should she pretend she doesn't greatly benefit from leaving her this size for at least a few days.... months... forever?</span></div></div>",

Thats the last she remembers, she doesn\u2019t remember if the device blew up or what, it started to glitch and that\u2019s the last she remembers. Lena sits up and runs her hands over her body checking that she\u2019s still in one piece. Lena lets out a sigh of relief as she realises she is in one piece. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere am I?\u201d Lena groans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena sits up and looks around, everything looks unfamiliar. Her heart sinks as Lena fears the worst. Someone must have drugged her or done something horrible to her and now she\u2019s in a prison. Lena notices something familiar yet alien about a pole in front of her. Her eyes trail up it to see where it leads. Lena stands up to get a better look at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Lena gasps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s a chair that is towering over her. A normal chair that is giant, how is that happening. Lena\u2019s eyes dart to the side and she sees a table and more chairs. Lena takes a step back and almost stumbles over. She looks around and sees that she is in a giant apartment. Lena does her best no to freak out. Judging on her sized compared to everything around her she must be at lest five inches tall. Lena places her hands on her head and takes another deep breath, how did this happen? The device she was working on had nothing to do with teleportation or shrinking, did she ended up programming it make it so did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a second.\u201d Lena says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena scans the entire place again this time more calm, this place looks familiar. The gears start turning in her head and it hit her. She knows why this place is so familiar. This is Kara\u2019s apartment. The placement of everything had given it away and Kara\u2019s jacket is laying on the floor at the foot of the couch. Lena\u2019s heart sinks, what if Kara is behind her shrinking? That thought instantly leaves Lena\u2019s head, she knows that Kara wouldn\u2019t do anything like this to hear, and if she did why would she leave her in the middle of the floor? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena hears keys rustling from the front door, the door clicks and swings open.

Lena stops herself and sees that Kara isn\u2019t alone, she\u2019s with a blonde and very busty woman. Lena dives behind a table leg as she doesn\u2019t want to be caught just yet, especially from someone she has never met before or knew anything about. Lean is curious about the blonde woman as she\u2019s starting to wonder if Kara has ever mentioned her before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for helping out today Kara.\u201d The blonde sighs. \u201cIf someone was to kick that alien\u2019s ass it had to be you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Sara,\u201d Kara smiles. \u201cBut it was a team effort, we kicked it\u2019s as together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena pokes her head out from behind the table leg and watches the two walk into the kitchen talking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want to stay for a drink?\u201d Kara asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not,\u201d Sara smiles. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m needed back on the wave wider for a bit.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena sighs, there goes her opportunity to reveal herself to Kara. Now she\u2019s going to have to wait. Lena sits down against the leg and rests against it listening to the two giantess talk. Quite a bit of time passes and Lena starts to get impatient, she wants to reveal herself it\u2019s that she doesn\u2019t know how Sara will react to her, she knows that Kara will be kind and caring but unsure on Sara. The two of them move to the couch and giggle, Lena is surprised that the two of them are talking like good friends, she\u2019s finding this odd as she has never once heard of this woman before and Lena thought she knew quite a bit about her best friend. Lena makes her way towards the two of them as she feels that something isn't entirely right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo hows the love life been?\u201d Sara asks as she sips her drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Kara giggles and blushes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can share with me,\u201d Sara smiles. \u201cWhat\u2019s said tonight says between these walls.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s been the same really,\u201d Kara smiles. \u201cI haven\u2019t had one, the last guy I was with was Mon-el. It\u2019s hard to get out there as saving the world take us a surprisingly amount of time.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo no guy has asked you out?\u201d Sara asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Kara blushes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI find that hard to believe,\u201d Sara smiles. \u201cThe beautiful Kara Danvers hasn\u2019t been hit on?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said asking me out,\u201d Kara giggles. \u201cYou never said anything about anyone hitting on me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see why though,\u201d Sara smirks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara blushes and stumbles her next words. Lena stands there watching with her jaw dropped, she  can\u2019t believe that she\u2019s watching this blonde hit on her friend. Lena takes a step back and thinks about this, is she really getting jealous? Kara is her friend, why is she jealous if someone is hitting on her, she should bee happy for her. Lena bites her tongue as she sees Sara shuffle closer to Kara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo when was the last time you had some fun?\u201d Sara asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d Kara blushes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ever been with a girl?\u201d Sara asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat quite a direct question.\u201d Kara says with an awkward giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d Sara smiles. \u201cBut it is a question none the less.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTure,\u201d Kara smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo have you?\u201d Sara asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201d Kara blushes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like to?\u201d Sara smiles shuffling closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara bites her bottom lip and blushes not knowing what to say. Sara places her hand on the side of Kara's face and turns her head towards her. Sara starts into Kara\u2019s eyes with a smile, Kara smiles back and blushes slightly. Sara closes her eyes and leans in, locking lips with her. Kara closes her eyes too and kisses back. Sara gently kisses Kara to get her comfortable with all of this. Kara kisses back more passionately causing Sara to let out a little moan. She surprised how good a kisser the innocent Supergirl is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena stands on the floor watching the two with her jaw dropped. She can\u2019t believe what she is seeing. Kara looks like she is really getting into the kiss. Lena bites her bottom lip and closes her eyes trying to ignore it. She hears a loud moan so she opens her eyes. Kara is now laying on the couch with Sara draped over her, one hand on her breast and the other on the side of Kara\u2019s face with Kara moaning and kissing back. Lena bites her tongue as this is starting to get on her nerves. She walks over towards them to try to get them to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Lena screams. \u201cYou girls better\u2026.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lena can react Sara\u2019s giant fingers envelop her tiny body. Lena squeals and she is raised in the air. Kara and Sara don\u2019t see her though as they are too busy with each other. Lena huffs as she wonders if Sara had even realised she is real. Kara moans and snatches Lena from Sara. Lena lets out a squeak as Kara\u2019s grip is tight. Lena is glad she\u2019s in Kara\u2019s hands but is still annoyed that Kara\u2019s tongue is inside Sara\u2019s mouth, she hasn\u2019t even broken the kiss to see if she\u2019s okay. Lena lets out a sigh of relief as she is being brought closer to the two. Lena smiles as she is finally getting the attention from Kara she needs. Lena\u2019s luck turns as she is not being brought to Kara\u2019s face, she\u2019s being brought towards Sara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKara!\u201d Lena screams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara doesn\u2019t hear Lena as she is too busy making out with the busty blonde. Lena starts panicking as she sees that the top of the blonde\u2019s shirt is undone going her a good view of her breasts. Lena\u2019s stomach drops as she knows where she is heading. Kara presses her between Sara\u2019s breasts and slides Lena inside. Lena screams trying to get their attention but Sara\u2019s breasts absorb the cries. Lena gets pushed in deeper and deeper until she can no longer see Kara. All she can see now is Sara\u2019s flesh. Lean closes her eyes and cries a little. This is the last place she wants to be. The tight warm breasts are squeezing the air out of her and she doesn\u2019t know how much more she can take especially since the breasts get slammed together quite a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara and Sara moan as they rub their bodies against each other. Kara moans as Sara\u2019s tongue dominates her mouth. Kara runs her hands down Sara\u2019s back and cups her hands over Sara\u2019s cheeks. Kara gives them a firm squeeze causing Sara to yelp. Kara\u2019s grip is extremely tight but Sara doesn\u2019t mind as it feels incredible. She loves a bit of roughness. Kara start to fondle Sara\u2019s cheeks and Sara makes her way down Kara\u2019s neck, nibbling at her ear and undoing her top buttons of her blouse. Kara heart races as Sara\u2019s lips get closer to her breasts. Kara gasps as Sara kisses her chest, Sara moans and kisses down to Kara\u2019s breasts. Sara\u2019s lips collide with the top of Kara\u2019s breasts witch causes her to let out a loud moan. Kara\u2019s hands clamp down on Sara\u2019s ass causing her to scream. Sara sits up followed by Kara with a share state of panic on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god!\u201d Kara squeals. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry Sara.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alight,\u201d Sara smirks as she brushes her hair off her face. \u201cThat was actually quite hot.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou like that?\u201d Kara blushes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGetting my ass squeezed by Supergirl, defiantly.\u201d Sara smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara leans in and gently kisses Kara, Kara moans and kisses back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about we take this to the bedroom?\u201d Sara whispers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara gives Sara a goofy grin and nods repeatedly. Sara giggles and climbs off the couch taking Kara\u2019s hand in hers. Kara jumps off the couch and drags Sara to her bedroom with a huge smile on her face. Despite being buried in Sara\u2019s giant breasts Lena heard everything that was being said. Lena closes her eyes and dreads to find out what the two have planned for each other but more importantly, herself. </span></div></div>",

Kara gives her another squeeze and fondles the breasts, they are large and soft and just a joy for Kara to play with.

They look amazing, Lena desperately wants to reach out and touch them but she\u2019s trapped. She huffs and her predicament but tries to enjoy the view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara and Sara strip each other down until they are naked.

Kara lifts Sara in the air with effort, the two of them giggle and Sara wraps her legs around Kara\u2019s waist. Sara can\u2019t believe that Kara is holding her in the air like it\u2019s nothing. Sara\u2019s arms lock around Kara\u2019s neck to hold her in place. Kara\u2019s tongue slides into Sara\u2019s mouth with a moan. Sara moans too and does her best to wrestle Kara\u2019s tongue with hers. Sara is struggling as Kara\u2019s tongue is very strong.

Kara loves the way she is doing this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena\u2019s tight prison starts to let her go a bit as Sara is draping herself over Kara. Sara\u2019s breasts are hanging and Lena is only just able to keep herself in place. Lena starts to panic as she feels herself slide down a bit. Lena tries to scramble to get herself to somewhere safe but she has no where to go. Sara positions herself a bit and the grip around Lena disappears. Lena starts to slide down Sara\u2019s breasts. Lena lets out a squeal and slides out form Sara\u2019s breasts. After being exposed to a few seconds of light Lena then lands on something that is equally soft. She looks around and sees that it\u2019s Kara\u2019s breasts. Lena smirks and lets out a sigh of relief as she thought she was going to hit the ground. She looks up and sees Sara\u2019s giant breast drag over Karas chest and right towards her. Not taking any more chances with the giant breast Lena crawls away and slides between Kara\u2019s breasts escaping the giant monsters. Lena snuggles between shielding herself from the outside world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank god,\u201d Lena gasps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena lays down and is relieved.

Lena does her best not to look up as she doesn\u2019t want to see Sara and Kara locking lips. Lena closes her eyes and moans as she is loving Kara\u2019s warm breasts on her. Lena enjoys her moment with Kara\u2019s breasts until she feels something curl around her legs. She looks down as sees that is someone\u2019s fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Lena screams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant hand envelopes itself over Lena\u2019s body and removes her from her paradise. Lena lets out a scream but the fingers are covering her mouth. Lena sheds a tear and shivers as she can tell that whoever the giant hand belongs to has something in mind for her. </span></div></div>",

Lena lets out a sigh of relief but freezes as she realises that she\u2019s being lowered down and down. Hoping to see something of Kara\u2019s, Lena gets disappointed as she sees Sara\u2019s giant pussy looming over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Lena yells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena closes her eyes as she is brought closer and closer to the wet pussy. Lena clenches up as the sight is something she doesn\u2019t want to see. Lena shivers as she can feel the heat come from it right above her. Kara brings her towards it and Lena yelps, she tries to kick and squirm away but it\u2019s no good, Kara\u2019s grip is too tight for her. Lena\u2019s face is pressed against Sara\u2019s wet lips coating Lena\u2019s face instantly. Lena lets out a yelp and spits out a mouthful of cum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKara!\u201d Lena shouts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara doesn\u2019t hear anything and shoves the tiny woman into the blonde\u2019s snatch. Lena screams as she is pushed deeper and deeper in until it is just her tiny feet sticking out. Lena is freaking out as the cavern is wet and tight, it\u2019s clamping around her not giving Lena much room to move. Lena absolutely hates this, her clothes are now drenched as well as her hair and she\u2019s inside someone she doesn\u2019t know being used as sex toy. If Lena had to be inside a giant pussy she wanted to be in Kara\u2019s. Lena kicks and screams trying to get the giant woman\u2019s attention. The walls tighten around her and the cavern starts to fill with cum. Lena only just realises that her state of panic is making her situation worse as she is pleasing the blonde not getting her attention. Lena feels the body shiver and scream and a load of cum shoots down around her. Lena expects to be shot out too but to her surprise she remains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit.\u201d Lena groans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena lets out a sigh of relief as she can feel giant fingers wrap around her tiny feet. Lena yelps as she is pulled out of the giant pussy with a bit of force. The giant fingers move up her form and wrap around her body a lot more as she\u2019s removed. Lena is just glad she\u2019s out of the monster of a cavern. Lena looks up and sees the blonde laying down on the bed with Kara looming over her. Lena lets out a huff as she sees that the hand she\u2019s in belongs to the blonde. She brings Lena up so that she is laying on the blondes stomach with her fingers still wrapped around her form. Lena\u2019s eyes widen as she sees Kara\u2019s naked body come down and drape over the blonde. Lena whimpers as she comes so close to touching Kara\u2019s smooth stomach. Lena sees Kara\u2019s lips lock with the blonde giantess. Lena feels a little jealous by this. Lena starts to get concerned when she hears them whisper then giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara removes herself from the woman and stands on the side of the bed with a huge smile. Lena smiles as her eyes travel up and down Karas naked body. She is beautiful. Kara giggles and spins around and Lena\u2019s eyes lock onto Kara\u2019s plump ass. Lena bites her bottom lip and checks her out. Lena feels the giant hand around bring her towards it. Lena doesn\u2019t know how to feel about it. Lena whimpers as she is brought closer and closer. Lena looks up and sees that Kara is spreading her cheeks apart with a giggle. Lena\u2019s stomach drops as she can tell what is about to happen. Lena wants to scream at the two giantesses and get their attention as now she has a better chance but she can\u2019t. Something is holding her back. Lena just closes her eyes and lets all this happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena hears Kara moan as her head is pressed against her ass hole and is slowly pushed inside. Kara\u2019s moans turn into squeals. Kara\u2019s ass is a lot tighter than the blonde\u2019s pussy. So much so that the blonde\u2019s pussy feels more like cuddling into a sleeping bag. Lena is pushed all the way in and a lot deeper than she was in the blonde\u2019s pussy. Lena\u2019s entire body is inside Kara. Lena smiles as she hears Kara scream and moan due to her presence. Lena bites her bottom lip and starts to wiggle around a bit to please Kara. Kara\u2019s screams get louder and louder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Sara! Yes!\u201d She screams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena rolls her eyes as Kara screams the blondes name. Lena\u2019s not entirely upset as she is pleasing Kara. Lena finds Kara\u2019\u2019s ass surprisingly conformable and if she had the chance she would like in here. Lena closes her eyes and moans too as Kara\u2019s tight ass feels incredible. Her breasts are rubbing against her walls giving her an intense amount of pleasure. Lena moans and rubs her tits against the walls moaning. Lena feels her panties getting moist from all this, despite being already covered in cum her panties are now mixed with her own. Kara and Lena both scream and climax. Lena starts puffing but doesn\u2019t stop moaning as kara\u2019s juices coat her entire body. She is loving this. She only wishes she could give Kara a kiss and make her aware that it\u2019s her who is pleasing her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever toy this is I love it!\u201d Kara moans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm glad your loving it.\u201d Sara smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara leans down and locks lips with Sara giving her a passionate kiss. Sara moans and kisses back. Kara decides to leave the toy in her ass for now Kara places her hand on Sara\u2019s thigh and gently strokes it. Kara smirks as she gets an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLay down for me.\u201d Kara whispers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara giggles and does what she is told. Kara gives Sara\u2019s large breasts a squeeze before heading south. Sara smiles as she can tell what Kara has in mind. Kara places her hand between Sara thighs. Kara moans and presses her lips against Sara\u2019s thigh and kisses her way up. Sara moans as she gets closer and closer. Kara kisses Sara moist lips and moans. Sara throws her head back and moans and Kara\u2019s tongue slides inside. Sara notices something around Kara\u2019s tongue. Something she hasn\u2019t experienced before. Sara couldn\u2019t figure out what it is until she feels Kara\u2019s tongue vibrate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit.\u201d Sara screams and clamps her thighs against Kara head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara moans as picks up the pace and Sara screams. She\u2019s absolutely loving this. It doesn\u2019t take long for Sara to scream and cum all over Kara\u2019s face. Kara removes herself from Sara and moans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you\u2019re tasty.\u201d Kara says licking her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara climbs up Sara\u2019s body and slides her tongue inside her mouth moaning. The two wrestle tongues and exchanged Sara\u2019s cum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena remains unaware of the vibrating fun happening outside. Lena feels something crawl inside the ass with her. It bushes over the soles of her feet causing her to laugh and shake causing Kara to shiver and moan. Lena smiles and feels it grab her. She\u2019s pulled out and Kara and Lena moan as the walls around her loosen, Lena opens her eyes and sees\u2026 </span></div></div>",

Not after what happened last time. Lena tenses up and just lets this happen to her. She knows that no matter what she tries to do the two giantess will just ignore her. Lena hears Sara let out a loud moan as she is pushed inside her head first. Lena smiles and moans too. After relaxing not worrying too much this is starting to feel pretty good. Lena feels something wrap around her legs only it wasn\u2019t fingers. Lena lets out a loud moan as she can feel that it\u2019s Kara\u2019s lips. Her pussy lips to be exact. Lena smirks and wriggles around a little, Kara\u2019s body clamps around her and it\u2019s a delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara lowers herself down and the toy is half inside her and the other half in Sara. Kara throws her head back and moans as she trusts her hips. She can feel herself grind against Sara as much as she\u2019s doing with the toy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god!\u201d Sara moans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara reaches out and grabs Sara\u2019s tits with her hands while still thrusting. Sara laughs and squeezes Kara\u2019s back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck me good Supergirl!\u201d Sara moans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara moans and picks up the pace. She feels her climax build up inside her and her body starts to tremble. This doesn\u2019t stop Kara slowing down, in fact she\u2019s picking up the pace a lot more. Sara feels Kara\u2019s lips pressed against hers and notices that she\u2019s vibrating. Sara screams as this is just incredible. Kara and Sara throw their head back and scream climaxing all over each other\u2019s pussys and their new toy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara pulls herself off Sara with a loud moan. She gives Sara a weak smile and collapses on the bed next to her. Sara and Kara start laughing and both their bodies go weak. Kara rolls onto her side facing Sara, Sara remains laying on her back but turns her head to Kara. The two of them lay in silence and just enjoy the moment between them. Kara sits up and locks lips with Sara giving her a very passionate kiss. Sara moans and kisses Kara back, her kiss is very strong but great none the less. Kara breaks the kiss with a smile, Kara can\u2019t resist and gives Sara another kiss this time giving her breasts a good squeeze. Sara lets out a loud moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for that,\u201d Kara smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny time,\u201d Sara smiles. \u201cAnd I do mean any time.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara blushes and Sara pulls her in for a hug. Kara hugs back but shuffles down the bed a bit. She rests her head on Sara\u2019s breasts and snuggles into them like a pillow. Sara smiles and kisses her forehead. Kara moans and wraps her arms around Sara\u2019s waist pulling herself in tight. Sara wraps her arms around Kara too and the two drift off quite quickly as their fun took a lot out of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena remains in the warm wet cave for what seems to be an hour. The girls had stopped moving and Lena can tell that they are asleep as Sara\u2019s body was vibrating due to her snoring. Lena sighs and wiggles a bit trying to get out but stops when she feels Sara move. The last thing she wants to do is get Sara off again. Lena strategises her exit, she knows that the more she moves with Sara\u2019s tight walls around her the move she\u2019s going to get the giantess off. She has a plan. Lena wiggles down a bit as carefully as she can. She stops, Sara is moving around due to Lena\u2019s wiggles. She then stops, Lena takes a deep breath and wiggles around a bit more, she can feel the air brush against her stomach, she\u2019s almost there. Lena\u2019s feet collide with the bed and she adjusts her footing. Lena gives herself a few seconds before giving herself a good push. Lena slides out and lands on the bed quite hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d She gasps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena rolls onto her side and starts coughing and spluttering trying to get all of the cum out of her mouth and lugs. She gets out quite a fair bit making a large puddle between Sara\u2019s thighs. Lena rolls onto her back and does her best to catch her breath back. She looks up squinting trying to adjust to the light she had not seen in a while. Her body is weak, vision blurred and she can hardly keep herself awake. Lena is exhausted from everything she has been though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStumbling up from her current position Lena tries to figure out he best escape route. Looking around all she can see is Sara\u2019s giant thighs towing above her and her feet right at the end of the bed. Lena sighs as there is only one way out if she wants to get out quickly. Lena places her hands on Sara\u2019s thigh and hoists herself up, she sits down on Saras warm thigh and looks up at the two sleeping giantesses. Lena can\u2019t help but smile as she sees Kara\u2019s naked body cuddling up to Sara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I have time or one peep.\u201d Lena thinks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena stands up and walks up Sara\u2019s thigh to her bare stomach. She smiles as she gets closer and closer to her destination. Lena makes it to Sara\u2019s giant breasts and looks over Kara. Despite Sara\u2019s giant naked body below her she is more focused on the other sleeping beauty. Lena smiles as she finally gets a chance to marvel at Kara\u2019s body and it\u2019s every bit perfect as she thought it would be. Lena looks up and down Kara and looks over everything that is on display. Lena\u2019s eyes stop at Kara\u2019s breasts, she\u2019s getting flashbacks from when she was in there before and just getting turned on by it. Lena stumbles forward doing her best not to wake either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I can take off in the morning before they wake up.\u201d Lena smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena runs over to Kara\u2019s breasts and dives in between them like there\u2019s no tomorrow. Lena is surprised that Kara didn\u2019t wake up from all of that. Sara must have taken a lot out of her. Or it might have been Lena. Lena nuzzles in making herself comfortable. Kara\u2019s sent and warmth is enough to make her want to stay. Lena finally feels safe and it\u2019s the first time she has ever since she had been shrunk. Sleeping close to to Kara\u2019s heart and hearing her heart beet made Lena feel safer than ever. Not just in her new tiny state but more than she had ever been in her life. Lena drifts off to sleep soundly and safely. </span></div></div>",

Lena opens her eyes and sees something hovering over her. Lena comes to and sees two giant faces looming over her. It is Kara and Sara. Lena shoots up but struggles to get her balance, she ends up falling back onto her ass. Lena looks around and sees that she\u2019s still the size of a doll and now on Kara\u2019s kitchen bench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLena?\u201d Kara says as her jaw drops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Kara,\u201d Lena says nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you get so small?\u201d Kara asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore importantly how did you get into Kara\u2019s breasts?\u201d Sara asks with a small grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Lena says. \u201cBut I was shrunk last night and tried to get your attention but you seemed to be a bit occupied.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you were the toy that we used?\u201d Sara asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena turns bright red and nods. Lena looks up at Kara awkwardly and sees that she\u2019s bright red, she never thought Kara could go that red. Lena\u2019s eyes dart to Sara who is grinning like a loom. Lena feels even more embarrassed about all of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for doing all of that,\u201d Kara says. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you didn\u2019t.\u201d Lena says. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth it wasn\u2019t too bad.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara and Lena awkwardly smile and blush even more, Lena giggles as she sees that Kara is blushes more than ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry too.\u201d Lena sighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor what?\u201d Kara asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSleeping between your breasts was my choice.\u201d Lena blushes. \u201cI was going to escape but I ended up crawling between your breasts and sleeping.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t blame you Lena,\u201d Sara smiles. \u201cThey do look comfortable.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara cups her hands over Kara\u2019s breasts and gives them a firm squeeze, Kara lets out a yelp. Sara leans in and kisses Kara while fondling her breasts. Lena jumps up with her jaw dropped. She knew that Sara was doing this to make her jealous, she is right. Lena pouts as she sees Kara lean into the kiss. The two of them start moaning and Lena stops her foot. Sara breaks the kiss as she sees Lena\u2019s fit out of the corner of her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes someone want a kiss too?\u201d Sara teases. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lena can react to her statement Sara\u2019s giant fingers curl around her tiny form. Lena yelps as Sara brings her up to her giant face pursing her lips. Lena\u2019s tiny head is pressed against Sara\u2019s lips trying to kiss the tiny girl as best as she can. Lena blushes to herself as she finds this kind of nice. Sara\u2019s giant warm lips feel great. Sara pulls her away with a smile, Lena blushes as she can see that she saw her enjoyment. Sara giggles and slides Lena between Kara\u2019s breasts. Lena smiles up as she is enjoying this placement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look right at home,\u201d Sara teases as she gives Kara\u2019s breasts another squeeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look adorable in there Lena,\u201d Kara smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t she?\u201d Sara smiles. \u201cI think she\u2019ll be even more adorable if we keep her as ours. She\u2019s the right size and we\u2019ve already experienced what she\u2019s like to play with.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Kara intrudes. \u201cI\u2019m not, Lena is a human being Sara. I\u2019m not going to keep her against her will because of our needs.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be against my will because I\u2019ll be okay with this.\u201d Lena says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are?\u201d Kara and Sara say in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Lena says as she blushes a bit. \u201cI mean I will if that means I\u2019m Kara\u2019s too and not just Sara\u2019s.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Kara asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I trust you.\u201d Lena says. \u201cDespite being the size of a doll I\u2019ve never felt more safe in your hands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara smiles but also sighs, she doesn\u2019t know what to do. Sara pulls Kara towards her pressing their breasts together and touches her nose with her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you say Kara,\u201d Sara smiles. \u201cDo you want to own this little woman with me?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Kara says. \u201cBut on one condition.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d Sara asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe keep and treat Lena as she is,\u201d Kara says. \u201cA human being, I want you to treat her as a person and not just a toy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal,\u201d Sara smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara smiles with glee and looks down at Lena, Lena smiles back. Sara wraps her arms around Kara\u2019s neck and pulls her in tight for a kiss. Kara moans and passionately kisses back. Lena is conflicted on what had just happened. She\u2019s beyond excited to be with Kara and to have some fun with her but she\u2019s also scared to find out what Sara has in store for her as she appears to be someone who wants more than she implying. Only time will tell. </span></div></div>",

Just the two of us.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Kara giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara takes Kara\u2019s hands in hers and leads her to the couch. Sara sits down on the couch and tries to pull Kara towards her but she won\u2019t budge. Kara reaches between her breasts and fishes Lena out placing her on the table. Lena looks up at the two giants with a frown. She\u2019s glad that Kara is respecting her but not that Sara wants to with hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome here,\u201d Sara moans placing her hands on thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena watches as Kara giggles and sits on Sara\u2019s lap. Sara wraps her arms around Kara pulling her in tight. The two giggle and lock lips giving each other a passionate kiss. Lena stands there watching all of this. Their hands run all over each other\u2019s bodies, Kara gives Sara\u2019s breasts a good firm squeeze causing Sara to let out a loud and over the top moan. Lena knows that Sara is doing this just to tease her. Sara\u2019s hands travel down Kara\u2019s back and cups her butt cheeks in her hands. Kara moans as Sara gives them a firm squeeze. Lena wants to turn away but she can\u2019t, she\u2019s finding this quite arousing but also a little awkward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Lena sighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena sees Kara\u2019s hands thread through Sara\u2019s buttons on her shirt. Without hesitating Kara undoes Sara shirt and pulls them off. Sara didn\u2019t put of a bra so her breasts pop right out. Lena\u2019s jaw drops as she can\u2019t believe what she is seeing. Kara lets out a little giggle and cups her hands over Sara\u2019s massive pair and gives them a good squeeze. Sara lets out another loud over the top moan as she does. Kara picks Sara up and turns her around, she lays Sara down on the couch and drapes her body over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood lord.\u201d Lena sighs and turns away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hears the two moaning and panting. Lena looks down and sees a four giant fingers and a thumb get close. Before she has any time to react the curl around her. Lena goes to protest until she figures out that the fingers belong to Kara. Lena doesn\u2019t know how to react to this, she knows that Kara has no intention of hurting her but Sara could be influencing her. Lena is raised in the air and places on one of Sara\u2019s large breasts. Lena turns bright red as she sees Sara smiling at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just thought that you might want to have a look Lena.\u201d Kara says. \u201cThey are pretty great aren\u2019t they.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Lena blushes. \u201cThey are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are the centre of the Venn Diagram that is our relationship,\u201d Kara smirks. \u201cIt\u2019s what\u2019s keeping us together.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks girls.\u201d Sara smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena turns redder as she feels Sara\u2019s nipple press into her ass. She looks up at Sara who gives her a wink, Lena turns to Kara who is smiling down at her. Kara places her hand on Sara\u2019s other breast and gives it a light squeeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell you what girls,\u201d Sara smirks. \u201cWho ever does the best job at getting me off gets a very special reward from me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds like fun.\u201d Kara smiles giving Sara\u2019s breast a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of reward?\u201d Lena asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Sara smirks. \u201cIf you win I\u2019ll stick my finger in you and play with your tits till you cum, and if Kara wins I\u2019ll eat her out and use you to please Kara\u2019s ass.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena turns bright red not knowing which reward sounds more embarrassing to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Kara says. \u201cI mean I will only if Lena wants to.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d Lena says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Kara asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Lena says. \u201cI mean I have to get used to this at some point don\u2019t I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit.\u201d Sara smiles. \u201cNow get to work ladies.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara closes her eyes and lets the two get to work. Lena drapes herself over Sara\u2019s enormous breast and starts to kiss the giant nipple. It is huge, Lena places her hands around the edge and squeezes as she kisses. It would be impossible to fit the whole thing in her mouth so she doesn\u2019t even attempt. Lena just licks all over and squeezes it doing her best to please Sara. Lena only agreed to do this competition because she knows that there will be a bit of favouritism with Sara and she will choose Kara no matter what. Lena would rather be back in Kara\u2019s ass than have Sara\u2019s giant digit inside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara slides Sara\u2019s giant nipple in her mouth and gives it a nibble. She places her hand around Sara\u2019s breast squeezing it as she nibbles on the tit. Kara holds herself back from doing anything extreme with the pleasure as she wants Lena to win. She wants nothing more than for Lena to be apart of this group dynamic and for her to feel comfortable with this. The best thing for her to do is make her feel like that she had accomplished something with the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou girls are fantastic,\u201d Sara moans. \u201cBut there can only be one winner.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena and Kara stop pleasuring and listen to the results. Sara smiles and decides that\u2026\u2026 </span></div></div>",

Lena yelps and panics a bit as this is the last thing she expected. She really wanted Kara to win as she doesn\u2019t want Sara\u2019s fingers inside her. Sara sits Lena on her open palm with a huge grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow let\u2019s get you out of those clothes.\u201d Sara smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lena has any time to react Sara grabs her blouse and rips it right of her body like it\u2019s nothing. Lena yelps and Sara reaches for her pants. She slides them off leaving Lena half naked on Sara\u2019s hand. Lena sits there just waiting for Kara\u2019s protests but there\u2019s nothing. Lena looks up at Sara who is licking her lips as her eyes travel up and down her half naked body. Lena blushes and does her best to cover herself up. Sara just giggles and flicks Lena\u2019s hands aside. Sara rips Lena\u2019s bra and panties off leaving Lena completely naked. Lena turns bright red and looks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDam Lena,\u201d Sara says. \u201cYou are so hot.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are beautiful Lena.\u201d Kara chimes in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena blushes even more due to their compliments and can\u2019t help but smile. Sara places her finger underneath Lena\u2019s chin and tilts her head up. Lena locks eyes with Sara and smiles nervously. Sara smiles back very eagerly. Lena gasps as Sara\u2019s giant finger starts to stroke her inner thigh. Lena does her best to hold back a moan, her finger is very soft and warm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ready for your reward?\u201d Sara whispers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Lena can muster is a whimper. Sara giggles and brings her giant finger closer to her snatch. Sara starts to gently stroke her pussy. Lena throws her head back and moans as she has to admit that this feels kind of nice. Sara wraps her fingers around Lena\u2019s stomach holding her in the air and starts to fondle her tits with the hand she is holding her in. Lena tries to figure out how she is doing this but she\u2019s too caught up in everything to figure it out. Sara\u2019s giant finger starts to slowly insert itself. Lena gasps and squeals as the finger gets deeper and deeper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good girl.\u201d Sara coos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara starts fondling Lena\u2019s tits and thrusts her finger in and out of Lena. Lena feels herself getting stretched out and weak due to this and she has to admit that she is loving it. It is an odd fuck but loving it none the less. She throws her head back screaming, Sara\u2019s giant warm fingers just add to all of this especially around her tits. Lena lets out a scream and cums all over Sara\u2019s giant digit. Lena goes limp as Sara took a lot out of her. Sara giggles at this and slides her finger out. Lena moans as Sara\u2019s finger was amazing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you taste nice Lena.\u201d Sara moans as she licks her finger clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena blushes and does her best to avoid eye contact as she feels a little embarrassed from everything that had just happened. Lena starts to take deep breaths as she feels that she is going to pass out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me have a try.\u201d Kara smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara giggles as she takes Lena into her own hands. Lena looks up at Kara with a smile as she\u2019s happy that she wants to play with her. Only problem is Lena doesn\u2019t have the energy to play but she\u2019ll make it work. Kara gives Lena a little wink and gives Lena a kiss. Lena smiles and does her best to kiss back. Kara raises Lena in the air more as she tilts her head back lowering Lena into her open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Lena panics. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara slides Lena's legs inside her mouth and lowers her further. Lena panics as she thinks that Kara is about to eat her. Her mind set goes a full one eighty as she feels Kara\u2019s tongue run up and down her thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh fuck.\u201d Lena wimpers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena can feel Kara giggle around her, her tongue runs up more and collides with her tiny pussy and starts lapping at it. Lena throws her head back and moans as this is incredible, even better than Sara. Kara\u2019s giant spongy tongue moves to her ass licking each smooth cheek. Lena sequels Kara\u2019s name begging for more. Kara complies and runs the tip of her tongue down her crack. Lena lets out a loud squeal as her tongue makes contact with her ass hole. While it was obvious that it isn\u2019t going to fit Kara tries to force her tongue in Lena\u2019s ass hole. Lena screams Kara\u2019s name as she is loving this. Kara\u2019s tongue brushes over Lena\u2019s pussy and back to her ass hole alternating between the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh fuck!\u201d Lena squeals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena lets out a loud scream and cums inside Kara\u2019s mouth, Kara doesn\u2019t stop and just keeps going not that Lena minds. Lena thrusts her hips slightly as she tries to ride Kara\u2019s tongue. Lena screams as climaxes again. Kara stops this time and slides Lena out of her mouth. She cups her hands around Lena and holds her like a baby. Kara smiles as she looks at the tiny woman laying in her hands, she\u2019s covered in sweat, saliva as well as cum head to toe. Kara giggles as Lena gives her a huge smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are just so adorable.\u201d Kara coos as she gives Lena another kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena blushes and doesn\u2019t kiss back this time as she\u2019s too tired. She does her best to keep herself awake as she feels that is about to pass out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we should give her a break.\u201d Sara says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I can keep my energy up.\u201d Lena says as she struggles to keep her eyes open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need a break,\u201d Sara says. \u201cYou\u2019re about to pass out. Look, why don\u2019t you have a sleep between Kara\u2019s breasts while the grown up figure out how this all works.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara smirks and slides Lena\u2019s tiny naked form between her breasts. Lena lets out a little moan and wiggles around to get herself comfortable. Kara giggles and gives her breasts a gentle squeeze. Lena almost instantly passes out due to Kara\u2019s warmth and heart beat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s so cute.\u201d Kara coos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd full on energy and passion.\u201d Sara says with her eyes glued on Lena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how are we going to make this work?\u201d Kara says. \u201cIt\u2019s a big responsibility raising such a little girl.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d Sara says moving closer to Kara. \u201cBut I do know that Lena has such an excellent mother to take care of her. Nice a sexy too.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d Kara smiles. \u201cWhile I do love playing with Lena we really need to figure out what we should do with her if we really want to keep her. She\u2019s more than a toy Sara. This is going to be difficult especially when we have such full on lives. Lena is vulnerable especially at her size and being cared for by superheroes doesn\u2019t help her state.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Sara sighs. \u201cWe could always get a babysitter for her.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara smirks and Kara just looks down at the the sleeping girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA babysitter for my little girl doesn\u2019t sound too bad,\u201d Kara says. \u201cBut we could always keep her on us at all times.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do the girls decide on?</span></div></div>",

Alex is the first name to be brought up but Sara and Kara don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea. Not because Alex would be an awful baby-sitter but that things could be a little awkward between Sara and Alex and Alex is just as busy as they are. They then decide on Nora West-Alan as they think that she\u2019ll be protective over Lena as well as get along along with her really well. Sara gives Nora and call and kara lets Lena sleep and keeps her new baby-sister a surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena wakes up and hour later laying on the kitchen bench with a cloth around her. Lena smiles as she thinks that Kara must have done this. She looks around the room and sees that Kara and Sara are no where to be seen. Lena starts to get a little worried. She stands up and her cloth falls to the ground, she looks around the room again to see Kara walk out of her bedroom with a smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKara!\u201d Lena cries. \u201cThat god.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning sleeping beauty.\u201d Kara smiles and kisses Lena\u2019s tiny head. \u201cSleep well?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did thanks.\u201d Lena blushes remembering where she had slept. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning Lena.\u201d Sara smiles as she walks out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning Sara.\u201d Lena says trying to be positive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ready to go?\u201d Sara asks Kara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup.\u201d Kara smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo?\u201d Lena asks. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re meeting up with some friends.\u201d Kara says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re taking me with you?\u201d Lena asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually.\u201d Kara sighs. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a baby-sitter for you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Lena says. \u201cCome on Kara I\u2019m a fully gown adult.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you are but you are also the size of a Barbie doll and I would hate for anything bad to happen to you.\u201d Kara says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKara!\u201d Lena shouts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t raise your voice to your mother young lady.\u201d Sara interrupts. \u201cWe are all adults here and should act like ones.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour right,\u201d Lena sighs. \u201cWho\u2019s looking after me? Alex?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNora,\u201d Sara says. \u201cBarry Allan\u2019s daughter.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNora?\u201d Lena jaw drops. \u201cYou don\u2019t trust me enough to stay home alone or go with you but you let a child babysit me?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLena,\u201d Kara says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena huffs and crosses her arms, Sara rolls her eyes as Lena turns her back to them. There is a knock at the door and Sara goes to answer it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry I\u2019m late.\u201d Nora says as Sara opens the door. \u201cIt was kind of difficult getting here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no problem Nora,\u201d Sara says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena covers herself up with the cloth wrapping it around her like a toga. She spins around and sees her baby-sitter walk inside. Lena can\u2019t help but smirk a little when she sees Nora. Nora\u2019s eyes light up as they lock onto Lena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s really small?\u201d Nora gasps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I did tell you.\u201d Sara says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d Nora says not taking her eyes off Lena. \u201cI just wasn\u2019t sure as I know that shrunken people don\u2019t come into existence until 2028.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Lena asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are just so adorable little one.\u201d Nora smiles, she missed Lena\u2019s question as she is too mesmerised by her. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLena.\u201d She blushes at her adorable comment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see you two are getting along well.\u201d Kara smiles. \u201cI promise we won\u2019t be gone too long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara and Sara leave the room leaving Nora and Lena alone. Nora\u2019s eyes remained locked onto Lena the whole time. Everything is silent as Nora studies her with her eyes. Lena stands there awkwardly not knowing what to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god,\u201d Nora says looking away. \u201cI\u2019m staring way too much aren\u2019t I? I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Lena says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Nora apologies again. \u201cIt\u2019s just so shway seeing a tiny person. I\u2019ve read and studied a lot about them but I\u2019ve never had the chance to see one and this is just so shway.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean study?\u201d Lena asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora goes onto explain that she is from the future and how shrunken people exist but are a rarity. Nora explains everything she knows about shrunken people. Nora is just amazed that Lena is listening, she\u2019s quite flattered. Lena is on the edge of her seat during this whole lecture and not interrupting her at all. Lena asks questions and is genuinely interested. The two talk for an hour about a whole lot of science babble. Lena is amazed how much she has in common with Nora and is actually enjoying herself. She hated the idea of a baby-sitter but she is actually enjoying it. Nora starts to ask Lena a lot of questions about herself too, Lena tells her about L-Corp and a few things she\u2019s been doing. Lena can tell that Nora is genuinely interested in everything she is saying and she is adoring it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you actually believe everything I said?\u201d Nora says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do.\u201d Lena smiles. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause hearing someone say they are from the future and know quite a lot about tiny people should sound insane.\u201d Nora says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m six inches being looked after my friend in a world where superheroes and superpowers exist.\u201d Lena says. \u201cYou story fits well into my world.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora blushes and giggles quite a bit. Nora bites her bottom lip as she stares at Lena. Lena blushes as she can read her look. She knows that Nora wants to do more with her. Lena blushes at the thought and takes half a step towards Nora. </span></div></div>",

Taking the 2 steps in difference between their positions she looks down at the now weak and helpless alien and decides to end it quickly, raising her boot before slamming it down on the so called invincible Supergirl with a smirk. It dropped rather quickly as even after twisting her heel and grinding her target into the ground there was no crunch of a small creature being crushed underfoot, Hell it felt like she was standing on something, rather than crushing someone. Finally she moves her foot and was surprised and annoyed to see Supergirl mostly fine, picking her up she see's the blond to be a little tender in places and bruised in many of those areas, but besides that she was basically unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Kara things were a little stranger: she came to the DEO for a chat with her sister, sure she doesn't remember that but he fact still remains, but when she landed there was a flash of light and she got very dizzy. Then came thuds that shook the ground, worrying Kara that there was an earthquake hitting national City, but when she looked up she saw only Alex's boot. Trying to fly in order to avoid the shoe she found herself even unable to jump and ended up meeting Alex's boot face first and then pinned to the ground by it's weight. The pain from Alex's heel twisting on her reminded her of a very unhelpful thought, that just because she was unbreakable, doesn't mean it didn't fucking hurt. Though what hurt her more was when the pressure finally ended and she saw Alex looking down at her with such malice and anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kryptonite really is the only thing that can damage you eh?\" Alex asks, but more just lets her thoughts drift \"Guess I'll need to find another way to deal with you\" she then moves to the edge of the roof and sits down, holding Kara in one hand and removing her right boot with the other. Her toes wriggle now they were free from containment, and Alex watches to see how long it takes her captive to realise what she has in store for her, but was disappointed when all Supergirl did was wince and pinch her nose, oh well might as well tell her the news \"You better get used to that smell Supergirl, it's about to become the only air you breathe\" with that Alex presses the blonde's head against her sole and moves her up until Supergirl's head peeks out from between her toes, which quickly clench around her head so she would be secure enough to let go of her and slide her foot back into her shoe, Alex bites her lip to stifle a moan as she feels Supergirl's curvy form wriggle against her foot, she was going to have a lot of time to play with this one, that was a guarantee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Given the amount of time Supergirl was going to spend around her feet, Alex decides to have her learn how to properly pamper her owners lovely feet as well as rub them after a long day of crushing her into the insole of her boot<br>\r\n2) Alex can't wait to show Kara what she did to her sister's favourite hero, bet she'd be jealous Alex got her into such a position she was literally dirt under her feet.

Stepping back and leaning over to pick it up, he saw it was a small doll, maybe 5 inches tall and reminding him of his mom's assistant, tied back blond hair, cute glasses, prominent curves emphasised by a short skirt and tight shirt, from what he could tell it was like someone made a Kara Danvers doll, but why was it left out here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Carter decides if it was left out in the open he'll take it, examining the tiny girl, getting even more interested when he discovered how lifelike/anatomically correct she was, as well as what was beneath her shirt besides 2 still quite large breasts<br>\r\n2) Curious, Carter brings his new toy to Cat, hoping she'll let him keep it<br>\r\n3) While the tiny girl caught his attention he did have other things to do, so puts Kara in his book bag and continues on, he can properly check out doll Kara when he gets home</span></div></div>",

Her vision is a little fuzzy and she struggles to see the world around her. She feels something soft underneath her, it\u2019s some sort of fabric. She sits up and rubs her head as her vision slowly come back. Something doesn\u2019t feel right, Kara looks around and notices that everything is dark. Kara\u2019s heart sinks, someone must have kidnapped her. Kara jumps up and tries to fly away but she end up tumbling to the ground. She tries using her heat vision but that doesn\u2019t work either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Kara gasps. \u201cMy powers, how?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara runs her hands over her body, she can feel that she has her work clothes on but can\u2019t feel any traces off her costume, who ever kidnaped her was after Kara not Supergirl. The world around her starts to shake. Kara is thrown around even hitting the walls. Kara was expecting it to hurt but to her surprise the walls are just as soft as the ground beneath her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on here?\u201d Kara gasps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud zipping noise springs to action and travels over Kara\u2019s head, Kara\u2019s heart leaps into her throat as the room flood with light blinding Kara. She struggles to see what\u2019s out there but does see something making it\u2019s way in. Something creeps around her waist, Kara wants to scream but nothing comes out. It\u2019s curls around her body and pins her arms to the side. Kara whimpers as she is slowly raised in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she is brought out of the prison everything starts to make sense but she doesn\u2019t like the results. She sees that she is in a room that looks to belong to a teenage boy. Kara looks down and sees that the thing curled around her is actually a giant hand and attached to that. Kara shivers as her eyes trail up, the hand belongs to Carter Grant, Cat Grant\u2019s son and he looks more than happy to have his grubby fingers around Kara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a realistic doll.\u201d Carter says as he places his giant finger on Kara\u2019s head gently stroking it. \u201cSomeone must have a thing for Mom\u2019s assistant to make you look like her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThats\u2019 because I am her.\u201d Kara whimpers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCater\u2019s smile quickly drops as he is in shock. \u201cYou\u2019re real?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Kara nods. \u201cCarter, you need to help me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d Carter asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Kara lies, she knows that it was from the alien that pricked her. \u201cCarter please, take me to my sister.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so cool.\u201d Carter smiles. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted a tiny person.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCarter!\u201d Kara screams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was your name again?\u201d Carter asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cK-k-k-kara.\u201d She says shaking, she could tell that Carter had full hands and control over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat right,\u201d He smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s such a pretty name, especially for such a pretty girl.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, thanks.\u201d Kara blushes like crazy, having someone flirt with Kara was always nice but from a thirteen year old boy made her feel a little uncomfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarter smiles down at Kara and runs his fingers though Kara\u2019s hair, she had tied it in a pony tail before she passed out so Carter smiles and plays with her ponytail. Kara blushes a bit as it does feel nice in a way. Kara bites her bottom lip doing her best to hold back a moan as Carter gently rubs her back too. She doesn\u2019t want to let her moan escape her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou like that don\u2019t you?\u201d Carter whispers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara blushes and looks away awkwardly, she doesn\u2019t want to admit to him that she enjoys having a thirteen year old boy giving her a massage with his giant digits even if his fingers are nice and warm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara feels her heart sink as Carter\u2019s finger moves to her front side. His giant digit makes contact with her breasts and gives it a little rub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch me there!\u201d Kara shouts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarter smiles and ignores her, Kara whimpers as Carter brings his thumb into the equation and gives them a gentle squeeze and rub. Kara bites her bottom lip harder. She doesn\u2019t remember the last time she had actually had any fun with anyone in a long time so her urges are rising to the surface. While she wants to enjoy this she doesn\u2019t want to if the person who is giving her pleasure is a thirteen year old boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop.\u201d Kara whimpers and moans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Carter giggles. \u201cI can see you are enjoying it as much as me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop it now!\u201d Kara screams at the top of her lungs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara feels Carter remove his fingers from her breasts, she instantly regrets what she had just said seeing Carter\u2019s face drop. Kara whimpers expecting the worst response from Carter. </span></div></div>",

Kara blushes, Carter places his finger on Kara\u2019s head and gently pats her head and down her back like she is a animal. Kara blushes and hugs her knees and tries shielding her breasts from Carter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou make such a pretty pet Kara.\u201d Carter smiles. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll take good care of you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s sweet of you Cater but I would prefer to be taken home to my sister so I can return to normal.\u201d Kara says with a bit of fear in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Carter asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I like my life and want to return to it normal sized.\u201d Kara says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut if you live with me at this size I promise I\u2019ll make your life so much better.\u201d Cater smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Kara says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease Kara.\u201d He begs. \u201cMy life hasn\u2019t been exactly great recently, I hardly see Mom any more and I don\u2019t really have any fiends.

But she knows that he can be a sweet boy and she can tell that he genuinely means it when he says he\u2019ll take care of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I stay with you.\u201d Kara sighs. \u201cOnly for a week.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA week? Cater says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTen days then.\u201d Kara says nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Cater says. \u201cForever.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCater!\u201d Kara squeals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Cater smirks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d Cater says. \u201cIt\u2019s kidnapping.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you agreed to stay with me.\u201d Carter says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut not forever!\u201d Kara squeaks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou still agreed.\u201d Cater smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara jumps up and scrunches up her face ready to explode, she doesn\u2019t care how big he is compared to her he needs to be told off. Kara goes to open her mouth but Carter\u2019s giant fingers around her waist and grabs her with a bit of strength. Kara yelps and closes her eyes as she is brought right up to Carter\u2019s giant face, she shivers as she can feel his warm breath flow over her body. Kara bites her bottom lip, it feels kind of nice. Kara slowly opens her eyes and sees Carter\u2019s smiling face right in front of her. Kara blushes a little as up close Carter does look handsome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop this now.\u201d Kara grunts to herself. \u201cHe\u2019s thirteen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me, we are going to have so much fun,\u201d Carter smiles. \u201cWe could even be friends with benefits.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara turns white a the thought, before she has a chance to actually process all that he sees Carter licking his lips before pursuing his lips. Kara squirms and tries to pull away as Carter brings her towards hm. He presses his giant moist lips against Kara\u2019s tiny face and kisses her. Kara closes her eyes and whimpers. She has to admit that it does feel kind of nice, his lips are perfectly moist and his lips are so soft and warm. This is the best kiss Kara has had in a long time. Kara brings her hands up and runs them over his giant lips and kissing his top lip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara is gently removed from his giant lips after a little bit and is greeted to a giant smiling Cater blushing bit himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI felt that,\u201d He smiles. \u201cYou were kissing back.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I wasn\u2019t.\u201d Kara blushes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you won\u2019t admit it,\u201d Cater giggles. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you are a very good kisser though.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara smirks and blushes. Carter grabs Kara\u2019s glasses and takes them off her face, Kara tries to cover her face as she doesn\u2019t want him to recognise her as Supergirl but Carter has her arms pinned to her side. Kara starts shaking as Carter undoes her ponytail and lets her hair hang down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look so pretty without your glasses,\u201d Carter smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, thanks.\u201d Kara bites her bottom lip and blushes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad that you're my girl now.\u201d Carter says softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara smiles and blushes, Cater kisses Kara\u2019s face again before holding her against his chest cuddling her. His hands covering her as he holds her. Kara closes her eyes and whimpers, she can\u2019t help but feel warm from this. She places her hands on his chest and hugs back. She can\u2019t remember the last time she actually felt wanted and him calling her his girl felt oddly satisfying. Kara smiles and blushes like crazy as she feels Carter gently rub her back with his giant digit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t he be eighteen.\u201d Kara whispers to herself. \u201cIt would make all of this less awkward.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you say something?\u201d Carter asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Kara says quickly. </span></div></div>",

Kara\u2019s stomach turns as she sees Carter\u2019s smile widen and licks his lips. He didn\u2019t need to move his hand far before Kara snapping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d Kara shouts jumping back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Cater says flinching his hand back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what you want to do and you better not!\u201d Kara says folding her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do I want to do?\u201d Carter asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to grab me and strip me naked.\u201d Kara says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was actually going to grab you so I could kiss you but that sounds better.\u201d Cater smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara\u2019s jaw drop as she instantly regrets what she had said. Carter\u2019s giant comes towards Kara and Kara shuffles back. His fingers get extremely closes almost wrapping around her but Kara hits him as hard as she can. Carter yelps and removes his hand completely. Kara stands there arms folded with a smug look on her face proud she fought him off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEither you strip yourself or I do it for you.\u201d Carter says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you want me to strip?\u201d Kara says stomping her foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I want to see that sexy body of yours.\u201d Carter smiles. \u201cYou are so beautiful as it is Kara I really want to see you naked. I\u2019ve never actually seen a girl naked before either.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara stands there with her mouth hanging wide open, she can\u2019t believe what she had just heard. There was no way she would let him strip her. Part of her does blush a bit at his comment but shes not going to let that thought take over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll be stripping Barbie myself.\" Carter smiles reaching for Kara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Kara squeals trying to escape his hand. \"I'll do it myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Theres a good girl.\" Carter smiles and gently pats her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara turns bright red as she undoes her top button of her blouse, she cant believe she is stripping for a horny teenage boy. She undoes all her buttons on her blouse and slowly takes them off shaking a little. She looks up at Carter who is grinning with his eyes locked on her breasts. Kara blushes like crazy and undoes the button to her pants. She pulls it to the ground and stand there half naked in her underwear. She feels too embarrassed to take off any more clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at the sexy body.\" Carter smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Kara blushes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara gasps as she feels the tip of Carters finger brush her leg. She bites her bottom lip as he places his finger against her thigh and brushes up and down Kara's entire leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have such nice legs.\" Carter smiles. \"So smooth, long and sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara blushes like crazy, his flirting and giant warm finger was kind of tuning her on. He gets dangerously close to her spot between her legs. Kara takes a step back to try get away from him but she trips and falls on her ass. Carter giggles and continues to rub her long legs. Kara bites her bottom lip and shivers, his finger would brush over her crotch a few times. She blushes like crazy as she can feel herself getting wet. Carter rolls Kara onto her stomach and gives her ass cheeks and good squeeze with his thumb and forefinger. Kara moans slipped out of her mouth before she could catch it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice ass.\u201d Carter smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarter pulls down her panties to get a better look at her checks. Kara is blushing like crazy as her bare ass is exposed to the giant teen. Kara shivers and moans as Carter gently kisses her ass. Carter quickly rolls Kara back onto her back and licks his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne left.\u201d He smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare.\u201d Kara whimpers almost crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was useless, Carter rips off Kara\u2019s bra before she even has a chance to blink. Now she is laying there naked in front of Carter. Carter gets very hands very quickly as his giant fingers explores her breasts all over. Kara closes her eyes and whimpers, part of her was kind of enjoying it while the other was completely disgusted, his fingers are very smooth and warm and it didn\u2019t help that they brushed over her erect nipples a few times. Carters fingers explore every part of Kara\u2019s naked body, her breasts, her ass, legs and brushes over her pussy a times. Kara\u2019s moans and screams slips out and she is moaning with every squeeze and feel. Carter wasn\u2019t trying to be too rough with her but the whole thing was turning Kara on. Kara closes her eyes and imagines someone else doing it to her instead of Carter, this wasn\u2019t the best idea as Kara\u2019s little moans turned into loud squeals and moans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarter smirks and gives Kara\u2019s nipples a gently pinch between his fingers sending kara into a squealing frenzy. He smiles and rolls them around in his fingers for a little bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew you would enjoy it.\u201d Carter smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara whimpers and blushes as Carter removes his fingers.

Kara tries to wriggle away but Carter grabs a hold of her legs to keep them apart and her close. Carter\u2019s tongue gets closer and closer until he gives Kara\u2019s pussy a big lick. Kara throws her head back and screams. Kara whimpers and moans and Carter goes for more licking at Kara\u2019s wet pussy. Kara\u2019s eyes rolls in the back of her head and she starts to moan like crazy, it did feel pretty good. Kara screams of disgust slowly turns into screams of pleasure, her urges take over her entirely. Her whole body turns bright red as her moans start to increase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god!\u201d Kara screams loudly and climaxes on Carter\u2019s mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm,\u201d Carter moans licking his lips and swallowing down a mouthful. \u201cYou taste so good.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara turns bright red, she feels completely embarrassed that she had oral by this young teen. Before she could curl up in a ball and cry Carter comes back and gives her pussy other lick to clean up the remaining bits. Kara shivers and feels that she could cum again, luckily for her she doesn\u2019t so she just lays there puffing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want to return the favour Kara?\u201d Carter asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara\u2019s jaw hangs open as she hears this, she wants to scream and yell at him for suggesting that but her mouth goes dry and her body freezes up. Carter smiles and stands up, Kara\u2019s stomach starts turning as Carter undoes his pants and lets it drop to the ground. He quickly takes off his underwear like there is no tomorrow and his cock springs into action. Kara\u2019s jaw drops as Carter\u2019s giant cock has in front of her, she is impressed. Despite the size difference Carter is well hung especially for his age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou like?\u201d Carter smiles and grabs Kara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara screams as his giant fingers curl around her tiny form, she is brought to the giant beast with no hesitation form him. just from being next to it Kara can feel the intense heat coming off it. She whimpers as Carter places her on his base and curls his fingers around her and his cock pinning the two together. Kara whimpers and gives it a squeeze, Carter moans and starts to gently jerk himself and Kara. Kara lets out a loud moan as it is slowly getting to her, His the giant meaty cock pressed against her naked body feels incredible and intense. Kara\u2019s face is buried against it and she gets lost in it. Kissing and licking it as her body is pressed. She feels the monster rumble sightly and a bit of pre cum down down the shaft. Kara lets out a little moan and licks up the cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy does it have to taste so good.\u201d Kara whimpers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarter places his thumb on the back of Kara\u2019s head and shoves her face first into his cock. He tightens his grip around Kara and himself and picks up the pace. He loudly moans and cums, his cum drips down and hits Kara like a title wave. Kara closes her eyes and just lets it flow over her, she slides her tongue out and does lick up a fair bit. She lets out a little moan as Carter removes his hand from her and himself, he lays back in his chair puffing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara sides down Carter\u2019s cock and sits at the base puffing like crazy. She runs her fingers though her hair and removes a good chuck of cum. Kara keeps her back towards Carter too embarrassed to face him. Kara takes a deep breath as her ass rests against the pubic hair and the cock between her lags. She smirks a little as she reflects on what had just happened. She knows its wrong and a bit odd but she cant help but admit that it was kind of arousing, her tiny naked body wrapped around a giant cock is exhilarating. While she doesn\u2019t want to be a toy for Carter she doesn\u2019t mind being a toy for this beast.</span></div></div>",

Carter laying back in his chair while Kara sat on his crotch, ass on his pubic hair and his monster of a cock between her legs. The two of them have been sitting there for a while saying or doing nothing. Kara\u2019s eyes are locked onto Carter\u2019s cock, she bites her bottom lip as she feels she has a bit of energy left and being where she is, is kind of arousing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara reaches out slowly and carefully placing her tiny hands on the monster, the heat coming of it is very intense. Kara cant help but giggle a bit as just by her sightliest touch the thing grew. Kara bites her bottom lip and gives her hips a slight grind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god.\u201d Kara whispers as she feels herself getting wet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara closes her eyes and grinds her hips a little more, she moves closer to the monster. Taking a deep breath she leans forward. It\u2019s just a sight distance from her face. Kara closes her eyes and leans forward giving it a gentle kiss. She lets out a little moan as it tastes very sweet, she blushes a bit before giving it another this this time with more passion and tongue. Her hands come into play rubbing it up and down it\u2019s enormous shaft. Kara could feel the vibrations of the moans coming from it, she smiles and purrs as it feels incredible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara leans into it more pressing her naked body against it. Still kissing and running her hands up and down it Kara adds her entire body to the mix grinding against it. She closes her eyes and gets lost in it making sure that her pussy is grinding against it too. Kara lets out loud moans with every grind, she just loves the feeling of the giants heat pressing against her naked body. Her tits and pussy being the biggest one. It feels magical and the best thrill she has ever gotten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara curls her arms around the shaft as she feels her own climax building up inside her. She buries her face into the cock and does her best to passionately kiss it while grinding her body and pussy against it. Kara rocks her hips and squeaks, she lets out a loud moan and cums all over the base of the cock. Kara feels the cock tremble and explode too. A fountain of cum pours down and lands on Kara\u2019s head. It\u2019s just a small load but enough to cover her face. Kara blushes and wipes her face clean. She smirks a bit before licking her hands clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for that love.\u201d Kara whispers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles and leans in giving the cock a gentle kiss before snuggling into it like a lover. Kara closes her eyes as she catches her breath back gently smiling. Kara\u2019s heart sinks as she feels a giant finger gently stroke her back. She had completely forgotten Carter was there, his giant digit run up and down gently massaging her back. Kara blushes, while she did feel embarrassed by her actions she has to admit that Carter\u2019s sensational massage does feel nice. Kara closes her eyes and lets out a little moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a good girl.\u201d Carter whispers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara smiles softly and buries her face in her new lover as Carter gently rubs her back. </span></div></div>",

Carter feels a little tired himself as fucking Kara took a lot out of him. He stands up and carries Kara over to his draws carefully and places her inside wrapping her in his underwear for comfort. While Carter would love for Kara to sleep around his cock he feels drained as it is and doesn\u2019t need any more till morning. Carter throws some underwear on and climb into bed almost passing out as his head hits the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarter wakes up the next morning feeling fully refreshed. He climbs out of bed and checks on Kara who is still fast asleep. Carter is tempted to pull her out and play with her but he leaves her to sleep as she needs the rest. There is a knock at the door and Carter turns to see his mother standing there in a suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m about to make breakfast.\u201d Cat says walking in. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing for me.\u201d Carter sighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Cat asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot hungry.\u201d Carter says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m starving.\u201d Cat sighs. \u201cI\u2019ll make you something.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat bites her bottom lip as her eyes drift down. Carter is a little confused so he follows her eye sight. He looks down only to see this his boxers were pitched. His morning wood make the front of his boxers stick out almost a foot. Carter blushes like crazy and tries to hide himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, sorry.\u201d He stutters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor what?\u201d Cat asks. \u201cBeing huge and impressive?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, I guess.\u201d Carter laughs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust make sure you don't hurt anyone with that thing.\u201d Cat smirks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo late.\u201d Cater smirks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Cat asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Cater giggles. \u201cI\u2019m just teasing.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you shouldn\u2019t be with that thing,\u201d Cat smirks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhys that?\u201d Carter asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just very hypnotising.\u201d Cat smirks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarter smirks and blushes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo is it morning wood or are you just happy to see me?\u201d Cat asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBit of both.\u201d Cater giggles and blushes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201ci\u2019m a bit surprised,\u201d Cat smirks and closes the door behind her. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I would be your type?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is hot and sexy not my type?\u201d Cater smirks with a blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue.\u201d Cat smirks and blushes slightly. \u201cI\u2019m glad you think so hon, I don\u2019t remember the last time I had someone actually attracted to me like that.

Cat bites her bottom lip and looks into Cater\u2019s eyes. He smiles back softly. Cat reaches out and brushes her fingers up and down the base. Cater lets out a soft moan causing Cat to giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want Mommy to help you out with it?\u201d Cat whispers. \u201cRelive some stress.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease.\u201d Cater moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat smirks and places her hands on Carter\u2019s shoulders. She turns Carter to the bed and gently sits him down on the bed. Carter smiles and Cat starts to undo her shirt. Carter's eyes widen no expecting this to happen. Cat throws her shirt off with the bra coming off next. Carters jaw drops as Cat\u2019s breasts pops out of her bra. While they aren't the biggest Carter loves the size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou like?\u201d Cat pouts squeezing them together.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDefinitely.\u201d Cater gasps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat smirks and lowers herself down, she sides Carters\u2019 cock between her breasts and sandwiches them against it. Carter\u2019s eyes roll into the back of his head and moans. Cat smirks and kisses the tip of his cock before moving her breasts up and down giving him a gentle breast fuck. Carter moans like crazy enjoying it. While he did love Kara wrapped around his cock this is on a whole other level. Cat kisses and licks the tip of Cater\u2019s cock as she tit fucks him. Carter lets out a loud moan and cums shooting his load. The explosive load shoots in Cat\u2019s mouth, on her face and all over her breasts. Cater moans and falls back on the bed puffing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow was that love?\u201d Cat purrs licking the cum off her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect.\u201d Cater puffs. \u201cThat was fucking incredible.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat giggles and kisses the tip of his cock.

It's been a year now  since Supergirl has arrived, and there were no way that Cat's company will end up like the daily planet who kept writing about Superman's saving the day. No. Cat wanted more. That's why she was in bad mood these last days, she even had to fire some employees, including Siobhan Smythe, her former new assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she arrived to her office, taking her coffee from Kara's hand, she noticed a box on her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" All right Keyra, that'll be all for now so leave me alone\" she said keeping her eye on the box, but Kara had a bad feeling about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh wait..Are you sure you don't want me to call someone, i don't know maybe the police the check the box ? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh come on. Do you really think that someone will try to kill me here. In my building, in my office ? Leave me alone or i'll make you regret to be my assistant \" The boss replied in a tone that Kara knew it was better to not try to argue. Kara tried anyway to check the box with her X-Vision, but it only made her more worried as the box was in plumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" F..Fine \" Kara said leaving the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat opened the box, but she didn't expect what was coming next : a dark cloud spreading over the room...it was a trapped. Cat get soon enought trapped in the darkness, trying to not breath but it was useless. It took a minute before the cloud disappeared, and so did Cat. But not really. In fact, Cat Grant openned her eyes only to see her office becoming huge ! she was there under her own desk, on the carpet...She has shrunk !<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Whaaat..The heeell is going on there ?! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a letter with the box, but the box was on the desk...And Cat was too small to reach it.

Unfortunately for Barry however, he never seemed to have good luck because as soon as he sat on the sofa he noticed a strange thing on the table, and as he went to inspect it a loud bang sat him back down, where he immediately noticed something wrong. Everything, was, HUGE. He had shrunken down to about 3 inches he figured and to his horror his speed wasn't functioning properly, and this all happened moments before Iris opened the door and entered the Living room and prepared to make herself comfortable as she waited for Barry.</span></div></div>",

She pulls out her gun and heads towards the noise. She leans against the side of the building and listens in on the conversation. It sounds like someone is getting mugged. As Patty slowly pears around the corner she sees a big man standing over a woman who is begging for her freedom. Beams shoot from the man\u2019s hands and land around the woman doing his best to scare her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFucking Metas.\u201d Patty whispers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty jumps out from behind the building before anything bad can happen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCCPD!\u201d Patty shouts. \u201cHands where I can see them!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looks up at Patty with a grin. His hands remain at his side, he doesn\u2019t look like he wants to surrender. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHands where I can see them!\u201d Patty shouts again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSilly girl.\u201d The man laughs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man charges his hands and throws a beam from his hands. Patty manages to dive out of the way and lands on a pile of rubbish. She scrambles out from the garbage and holds her gun back at the meta. Despite being down for two seconds the Flash had already come in and caught the man with the woman thanking him. Patty rolls her eyes and puts her gun back in its holster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch out!\u201d She hears the woman scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty looks up and sees the beam from the meta heading straight for her. She does her best to react but she\u2019s too slow. The beam hits her chest casing her to fly back with a scream. The beam knocks the wind out of her giving her trouble breathing. Everything feels like it\u2019s in slow-motion. She looks around and sees that the cars around her are driving really slow. She looks over back at the crime scene and sees they woman still there but The Flash and the Meta gone. The woman hadn\u2019t noticed her, she is just walking away very slowly. Patty\u2019s body starts to tingle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Patty screams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty looks down and sees that her body is fading out of existence. She goes to open her mouth to scream but nothing comes out. Before she knows it all she can see and feel is darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty wakes up with a huge gasp. She sits up and runs her hands all over her body to cheek if she\u2019s all there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank god.\u201d She gasps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty lays back down and starts puffing, it feels like she just ran a marathon.

She sits up and looks around, her jaw drops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck!\u201d She squeals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s hard to tell where she is as her vision is still blurry but from the looks of it she appears to be about five inches tall as she can see that there are giant things around here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp!\u201d Patty screams. \u201cSomeone help!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart sinks as she can hear a door click and footsteps getting closer.

She went outside to wait for the others but after 5 minutes she noticed the street was surprisingly crowded, so decided to head back inside. Halfway back though, a man ran through the crowd and stole her bag. She gives chase to the theif and follows him into an alleyway, once he was out of breath the guy turn around with a gun pulled at her. She raises her hand, \"get lost or you'll regret it\" he warned but even as the words came out a bright light passed through Caitlins hands and travelled towards the theif. The theifs eyes went wide as he tried to run but in the blink of an eye, he was gone. Caitlin was confused and looked around for the theif but it didn't take long to notice the tiny body laid flat on the ground, passed out. Caitlin was stunned at this newfound power of hers and, after taking her bag back, decided to give the theif away.

'Barry could you meet me in the speed lab in a few minutes to help me with something', Cailtin asked so Barry nodded back 'sure I'll be down in a few.' Caitlin headed down to the lab awaiting Barry's arrival she pondered what she would do with Barry once he was the size of her finger. Her thoughts were interrupted, however, when Barry entered the room and asked \"ok then, what's up?\" Caitlin said nothing, but raised her hands at him and focused the same energy she felt earlier, Barry couldn't even activate his speed before the beam met contact with him. Before he could register what was happening, in the blink of an eye, he was gone. Caitlin smiled triumphantly as she walked towards her prize, and as expected she saw a little figure on the ground trying to run from her. She wasted no time in picking him up and squealing with delight at how adorable he was. She could his shouts and pleas and knew exactly what he was saying but didn't care in the slightest, her only care was that she now had a new boytoy and couldn't wait to have her fun with him. \"Oh Barry i am going ti have sooooo much fun with you\" she smiled, but she knew he would have to be kept hidden throughout the day and debated where he would be stored. After some thought she said to Barry \"well Barry ive decided that you will be in my _____ for the rest of the day,\" and laughed happily as his eyes widened with shock and horror.</span></div></div>",

She\u2019s been sitting in her apartment in silence for about an hour and it\u2019s almost driving her crazy. Kara fiddles with her phone and keeps her eyes lock onto the centre of the room as that\u2019s where she normally appears. Kara sighs as her hope is slowly diminishing. She\u2019s usually on time but Kara\u2019s not too sure what\u2019s keeping her guest.  They haven\u2019t seen each other in a week due to their busy schedules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara is waiting for Caitlin Snow to arrive from earth one. Kara and Caitlin have been secretly dating for five months. Ever since her last visit to earth one Kara had some time to kill. Kara had the option to go back home but she wanted to explore earth one as she\u2019s there once a year for emergencies so she thought why not have a look around so she invited Caitlin. Kara and Caitlin spent a lot of together, Kara even let Caitlin fly with her a few times. During their time together the two of them got quite close and started to develop feelings for each other. Caitlin make the first move by kissing Kara but got quite embarrassed. Kara caught up to her and they two talked for quite a while about what had happened. They shared another kiss and admitted their feelings. Ever since Caitlin would travel to earth thirty eight a couple of time a week to see Kara with a breech. They would send time together talking, making out as well as having sex. No one knows about it as the two want to keep it privet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breech appears in the middle of the floor and Kara jumps up with a squeal. Caitlin steps out with a smile and the breech disappears. Caitlin opens her mouth to say hi but Kara wraps her arms around her and hugs her tight. Kara pulls away a bit and Caitlin leans in and locks lips with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI missed you so much baby.\u201d Caitlin whispers as she pulls away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI missed you too baby.\u201d Kara whispers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara leans back in and kisses Caitlin. Caitlin moans as Kara runs her tongue over Caitlin\u2019s lips and slides it inside. Caitlin loves Kara\u2019s kisses as they are warm and quite strong. Caitlin places her hands on Kara\u2019s smooth ass and gives them a firm squeeze, despite being the girl of steel, Caitlin was surprised how firm and tender Kara\u2019s ass was. The two of them moan and hold their possessions for a couple of minutes loving each other\u2019s embrace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you want to do tonight Kitty?\u201d Kara asks slowly pulling away. \u201cI\u2019m okay if you just want to fuck.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat does sound great.\u201d Caitlin smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara takes Caitlin\u2019s hands in hers and takes her to the couch. Kara sits down on the couch and Caitlin sits on her lap. Caitlin giggles and passionately kisses Kara. The two of them make out with Caitlin doing her best to control the kiss. She places one hand on the side of her face with the other massaging her breast. Kara moans and places her hands on each of Caitlin\u2019s firm butt cheeks. Kara loves Caitlin\u2019s ass and its the body part of her\u2019s that she plays with the most while fooling around. Caitlin moans and slowly pulls away breaking the kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong baby?\u201d Kara asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Caitlin smiles. \u201cBut I want to explain why I took so long to get here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe a little later if that\u2019s okay.\u201d Kara smiles as she bites Caitlin\u2019s lower lip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like to tell you now,\u201d Caitlin giggles removing her lip from Kara\u2019s teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it then?\u201d Kara smiles as she kisses Caitlin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve set up a romantic dinner for us back on my earth,\u201d Caitlin smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Kara squeals. \u201cThat\u2019s so sweet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all ready to go,\u201d Caitlin smiles. \u201cAll we need to do now is go. Are you ready?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me get changed first,\u201d Kara says. \u201cI look like a mess.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Caitlin asks. \u201cYou look beautiful, you don\u2019t need to change.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Kara blushes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara pulls Caitlin in close and passionately kisses her. Caitlin kisses back and the two hold their embrace for a while. Caitlin breaks the kiss with a smile, she climbs off Kara and holds out her hand. Kara smiles and takes her hand. Kara stands up and Caitlin reaches into her pocket and pulls out a breech disk. She throws it and a breech appears, Caitlin and Kara give each other a smile and walk towards it. The two of them stop as the breech starts to glitch out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d Kara asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Caitlin says. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine though, it just looks like we don\u2019t have much time.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen what are we waiting for?\u201d Kara asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin and Kara hold each other\u2019s hands firmly and jump inside. As soon as they jump in they knew something is wrong, they are thrown all over the place and feel themselves being scattered and scrambled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens to Kara and Caitlin?</span></div></div>",

Kara leans in and kisses Caitlin. Caitlin kisses back and the two break. The look at the floor and notice that something is off. They lift their heads and see that there is a giant table right next to them. Kara and Caitlin\u2019s stomachs drop. They look around more and see chairs and table, they are in someone\u2019s apartment. Kara and Caitlin look down at themselves and are glad to have their clothes on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell just happened Katie?\u201d Kara asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Caitlin says. \u201cThe breach must have malfunctioned scrambling out molecules which caused us to become about five inches.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara didn\u2019t fully understand what Caitlin said as she was speaking quite quickly but she did understand that the breach must have done this to them. Caitlin and Kara wrap their arms around each other and waits for the owner to arrive. Caitlin and Kara hold each other in silence, they are too scared to say or do anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take long for the two doll sized women to hear footsteps. Their hearts sink as they are dreading the size of the giant and who but they are also relieved. They look over and see a blonde haired woman walk out of the bathroom. She walks into the kitchen and pours herself a drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPatty?\u201d Caitlin says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know her?\u201d Kara asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d Caitlin says. \u201cYes I do, she an officer at the CCPD.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA police officer?\u201d Kara asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Caitlin says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHopefully I can trust her enough with that bit of information.\u201d Kara says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin and Kara let go of each other but hold each other's hands. They take off running towards the giant and screams her name trying to get her attention. Patty doesn\u2019t hear them, she leans against the bench and sips at her drink. Kara lets go of Caitlin\u2019s hand and jumps trying to fly up to Patty. Kara remains in the air for a second before plummeting to the ground. The breach had made her lose her powers. Kara had never felt more powerless in her life. The thud was enough to get Patty's attention. Kara and Caitlin look up and see the giant\u2019s eyes locked on them. The two are relieved but also nervous. Patty kneels down and reaches towards them. Kara and Caitlin stand still and let Patty grab them. Patty curls her giant fingers around their waists and lifts them in the air. Kara and Caitlin are brought to Patty's giant confused face. Her giant eyes study them as they are shiver. Patty\u2019s jaw drops and eyes widen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaitlin!?\u201d Patty squeals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi,\u201d Caitlin squeaks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty places the two on the bench before she accidentally drops them. Patty brings her face towards them jaw still dropped. Kara and Caitlin can\u2019t help but giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d Patty gasps. \u201cI mean what.. no I do mean how. What happened?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Caitlin sighs. \u201cKara and I were trying to come to Earth one but the breach must have done this to us.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is so cool.\u201d Patty smiles. \u201cYou two are dolls.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool?\u201d Kara says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Patty apologises. \u201cThis is terrible, I shouldn\u2019t have said that.

I know you\u2019re scared but I know Patty, she's kind and sweet and I\u2019m sure she's not going to hurt us.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScouts honour.\u201d Patty smiles. \"I promise I won't hurt you.

You are just so adorable.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Kara sighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me on this.\u201d Caitlin smiles and warps her arms around Kara\u2019s waist pulling her in close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright.\u201d Kara sighs. \u201cOnly because it\u2019s you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara leans in and kisses Caitlin, Patty lets out a squeal as she watches them kiss. Caitlin blushes while Kara rolls her eyes. Caitlin smirks as she sees her lovers reaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to watch TV so you are welcome to join.\u201d Patty smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin and Kara don't have time to respond. Patty reaches out and wraps her giant fingers around their waists. Kara lets out a little squeal along with Caitlin. Patty giggles and heads to the lounge with a smile on her face. Kara looks over at Caitlin with a concerned look. Caitlin doesn\u2019t see her as she is too focused on the giant woman. Patty sits down on the couch and lays down on her back. She gentle places the two tiny women on her stomach. Caitlin giggles and lays down as Patty turns the TV on. Caitlin looks over and sees that Kara is sitting there hugging her knees as she is a bit scared. Caitlin holds Kara\u2019s hand in hers. Kara gives Caitlin a smile and lays down next to her on Patty\u2019s giant warm stomach. She moves in close and cuddles into Caitlin.Caitlin lays there watching TV with Patty, Kara has her back to the TV and cuddles into Caitlin, she\u2019s not worried about the TV, all she\u2019s worried about is her situation and wanting to be with her girlfriend. Caitlin kisses Kara\u2019s forehead. Kara lets out a moan as she can feel something pat her body. Kara looks expecting it to be Caitlin but to her surprise it is Patty. Patty has her eyes glued to the TV but she is patting the two of them like they are animals. Kara wants to speak up but doesn\u2019t, she has to admit that this feels quite nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty looks down at her pets with a smile. She can\u2019t believe that this is happening, it\u2019s so strange yet it feels really good. Patty loves feel dominant over the two tiny people that are laying on her. Caitlin\u2019s calm and relaxed state was surprisingly satisfying and Kara\u2019s twitchy state is kind of adorable. The temptation is there for Patty to just pick them up and use them as toys but she wants to be carful, she wants them to feel comfortable and slowly lewd them into become toys especially for how sexy and cute the two are. Patty smiles and pats them as she watches TV.  </span></div></div>",

She looks down at Kara and Caitlin who are almost out of it too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Patty giggles. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to go to bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty curls her fingers around Kara and Caitlin and pull the two apart. Kara lets out a squeal as she does this. Patty giggles and climbs off the couch and heads to her bedroom. Caitlin is still half asleep, she feels that she could fall asleep with Patty\u2019s warm fingers around her. Kara is wide awake feeling the opposite to her lover. She\u2019s still adjusting to all of this and would rather be somewhere else than her. She doesn\u2019t feel entirely safe in Patty\u2019s hands despite what Caitlin had told her about her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty walks over to her draws and opens the top draw. She places Kara and Caitlin inside as carefully as she can. Caitlin gives Patty a smile while Kara is still trying to process everything. She looks down and sees that Patty and placed her in her underwear draw. Kara shoot Patty a look of disgust. Patty giggles before blowing Kara a kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweet dreams my pets.\u201d Patty smiles. \u201cHope you can sleep well on my panties, make yourself at home.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin giggles and Kara smirks a bit. Kara goes to open her mouth to say something but Patty slides the draw closed before she can get the chance. Kara and Caitlin sit in silence and listen to Patty wander around out side the draw. Caitlin smiles to herself as she can hear Patty stumble and turn the lights off. The idea of being a pet to Patty was kind of exciting. Caitlin looks over and sees that Kara is hugging her knees and shaking. Caitlin feels bad for her. She crawls over to Kara and places her hand on her back and rubs it. She leans in kissing Kara\u2019s forehead before pulling Kara in tight for a hug. Kara hugs her back with no hesitation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay baby?\u201d Caitlin asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Kara says with a bit of tremble in her voice. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that this is happening. We\u2019re the size of Barbie dolls in a woman\u2019s panty draw who intends to keep us as pets. I don\u2019t have my powers so there is no way for me to do anything to help. I\u2019ve never felt so powerless.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin holds Kara tighter as she cries a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo matter what happens Kara I\u2019m here for you.\u201d Caitlin says as she kisses Kara forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Kara says. \u201cSorry for being such an emotional wreak.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve five inches tall Kara.\u201d Caitlin smiles. \u201cYou have every right to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just can\u2019t believe this,\u201d Kara sighs. \u201cHow are you acting so calm? I thought you\u2019d be freaking out.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was at first,\u201d Caitlin sighs. \u201cBut once I knew we were going to be in Patty\u2019s hands I calmed down a little because I know what kind of person she is.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably why I\u2019m freaking out so much.\u201d Kara sighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive it time baby.\u201d Caitlin kisses Kara\u2019s head. \u201cI\u2019m not that tired and you\u2019re a bit stressed so I\u2019ve got something in mind that we can do that\u2019ll get your mind off all this.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you thinking what I think you\u2019re thinking?\u201d Kara asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf that thinking of my thinking is you thinking that I want to have a little fun then yes.\u201d Caitlin smirks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara giggles and places her hands on Caitlin\u2019s face pulling her in for a kiss. It was a soft kiss from Caitlin that she loved so much. The two sit there kissing for a bit enjoying each other\u2019s embrace. Kara grabs the bottom of her shirt and throws it over her head. Caitlin giggles and follows Kara\u2019s lead. Kara and Caitlin wrap their arms around each other and lock lips. They moan with their hands trailing down each other\u2019s back. They undo each other\u2019s bra and throw it aside. Caitlin\u2019s warm hands cup Kara\u2019s breasts causing her to moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI missed these super tits.\u201d Caitlin moans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI missed that frosty ass of yours.\u201d Kara giggles as she cups her hands around them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrosty?\u201d Caitlin asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvery time I grab your ass it\u2019s away quite cold.\u201d Kara giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood cold or bad cold?\u201d Caitlin asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood cold.\u201d Kara giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara gives Caitlin's ass a firm squeeze and pulls her in tight. Caitlin moans and slides her tongue inside her lovers mouth with her hands cupping Kara\u2019s cheeks. Kara moans and gently pushes Caitlin down as her lips remain locked. Caitlin squeals as she can feel Kara\u2019s bare breasts rub against hers. Kara drapes her body over Kara more, their breasts are firming squeezed together. Caitlin runs her hands down Kara\u2019s body and grabs the button of her pants. She does her best to undo them but she\u2019s struggling as Kara is trying to grind herself against her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeed some help?\u201d Kara giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind.\u201d Caitlin giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara sits up and undoes her pants, she grabs the waistband of her pants and panties and slides them down. She throws them to the side then does the same to Caitlin, Kara\u2019s eyes lock onto Caitlin freshly save pussy. Kara lets out a little giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you do this for me?\u201d Kara asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Caitlin smiles. \u201cLast night to be exact, I wanted to surprise you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I am surprised.\u201d Kara smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara leans back down and kisses Caitlin quite passionately. Caitlin lets out a little moan as she has never gotten a kiss like this before. Kara kisses her usually quite stronger. Kara gives Caitlin breasts a good squeeze before moving down her body. Caitlin throws her head back and gasps as Kara\u2019s lips make contact with hers. Kara\u2019s fingers trail around the moist lips to tease Caitlin. Caitlin moans as she loves Kara\u2019s teasing. Kara slides two fingers inside along with her tongue. Caitlin throws her head back and squeals as Kara fucks her. Caitlin\u2019s moans quickly turn into squeals as Kara picks up the pace. Caitlin feels her climax build up, she lets out a squeal and cums all over Kara\u2019s fingers. Kara moans and does her best to lick up all of the cum. Kara makes her way up Caitlin body and slides her tongue inside her mouth and gives her a taste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry I couldn\u2019t do it the way you liked it baby.\u201d Kara whispers. \u201cI don\u2019t have the powers to do so.\u201d \u2028<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright sweetie.\u201d Caitlin puffs giving Kara another kiss. \u201cIt was still fantastic.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara smiles and kisses Caitlin again. Caitlin\u2019s hand travels down Kara\u2019s body and finds its way to her pussy. Kara lets out a gasp as Caitlin\u2019s fingers slide inside. Kara sits up slightly so Caitlin is able to fit more inside. Kara starts moaning as she trusts her hips against Caitlin\u2019s fingers. Kara uses her arms to hold herself up but makes sure her lips are locked with Cairn\u2019s. Kara lets out a loud moan and cums all over Caitlin's hand. Kara gives Caitlin a passionate kiss before rolling off her and laying next to her. Kara and Caitlin lay close to each other and do their best to catch their breaths back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d Kara puffs. \u201cSex is sure exhausting without powers.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me.\u201d Caitlin puffs. \u201cWell for one thing I now know it\u2019s not your powers that makes this incredible.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Kara smiles. \u201cI thought you were going to break up with me since I can\u2019t give you you\u2019re favourite tongue fuck.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Well now that you brought it up.\u201d Caitlin giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I might have a bit left,\u201d Kara giggles. \u201cLet me try again.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara makes her way down and the two start giggling.

She\u2019s tempted to reach in and pick them up and cuddle them but she doesn\u2019t want to wake them. Patty bites her bottom lip as she checks out their naked bodies, just seeing them pressed against each other is enough of a turn on. Patty smiles as she sees that the two of them are sleeping on a pair of panties with them cuddling up in the crotch area. This gives Patty an idea. She reaches inside and grabs a different pair of panties and puts them on with a smile. Patty reaches in and does her absolute best to pull Kara off Caitlin. Patty lets out a sigh of relief as she lifts Kara in the air still asleep. Patty giggles and brings the tiny woman to her behind. She opens her panties and slides Kara between her butt cheeks as gently as she can. Patty lets go of the waistband and light clenches her cheeks together. Patty lets out a squeal as she can feel Kara wriggle around and cuddle up to her. Her tiny body against her cheeks feels delightful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome here little Katie.\u201d Patty smiles as she reaches in for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty opens the front of her waistband and lowers Caitlin in. Patty is a little hesitant there as Caitlin is right in front of her pussy. Patty looks down and sees that she doesn\u2019t take much to adjusting. Caitlin slides to the bottom and cuddles into Patty\u2019s thigh with her hands lightly brushing over her pussy. Patty shivers and lets out a moan as it is incredible. Patty closes her panties with a squeal. Both of them feel right at home with their new placement. Patty put the rest of her clothes on carefully as she doesn\u2019t want to wake her pets up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty goes about her morning like she normally would, breakfast, bathroom and fully changed into her uniform. Patty picks up her keys and heads to the door with a smile on her face, she hasn\u2019t felt her pets wake up yet but she can definitely tell that they are still asleep with Kara cuddling into her cheeks and Caitlin against her pussy. Patty is a little hesitant to head out like but she instantly changes her mind as Kara gives her a big hug. Patty giggles and heads off to work at the CCPD. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara wakes up wondering where she is, the walls around her are pushing against her and there is a wall of fabric behind her. It doesn\u2019t take her long to realise where she is. Kara lets out a grunt, she can\u2019t believe that Patty had put her between her ass but she\u2019s not really surprised. Kara\u2019s heart sinks as she instantly wonders where Caitlin is. Kara winces as she\u2019s fearing the worst. Kara wriggles around trying to break free but she ends up sliding down the patines. Kara\u2019s heart sinks she she can feel something brush against her feet. Kara tries to wiggle away to get away from it but she stops, its a pair of feet just like hers. It has to be Caitlin. Kara does her best to kick the tiny feet to wake Caitlin up but with her limited room it\u2019s a real struggle. Kara does her best to wiggle down more. She uses her hands but it ends up colliding with something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh no.\u201d Kara gasps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe does her best to pull her hand out but it\u2019s doing the opposite effect. Kara\u2019s arm is getting sucked inside. Kara is freaking out and does her best to escape but it just keeps sinking. Kara takes a deep breath and clams herself down, she knows she needs to be calm. Kara does her best to calmly pull her hand out but it\u2019s stuck. Kara takes another deep breath and does her best not to freak out again. She decides to just lay there with her arm stuck until Patty decides to wake her. Any more struggles will make things worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin wakes up from from something brushing against her feet she feels something wet and warm next to her. Caitlin remembers that she is small and doesn\u2019t take her long to realise what she is snuggling next to. Caitlin smiles to herself as she is kind of enjoying this. Caitlin can\u2019t help herself and runs her fingers up Patty\u2019s wet lips causing her to shiver. Caitlin giggles as she can feel Patty readjust herself. While Caitlin is loving her new panty partner should would have preferred to have Kara snuggling next to her and enjoying this with her. Caitlin starts to get worried about her as she knew how scared she was earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty walks around the CCDP sorting out the paperwork and delivering them where they needed to be delivered. Patty feels her pets wriggling around, she couldn\u2019t help but smile as she felt Kara freaking out a little. While she was a bit annoyed with Caitlin playing with her lips while she was in a crowed area she did love the feeling and wants more. Patty\u2019s day continues as it normally would and her pets remained still, she knew that the two of them wanted to escape their prison but Patty is loving their time in there way too much. Patty stands around with everyone as there is a large meeting for everyone in the CCPD. Patty stands around the middle as she needs to hear what\u2019s going on. The speech from the captain goes on for a little while but Patty manages to keep her attention and focus as she can feel the tiny women become impatient in her underwear. Patty manages to keep her posture until Caitlin starts moving, Caitlin is enjoying herself way too much in there and Patty can easily tell. Her hands trail up and down her lips and she even puts her arm in slightly. She goes to pull Caitlin out from the outside of her pants as she doesn\u2019t want to get aroused in front of all her co workers but she accidentally pushes Caitlin inside a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit,\u201d Patty gasps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty takes a deep breath and does her best to maintain herself as the captain continues his speech. Patty bites her bottom lip and clamps her thighs together thinking it\u2019ll stop Caitlin. Luckily for Patty the captain finishes his speech not long after, everyone goes their separate way and Patty calmly walks to the bathroom holding back her moans as Caitlin\u2019s torso is now inside her. She quickly scans the area, no one is around. She runs into a still with her posture still remaining. The excitement of all of this is really getting to Patty, she grabs the bottom of her shirt and throws it over her head. She leans against the door and gives her breasts a good squeeze to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck!\u201d Patty screams giving herself another squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty pulls her pants down and sits on the toilet still squealing. She reaches into her panties and wraps her fingers around Caitlin and pushes her in more. Patty lets out a squeal as Caitlin sinks inside her. Patty feels Kara\u2019s feet brush against her fingers as she pushes Caitlin inside. Kara\u2019s position gives her an idea. She slides Kara out from between her cheeks, she can\u2019t help but smile as she hears Kara let out a sigh of relief. Patty lets out a little moan as Kara\u2019s arm gets removed. Patty closes her eyes and leans back pushing Kara back towards her position. Kara can see where she is head and starts screaming. This doesn\u2019t stop Patty, she presses Kara\u2019s head against her ass hole. Patty moans and smiles as Kara sinks inside, Kara fighting is doing the opposite effect as Patty is loving her wriggling. Patty screams and does her best to push Kara in as much as she can, she stops until Kara is up to her shins inside her. Patty starts to squeal, she is loving Kara\u2019s wriggles. The tightened are around Kara makes her wriggling more pleasant. Patty reaches down and wraps her fingers around Caitlin\u2019s legs and pumps her in and out like she is a dildo. Patty squeals as she can feel her climax build up. Kara and Caitlin\u2019s wriggles are definitely working in her favour. Patty grabs her own breast and gives it a good squeeze as she picks up the pace. She lets out a scream and cums all over Caitlin\u2019s tiny form. Patty lays back on the toilet seat and does her best to catch her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you two are amazing.\u201d Patty puffs and brushes her fingers over the tiny girl\u2019s feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty shivers as the two of the wriggle trying to get out. Patty wants to pull them out but decides to leave them inside. She\u2019s too exhausted and they do feel incredible.</span></div></div>",

Nora shutters as she turns on the tap. She washes her hands but stops, she turns the tap off and spins around, she hears someone screaming from one of the cubicles. She must be in trouble. The screaming stops, Nora gets worried, something must have happened to her. Nora walks to the cubical door and starts vibrating her body. She steps through the door and sees a half naked blonde woman covered in sweat. Nora and the woman turn bright red as they see each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Nora turns around and does her best to vibrate through the door. Nora becomes unstable and ends up colliding with the door. Nora lets out a squeal as she has hit her nose against the door. She opens the door a fraction and slides out and does her best not to look back despite how tempted she is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d She follows Nora outside to make sure that she is fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora is doubled over and covering her hands over her face as her nose is now bruised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry you had to see that, I\u2019m Patty by the way.\u201d She says. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s my fault.\u201d Nora says standing up. \u201cI\u2019m fine really, my name is Nora. It\u2019s nice to meet you despite what is happening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora turns to Patty and blushes, she\u2019s still standing there just in her bra. Patty turns bright red and does her best to cover herself up. Nora bites her bottom lip and takes half a step forward. She\u2019s finding Patty\u2019s kindness quite attractive. She places her hands on the side of Patty\u2019s face and pulls her close for a kiss. Patty lets out a moan as their lips collide. Nora breaks the kiss and starts to shake a little she turns bright red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should not have done that,\u201d Nora apologises. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I shouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Patty says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora doesn\u2019t hear this and turns to the door. Patty places her hands on her shoulders and turns her around towards her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright Nora,\u201d Patty says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo it wasn\u2019t.\u201d Nora stumbles. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I hated kissing you it\u2019s that is should have asked even though it is weird to ask someone i just met to kiss them\u2026.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty pulls Nora in and kisses her more passionately than Nora did to her. Nora lets out a loud moan and does her best to kiss back as she feels a little weak. Patty breaks the kiss with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was okay,\u201d Patty giggles. \u201cIt was more than okay actually, you\u2019re a pretty good kisser.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Nora blushes. \u201cYou\u2019re not so bad yourself.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty and Nora giggle and stand up more, the two smile at each other before Nora pulls Patty in for a kiss, this time Nora feels more comfortable. The two stand there kissing each other with Patty\u2019s half naked body pressed against her. Nora lets out a moan as Patty breaks the kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about we go into the stall for some fun?\u201d Patty whispers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora giggles and pushes Patty towards the stall, they giggle and Nora kicks the door closed behind her, Patty pulls Nora in for a kiss and locks the door. Nora grabs the bottom of her shirt and pulls it over her head. Patty helps with her pants and undoes the button. It doesn\u2019t take Nora long to wiggle out of her pants. Nora goes to take off her bra and panties but Patty stops her with a kiss. They pull each other in tight and pressed their half naked bodies against each other. Nora reaches behind Patty and undoes her bra. She lets it drop to the floor and Patty does the same with Nora\u2019s bra. Patty breaks the kiss with a smile. She takes a couple of steps back and sits down on the toilet. Patty runs her hands up and down her thighs to tease Nora. Nora giggles and pulls her panties off. She climbs on Patty\u2019s lap and kisses her. Patty wraps her arms around Nora and pulls them together tight. The two of them moan as their bare breasts press against each other. Nora slides a hand down and cups it over Patty's breast. Patty lets out a moan as Nora starts to gently massage it. Patty runs her hands down Nora\u2019s back and gives her ass a good squeeze. Nora lets out a squeal as she is loving this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora starts to grind herself against Patty\u2019s lap, she\u2019s starting to get wet and wants more. Nora feels something strange. It feels like something is inside Patty. Nora isn\u2019t too surprised as she did walk into her masturbating. Nora reaches down towards the thing inside Patty to please her with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait.\u201d Patty gasps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Nora says. \u201cDid I do something wrong? I didn\u2019t hurt you did I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re fine.\u201d Patty smiles as she kisses Nora. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019d prefer to use them on you than me, I\u2019ve had my fun with them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Nora giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow do me a favour and stand in front of me with your eyes closed.\u201d Patty smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora giggles and climbs on Patty with a smile on her face. Nora does as she is told, she closes her eyes and does her best to keep herself still. Nora giggles as she can hear Patty moan as she slides the toy out of her. Patty places her hand on Nora\u2019s thigh and presses the toy against Nora\u2019s pussy. Nora gets a little confused as she can feel a little head and body. Before she can question this Patty pushes it in all of the way causing her to squeal, it starts wiggling and it feels like vibrator. Nora opens her eyes and leans down kissing Patty. Patty giggles and pushes Nora of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on,\u201d Patty giggles. \u201cI\u2019m not done.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have you got left?\u201d Nora moans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d Patty giggles. \u201cTurn around.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora spins around with no hesitation. Patty lets out a moan as she pulls another toy out of her. Patty hears a squeal and it doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s coming from Patty. Nora doesn\u2019t question it this time, she knows what\u2019s coming and she wants it. Patty presses the toy against her ass hole and pushes it inside her. Nora screams as Patty pushes the toy deep inside her. She spins around and grabs Patty\u2019s face and kisses it. Patty giggles and the sudden nature of this. Patty kisses Nora and does her best to kiss back, she\u2019s struggling a bit as Nora moans and squeals. Nora kisses down Patty\u2019s body and gives her breasts a kiss. Patty throws her head back and moans as she can tell where Nora is heading. Patty places her hands on the back of Nora\u2019s head in anticipation. Nora gives Patty\u2019s pussy lips a gentle kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Patty moans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty have never had a woman between her legs before, she is loving Nora\u2019s soft nature. Nora gently kisses Patty again causing her to shiver and moan. Patty lets out a squeal as Nora\u2019s tongue slips her. Patty throws her head back and moans and Nora runs her tongue around a little. Patty rubs the back of Nora\u2019s head and starts to moan her name. Patty feel something strange, Nora\u2019s tongue is vibrating. Patty throws her head back screaming as Nora\u2019s tongue vibrates quite quickly. Patty wants to question this but she\u2019ll do this later, this is incredible. Patty squeals and Nora starts moaning from Patty\u2019s pussy and toys. Both of them squeal and cum at the same time. Nora removes herself form Patty\u2019s crotch with a moan. Patty grabs Nora\u2019s shoulders and pulls her up towards her. Nora sits on Patty\u2019s lap and the two kiss. Patty can feel Nora\u2019s cum drip on her thigh and trickle to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell did you do to me?\u201d Patty giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike it?\u201d Nora smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike it?\u201d Patty smiles. \u201cI fucking loved it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty moans and pulls Nora in for a kiss. The two press their naked wet bodies against each other and hold the embrace. Patty lets out a little moan and giggle as she can feel her pets brush against her thigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can get used to this,\u201d Patty thinks as she kisses Nora.</span></div></div>",

All the two of them do is lock lips and gently kiss each other, they\u2019re not too worried about pleasing each other at the moment, all they want to do is be in each other\u2019s arms. Nora has her arms wrapped around Patty\u2019s neck while Patty has her wrapped around Nora\u2019s waist. The two of them let out a moan every now and then. Patty and Nora stop as they hear the door to the bathroom open and a pair of high heals walk inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNora?\u201d They call out. \u201cAre you in here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora stares into Patty\u2019s eyes and winces, Patty can\u2019t help but let out a little giggle at her reaction. Nora slides her hand over Patty\u2019s mouth as her giggle is kind of loud. Patty does her absolute best to hold back her laughs as Nora is really freaking out. Patty can\u2019t help herself and gives Nora\u2019s ass a little pinch. Nora only just manages to catch her squeal. She shoots Patty a look who instantly regrets what she has done. The woman turns around and heads out of the bathroom. Nora removes her hand from Patty's mouth and the two give each other a terrified look. There is nothing but complete silence. Patty can\u2019t help herself and ends up giggling along with Nora. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you answer?\u201d Patty smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m in the middle of fucking a gorgeous woman, why would I want to?\u201d Nora smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood point.\u201d Patty smiles and gives Nora a gentle kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora cups her hands on the side of Patty\u2019s face as she kisses her. Patty lets out a soft moan and kisses back. Patty can\u2019t help but smile to herself as she feel Caitlin and Kara\u2019s feet kick her thighs. It\u2019s quite delightful. Caitlin and Kara\u2019s feet feel like fingers brushing against her. Nora reaches down and gives Patty\u2019s breasts a good squeeze. Patty lets out a moan and cups her hands over Nora\u2019s ass cheeks and starts fondling them. Patty and Nora moan in sync as they fondle each other\u2019s bodies. Kara and Caitlin wriggle around inside Patty as they desperately try to get out. It\u2019s useless though as Nora\u2019s body is clenched around the two. The two don\u2019t give up but this all back fires. All of this is turning Nora on. Nora lets out a loud moan as the two wiggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are my toys doing?\u201d Patty asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill vibrating.\u201d Nora gasps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want me to make them stop?\u201d Patty asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Nora moans as she sides her tongue inside Patty's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty and Nora wrestle tongues as Kara and Caitlin wriggle around inside Nora. Nora holds Patty close and grinds herself against Patty. Patty lets out a little squeal and Nora\u2019s cum drops onto her thighs. Nora lets out a little squeal and reaches her climax, coating the toys in cum. Patty giggles as Nora removes her lips from Patty\u2019s and starts puffing. She\u2019s covered in sweat and completely exhausted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor someone who has super speed you sure do get tired pretty quickly.\u201d Patty giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve I\u2019m trying not to use my super speed here,\u201d Nora smiles. \u201cWait, how do you know I have super speed? I never told you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s not hard to figure it out.\u201d Patty smirks. \u201cYou vibrated through the door and then you used your super tongue, it\u2019s was easy to piece together.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Nora blushes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Patty smiles as she kisses Nora again. \u201cI understand why you didn\u2019t tell me and it\u2019s probably a good thing you didn\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is that?\u201d Nora asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not particularly fond of metas.\u201d Patty sighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d Nora sighs and goes to climb off but Patty stops her before she has a chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait,\u201d Patty pulls Nora close and kisses her. \u201cBut you proved to me that it\u2019s not all metas that are scum, there are some out there that are kind and quite sexy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora giggles and kisses Patty. Patty smiles and kisses back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to break the mood but I should probably go.\u201d Nora sighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all good,\u201d Patty smiles and kisses Nora. \u201cToday was fun. Maybe do this again sometime?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Nora blushes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora climbs off of Patty and picks up some clothing, she tosses Patty her clothes and throws her on. The two of them giggle as they do and get changed surprisingly quickly. The two of them leave the stall and Patty heads to the sink washing herself up as she is covered in cum and sweat. Nora gives Patty a smile and heads to the door. She reaches for the handle but stops herself, Nora spins around and nervously walks over to Patty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Patty.\u201d Nora smiles shaking a little. \u201cI was wondering if you would like to.. you know, would like to go out with me? On a date?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d love to,\u201d Patty grins and nods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay!\u201d Nora lets out a squeal and gets all giddy. \u201cDo you want to go now? I mean if you\u2019re not doing anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d love to,\u201d Patty blushes. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you had to go somewhere?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Nora says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter too much anyway, I just needed to cheek back in with my Mom and Dad but I\u2019ll just message them later to let them know I\u2019m okay.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a plan,\u201d Patty smiles. \u201cReady to go my lady?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty holds her hand out for Nora with a smile. Nora lets out a squeal and grabs Patty's hand instantly. The two of them head towards the door with Nora giggling and squealing taking about where she wants to take Patty. Patty smiles and pulls Nora in for a kiss to clam her down. Nora lets out a moan as she kisses Patty back, this is the best kiss she\u2019s given her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake a deep breath and calm down,\u201d Patty whispers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Nora giggles. \u201cJust excited that\u2019s all.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t tell.\u201d Patty giggles. \u201cI\u2019ve just got to do one thing before we go.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Nora asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty reaches behind Nora and slides her hand down the back of Nora\u2019s pants and panties. Nora lets out a gasp as Patty\u2019s warm hands travel down her smooth ass. Nora lets out a little squeal and pulls Patty in for a kiss, Patty giggles and kisses back, Nora gets jittery again. Nora lets out a moan as she feels Patty wrap her fingers around the toy in her ass and pulls it out. Patty giggles and takes it out of her pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d Nora giggles. \u201cYou just wanted your toy back, do you want the other one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can hold onto her for now,\u201d Patty smiles. \u201cI\u2019d just like to keep this little one on me if you don\u2019t mind?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d Nora smiles. \u201cNeed help?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d Patty giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora grabs the toy off Patty and opens the waistband to Patty\u2019s pants and waistband with a smile. She lowers the toy inside and presses it against Patty\u2019s pussy. Nora rubs the tip of it against Patty\u2019s lips. Patty lets out a moan, Nora hears a little squeal and scream but doesn\u2019t think too much of it. She puts the toy deep inside Patty causing her to scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFucking hell Nora!\u201d Patty moans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Nora giggle. \u201cReady to go now?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn a second.\u201d Patty giggles as she readjusts herself. \u201cOkay, ready.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty and Nora grab each other\u2019s hands and head out hand in hand excited for their date. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara and Caitlin lay still inside the giant pussies motionless, they have been though a lot in the past hour and are completely exhausted. Kara has had enough time in giant asses for one day and she finds it weird that she actually is enjoying her new surroundings. It\u2019s a lot more cosier than her last spots. Kara had sort of been enjoying herself at times. Not the insertion parts but the tightness around her was kind of pleasurable at times. While Kara was kind of enjoying she\u2019s not enjoying it as much as Caitlin. Caitlin had to admit that she is having a blast, sure she was scared that she was going to drown at times but apart from that it\u2019s been trilling. Tossing between the giant pussys have been incredible. Despite her love she still gets worried about Kara. Caitlin puts a bit of hope in Patty as despite what\u2019s been happening she knows that Patty will look after them. </span></div></div>",

Nora avoids telling Patty that she\u2019s from the future as she can tell she has having a hard enough time wrapping her head around the meta detail. During the walk Nora and Patty are both a little nervous to hold hands. The two of them arrive at Jitters and Patty can\u2019t help but giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI admire you selection Nora.\u201d Patty smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry it\u2019s not somewhere fancy,\u201d Nora says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts alright,\u201d Patty smiles. \u201cAs long as I\u2019m on a date with you I don\u2019t mind where we go.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora blushes and gets giddy. Nora walks to the door and opens it for Patty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter you.\u201d Nora smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Patty smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them walk inside and orders their coffees, Nora realises that she has no money on her and feels really bad. Nora apologies but Patty doesn\u2019t mind too much. The two of them sit down at a table on the other side of the room and talk. Nora has her hand resting on the table and Patty can\u2019t help but rest her hand on hers. Nora blushes and holds Patty\u2019s hand in hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll admit I haven\u2019t been on a date in a while so I apologise for being a bit messy.\u201d Nora says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t even tell,\u201d Patty smiles. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you even asked me out.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we had a bit of fun in the bathroom,\u201d Nora giggles. \u201cI felt like I owed you a date.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you did.\u201d Patty smiles. \u201cTo be honest this the first romantic kind of date I\u2019ve ever had with a girl.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, So you\u2019re not\u2026\u2026?\u201d Nora asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Patty sighs. \u201cBut what I do know is that I\u2019m having a lot of fun and if I am I\u2019m not too worried. Love is just love isn\u2019t it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora smiles and her and Patty continue to flirt and talk with each other. Patty is surprised how much she has in common this this girl and that she\u2019s actually falling for a meta. Patty\u2019s grudge for meta is still there just selected meta. Inside the girl\u2019s pussies Kara and Caitlin had fallen asleep as they are drained form earlier. There\u2019s no much they can do or want to do given what they have been through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty and Nora talk for the next couple of hours, giggling and chatting about all kinds of nonsense. They learn a lot more about each other and Nora is starting to fall for the blonde too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting a bit late,\u201d Patty says checking the time. \u201cI might need to head off if that\u2019s okay.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no problem.\u201d Nora smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want to come back to my place?\u201d Patty asks. \u201cNo one else is home and I don\u2019t have anything on.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Nora blushes. \u201cI\u2019d love too.I\u2019ve just got to go to the bathroom first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake your time.\u201d Patty smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora heads off to the bathroom with a huge grin on her face, this is the luckiest she\u2019s been since she came back in time. Nora uses a toilet in the stall and hears someone walk in, Nora ignores her as she\u2019s not going to bother her. Nora flushes and pulls her pants up but stops in her tracks when she hears the stall to her door open. She had locked it but it sounds like someone was picking it. Nora takes a step back as the door swings open and Patty walks inside with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sorry,\u201d Patty giggles. \u201cI thought you were in trouble.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora and Patty start giggling until Nora pushes Patty against the door. Patty yelps as Nora places one hand on her chest and the other on the side of her face. Nora leans in and kisses Patty, Patty lets out a loud moan as she is loving her kisses. Patty places her hands on Nora\u2019s ass and pulls her close squeezing them. Nora moans and slides her tongue inside Patty\u2019s mouth. Patty gasps and wrestles Noras tongue with hers. The two of them moan loving their session. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about we continue this at my place where we don\u2019t have to be so secretive and privet.\u201d Patty whispers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood idea,\u201d Nora smiles. \u201cI\u2019ll run us over.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know where I live?\u201d Patty giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Nora giggles. \u201cBut we have the time.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no rush.\u201d Patty smiles as she kisses Nora. \u201cI don\u2019t mind slowing down a bit.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d Nora giggles. \u201cBut I really want to have some fun that\u2019s all.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty giggles and runs her hand down Nora\u2019s stomach, she slides her hand underneath her waistbands and grabs Caitlin\u2019s feet. Nora gasps and kisses Patty. Patty starts to use Caitlin to please her, pumping her in and out of Nora\u2019s pussy. Nora throws her head back and moans.

That personal challenge was the reason after one small fruity drink ordered for her by a cute looking guy she felt was punching well about his weight, she went straight for the hard liquor. This meant she formed a slight rhythm of drink dance, drink, dance, she didn't care who or what or whether her partner had a cock or a nice set of tits, anyone who caught her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCase in point being the lovely lady drinking alone at the bar, from the way they eyed her they recognised her from somewhere just no clue where, and Frosty was intrigued so slid into the seat right next to them \"This place seems a little run down for someone like you\" she purrs, getting a clearly unamused expression in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I prefer not to be disturbed\" the replies, causing Frost to chuckle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dance with me\" she orders, surprising the woman<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're dancing, best you is at least try to leave intact tonight\" she whispers in her eats and that shiver of fear, whoever they were did recognise her \"Come on cut loose\" she yells, dragging her into the middle of the club, seeing the shock and joy on their face then she realises despite how much alcohol Frost had knocked back she was still very graceful and flirty, managing to find an opening to build upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>About an hour later</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on with me to my place, we can have a proper good time\" Frost coos, happy her soon to be lover was a giddy drunk as they were the most fun even when kicking them out back when she worked for Amienate, mostly because they were grinning and joking even when being thrown out. Resting her face in the crook of Frosts neck, they were content to follow the ice meta as she let the girl in and both were quick to start stripping one another, coming just shy or ripping them off each other<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were much less peachy for Caitlin though, for one she learnt that Killer Frost did sweat, just that her cryokinetic powers flash froze the water and created a layer of ice on her skin during nights like this. The problem came when it started to affect her, her body pinned rather comfortably through the ice to Frost's toes, which only let her free when they felt her frozen form and gave it a pinch or a squeeze hoping for a response from the little critter in her shoe. And now they were fucking on her bed, damn it Frost!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>The next morning</i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was actually a relief to learn that Frost's powers essentially died when she was unconscious as the moment she fell asleep cupping the breasts of the woman she'd just screwed, with their legs intertwined. With the ice now weaker Caitlin was able to full herself free of the bindings and slip away, the warmth under the covers helping that extremely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a simple plan ,sneak over to her phone, send a message explaining the situation and then let the others deal with Frosty once more. But still there was a woman in her bed she'd never met before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Getting out from under the stifling covers was a train wreck, but finally besides Frost shifting slightly, worrying Cait that she was going to spend the rest of the night crushed under her ass but she mad it to the back of Frost's neck, even now she was curious as to who her double tricked into following her into bed....

He wasn't married to Iris in this world, they tried but she couldn't handle the looks at her toy sized boyfriend so they broke it off, not helped by her casual crushing of him by sitting or standing on him randomly, even once accidentally using him as an insole for 3 days. As for them, they hit it off the moment she walked into his lab, then his heart, they started dating about a month after she joined the CCPD, have been going strong ever since and even moved in together, technically she brought him home in her purse one night and he has stayed ever since. All in all it was a much better world in her eyes than she was in an hour ago, her hatred of metas even simmering, now it was more complaining they were making her adorable meta boyfriend look like a thug, Barry not minding listening to her vent as she tended to cuddle him during these moments, happy to get held against her chest, only a thin blouse between him and boobs bigger than he is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sorry Bare, it's just been a long day\" Patty apologises, running her pinkie through his hair to mess it up and he jumps out of the way, though his smile says it all<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry I didn't help with the paperwork, Singh made it official the moment you joined the lab that I was to never file a report again as he can't read anything I write at this size\" Barry apologies, but Patty just giggles<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey actually do have a nice meal and were just elavign when they get a call stating there was another meta attack they needed to be there for...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Despite his size Barry is still the Flash, so he zips off the moment Patty's eyes leave him, leaving the woman rather annoyed.

Due to his size Barry is basically Patty's assistant out in the field, there for a different perspective literally in some cases.

This is good for stealth, not so much combat, also she has a free ride off any and all female teammate, even the minorly endowed Zari<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3)Same a 2, but it's Sara who ended up shrinking. Nyssa eventually becoming the captain, with Sara being her advisor/pet, not that the blond was in any mood to complain.</span></div></div>",

Why in an attempt to do so they handed it to the Legends is a mystery even Batman can't solve. Sara happily accepted the book and put it where it should most appropriately stay: the library. She also had Gideon create a genetic lock to attach to the front, stopping Mick and Zari (the most likely to use the book for their own ends) from even touching it without receiving a cattle prod to the brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving dealt with the human element, Sara forgot about the mechanical crew member, mostly because she was the ship itself. Gideon smiles from her virtual zone, the self aware AI curious as to whether she could even use it, as while it worked for humans it also clearly took a lot of control, of which she lacked the former and had the latter in cargo holds. Finally as is common on this crew her curiosity lead to her doing something ill advised. Fabricating probes and manipulators she sets up an apparatus so she can open the book and then absorb/direct the energy in ways she decides. With the Book pretty much hooked up to the Core she has a pair of grabbers undo the genetic lock and then open the book proper, the light flooding the room and energy flowing through the wires into Gideon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Gideon absorbs the book itself into her system, giving her absolute control of reality within the Waverider, which was basically her body up to this point and now is so much more. Summoning an avatar through which to interact she leaves the library and sets off in search of her crew, her little playmates inside her domain.<br>\r\n2) Her desire to be physical/have a real body is fulfilled in a round about way, as she steps out of the books pages... 6 inches tall and naked. Looks like she's going to need a little help getting things fixed, maybe Zari, she knows how to keep a secret and likes tinkering with things as well as loopholes, which should help her keep her human form while also making it the size of a normal human</span></div></div>",

Even with Oliver now out of prison there was a lot of crap that needed doing and she was unfortunately not the kind of person to just ignore the world burning around her... anymore that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer newer sense of awareness was why she noticed the very old and very strange looking book sitting on her desk, not having any idea why anyone would leave something like that for her, especially with as said before Oliver having been behind bars until very recently and her dad dead, so her suspicions were peaking. Frowning and considering the possible reasons for such an object to wind up in her possession, Thea decides to do what she did best, blinding charging in. With that she picks up the book and immediately a booming voice in her head is heard<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I've travelled far to this place and time to lay this precious burden at your feet. Use this book to reshape the world as you see fit. Show them what a real god can do\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that hurt and was weird\" Thea complains to herself, while trying to process what she'd just learnt. Someone/something had left her a gift: a book which could apparently rewrite reality itself. They really had no idea who they were fucking with did they? Giggling slightly evilly Thea sits herself down on the bed and wonders what she could change, how to make things better for her family?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens the book and lets the light/power flow into her, but what happens to the world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) None of the Arrow stuff happened in Thea's new world, no Undertaking and no sinking of the Queen's Gambit, as she knows everything else is tied back to those 2 moments in one way or the other. The side effect is that Oliver was born small and currently lives at exactly 5 inches tall, which means that for the last 6 or so years she's been his guardian/keeper, though she's had that role since she was young and enjoyed messing around with her big little brother in the ways expected of bratty rich kids.<br>\r\n2) She erases their mother's death, but oddly enough the domino effect is her own size. Malcolm had things done to him when he was still part of the league, they didn't seem to work on him, but were passed onto his daughter, when time catches up with itself Thea is 50ft tall, and boy is she looking forward to having fun with HER city.</span></div></div>",

It lead to the first of 2 simple changes she had the book to for her, that being making her a giantess, peeking at about 50ft tall, able to be altered mentally (she wanted to be able to sneak when needed, and giantess are rarely able to do so). the 2nd was for Chase to be on the island with her once more, not for any sentimental reasons but simple because with these new powers her plans also changed and as such she wanted to ensure he didn't get in her way the most direct way she knew, eliminating him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watches the tiny man look around in confusion, amusing herself before reaching down and grabs him to lift to face height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back already, did you miss me that much?\" Talia teases, deciding if she was going to be a giantess she might as well enjoy herself, not just with Oliver but all her victims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase stares for a moment before yelling \"Talia? What the... how are you this huge? Why didn't you bring this up before it would make killing Queen so much easier\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia chuckles \"True my dear it will, but gaining this size advantage has also made me realise something that is important to both of us, I don't need you anymore\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-what, you need me, how are we going to capture Queen with you like this?\" he asks, trying to get out of what he knew would soon be a sticky situation<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, I have my ways\" she smiles before clenching her fist, enjoying his screams of pain as well as both the sound and feel of bones breaking. She then opens her hand to let him drop to the ground, groaning weekly a moment later. As an assassin she knew exactly what it took to kill someone, and as such knew how far she could go and have the target remain alive, Chase would never recover from the amount of damage she just did but he'd live... not so much after she raised her foot, her boot hovering over his immobile form. She thought she heard something akin to a plea for mercy, but it was quickly drowned out due to the crunch as his body exploded under her boot. Grinding her foot into the ground to make her former partner unrecognisable she then shrunk herself to a more reasonable 7ft (liking the idea of still being taller than almost everyone), wiping her boot off a nearby rock before signalling her own followers  who brought the boat to the island and headed for China where she would then be taking a plane to Star City. Look out Oliver Talia Al Ghul is back and more powerful than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) She baits a trap for Oliver on the outskirts of the city, somewhere she can have some fun with Oliver, with little chance of being uncovered<br>\r\n2) She decides to fuck subtlety thanks to her powers and walks through the city at full size, catching the attention of everyone and either killing or capturing every member of Team Arrow she comes across rather easily<br>\r\n3) Similar to option 2, except when they see a giantess rampaging through the city Oliver decides they can't deal with this alone, so calls for help from Team Flash, the Legends and even Supergirl, in the hopes they can all deal with the threat</span></div></div>",

I don't want to be arrogant, be he and i are the most powerfull guys of our team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver wanted so much to get into the fight with them, but he couldn't do anything and had to admit that himself needed some protections right now. \"Ok guys, just be carefull, the legends will soon come to help you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone nods and left the HQ to Star City and meets the giant woman who was now holding a cop in her hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Tell me where's Oliver Queen, and i'll get rid of him.

It lands on the ground, and Sara, Ray and the other left the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" hmmm...Ta-er al-Asfer ? \" Talia can recognize a former member from the league. A betrayor.

This is an order now go\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was going on Talia notices something odd out the corner of her eye, looking up she saw a red streak heading in her direction, while something shot through the air faster than any manmade object 'Hmm, so these jokers aren't the only reinforcements Oliver sent for, too bad they're worthless against me' she smirks as just before the duo reach her she uses the book's power to vanish them in a poof of blue smoke, reappearing tiny and powerless back in the Arrow Cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara was more than happy to point out Talia dispatching Barry and Kara with a hand gesture, as reason for them to retreat, and it worked. As the legends left Sara felt soft fingers wrap around her body, rising up to a rather large bosom, even before it's owner grew to 50ft tall 'Damn, she might be bigger than Nyssa, only slightly but still' Sara thought, her brain getting smutty now the danger was technically past<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have plenty of time to get acquainted later, for now I have one more person to acquire\" Talia purrs then grins, moving the book to her stomach<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You said...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing of value, but that's beside the point, there is nothing else in this city that appeals to me, so we'll be going now\" she opens the book, it's light messing with the shadows on her face before it fades as she absorbs the book into herself, giving her instant access to the artefact's power, as well as ensuring it can't be stolen from her. With that in mind, she teleports to her next location, finding her sister curled up in bed in a pretty nondescript house, clearly dissolving the League wasn't doing her nay good in the long run. Once more a reasonable size she was swift and quiet as she moves to Nyssa's bed and straddles the sleeping woman, pinning her arms with one hand as she watches recognition form in sleep idled eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talia?\" she whispers, to which the elder smiles<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Nyssa, it's been so long, I even got you a present\" she coos, dropping the now tiny Sara beside her head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beloved!\" Nyssa gasps, the blond running up to her, cuddling her cheek and kissing it repeatedly, despite everything happy to be reunited once more. Then the former assassin's blood ran cold \"I know you are angry with me sister, but please let Sara go she has nothing to do with this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\" Talia hums \"But she's so cute, I can see why you fell for her, I bet she tastes so sinful. Not that it matters\" Talia smirks before grabbing Nyssa's head, leaning down and running her tongue up the side of her face, overshadowing any trace of Sara under her saliva \"I have plans for you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinning Sara down with a finger Talia's eyes begin to glow, but what happens? [Note in all scenarios the League is intact and Talia is in charge, Malcolm never was, it went straight from Ra's to Talia]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) As a mix of fun and punishment Talia makes both of them her shrunken servents, never allowed off her body unless she allows it, but as she is a benevolent mistress they are considered partners and when they do a good job that day they can sleep together in her cleavage or ass, if not Nyssa spends the night under her toes, while Sara is shoved head first into her pussy.<br>\r\n2) Talia decides to start her punishment by doing the one thing Nyssa never did: Make Sara her bride, she then rewrites her memories so every moment spent with Nyssa is now with Talia. Finally she shrinks Nyssa and makes it that she was their slave, unbreakable due to rough treatment , accidentally being stepped or sat on and Sara's frequent use of her as a sex toy, with Nyssa cursed to remember how things were as well as are.<br>\r\n3) Given their loyalty to each other Talia makes a slight edit to history: Nyssa and Talia grew up close, like proper siblings, and later when they fell for the same woman agreed to share her, with some occasional pleasure of one another. With that dealt with she decides the new trio should have some fun bonding together, so leads them to a model city she summoned, with Sara's former friends and allies shrunken and powerless for them to enjoy.</span></div></div>",

The book was strange, too old to date and gave off an energy signature that hinted at a very strong power source, but was completely unrecognisable to human technology, also there was a complex locking mechanism sealing it shut that despite the efforts of several teams still remained attached to the book and keeping it sealed.. As Lena entered her hidden basement lab, she was glad neither Supergirl of the DEO were aware of the book's existence, mostly because of the headache it would most likely cause for her before they take it off her hands 'for her own good' or whatever bullshit excuse they give her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the scientists in charge of trying to open the lock keeping the book sealed had jokingly theorised the device was waiting for someone worthy to find it before it could be opened and whatever power it held could be unleashed, something Lena thought of as really stupid.... until she rested her hand on the locking mechanism and the thing clicked open and fell off the front of the book <i>'Well shit'</i> Lena thinks as she lifts the book 'I guess Anderson was right after all' she then opens the book and her eyes were open for the first time......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe understands, this artefact, known in most worlds as the<u><b> Book of Destiny</b></u>, could shape reality to the users preference with simply a thought. Lena may think big with her goals, curing cancer being her most well known one, but she also knew fucking with reality tended to go badly so completely warping the world was not a good plan. Still she was tempted to do one thing, something she hoped would make her life a little better in the long run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"I want to get out of the shadow of the Luthor name\"</b></i> she willed into the book, which pulsed and rippled before following through with the vague command<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did she do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) In this world the Luthors aren't Evil (Lillian's still a c**t because Lena can't imagine her any other way) Lex is even accepting of Law Abiding Aliens and is still best friends with Clark after sharing his secret with him and Lois back when they were in their teens. Lena isn't CEO anymore, instead Head of R&amp;D for LexCorp where she is much happier. Also one night when her and Lex were stargazing what they thought was a meteor hit near their house and Lena discovered a tiny pod with a girl inside, who she made friends with and later became her tiny lover: Kara Zor-El. The only snag for Lena is Kara's mind wasn't as affected by the Book as you would expect( having just arrived from Earth 1 as the rewriting took hold) so while she won't be freaking out about her size, it's still Supergirl Kara in the body of Lena's girlfriend and jokingly called sex slave Kara Astra Ze-Luthor. Whoops<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Lena never had to deal with the Luthor name because she was never adopted by the Luthors. Lena was one of a rare number of individuals who were born and inch tall and grew to a max of 4 inches in height, and would have basically lived the life of the borrowers if she hadn't been discovered by Kara soon after arriving on earth. Now in National City she was seen by most as an exotic pet of her owner Kara Danvers (and as more a toy to some, given the offers from Maggie and Alex to take her out for some<b> fun</b>), except by Kara herself, who still saw the Irish ravenette as her best (and oldest) friend. The blond becoming a literal Goddess to her in size really didn't help quell the crush she had been developing on Supergirl, but oh well.</span></div></div>",

Maybe it was the imprisoning her under radioactive bars, or she just didn't hold it against Sam but Lena seemed content to pretend all was good and Reign was something completely unrelated to her, something Sam wishes she could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she went to grab her things and head home to Ruby she notices something odd about the contents of her desk, mainly the old style book sitting where he laptop had been 5 minutes ago before she packed it away. On it's cover, in a flowing script was the title: Book of Destiny. Curious Sam goes to pick it up, hearing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'This book is  the key to unlocking your potential Samantha, use it wisely, and become the God this world deserves'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam releases the book in shock, only now feeling the power leaking even from the sealed state of the artefact. A part of her wanted to leave the book alone or bring it to Lena (she knew the girl barely slept, so was probably still working away in her office), but another part was intrigued by the possibility<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Reign had been separated from her and killed by Supergirl (Sam even saw her do it and Reign fall into ash) Lena explained that due them being one and the same until recently and now being aware of it Reign would be the voice and the face of her darker thoughts, the woman may be gone, but the echo would always be the Devil on her shoulder. It was that voice that whispered sweetly in her ear, reminding her of the power she once held, how she could use it to help people, keep Ruby safe. But it also brought the idea of punishing Kara, because evil or not Reign was part of Sam, and the girl of steel deserves to suffer for killing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a goal in mind Sam opened the book, bathed in it's blue glow as the energy wave passes through National City in seconds, changing how things ran just as quickly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Next Day</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was glad the book gave her the knowledge to go with the powers, as what she was doing right now would be a problem otherwise. Currently dressed in the expected outfit on the Supers, Sam was dealing with some alien bank robbers, walking through them while also testing she had all the expected powers: Strength, speed, flight, heat vision and freeze breath. There was one more though, which she wanted and the book gave to her, size manipulation, one she used on the leader of this ground after taking out the rest of her crew, shrinking her down to bug size before threatening to crush her under her boot, no surprise she surrendered almost immediately after her boot became the sky. Sam grew the woman back before knocking her out, leaving them all to the DEO as they weren't her problem any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was glad for the new ability, as all the others had been powers Reign used so it was something wholly her own. She also had the book remove her vulnerability to Kryptonite, though she was in no hurry to see if it worked or if it was beyond even the Book's power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Somewhere else</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara groans as she comes to, feeling like she'd been brought on a 2 day bender with Mon-El, which just made her more angry when she found herself unable to move. The semi darkness was good for Kara's not a hangover, but was bad for someone trying to move around in, so when Kara finally does get around to wriggling herself mostly free she is shocked when she sees the source of her troubles: A bear. Her cloak had been caught under a toy bear and as that though flashes through Kara's mind so does another, she'd been shrunk (the idea of there beign giants around did cross her mind but she dismissed it as giants aren't known for stealth. Looking around she sees that she appears to be in some kind of toy box, if the teddy, dolls and other plush toys were any indication. All the light in the room was caused by a key hole in the wall, which after unlatching her cape to prevent more catching Kara manoeuvres another of the toys so she could see out of. What she saw made her blood run cold, she knew who's room this was, she'd been there before, she was in a toy box, in Ruby's Arias bedroom. It was then she felt tremors, someone was coming her way... but who?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Sam: Here to check that the book did exactly what she asked it to, powerful Supergirl, now a doll for her daughter<br>\r\n2) Ruby: Aware of her doll's living status, she has fun with the one friend who can never leave her<br>\r\n3) Lena/Alex: Babysitting Ruby, can Kara get help from her best friend or sister, or will they see her as a special part of Ruby's doll collection?</span></div></div>",

But yes, we have a problem I can't deal with alone. Her name is Reign, she's a Kryptonian like me, or at least that's what she seemed to be when we first fought her. She's a lot stronger than me, in fact she was the person to do the most damage ever in my time as Supergirl, not even throwing Fort Rozz into space did a number on me like she did, I was in a coma for 2 months. She also gets her power from another source, as she was able to still have all hers despite being under a Blue Sun (Fun fact: Blue suns actually strengthen Kryptonians, and no forms of light kill a specific sex of any species. It was just CW being political assholes) and kryptonite just barely irritates her, even a levels that would kill me outright' at this Kara tenses and looks at her boots 'I actually got into a fight with a good friend of mine, she managed to synthesize kryptonite at a strength that caused her pain, and I lashed out because as I said, if it hurts Reign it is nearly instantly toxic to me'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyla hums 'So is there anything else that should be able to harm your kind, or whatever she is?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Magic basically renders our invulnerability mute but they're pretty sure magic is how Reign and the other Worldkillers were created, luckily they were easier to deal with, so it's back to just Reign making our lives difficult' Kara continues 'I thought, given we were able to fend off Overgirl, well mostly me but there were other issues besides her to deal with, I thought that if everyone was focused on her we could take her down.

My powers seems to mess with me but at last i still feel invulnerable, which explain why i didn't feel anything. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I think this answer the question. You'll come in my hand, since you can't really fly \" Lyla concluded before taking the tiny girl of steel in her fist, and stood up to her full height. \" I just need to call the babysitter for watching over John, since i don't know when my husband will come back\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara nodded, frustrated to be held like that, but there were more important things to solve for now, so it was time to forget her pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Lyla was ready to go, she placed the tiny girl of steel inside her bra, wich embarrassed Supergirl as she wasn't even warned. The babysitter came quickly, greeted Lyla who left as soon as she arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took several long minutes for Kara before they arrive at the Argus, Lyla heading directly to the lab where she picked up Kara from her bra and placed her on the desk. \" Ok now i need to check your body, please lay down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara didn't like that, but obeyed, allowing Lyla to take a blood sample, but it failed. Kara's body was invulnerable after all, so the sting couldn't go throught her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh yeah i forgot it \" Kara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hmmm...i thought that since your powers don't work correctly, there was a chance for me to take your blood. But it seems your passive powers are fine. It's just your active powers that you can't use \" Lyla explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Great...really great ! \" Kara felt not only too small, but also helpless now. But she focused on Lyla's intentions to find out the problem with her size. \" Hey why don't you take my device. Cisco gave it to me, maybe the problem comes from there. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" it's...too small for me study. But, there's a possiblity that your Earth and mine have differents scale. And that maybe, the last times you came on my Earth there were something to make you bigger, so we didn't see the problem.\" Lyla said, uncertain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hmmm...i don't like how it sounds, i would rather to not believe it \" Kara replied almost angry. She was the most powerfull girl in her earth, and didn't want to believe she was helpless in Barry's earth. But maybe, someone else could tell it, and find a way to fix her problem with Reign on the way.</span></div></div>",

Luckily biology is, and I brought the red sun lamps to allow me to do so' her smile resembled something more at home on Killer Frost than Caitlin Snow as she pulled out and turned on the red lamp, Kara already beginning to regret coming here looking for help, She did at least feel safer in Dr. Snow's hand than say a child or teen's hands, she knew what they did thinking about her, as well as to dolls of her on her earth, she didn't need to see what they would do with a mostly powerless (and in the red light, getting steadily more powerless) tiny Supergirl<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red lamp made it possible for Caitlin to draw the tiniest amount of blood, as well as give Kara the equivalent of a CT scan, highly amused by the results 'I know Barry said you guys were solar powered but your cells act more like a plant's than I expected, absorbing unimaginable levels of solar energy and using it to augment themselves.

Do you think you can fix the problem ? I mean, removing Reign once and for all from Sam's body ?\" Kara requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hmmm i'll need to make a lot of studies, it might take time mostly because i don't know anything about your aliens's body, and she's different than you, so...it's gonna be difficult, i can't promise anything but i'll try.\" Caitlin said honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara nodded. \" All right, i hope you'll find something. By the way, why are we here ? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh, Lyla thought she was not the best one to help you, so i told her i could take care of your problem by myself. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I see...Well thanks again, i'm going back home to tell the news to my friend and i'll be back later to check if you find something \" Kara said...</span></div></div>",

Caitlin looks at the tiny device in her hand... before crushing it between her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven given her containment, Reign still smirks at Kara's look of shock and horror just before she is also captured by a red solar energy infused prison. 'But, what are you doing. We're friends, I've helped save you earth twice even. Why?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin grins and her eyes flash for a second (Hi frosty... oh not coming out, okay bye frosty) 'When I saw that tiny cutie that was once the invincible Supergirl I knew I had to make you mine, and that coincided perfectly with Lyla's thoughts.

Then what?' she asks torn between hoping Caitlin had a plan, and her coming to her senses and set her free'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin rolls her eyes 'Of course I know that, it's why I had her sign an agreement after letting Laurel and Lena look it over. She can't touch me as long as I do my job and that means you stay as my plaything till I die, or you die, not sure which comes first. Reign is a bonus in all honesty'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'There's a Lena on this earth? Also I thought Laurel was dead?' Kara asks in confusion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, Frosty actually gets along with some of our villains, there's a monthly poker game and everything. As for Lena, it's not her real name but the one she currently uses. I just do so because calling her Morgan Le Fay sounds silly. Anyway, they made sure all bases were covered and Lena even got her to sign in blood to ensure this doesn't bite me in the ass. Now all I need to do is keep you out of sight from the others and I'm home free. Her... well she'll have to stay here for the moment until I'm done experimenting on her, afterwards she'll <i><b>tragically pass</b></i> and join you at home as toy No.2' at this even Reign shivers, really not liking how far ahead the Doc was planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow to figure out Snow's first move...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) She promised Kara she'd deal with the World killer problem so begins examining and experimenting on Reign, hoping she can separate her from Sam, as it would mean a new toy, plus she had a feeling Reign and Frosty would be good friends, she might as well give her other half someone to hang out with after all. She might even be able to use whatever splits Reign and Sam on herself, allowing Frost to be her own person and the 2 can finally interact with one another.<br>\r\n2) She can't restrain herself any longer and decides to have some fun with her little pet, the radiation should have been adsorbed enough Kara won't be able to really fight back at all.</span></div></div>",

But William didn't show the same enthousiam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well, in fact, i wanted you to come to check something with me \" William replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Something more important than homework ?

It's frustrating don't you think ? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Maybe..but they also told us about their 'mission'. I'm worried for my dad as much as you are for Felicity, but what do you have in your hand ? \" Zoek asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" i don't know exactly and that's why i wanted you to come today. I don't want to hide anything from you, just like our parents does. I just know that felicity told me it's the most important thing she has if she needs backup. So, i wanted to try it with you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe device in William's hand looked like a small remote. And thought that Zoe was worried about what can happen by activating it, she took a step to william and too his free hand in hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Let's do it then.\" She said before the boy pushed on the button. A breach then appeared in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Whaaaat is thaaaat...?!\" Zoe asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I don't know. But i think we should jump in, it's like a portal or something ! \" William replied. \" Are you with me ? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yes \" The girl replied.

And how ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" William we need to go back ! \" Zoe suddenly begged uncertain of the situation, but it was scary. But William was still watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" not now...i need to know \" he just replied. He started to walk forward, leaving Zoe, too curious to know what was \"Felicity's secret' . But suddenly a door opened, revealing a giant girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Mom ? i'm home ! \" The giantess said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe then ran to William. \" Let's go back ! We're in a world of giant or something, who know what can happen to us ?! please let's go back ! \" she begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam finally realized the situation. \" you're right, let's go back ! \" he replied, ready to activate the device again when the giantess spotted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh my...What's the hell are you ? \" Ruby said, she was not scared or something, in fact she almost looked happy to find some tiny 'living doll' in the living room. She quickly caught them both in one hand, and raised them to her giant face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" you...are real tiny people ? What are you doing here ? \" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the two kids were held too tight, and were too scared, they couldn't do anything more but scream at the pain they had to endure in Ruby's fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" My name's Ruby. \" She said, releasing her grip to let them breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happen now ?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lena was glad the shrink gun's power took a minute or 2 to fully take hold of the target, as that way she had time to shrink them all rather than zap one and set the others on edge. When she fired under the table the 2 kryptonians didn't notice anything but she saw Alex flinch and rub her leg when she was struck<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything okay Alex?\" Lena asks, looking concerned but holding in a smile when she sees Kara's glasses sliding further down her nose than usual<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good\" the red head waves off \"Think it was just a bug\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well as long as it's not bad enough to ruin girls night I say just ignore it till tomorrow\" Sam suggests, shrugging and not noticing her dress slide off her shoulder<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad everyone liked the food, it took a lot of work to make\" Kara says before standing up and moving for the fridge<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the effects start to become more noticeable Lena schools her features of her more genuine emotions (mostly amusement and arousal) and forms a mask of surprise and confusion \"Sam\" she hisses, waving her hands in the woman's general direction in hopes she'll notice something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette raises an eyebrow before looking down and both disappear into her hair: the dress which previous hugged her luscious curves now pooled around her as if she were Ruby playing dress up a couple years back \"Holy shit what's happening to me?\" she shrieks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sammy\" Alex shouts before falling off her chair as she tries to get to the other woman, her body already too small to properly manoeuvre in the clothes she'd been wearing tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena clicks her tongue as she allows things to continue along this course, wondering if she should help the girls or begin her retrieval with her first friend, who she actually hasn't heard any reaction from since shooting her. In the end she sighs lightly and moves, walking over and removing Alex from her shirt, then over to Sam's chair to save her from her dress, not even trying to hide her amusement at having to free the girl from her own thong after slipping her hand up the dress. Flicking the bright red strip of fabric onto the floor she then places both shrunken nude women on the table and went to find Kara, the crumbled pile of clothing was easy, What was harder was finding the Supergirl costume within the pile (and she's been pressed against the material enough times due to being Supergirl's Lois Lane to recognise it as the genuine article rather than some kind of Supergirl merch) as well as the feelings of guilt, betrayal and a little self loathing at having been fooled by something so simple. Luckily those feelings were able to be suppressed once her long fingers found Kara's tiny body, her previously massive bosom feeling divine against her skin, forming around her thumb like memory foam as the alien blond is brought to the Irish CEO's eye line<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lena. I'm so....\" Lena silences her with a finger pressed gently to her face, a clear 'later' implied in the gesture as she walks back to the table, idly wondering if Alex would even move if she tried using her breasts to crush the still green lesbian, but settled for sitting down in Kara's chair and placing the blond between the red head and the brunette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this is weird\" Lena says before Sam does, the girl pouts while Alex frowns, clearly suspicious of the only full sized woman in the room<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clearly we shrunk, but why didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena shrugs \"No idea, we'd need to know WHAT shrunk you to even start figuring out how you all shrunk to 4 inches tall and I didn't\" she argues, seeing nods from 2 of them and a reluctant agreement from Alex and so smiles, this was easier than she thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Lena suggests they continue on for the night, like Sam said they can't let anything ruin girls night. Especially when Kara made a cake, with lots of fristing and a gooey chocolate centre. It would be a shame to waste the chance.<br>\r\n2)Lena takes them to her lab to run tests and try reverse whatever happened. This gives her the chance to get some good will and trust as well as take as long as she wishes, as nobody else knows the specifics of their shrining<br>\r\n3) Lena plans to take the 3 girls to her secret lab/sex dungeon, managing to hold in a clearly evil smile until Kara was carefully and safely secured in her bra, hen grins down at the 2 left, wondering if they should be temporary insoles, or stick them together nestled in her ass. Decisions, decisions.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One problem with Lena's plan was that due to her shrink gun being a prototype while she knew it worked she wasn't aware of any potential flaws in the design or side effects/defects, in this case the power source/ shrinking material being unstable. This probably wouldn't have meant much except she WAS aware the device needed a minute to power up (which would have made it a dawdle for a trained agent like Alex, or say Supergirl, to disarm her), so she had it activated but with what could best be described as the safety's on when she strapped it to her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the meal the containment chamber cracked, a slight purple glow hidden by her long black dress. As the device continued to fall apart Lena began to twitch and develop a migraine, Kara noticing and trying to comfort her but she just waved her off as it being a long day and she was sure the evening would make it worth while. The blond smiles tensely, obviously unsatisfied but still lets it go, returning to her own food that was about 3 times what everyone else was eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena's problems reached their climax when Kara went to get desert, the shrink gun having broken and contaminated Lena enough the core was actually affecting her: purple veins, not too dissimilar to kryptonite poisoning on Supergirl appeared on the visible skin of her body, Sam being the first to notice though it wasn't until her body seized up that Alex and Lena herself noticed, a momentary purple tint filled her vision just before the world began to expand around her and Lena's mind screamed <i>'No! this wasn't supposed to happen!'</i>. She supposed it was a good thing her clothes were affected too, not wanting to be seen naked in front of her two best friends... and Kara's disapproving big sister, the only exception being her shoes, simply because she'd already slipped out of them before hand, heels were never something she was particularly happy to wear, they were just part of the formal ensemble. When the effects finally stopped Lena guessed she was about the size of a small doll, something she was sure she would have enjoyed having the other 3 women be previously, but now she was shrunk and at their mercy, she felt panic enter her bones<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Lena' Kara yelps, picking up her friend and cradling her to her chest 'Are you okay, did something happen? This is my first time making a full meal, did I cause this? I didn't do anything special, all earth grown, human consumable food, I don't understand' Lena smiled a little at her friend's ramble but knew she was going to have to come up with something other than 'I planned to shrink you and the device shrunk me instead' a small part of her glad the broken device had been crushed between her thighs just before she'd regained full motor control. It was one of these days when being a Luthor (and therefore almost universally hated) came in handy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I was attacked this morning' she admits, Kara and Sam gasp while Alex looks worried 'He threw something at me, no idea what it was and it cut me. I...I shot him, the police took away the body and I thought everything was fine, I thought nothing of it... well until I became CEO Barbie' Lena grumbles into Kara's perky chest, she had told the truth, she had been attacked except she hadn't let it get far enough for him to attack her, he'd monologue like a lot of idiots did, about how Lilian sent him because Lena was being too friendly with aliens how she was ruining all the hard work she'd been doing since Cadmus was created as the army's alien research division. It was long and boring and Lena couldn't be arsed caring what the mad bat had to say, so she shot him in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't worry Lena, we'll fix this' Kara promises<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And until then, at least you do well as CEO Barbie' Sam teases getting an unseen eye roll from the shrunken Irish ravenette<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Kara wants to find out what was wrong with Lena as soon as possible, Alex suggests bringing her to the DEO but Sam argues for L Corp, mostly because besides Kara the DEO would rather Lena be dead in a ditch than be helpful to the youngest Luthor<br>\r\n2) Seeing as she was safest with them they decide to continue girl's night, planning to find out what happened in the morning. Kara has lots of fun planned for the evening, and she's sure she can alter them to include Lena new condition, as well as give all 3 normal sized women the chance to take advantage of Lena's reduced size</span></div></div>",

It was not how she expected the end of the evening, but what is done is done, and the small woman had to deal with it. On the otherside, as Kara talked to Alex and Sam about what to do, Lena noticed that both Alex and Sam were drunk, Sam more than Alex, but still she would rather Kara to keep her close to her for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Fine ! we'll wait tomorrow, is that ok for you Lena ? \" Kara said, and the three giants girl looked at the diminutive Luthor, waiting for her answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I guess it's ok...\" Lena replied, not convinced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Ok, huh...i know this can be weird, but i've prepared some ice creams...and i don't want to let a shrinking situation waste the best moment of the dinner, right guys ? \" Kara said and everyone nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I'm going to take care of Lena while you bring the dessert \" Alex offered and Kara gave the \"doll\" to her sis before going to the kitchen.<br>\r\nAlex brought Lena to her face, while taking a sip of wine with her other hand. \" How do you feel with your new perspective ? \" she teasingly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" that's kinda embarrassing...and confusing. But i guess it could be worst...\" Lena said thinking about things would be if she was naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam get closer and touched Lena's small breast with a finger. \" You look really cute like this you know ? \"  She then adressed to Alex ignoring Lena's worried reaction : \" Can i hold her ? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Sure \" Alex handed Lena to Sam, not asking the small woman's permission of course. Sam then sat on the chair near the table and looked at her boss with excitement...and a high dose of alcohol in her eyes from what Lena could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Sam...are you all right ? \" she asked more worried than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yeah...i was just wondering if you can imagine the things you could do with your size...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena blushed, knowing exactly what she meant only by the tone in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" huh...not really in fact \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Let me show you...\" Sam delicately placed Lena between her thigh, trapping her boss by two gigantics wall of flesh and muscles, giving Lena a view of her panties hidden under her skirt right in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam...what are you doing, let me go ! \" Lena panicked in a futil attempt to struggle. \" Alex says something ! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was looking at Sam messing with Lena, and didn't know if she should stop Sam or not. After all, she was not hurting her, Sam was just drunk and took advantage of her boss's size. Who wouldn't ? Beside, Alex herself would like to play with a shrunken woman as small and beautiful as Lena if she had the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" All right ! Ice cream time ! \" Kara said with joy. \" I guess Lena won't eat too much \" she said causing the girls to laugh.</span></div></div>",

Lena yells when Sam withdraws<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You had ice cream in your cleavage, did you want it to get all warm and sticky?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena sighs 'No, but it's warm and sticky anyway now because you slobbered all over me'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex grins widely 'Hey Sammy, pass me your spoon' Sam catches the grin and Lena changes hands between Arias and Danvers once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Alex, don't you dare' Lena scolds but the agent just rolls her eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Calm down Lena, I won't dip you headfirst into my ice cream' Alex promises and Lena smiles... right until her teeth are on the verge of chattering due to finding herself up to her hips in ice cream 'Didn't say you weren't going in though' the elder Danvers sister laughs before pulling her out and letting Lena's shapely legs part as they enter her mouth. Alex moans as she slurps ice cream off Lena's lower body, her tongue failing to penetrate her underwear and give her access to her ass or pussy, but the rough handling (tonguing?) of her nether's still aroused Lena, to the extent Alex still got her first taste of Luthor juice. When she finally removed her from her mouth with a wet pop Alex was grinning like a loon 'You liked it, you get off on this Luthor. It gets you hot for 3 sexy ladies to have you at there mercy, they can do anything they want to your sexy little body' Alex purrs, licking Lena across the face 'And you taste so good'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam nods 'I know right? Hey Kara should get a turn, she is Lena's best friend after all' she teases, not as bitter as she could be that she'd been usurped to that title.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, I'm fine' Kara mumbles, trying to get through the awkwardness, while also not wanting to have the chance to do anything to Lena, unsure how her body and mind would respond to the opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Come on Kara, I'll be fun, see?' Alex yanks the bowl from under the kryptonian's nose and drops Lena in, using the blonde's actual spoon to cover the ravenette in the now more gloopy ice cream before pushing it back 'She's absolutely covered in it now, can't you clean her up Kara?' she pouts, Sam joining in with a puppy dog pout<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara looks down into Lena's wide eyes, staring out of her desert 'Lena IS my desert' a voice in her head whispers, Kara biting her lip trying to supress it before deciding screw it, picking up Lena and putting her entire body into her mouth. If Alex had been sober the sounds coming out of her little sister's mouth would have her running for the hills, Kara's eye's nearly rolled back in their sockets as she tosses Lena around in her mouth, her alien strength extending to her tongue as it easily tears apart both Lena's dress and undergarments, and it's strong vibrations deeply massaging all Lena's tender regions when she wasn't being tossed up against teeth hard as diamonds. After a few minutes Kara finally swallows before freeing Lena from her mouth, having to resist the urge to let her drop either into her cleavage to keep playing or the bowl to go another round and repeat the process all over again, Lena was now her new favourite flavour anything, if they could make a Lena flavour pot sticker she'd live on nothing but that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena herself was exhausted, uncomfortable and oddly satisfied, she really did need the release Kara gave her a lot more than she'd be willing to admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)Kara decides she want to keep Lena for her self, thought out loud it's to stop the <i>'drunken idiots' </i>from hurting her. Len is all for it as the still sober Kara is definitely her favourite person right now, and the other 2 smirk and roll their eyes.<br>\r\n2) The 3 girls turn the game night into a competition, Lena against her will finding herself being offered up as the prize for the winner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

'I think that's enough for now Sammy' she coos, running hand along Sam's inner thigh before picking up Lena and bringing her up to her face, the brunette pouts slightly but the alcohol clearly making her more open as she blushes a deep red from the warmth Alex's hands on her caused within her core. That and Kara managed to distract her with ice cream<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Hey Lena, you know how you normally drink like a fish?' Alex asks with a slight leer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Um, yes' Lena replies, aware of her habit of going through whiskey bottles like Kara goes through cake (not that she feels ashamed, Cat Grant is apparently just as bad) but unsure of the reason of the question, though she does know it can't be good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well I think the change in size shouldn't mean you have to miss out on your drinking' Alex grins and Lena yelps as she was dropped into Alex's half filled wine glass. The shrunken woman was at least glad she had no chances of drowning or even having to swim, mostly due to the shape of Alex's glass as well as her own size, instead starfished oddly along the bottom of the glass, covered in wine. Alex smirks down at her before swirling the glass, letting the drink cover every inch of the woman stuck in her glass. Lena then just barely suppresses a scream when Alex lifts the glass and drains it, her mind trying to placate her that regardless of her size, or Alex have a gag reflex or not (Spoiler: I don't care, if someone wants Alex to eat Lena they can decide for themselves) she was in no danger of being eaten by the DEO agent, her lips only parting enough to allow the liquid to flow from the glass into her mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Alex' Kara warns, clearly unhappy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So what was it like?' Sam asks, eye flicking between Lena and Alex's lips<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Actually rather nice, she adds a special something to the taste. Hell I bet Kara would drink wine with a Lena floating around in it. Oh idea!' Alex yelps and before anyone can stop her she's already grabbed the wine bottle and refilled it, luckily Lena was still able to breathe by the end of it just before thrusting it to the worried blond 'Here you go'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Alex I'm not going to try it, my friend is in it' Kara responds negatively, Alex grumbles about being a spoiled sport before knocking the entire glass back. This time Lena did scream right before Alex found her cute little feet standing on her cheek bones at which point eyes locked... until Alex got distracted and instead decided to watch Lena's breasts bounce with every breath in that dress. Finally the glass is empty and Alex puts down the glass, Lena looking annoyed but once more trapped in the glass<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That was good hic, if we can't fix this every drink is getting a Lena dipping, she makes everything taste so much better' Alex groans before grinning drunkenly down at her new taste enhancer<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara growls 'Alex, stop messing with her and get her out of the glass' the agent finally sighs and follows orders, Lena being picked out of the glass and placed on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ah, look Alex got Lena wet' Sam giggles at her joke before Alex high fives her 'Though on saying that Le, it's probably bestest to get out of those wet clothes' her eyes focus on her chest and Lena knows the only reason she isn't suspecting they'd planned this was because they were both 2 drunk to plan ahead something like this with subtlety. Sam was clearly just taking advantage of the other idiots drunken messing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara pouts slightly 'But I don't have any doll clothes for her to change into' she sighs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's fine, Le can just do without. What do you say Lena, we're all girls here, the fact we're all gay should have no effect on your shyness' Sam teases, Lena wants to argue but she was right, plus she had gone to an all girl school, stripping should be no problems for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Alex! Sammy! How can you do this to Lena, how would you feel if you were in her shoes?' Kara scolds her friend and sister, but also kept one eye on Lena<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If whatever got Lena affected me too, I'm sure Sam and I would be having a LOT of fun together right about now' Alex teases, waving her tongue in her direction and Kara can't help but smile: After Maggie broke her heart Alex was depressed for weeks, but then Sam came into her life, Alex smiled again, these days it's Maggie who? and they seemed to be heading for something great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing there was no way out of this, and her clothes were starting to feel sticky and clammy on her skin, Lena began to shimmy her way out of her dress, catching her holster with the underwear and bunching both up, while the lack of bra made it a simple case of pushing the dress off her legs and tada, one nude Lena, hold the wet cloth. While still damp from her drink she actually did feel better than she expected, and she had actually expected the leering from both drunk idiots, but Kara's eyes roaming over her had the pale human blushing up a storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Alex and Sam continue to toy with the now naked Lena, even getting Kara to join in under the idea it would help Lena 'raise her spirits' which the blond is eager to do.<br>\r\n2) Kara gets worried about her friend and decides Lena will stay with her for the entire girl's night. This gets teasing from the drunk girls, such as how Kara finallt has her own pet girlfriend, but Lena doesn't care, content to have her cold wet body warmed by Kara's soft, hot one. Cuddling at her new size actually feels great when Kara and her pillow like chest is involved</span></div></div>",

Kara then steps out of her footwear and turns to Lena, now showing off her gravity defying melons as well as a neatly trimmed pussy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not the sink Le, it's the shower, we're going to get nice and clean and free of wine, then I'm going to prepare a bed perfect for a little angel like you\" Kara coos, Lena blushing from the praise as much as the full frontal. Due to not looking at the blond she yelps when she's once more picked up, this time placed on Kara's shoulder as she steps into the shower and turns it on, Lena tensing at the amount of damage the much larger than normal water drops will do to her smaller form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Kara, I don't think this is a good idea\" she mumbles, but Kara has thought ahead, as well as giggling to herself as she reaches for and retrieves the shower gel<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Lena, I have a plan, but first\" she offers the end of the bottle to Lena who nods and with a single squeeze gets covered in the blue goo, rubbing it to form a suddy barrier around herself and Kara's shoulder making he girl smile, the then reached up, grabbed the human from her shoulder and moved her below her breasts, manoeuvring her hands so Lena could sit in them \"There we go, now lie back and relax\" she coos, then steps forward into the shower's path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she did yelp at the water hitting her like tennis or basketballs, once Kara has stopped moving Lena realised what she was doing, just before being flooded by a veritable waterfall of Kara scented liquid: the girl using her body to collect the water from the shower as well as letting it flow from out of her cleavage like a shower within a shower. A Kara scented shower Lena was going to miss whenever they got her back to normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe process repeated with the shampoo, only Kara held Lena nearly directly under her breasts so things could go more smoothly as water flowed from between her tits. With Lena no longer smelling of wine (though maybe smelling slightly of Kara, not that she's complaining) Kara could now focus on herself, after all the reason for the shower rather than the sink was so both could get clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Kara decides that seeing as she helped Lena to shower using her body, Lena could do the same to help her, in this case meaning being used as a loofah or washcloth to rub soap into Kara's entre body from her neck all the way down to between her toes<br>\r\n2) After being practically scent marked by Kara Lena tries to pleasure herself on the woman in question, Kara fulfilling her desires in an interesting way... pushing her feet first into Kara's hungry, Kryptonian pussy<br>\r\n3) Time skip, after being dried by Kara (resisting the urge to use her super breath as she didn't want to turn her friend into an ice cube) Lena is surprised to find out her bed is going to be Kara's large bosom, the girl wanting to keep Lena close to her heart for her safety (it's the actual reason she didn't offer to keep her between her butt cheeks where she'd have even more protective control), plus her breasts are soft and squishy enough to make a good mattress that suits her rich girl tastes.</span></div></div>",

That's my first time throught a dimensionnal portal, i didn't know the land would be so hard ! '<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Nevermind. Just let's calm down.

Like Ava said we need help and I suggested asking you. I wasn't aloud look for you alone so Ava came along with me, she's in charge of the Time Bureau.

I mean even without Lex's archives, <u>flew here on a bus</u>... Really?' she laughs at Kara's adorable pout, while their shrunken visitors looked really confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing deeply Ava tries getting their attention back to the point of their arrival: explaining the Time Bureau on top of time travel in general ('Yeah we have Time Travel on our Earth, I'm a Captain of my own time ship, no biggie' 'Sara, not helping!'), anachronisms, as well as finally the Time Demon Malice who was the main reason they came to Kara's Earth and got themselves shrunk to doll size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara bites her lip before answering 'I don't know how to say this, but magic tends to fuck with my powers, like a lot' hearing this Sara and even Ava droop 'That's not to say I won't help, I'm just saying I won't know how much help I can be until it's too late. Also aren't you guys going to need to get yourselves fixed before trying to fight a demon?' she asks after trying to reassure them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah we do, but it's basically on the list after getting help and above fighting Malice. Like high-ish priority' Sara explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)Lena butts in, offering her own assistance in all matters, be it their size problems, multiverse travel with less side effects, the anachronisms and also fighting Malice, magic being a thing she'd been rather covertly fascinated by and always wanted to experiment with/examine. Ava agrees because they REALLY could use all the help they can find.<br>\r\n2) Kara says they can't do much till they fix the 2 of them so invites them to stay with them as well as join them for a double date type thing at Lena's, the ravenette CEO agreeing because she was entertaining the idea of bringing the 2 shrunken women with them into the bedroom, so she can make her and Kara's first time together extra <b>special</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[2 things:<br>\r\n1st turns out the correct spelling of Mallus is Malice, we don't learn that till the last episode and they even argue about it. Just check the wiki/episode if you don't believe me, it was quite surprising really.<br>\r\n2nd, the magic thing is real, magic is considered a secondary weakness to kryptonians on par with kryptonite, I think that's wrong at least as a term, magic doesn't effect Supergirl as more than it would affect Lena or Alex... and that's where her problems are, magic seems to bypass all Kryptonian resistances, meaning magic users are much more likely to kick their asses than regular fighters]</span></div></div>",

Or either, i can work on something similar to your \"portal incident\" and go on your world. Only fact, is that it will make grow.\" Lena explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara frowned : \"hmmm..are you really able to do that ? Both options sound fine to me. But what not growing Kara instead ? Magic can hurt you more than her, even if you become a giantess against the Demon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Because, whatever has shrink you, might be caused by some magic. And as i said, we don't know what magic of your world can do to Kara. \" Lena simply replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" You can believe Lena. She's the smartest woman i ever meet.

Sara asks, Ava smiling blissfully, and nods<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She's so soft, and the smell'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara practically purrs 'Yeah, it's something that can only be described as Kara, and is quite an addictive scent' she smiles before nuzzling the pale orb, happy she gets to share this moment with Ava of all people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara, seeing Kara was going to be out cold for a little longer she decides to expand her knowledge of the giantess, exploring her sexy body in a way never seen before.

Ava had the feeling that biting the kryptonian's tit would work better to awake her,after all from what she heard, this won't hurt Kara. But Sara glared at her, letting her say that she would rather visit a goddess body right now. She then slides herself on the giant boob to join Sara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Fine, now let's see where do we start ? \" Sara said, feeling the soft giant body moving a bit under her feet, as she of course was breathing.

I'll be back \"  Sara said, and Ava nodded while finding a good place for her to be safe, just in case the girl of steel would move in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara decided to join Kara's head at first, since thKis was the closest part of the kryptonian she could reach on the moment, and that's what she did. The captain smelled Kara's perfume on her neck, then climbed to join her face. She walked close to the mouth, but not enought to get swallowed if she had to open her mouth somehow. Sara only did a \"tiny\" kiss on her inferior lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Once you wake up you owe me a kiss Supergirl \" she said amused.

She had to be carefull, but it didn't matter if Sara had to fall, she would only have to crawl until she joins Kara's panties. It didn't happen, Sara was enought experienced for differents kinds of walk, and finally she arrived to the girl of steel's private part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Ava, i'm sure i found a better place for us to have some rest...or fun.\" The Captain yelled.</span></div></div>",

Alex was definitely attractive, she wouldn't be so insanely jelous and petty if she wasn't, and having this massive seductress focused on her made the time agent blush harder and her thighs rub together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Sara thought this could be fun, having been quite a while since her last threesome: Nyssa had been possessive, and while she loved the way the older woman looked like she hung the moon, it did make certain things unavailable to them.

Finally Ava was nude and sitting in Alex's palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I feel rather underdressed here' Ava jokes, having gone from most to least clothing of them all rather quickly, to which Sara just smirks and removes her bra, Alex smiles as she watches the captain's large breasts bounce in Ava's face, they looked adorable at her tiny size. With no more issues Alex places them down just before Sara removes her panties, mostly so she can finish her own removal, but not before swatting Ava on the ass with a finger<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex smiles unapologetically 'What, it's a phenomenal ass you got there Ava, I couldn't resist the chance' she says, shedding her bra and thong to lay herself bare in front of the other 2 women 'Ready?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara grins, rubbing her breasts against Ava's spine as the other woman rolls her eyes back into her head 'As we'll ever be Alex' she calls, getting picked up just before she drops herself onto the bed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Let the fun begin'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does this go on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Given Ava looked disappointed by her trip Alex decides to correct that, letting Ava show her tits some love while Sara explores her nether region<br>\r\n2) The 2 time travellers work together to bring Alex to a peak, hoping she will see that if she wants Alex she will need to take Ava too (not that she has anything wrong with that, she other woman seems nice and if they hadn't been romantic rivals first second they met they could been fast friends)</span></div></div>",

My scientists tell me the serum is tasteless and odourless, slip it in anything and he won't be able to tell the difference. The only unintentional side effects is depending on the drinker there can be dizziness or drowsiness. They say give it an hour for the best effects'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Fine but you owe me for this' she huffs before exiting the car, standing at the door as she watches it leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>Later{ that evening/i}</i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oliver, you around?' Moira calls as she pushes against her son's door, happy to see he was actually in it for once, though not so happy to see he looked tense, worried and was clearly not sleeping 'Are you okay my boy?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver turns to her and smiles very slightly 'I'm fine mom, it's just...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The island? Nightmares?' Moira guesses, knowing like his father that Oliver would try keep things bottled up inside and let them fester, the opposite of herself and Thea they tended to shout every little thing at each other<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Every time I close my eyes, I'm back there. It makes sleep, not exactly something I welcome nor seem to be able to find' Moira bites her lip before passing a teacup over onto the desk he'd been sitting at<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I had a feeling something was bothering you, so I made you some herbal tea, did wonders when your father was working on a big project with Malcolm and the others, got him to relax and clear his mind... something I think you need just as much right now. You need to sleep or you'll crash Oliver, I don't want to lose you after just getting you back' Moira felt bad for using that on him but he's hiding something: Oliver was a terrible liar, or at least to family he was, he's gotten better but a mother knows these things, he's hiding something and he's lying to her face. It was this which really made her empty the vial into his tea before coming up, she wanted answers and if this does what Malcolm claims it does she'll get them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver sighs but takes a sip, even that does wonders in Moira's eyes as his shoulder slump and he looks more like he did 5 years ago 'Thanks Mom' he whispers, causing the eldest Queen to smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Try to relax my boy, I'll check up on you later, there are some things I need tp deal with. Paperwork seems never-ending' she jokes and Oliver smiles, something she'd missed seeing from her once happy go lucky and jokey son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Malcolm said she gave it the needed hour before walking back into the room, not knocking up just pushing it open, what she found there shocked and confused her. She didn't know what the serum was supposed to do to get their answers but shrinking her son wasn't even a thought in the back of her mind, but there he was, standing on his bed looking lost and confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow big is he?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There were several factors in Oliver's favour to balance out the major disadvantage of his reduced size. The first was that Moira left the door wide open, so once he managed to reach it then he had the whole house to hide from his crazy mother, Another was that it was late in the evening and most of the lights in the mansion were off, which was combined with a very important advantage: that Moira most likely didn't want anyone to know that she shrunk him or that he was shrunken at all. This meant once he managed to get into the dark hallway, clinging to the walls once out of sight she had to pad her way through the dark whisper/calling his name, rather than yelling or even just turning on the lights, which would have made finding him so much easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling confident that unless conditions changed he would be able to avoid Moira for a while longer Oliver considered his options: he had no way of getting to Felicity or Diggle, Laurel wouldn't be much good and his mother was both the problem and working for the people on 'The List' (she was probably on one of the lost pages). This left him with an option he didn't really want to consider but it was the only one he had... Thea. He would have preferred to keep Thea out of all this madness, especially now he knew their mom was also part of it, but she was the only chance he had of getting changed back to normal. With that in mind he hugged the walls and made his way to the youngest Queen's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea's room was a lot less girly than he remembered it, feeling a bit more punk rock, but then again that's what 5 years will do to you. Thea herself while older still sat the same way when she was relaxing though: Edge of her bed reading a book with an ear bud on and the other sitting on her now noticeable chest, with her left foot gently rocking, her toes just barely touching the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver knew he couldn't get her attention from the doorway or even the floor if he were honest, but had to come up with something, especially before Moira got desperate enough to involve Thea in her search (that is if she hadn't planned to let Thea in on the secret from the start. But how could he get this giant of a woman's attention?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)Even when they were kids Thea had sensitive feet, after all if Oliver wanted her to get off him all he had to do was tickle her soles and she shot off him like she'd been fired from a cannon. In theory all Oliver had to was pinch her baby toe or run his hands along her arch and he'd have her attention, but the problem was she might kick out or step on him. So a high risk, high reward option as well as the most immediate seeing as her foot was right in front of him<br>\r\n2) Just because she couldn't see of hear him from the floor doesn't mean he couldn't try from closer to her, after everything he's done shimmying up her duvet should be child's play, climbing her body would be a little harder but once he was high enough (if trying to climb her wasn't noticeable enough for her) he would be in direct visual and audible range for him to do the usual wave and yell when you want to get someone's attention.</span></div></div>",

Thea seemed to be unaware of him, too busy to dance with the upper part of her body, eyes closed. So screaming won't help, and he couldn't expect her to see him. On the other side, he remembered that Thea had sensitive feet. This helped him a lot in the past, when Thea used to play with his face with her feet, which he never liked..but at the end touching her feet was enought to stop her from rubbing her sole on his nose. And now he was going to use that to get her attention. He went closer and closer, still hoping somehow that Thea will open her eyes and sees him before he had to touch her gigantic foot, but it didn't happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivr was now enought close to her feet, but get some hesitations. Thea might react with violence, and considering his new size, it might hurt...a lot. But after being for some years on an island trying to survive, he couldn't believe that he would be killed by Thea's foot.<br>\r\nThat helped him to do what he had to do, and with enought confidence, touched her pinky toe, rubbing it a little before he suddenly get poked away as Thea's quickly reacted to it by kicking whatever touched her. She openned her eyes, looking at what looked like a doll laid on the ground in pain and almost had an heart attack. She removed her earbud, as she quickly recognized the form of her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Ollie ? I must be dreaming ! \" She said shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" No you don't...Thea  i don't have time to explain, Mom shrunk me i need your help ! \" Ollie replied at his confused sister. Using her both hands, she caught Oliver tight in them, hurting him a bit while raising him to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Wait...What ? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Thea please, hide me somwhere ! \" He begged. Thea had no choice but to listen to him and found an empty box on her desk enought tall to keep him safe for a while...That was close as Moira entere her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Mom ? \" She turned back to face Moira, who seemed annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Sweetie are you okay ? \" She asked suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yeah, i just hate when you enter my room without my permission ! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoira looked all around the room checking for something obviously, and Thea finally understood the part oliver said : \" Mom shrunk me ! \". Deep inside she felt some anger, but did her best to hide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Sorry, i just wanted to know if you were okay \" Moira said before leaving the room, and Thea had to close the door by herself as her mother seemed to didn't care about her privacy. She then released Oliver from his prison and grabbed him in both hands again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Can't believe Mom did this to you, your own son...Now will you explain ? \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver took a breath before saying the most essential part, making sure to not mention he was the hood. All he said was that Moira worked with someone who thinks that Oliver knows something about a dark project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" So Mom is not the one we think she is...What a surprise. You were right to come for me, thought that i could have hurt you with my foot. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" It's ok, i'm a survivor from an island remember ? It's not your who's gonna kill me...\" Oliver joked making Thea smile. \" So are you going to help me ? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Play with me? Well guess what, you're here and you're not exactly going anywhere unless you feel Mom's a better option than me now so you're my playmate for the next little while' After this she locks her room (just in case) and bounces onto the bed, placing Oliver down  in front of her crossed legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken vigilante sighs 'So what do you have in mind?' she asks to which she smirks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I've thought about that and it's weird that there's a lot more roughhousing in our past than I expected. A lot more high pitched squealing from you tickling my feet too' she teases a little 'So that's the plan, how about it Ollie, afraid to rough house with your wittle sister?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver wants to comment that the only little thing about the young woman his sister had become was her stud earrings, but swallows that thought 'You do know I survived that island for 5 years, I'm a lot tougher than I used to be' he slightly boasts<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea just grins wider 'I know, that's why I have backup' Oliver looks confused for a moment before Thea uncrosses her legs and pins him between her feet, rubbing them against him before spreading out, trapping him in a triangle formed by her legs and the end of the bed '2 against 1 should even the odds don't you think?' she asks, then looks slightly worried when Oliver doesn't respond with words, more so coughing and wheezing 'Did I hurt you or something, my feet can't smell that bad' she half teases half worries<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver smiles slightly as he coughs 'It's not bad per say... okay it's a little intense. But on the bright side, unless they're my size, I doubt any future boy or girlfriend you have will have a problem with your feet smelling of honey and coconut' he grimaces 'I think I can taste the damn thing'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea laughs 'Oh that's my new lotion, Laurel got it for me the other month. Guess that's another added difficulty for you Ollie' she coos and the battle commences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver uses all the training he had acquired over the years away but somehow Thea's feet were still able to pin him, luckily the scent was much less overpowering from a single source, in this case the heel of one foot holding down his legs while the toes of the other foot were clenched around his neck (gently as she didn't want him to pass out). Despite the humiliation this situation causes it wasn't as bad as it could have been: Thea kept good care of herself and the lotion kept her feet smooth and fairly soft, pinned between then and her bed was actually more relaxing to him than it probably should, he actually had to keep his eyes open so he didn't zone out and do something stupid like sniff her feet, he knew Thea wouldn't be angry per say, but she would tease him endlessly, and this situation itself was enough teasing and blackmail material for the foreseeable future for her, her didn't need to add to it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Thea got bored of pining and rubbing Oliver against her feet so decided...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Sticking to the more aggressive/confrontational activities she decides to give him another fight, between her ass and his speed. Basically she's going to try sit on him or flatten him under her ass, simple if nothing else<br>\r\n2) Thea decides they should have a little game of Hide and Seek, with a little wager: If she can find Oliver he has to do one thing for her (no matter how strange, bad or just plain wrong it is). On the other hand if Oliver can last half an hour without being found she would help him right now with his size issues.</span></div></div>",

Sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver knows despite the questioning down it wasn't one, more a statement, they were doing this, and if he didn't manage to evade her he was screwed \"Sounds fine, as long as you don't cheat\" he replies, trying to remain playful and carefree whle he had the chance<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea gasps and holds her chest \"Why I would never. Go hide Ollie, I'll stay up here and count\" she kisses the top of his head then lies back with her eyes closed, a content smile on her face as she slowly counts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little time to lose and not wanting to know what exactly she had planned for him Oliver slides down the bedsheet and drops to the ground. There were quite a few places he could go, drawers were left only half closed, handbags on their sides, but he didn't want to use them, partly because with how out in the open they were Thea would check them relatively quickly ,as well as the fact if she does find him he'd prefer it not wrapped up in one of her panties by accident. Instead he does a complete 180 and runs under the bed, glad to see Thea was just a cluttered under here as he remembered, it being relatively easy for him to find somewhere he could relax for the next half hour while she roots around her room, at least if their mom comes in again Thea could claim to be cleaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while passes and as he expected Thea checked the drawers first, actually sounding disappointed when she didn't find him there but continued none the less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is the result of this game?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Thea finds him, and given how good he felt under her in the last game she wants him to rub her feet while she come up with the next game for them to play<br>\r\n2) Thea finds him. Given the amount of time out of her life as well as his current size, Thea can't resist the opportunity, and makes Oliver her sex toy for the rest of the day, introducing him to both her eager holes<br>\r\n3) Oliver manages to remain undetected until the timer runs out, meaning Thea has to help him get his size restored. He wishes she'd told him she was going to put him down the back of her pants for the journey there, and she probably should have told him she was heading straight to ...

A part of him feels scared, which mean a lot considering all he went throught before, Oliver didn't think he could be scared of something again. How did he shrunk, he has no idea on the moment, but things just become more clear once he notices his mother walking into his room, her expression says all he needs to know...he got shrunk for some reason by his own mother !  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" the tea \" he figures out the answer of \"how\". \" Probably odourless that's why i didn't suspect anything.\" he looks at his now gigantic mother who seems to feel sad and guilty, but this doesn't explain why she did this.

Why did you do that ? \"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver is leaded by his shock and anger, he doesn't even realize on the moment that he was too small to be heard.

What is done is done, now she has no choice and has to question her own shrunken son. Oliver doesn't know who is \"him\", but he guess she meant the guy who gave Moira the shrinking stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Mom, you have to tell me what's going on. Who's behind this ? \" he asks, letting the giant mature woman know that she has to bend down to be able to hear him, and that's what she does, putting herself on her knee, in front of Oliver's bed, and Oliver himself now in front of the upper part of his mother giant body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" WHO ASKED YOU TO DO THIS ? \" he yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" No, no, no...Oliver. I'm the one asking questions.\" Moira manages to act more like a soldier than a mother, putting her feelings aside. \" You have to tell me everything your father told you \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Or else ?

Moira places her hand next to him, allowing Oliver to walk into her plam so she can raise him to hear him better. And what comes out from his mouth next, was half a shock for the woman. Oliver revealed he was the Hood, and told her about the list he received from his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....I didn't want either you or Thea knowing the truth.

Things got worse after the Queen's Gambit went down, a rift opening up between the 2 of them that just continued to get wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was this growing turmoil as well as the information she'd just learnt that made her consider telling them, not just Thea about Oliver but them both about what she'd done or been part of.

On the other hand, Thea was impulsive and clearly angry, she didn't want her to slash out and try crush Oliver in her current state, sure Malcolm had said he would be safe but she wasn't too sure she trusted him, after all he could have just told her the vial was a shrinking serum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Moira pockets Oliver as she moves showing Thea her empty hands. She storms off and Moira decides what to do with her shrunken son<br>\r\n2) Moira reveals Oliver to Thea who responds rather similarly to how she did.

Thea hisses<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You need to calm down' Oliver replies, resting his head against her, feeling her heart beat slowing now the panic had stopped at the very least 'I know a lot of things have just come to light, but we need to do something about this, and me doing this was the only way to get either of you to do anything besides yell at each other. Speedy, i'm not asking you to forgive her right now, I'm not...' he doesn't need to look away from Thea's face to know Moira's expression fell '... but we need to all work together, figure out where we go from here with what we know as well as find a way to fix me if at all possible'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then he was given one bit of good news, that being other than the fact he'd been keeping secrets Thea wasn't mad at him like she was their mother, she teased him 'Aw, but I was beginning to warm to the idea of having a little brother, plus the Tom Thumb look is kind of cute' Thea smirks and runs her finger gently up and down his back 'Plus I like the symmetry, I've been throwing myself at my brother for the last couple months, and then my shrunken little brother throws himself at me. Good thing my shirt wasn't open or we'd have lost you between my girls' she giggles and cups her breasts with her hands, completely enveloping the shrunken archer, though only for a moment before releasing them. 'So, what can we do?' she asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver turns his head 'Mom, what is the plan?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eldest Queen sighs 'The Undertaking is something I only knew about in broad strokes, it was Malcolm's baby ever since he came back from Nanda Parbot or however it was pronounced. What I understood was that it was a plan to clean out the Glades of the decay that it was spreading to the rest of the city, Malcolm, Robert and Eobard knew the most about the details. Oliver's actions have had Malcolm speed up the schedule for the Undertaking, as in less than a year. The only good news is we're not in the Glades so we hopefully won't be directly affected, but given this incident I'm not sure if believing Merlyn is really a good idea' she explains as Oliver listens while making his way up to Thea's shoulder so he wasn't hanging off her chest for the entire conversation<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, I hadn't managed to find anything else from the people I spoke to, though at least I have a List of all the people in the group responsible for the Undertaking. Now while I'm sure this size would be useful for stealth, it's very bad if I were to get caught, so if you could fix my size or at least find out if it were possible' Oliver says as corroboration,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Moira suggests she tells Malcolm they need another vial, explaining she'd been spooked by one of the kids sneaking up on her and causing her to drop and shatter it. When she gets it, Thea has to try stop herself from using the new vial even partly on Moira (seeing as she did at least want Oliver to get fixed eventually), though whether she does or not remains to be seen<br>\r\n2) There was a little of the substance still in the vial, not enough to remove more than a few inches but Oliver thinks they should give it to Felicity, who could either find a way to reverse it, or find where Merlyn got the stuff, because if you make something like this you make an antidote as quick as possible.</span></div></div>",

They were so small and fragile, she could do anything and they couldn't stop her. It made her think back to when she first arrived on Earth 38, she had gone from a well of teen on Krypton, Heir to the Great House of El, to Earth, where she had the powers of a God... but also loads of people scolding her for not being ordinary. Couple that with a distinct lack of purpose due to the baby she was supposed to protect being a man in his 30's Kara had been directionless and unhappy for quite a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe void had been filled for the most part by being Supergirl but like she had discussed with Cat, there were still so many restrictions, as well as the fact she knew if she put a toe out of line, General Lane of some other xenophobic arse would pump her full of kryptonite faster than you could say <i>Lex Luthor</i>. Those underlying restrictions made her role as Supergirl difficult at times, as well as her cousin's <b>''No killing the bad guys''</b> rule, even though he'd killed Zod, she still got it in the butt when he heard that she killed Non.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis new earth was a breath of fresh air to the Kryptonian, she could feel her powers grow even stronger as the yellow sun energized her massive form, probably why she was getting tired of waiting around, all that energy building up inside her. She had gone from being a citizen of a species who's level of technology made them look like magical beings to the less advanced races (humans included), then she was sent to a planet which gave her god like power and abilities, now this accident gave her the stature of one, she was a literal goddess to these people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought began to burrow into her mind as she rose from the ground, debris falling from her boots and winds picking up as she moved, pulled her legs into a seated position and wrapped her cape around her legs before lowering down to the ground, crushing smaller structures due to her increased area but she didn't mind right now. Next her eyes zeroed in on a human, reaching out she grabbed him and brought him to her face. He curled in on himself, shuddering as Kara pouts 'Don't we afraid' she whispered, though to him it was as if she was loudly speaking at her normal size 'I'm not going to hurt you, not unneedelly. I'm Kara Zor-El. This city is now mine, I will keep it safe, no body will bring harm to it as long as I am around' while she was speaking to the human in her hand (it made it more personal in her mind to have a target to speak to) she was addressing most if not all of this little Central City, HER Central City. The human in her hand seems to believe her, moving from the fetal position to a kneeling one, kissing her palm, something that would be a useless gesture were Kara not able to feel it, and it made those thoughts get louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at the little one she stands again then places him on the roof of a building, luckily for him this building only reached Kara's chest, so when she took her classic pose and puffed out her chest, those twin zeppelins were all he could see. 'I must leave before I cause more wreckage, but I will not be far, nor will I be unaware of what you do' she explains directly, she wouldn't tolerate crime in HER city 'Goodbye' she then rises slowly before shooting off once she was out of the way of anything in the city, aware the wind currents her new size could generate would tear the place apart if she was careless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Kara turns a nearby mountain into a throne, and ctizens flock to gift her with offerings, feeding Kara's sense of godhood, and leading her to consider spreading her influence across this earth, as well as build her own pantheon.<br>\r\n2) The army or this Earth's heroes see this giantess as a threat to their earth, though whether they attack her head on or try speak to her and convince her to go home, depends on which option is chosen. Might also depend on who the heroes of this Earth are: are they the Earth One roster or a mix of other continuities?</span></div></div>",

In fact they were counting on the Flash, but Joe and Iris knew that he was not going to show up right now, as Barry was away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" that's Supergirl \" Iris said loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe grabbed her arm and took her in the restroom, where no one can hear her by accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Wait, can you tell me why Barry's alien friend is giant ? That's not what i call a discret entrance ! \" He asked panicked. These last months, Joe had seen many weird and unbelievable things, but now this was too much to handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Can't say, but as Barry is on the sland with Oliver Queen, i suppose we have to count on Caitlin and Cisco for now. We need to get in contact with her without beeing seen by the authorities, or else we'll be questionned. \" Iris replied trying to get a plan. Kara was friendly, from what she can say, so it might be an option. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" That's great...and how are we supposed to do that ? \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Let me go to Star Lab, i'll call you later. See you later Dad \" Iris kissed her father and left the CCPD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe left the restroom, not knowing what to do and how to help, when a cop told him that the Argus will take care of her, so they don't have to do anything.<br>\r\n_______________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the giant girl of steel had her way in a near forest, the tallest tree barefly reached her knee. It was easy for Kara to scan the whole environnement with her vision and her new perspective to check that no one was there. This place was perfect for now, there was also a lake near her where she could take a bath. Kara didn't feel anything wrong causing a mess in this world, she was just doing her job after all. Even if they had some kryptonites, which is almost impossible, she wasn't sure anyone could hurt her anyway, there were just too small. Deep inside, she knew she always wanted to be totally a goddess, and she had a smile at the thought of Oliver's reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for now, all she had to do was to wait and see what will be Central's city's answer to her domination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happen ? </span></div></div>",

Nodding to herself Kara walks over to the edge and began removing her suit, crouching down so the bare minimum of her body was revealed to the world, thought given her size she knew she'd probably flashed or mooned a few people in the minute it took to remove her clothes and slip into the lake. She had been right, the lake did function as a rather nice bath for a being of her size, as though it were made for her (not helping the growing God Complex she was expectedly developing). Shifting her positon, so her breasts were also underwater rather than forming little island lakes, Kara lay back, her golden curls floating on the surface and finally relaxing for at least a little while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Kara was enjoying her soak, some others were enjoying the view they received and continued to of Kara's perfect Kryptonian body in the crystal clear water<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I am actually okay with this choice of honeymoon beloved' Nyssa says with a small smirk, closing Sara's mouth which was beginning to leak drool down her chin 'I married a child didn't I?' she teases, squawking when the taller assassin picks her up and spins her, capturing her mouth with a kiss. When Sara proposed the idea of hiking and camping as part of their weeklong celebration of their union she was sceptical, though Sara's insistence on 1 sleeping bag did hold her attention slightly, as did her pointing out it had been something she'd wanted to share from her childhood, but every time they had been in woods or forests before now, it was chasing a bad person who they needed to kill, not the best time for this kind of discussion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, Supergirl definitely lives up to her title, wowza. Think she'd be open to...' Sara wriggles her eyebrows, earning a playful slap on the chest from Nyssa, who is also grinning<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Always thinking with your cunt beloved, though she is definitely a fine specimen. I hope you don't expect to get her all to yourself' Sara looks surprised for a moment before grinning and kissing her wife<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh I don't deserve you, you perfect creature, there isn't another person I'd want to try proposition a goddess with' Sara flashes a cheeky grin before letting Nyssa stand once more<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat duo our deadly duo well do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Nyssa says they shouldn't interrupt her bath, as a grumpy Supergirl is more likely to crush them than screw them, leading Sara to the idea of sneaking into her suit, make their own fun while she bathes.<br>\r\n2)Not one for finesse or subtlety ( I believe the LOT comparison was a chainsaw) Sara decides to walk over to the water's edge, yell at Kara to get her attention, and when the giantess turns flirtingly ask if 'the goddess would like some willing acolytes to play with?' pointing to herself and Nyssa (stroking the ego works on everyone else, why not Gigagirl?)</span></div></div>",

Lena asks, pulling from her pocket the breacher device, which Felicity noticed was nearly half her size in diameter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Um..' Felicity blanked for a moment, Lena was incredibly beautiful, especially at this size, but her smile still had the blond unnerved, it was predatory, rather similar to a certain assassin she'd rather not think about, only Nyssa couldn't kill her and dispose of her body simply by swallowing '...Ray! He had tools for his ATOM suit, they can have their size altered, the properties are built in so it only alters them or else I'd recommend just using it to shrink yourself, but they should be able to be made large enough to work on the device without breaking it' Felicity then begins to babble, which just causes Lena to find her even more adorable<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Perfect, now where are these tools?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'In a warehouse at the edge of the city, this kind of stuff needed discretion, which I'm sure you understand and appreciate' Felicity answers, Lena nods, before placing both girl and device into her pocket, giggling at the tiny squeal Felicity lets out and she gets caught between Lena and the device in her breast pocket<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I hope you don't push the button while you're in there, that's what got me into this mess' Lena teases as she begins to walk in the direction Felicity had pointed to. When she arrives she removes both Felicity and the device, the blond running inside as Lena gets onto her hands and knees to get through the door before moving to a sitting position once she's fully inside. 'So can you work this stuff?' Lena asks as she watches Felicity fiddle with the console<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course I can, the real question is can you use these tools?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena rolls her eyes 'I was an engineer before Lex went insane and I had to take over the CEO position' she drawls, but then see's Felicity's look of confusion and remembers she's not on her Earth right now... though the fact they haven't called in the army to nuke her for being a giant Luthor should have been another 'Never mind yes I can, I'll just need you to be a tiny extra pair of eyes, as I get the feeling I'll need them'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity nods, if Cisco did make a device to perfectly mimic his breaching meta ability it would be complicated, not exactly something you can just put together with a hammer and screwdriver for example.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the tools were resized and Lena was able to for lack of a better term 'crack it open' she was in awe, the tech in front of her was on par with the stuff Rhea had shown her, but it wasn't made by some advanced alien race... but by a normal human... well normalish. Watching Felicity direct her towards certain parts that would need to be checked for damage or fault, and then use an oversized plug to hook the device to the console and begin working through the code<br>\r\nmade Lena realise, she wasn't going to let this tiny human go, Felicity was going to come back to Earth 38 with her, be her tiny assistant in the lab and maybe more when the blond calms down after the transition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay, I think I found a fault in the programming, apparently it didn't take dimensional scaling into account, I think, Cisco basically understands this stuff instinctively, it's a wonder Supergirl showed up on your earth in one piece if I'm being honest because I understand programming but some of these equations look like something Professor Stein must have collaborated on' Felicity explains, Lena nods in understanding (reassuring the blond that she was probably right) as it was a little silly to believe all realities were built exactly the same, apparently her Earth was about 18-20 times larger than Earth 1 (Katie Mcgrath is apparently 5ft 5 and a half inches, and Lena's currently 100ft tall). With a quick fix from Felicity Lena was able to put the device back together, not good as new, but usable for at least a couple more jumps before Kara will need to talk to Cisco about getting a new breacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Lena grabs Felicity and breaches them to Earth 38.... but she's still a giantess (Whoops, guess resetting the device means it took Lena's current size to be her normal size. Not that Felicity's complaining too much, she's still her own size rather than that of a toy after all)<br>\r\n2) Oliver comes over suspicious of Lena's intentions (rightly so, see option 1 for proof) with a few of the other Earth 1 heroes. There's a small fight, but the device becomes damaged beyond repair, which leaves them with an angry giantess they can't breach anywhere simply due to her size.</span></div></div>",

I'm done!' she screams, last year she had someone who made her feel like a person who wasn't just Kara's protector, but Maggie was gone, she walked away and abandoned her when all she wanted to do was talk about having kids in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex sighs thinking about the last time she'd felt like herself, the night before Kara's friend Barry's wedding, when she met a sexy blond at the party and they had mind blowing sex. Sara was smart and fun, everything Alex needed due to her highly stressful life, not that being captain of a time traveling spaceship was a walk in the park (though Sara's teammates did make it seem that way at times). The red head missed the blond beauty, and being an entire universe away meant she couldn't exactly pop over and see.... hang on a minute<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex runs over to the box she keeps all Kara's spare shit, remembering the last time Kara had used the dimensional jumping device had been when she had been spending time at hers. Sticking her hands into the pockets of the jeans she had left in hers after coming back and ta da, found the silver/blue device that was the answer to all her problems. She was a little buzzed, but she was thinking clearly enough that she was sure this plan would work just fine, running her fingers along the edge, not noticing the beeps it released from the portal adjustment buttons, before pressing her thumb into her thumb into the glowing centre: opening the bright blue, shimmering portal<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ow, fuck!' Alex groans as she pulls herself from the wreckage of the structure the was slammed through when she fell out of the portal. She was lucky she was still wearing her DEO uniform/cat suit when she had this moment, as it meant she was protected from most of the damage crashing through a building, with the exception of a cut across her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling herself from the wreckage of what she sees to be an old brick building and grimaces at the decay and metaphorical rot around her <i>'Damn, Sara's hometown is a shithole, no wonder the wedding took place in Central City instead'</i> Alex thinks, pushing her hair out of her face. It was then she noticed something was off... she had just pulled herself out of a 5 story building like she had been thrown through a door or plasterboard wall, she was a giantess 'Ahh for fuck sake!' Alex growls, lashing out and kicking a car through an apartment block, a small chuckle escapes her throat as she watches the building collapse in on itself and the car explode in the distance <i>'That felt kind of nice, no wonder Kara smashes cars when she gets annoyed'</i> she thinks, the buzz at getting to destroy rather than protect making her long for more... but she came her with a goal in mind: Find Sara Lance, and see if she wants more than a one night stand, if she wants to pursue a relationship... and if not, her new size should make a roll in the hay rather interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Alex catches a break for once, Sara and the Legends are in Star City for a vacation after saving the timeline again. Which means she can get her chance to try form a relationship with the sexy time traveling assassin that rocked her world even harder than Maggie had, and even better she was the perfect size to make her <i>'happy'</i> all the time<br>\r\n2) Sara's not here, so Alex has little choice but to take out her frustration on the city, breaking everything she wants to and unfortunately getting the attention of Team Arrow.</span></div></div>",

Ollie! William! Anybody home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex had been satisfied by Felicity's squirming, at least enough she was content to simply wait for Sara to appear rather than continue her rampage through the city. In fact she was using her time to practice some of the meditation techniques J'onn had taught her a while back that should help her focus as well as drown out distractions, a good plan when you have a potential child of your own in your breast pocket, waiting for your future doll girlfriend and while Felicty was no longer pleasuring her, her current position meant the hacker had her head pressed up against her clit, to the point Alex could feel her breaths and if she licked her lips would also lick Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill she was able to find her centre and avoid breaking shit (other than several vehicles that may or may not have been occupied who were crushed under her ass when she sat down) until she heard the voice of an angel, or more importantly Sara calling for someone to explain what was happening. Pulling herself to her feet, and biting her lip as Felicity once more is rubbed against her pussy Alex walks back over to the building, making her prescience known with a wide grin and a \"Hey Sara\", and wow she'd never seen a human jump that high before<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara stares at the enormous grinning face of Alex Danvers, the hot secret agent she'd met (and soon after slept with) at Barry's wedding and oddly enough her first though was why she never thought to steal Ray's shrink ray back when her and Nyssa were still dating, seeing that woman at this scale would have definitely stopped Sara from straying. \"Alex\" she gasps, the giantess just grins wider as she steps out to get a better look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure is cutie, something weird happened when I came looking for you, but it does make this so much easier\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What easier?\" Sara asks, a little worried but mostly curious<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and me were great, we got on well and the sex was amazing, the best I've ever had for sure. And so I decided to come see you and see if you wanted to make it a more formal arrangement, you know like girlfriends or lovers with something else later down the line\" Alex explains, looking slightly nervous but still hopeful as she bares her heart to the tiny bundle of sexiness, a voice in the back of her mind telling her to grab the girl shove her in your pants and go home, but she wanted Sara to be willing if able.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara's jaw drops, her brain actually short circuits for a couple seconds. This goddess from another world wanted her to be her girlfriend, not a toy or a pet but an actual lover, why wasn't she jumping for joy? She'd struck out with Sharpe and Nyssa was dead, Alex was exactly the kind of woman she went for and in her current form was also fulfilling and well as inspiring her to embrace a couple fetishes and fantasies she really wished she'd gotten to do with her beloved. Walking to the edge of the balcony Sara gets a proper look at Alex's giant form, dressed in that Black Widow suit which drew attention to her breasts and ass, Sara was practically drooling \"Oh God yes, you are by far the best relationship I had since I came back from the dead. I'd love to be your girlfriend\" the words were just out of her mouth when Alex grabs her and cuddles her to her chest, petting her head and cooing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad you said yes, makes the trip home much less awkward\" Sara blinks in confusion \"Now I think you'll like the transport I prepared, they want to see you once again\" Alex gives her a kiss and pulls open her suit, slipping Sara into her cleavage, then taking the portal device from her pocket and activates it, the shimmering portal lighting up the entire city as she steps back into her own world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more back in her apartment, Alex sighs in relief, with Sara as her tiny girlfriend she finally had someone who cared about her and not try to get her to focus on Kara at all times, that fact she was really sexy and perfect in bed, just made it even better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Before Alex could do anything else she gets a call from the DEO about an emergency they need her assistance with, running out and taking her shrunken toys/pets/girlfriend with her<br>\r\n2) Alex removes Sara and William from her shirt, beginning to try find an arrangement as she explores a new relationship as well as becoming a mom. She won't force Sara to assist with her new child, but if the woman feels comfortable Alex won't stop her from helping her with William. Felicity on the other hand, she'll leave that as a surprise for when they get to bed later ;)<br>\r\n3) Sara was the true objective, and she didn't want to coerce her lover into becoming a mother, so she takes all 3 of them out of her shirt and pants, then opens the portal again to shoo Felcity and William back into their home dimension. Now it's just the 2 of them, Alex has some cute and romantic ideas to run by Sara, hoping the blond would agree to at least a few of them.</span></div></div>",

And William was just too cute, she couldn't just let him go with a man than killed people before, and used to threat Kara as nothing more than an alien. No matter how much she was frustrated by Kara's getting all the attention, she was still her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I know this gonna be complicate for you, but i promise i'll take care of you \" Alex just replied nicely, knowing this going to be enought for the boy to not try to insist, and she was right. William said nothing, and she put him back to her breast pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Maybe i should leave now. \" Alex said to Felicity, as if she expected the tiny blonde to try something else to stop her, but nothing happenned...until, Alex felt something on her back. Like a small sting. She turned back to see the Green Arrow who just attacked her, and Thea with Diggle by his sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Give me back my son ! \" he yelled angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Huh, he meant, can you please give us back William ? \" Thea said, not wanting to make the giantess angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" How dare you attacked me ? \" Alex was certainly already angry after Oliver's hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oliver, you should not consider her as a normal ennemy. I suggest you to be calm and speak nicely to this giantess \" Diggle added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" She's taking my son ! \" Oliver said before sending another arrow to the giantess. Seeing that he won't calm down, Thea and Diggle tried to attack her as well from the roof of the building they were standing on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Seriously ? You think this can get me ? \" Alex gave a slap to the three little bugs shooting at her and made them fall from the building. Oliver managed to use an arrow with rope to slow down his fall and caught Diggle on the way. Thea, on the other hand caught the edge of the roof so she didn't fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity couldn't do anything but watch Alex Danvers attacking her friends. The giantess was about to catch Thea, when the blonde suddenly screamed : \" STOOOOP !! WE ARE BOTH IN THE SAME SIDE !! \" And she got the giantess's attention, just like Oliver and Diggle as well, now on the ground by Alex's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" My mind is up \" Alex said. \" I'm going to take the boy with me, and it's useless to attack me considering my size and my suit. I could step on you all if i wanted to \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity tried to think about something else to say to calm her down, when Alex suddenly used her device to go back in world throught a portal.  \" I'm leaving, sorry for the mess \" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now ?</span></div></div>",

Thea pulls herself to her feet in what looks to be a giant, rather nice apartment, Alex just beyond removing William from her suit and placing him on the island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh you just had to be so cute, and the best part is, because this is your natural size on this earth, you'll always be this small, always need mommy's help' she giggles and Thea could clearly see the woman wasn't thinking straight<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm going to be with you forever? Alone?' William asks, casing Alex to lightly chuckle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not forever, not even for very long, Sam's daughter Ruby is about your age I'm sure you'll both get on great, plus some aliens are naturally this size like galvans, so at least that means we won't have to worry about commodities' Alex tries to console, running her finger along his head in a comforting manner and it seemed to be working, William seemed happy to know he wasn't going to be trapped with Alex, even if she was his only adult contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea was getting her bearings in this massive world when a shadow overtook her, looking up she sees it's Alex just before her fingers pinch her back, bringing the former Speedy (she's out of uniform) up to her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well lookie here, just couldn't let me go now could you? At least your a cutie' Thea blushes, she'd be flattered on a normal day, but there was something off about Alex's smile 'I think I'll keep you. From now on, your sexy ass is mine' she announces pinching Thea's bouncy rear before the archer is nearly suffocated by her pouty lips as she smooches her. Finally the giantess lets her go for oxygen<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I... you... Sara.... Hey! What about Sara, you seemed pretty focused on getting with her and now you want me? Am I the rebound girl or the side-bitch?' she asks angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex just shrugs 'I do still want Sara as my girlfriend and eventual wife, you can call yourself my side bitch if you want, if you think it sounds better than pet or toy that is. Plus having another tiny around should make looking after William easier don't you think?' as she asks she places Thea on the island with William, the boy instantly recognising her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Aunt Thea' William cheers, wrapping his arms around her in a hug, sure he knows Alex isn't going to hurt him, but he still felt safer on this strange new Earth with his badass aunt around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'See, he's doing better already' Alex grins, and Thea gives her a shaky one in response 'So Thea, the position of side-bitch just opened up, interested?' Thea knows the question was a joke, knowing much worse things could happen if she refused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ready as I'll ever be, you better be worth the chance of facing Sara's wrath, someone your size must be a goddess in the sheets' she quips, feeling William groan into her shirt as Alex laughs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh I knew you were the fun one on that Earth' Alex says, sounding happy on Earth 38 for the first time in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Alex gets a call, she has to babysit Ruby for a few hours because of a problem Sam has to deal with that she can't avoid or reschedule. This is a good chance for Alex to introduce William to Ruby, hopefully sparking something between them, be if friendship or something more<br>\r\n2) It's late, so Alex shows the 2 where they'll be spending their nights before going to sleep herself. (Can be on her body, or not)</span></div></div>",

Trying to collect her thoughts she got flashes, Constantine, the Darhks, the rumble of Malice's voice and magic, but that was all she could recall and given magic seemed to have several times fucked her over (Both Darhks, several times, the Lazarus Pit may have resurrected her but it also made her a blank slate killing machine, Savage might as well be magic, and then there was Malice. The only good thing magic has done, was Constantine saving her soul) she was sure whatever was happening now was magic... and at this point she just stopped caring, it had made her job as a Legend easier to not care about the why and just deal with what's happening right in front of her... which was that she was about 50ft (Maybe, lack of measurable scenery made exact measurements difficult to determine) in the desert and just outside a major city, what told her the exact location wasn't CatCo or L Corp, or even Supergirl flying around saving the day (that last one would have, but Kara's not in line of sight at the moment), it was the sign, which she'd be able to comfortably lean against, which read<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>''Welcome to National City: Home of Supergirl''</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Hm, so I'm on Supergirl's Earth, this should be fun' </i>Sara thinks, a smirk forming on her face. And why shouldn't it when she was getting to live out a life long fantasy: she liked being a Godzilla type monster as a kid, wrecking her sisters things and toys often, when she got older, some of Laurel's dolls as well as her own she used as little people, some of whom she liked to playfully crush under her growing body, while others became sexual aids, her narrative being she was a goddess who conquered a small colony, and was now dealing with a 'rebellion' as she saw fit. Looking back Sara wasn't entirely sure a human could survive what she did to those toys, though she's sure that Kara <b>DEFINETELY</b> would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here she was, on another earth, a giantess with an entire city to play with, and if she could find Kara or one of her friends (she mentioned her sister, friend Lucy, and a sexy Irish lass called Lena Luthor but Sara didn't get much more about that one besides a beet red Supergirl) a few more personal playthings. And the best part is she could technically have her way with this world, leave and never come back and everything would be fine. She was also glad she entered this world outside of rather than the middle of the city, if she was going to flatten a car under her boot, or wreck buildings with her ass and tits, she wasn't going to accidentally do it, all her breaking shit was going to be because she was having fun wrecking shit, So with a goal in mind she pats down her Canary suit, amused by the burnt cleavage window it now sported and made her way purposefully towards National City, or as she was calling it in her head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Canary's toytown</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) A magical pulse that big didn't go unnoticed by the DEO, (or Cadmus, but that's not important) and with Kara recognising Sara almost instantly Supergirl and Alex are sent as the vanguard for a DEO greeting/capture/interrogation/set up for a monumental fuck up<br>\r\n2) As a very large building with a big green and purple <u><i><b>L</b></i></u> on the front (Yes that's Lex's symbol but good enough for me) Sara had no problem finding L corp, making her way there with the express plan of nabbing herself a few lovely ladies to play with, such as Lena, Sam.

She did the same thing to some other floors, messing with the tinies personns trapped inside. Sara was also tempted to tell them she was gonna to eat each one of them, but a part of her told her to not do that just yet. It was already an incredible fear they had to face, only with a \"hi\" from the giantess, so she couldn't imagine how they would react to a direct threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile on her face, Sara checked another floor and spotted something interesting : two women having a lunch together, one of them was blonde and seemed familiar, the second one was brune.

There was still some tension between Lena and Supergirl, and thought that the girl of steel made some apologizes, Lena just couldn't go over the the lack of trust from someone she once considered as a good friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena kept working days after days, to study all the kryptonite effects, with hope she could use it in some other way than a weapon against some aliens invasions. A way it won't hurt the Girl of Steel or her cousin, so she could use it as an energy source for the city, for example. But yes, the most difficult part would be to make it ineffective for the two Kryptoninans living on Earth. And that's why she couldn't sleep, and forgot Kara, Sam, and even James for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, as Lena was taking a nap at her office, she received a call which awakenned her and picked up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Mrs Luthor, i think you should see this ! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Dr Wilson ?

It contains all the energy from a green Kryptonite, but it's probably harmless for any Kryptonian \" Wilson explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Probably ? \" Lena crossed her arms disappointed. \" I need guarantees !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well, it's not as if we could call Supergirl to come here and check...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Of course not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" It might take me some times to figure out if that's totally harmless for her, but it's a good step \" Wilson tried to comfort his boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Is it harmless for us too, or you don't even know that either ? \" Lena questionned in a sarcastic tone. Wilson then took the black Kryptonite with his hand and brought it to the woman. \" I can say it's safe. But it seems there's two different energies, inside as if the original green's kryptonite was splitted in two. I'll find what it means really soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Sure. We don't want to give the city a corrupted alien energy. \" Lena agreed before taking the black stone in her own hand...That's when something strange happenned and Lena began to feel...different...dizzy...confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Mrs...Luthor are you Okay ?! \" Wilson didn't expect the reaction of the Black's kryptonite. Lena let it fall on the ground, and all the Dr can see was...as if Lena Luthor's body was getting splitted from the upper part at first. He thought it was an hallucination, but now he was seeing with his own eyes a second body of the woman standing next to the original one, having the same movements, the two Lena acting like a mirror.

With that in mind he dropped the device and ran out of the lab, setting off the quarantine protocols as he did, hoping Lena would be able to fix herself, as well as having no intention of informing Supergirl or the shadowy organisation she works with abut this incident. He grimaces just thinking about it, the fact Supergirl disapproves of their boss's work was the worst kept secret in L Corp, and after coming so close Wilson would rather continue believing their city's protector was better than Superman but presumed the opportunity to tell Lena <i>'I told you so' </i>would be too much to resist and the blond would come across as a smug cunt, similar to the Man of Steel himself at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft alone to their devices the Lena's continued to mirror their actions until the energy drain of the separation caused them to droop, one falling against a table, while due to the room being much less mirrored than the ladies the other fell to the ground, her head bouncing as she does so. The Lena at the table slowly pulls herself to her feet, clicking her tongue as she sees the shrinking beamer sitting in front of her, practically begging to be used on something... or someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a groan Lena begins to sit up, her eyes blink owlishly when she finds herself staring into an identical gaze, the only exception being the smile... one she'd seen on Alexander's face many times that last year before his incarceration. She didn't really have much more time to process before there was a blinding flash of purple light, followed by what felt like her brain overheating inside her skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena smiles as her double shrinks down, stopping at about 3 inches if her estimates were correct. Her long bony fingers wrap around the shrunken woman as she moves her to the bench, keeping the beamer out of reach as she lets the ravenette try to get her bearings, adjusting the collar of her black jacket as well as smoothing out the creases of her white blouse (Yeah went the Bakura method, Dark one is wearing dark clothing over the lighter clothes they are both wearing, in this case a black suit jacket over a white blouse)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena's head stops spinning and she finally has a moment of clarity... which is ruined by the giant form of her doppelganger grinning down at her, arms crossed over her bust and elbows resting on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hello darling, I must say both the kryptonite experiment as well as the beamer are quite successful if I do say so myself. I wonder why Alex never tried to use the device on Clark, after all the blueprints were from his old archives'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Probably because he wanted to show he was better, but didn't have your dominatrix fetish' the smaller Lena replies with a flick of her hair<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Our, darling, we are both Lena Luthor after all, well I'm more her right now but that's beside the point, besides it's not domination, it's microphilia' she picks up the device and points it at the wall 'Oh imagine if we used this on Supergirl, what fun we could have with her' she mimes pulling the trigger, even making sci-fi laser noises (Dark Lena coocoo for cocopops, but also more relaxed then normal Lena, mostly because she doesn't give a shit what people think about her in a general sense, the normal people of the world can go fuck themselves their opinions mean nothing to her)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We can't, National City needs it's protector, plus if we do anything to Supergirl the DEO will put us in a hole in the ground and make sure we never get out again, plus Kara will be mad at us. We can't lose her, not so soon after Supergirl's stabbed us in the back' good Lena pleads, her darker half sighs, it feels wrong agreeing with her lessor side, but given they both have the original's genius level intellect she is able to argue coherently to the point she can't really argue, plus she was just making a joke, even shrunken, trying to contain a Kryptonian sounds like it would be a pain in the ass to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I suppose you're right, not that it matters, as I'll find some other toys to play with, I have a few in mind already' her grin is predatory, Light Lena cringes, knowing something bad was coming for her 'But first I need to clear up a loose end' she reaches behind her back and unclips her necklace, letting it fall onto the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Oh shit!'</i> LL thinks, trying to make a break for it but she gets grabbed by DL before she gets far. With the materials and equipment in the lab Lena was able to quickly create a set of restraints for her annoying double, as well as harness so she could actually accomplish her little plan. Humming as she did Lena easily attaches the belt of the harness to her necklace, adjusting it for at least some comfort, they were both the same being after all and she wasn't masochistic or as self loathing as most people believe her to be. Then she lifts it up, ignoring the struggling woman as she reattaches the clasp, Light Lena finding herself buried in her Dark counterpart's pillowy bosom, deep enough that while they could see the chain there was no chance they could see or even suspect she was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that dealt with Lena walks over to the security panel and uses her code to disengage the quarantine, though not before slipping the shrink beamer into the inner pocket of her jacket. As she leaves the lab she hears the familiar click of heels before Jess runs around the corner, nearly running into her boss in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Miss Luthor you're okay! Wilson told me about the accident and the quarantine alert, I'm glad to see you're alright' Jess babbles to Lena's amusement, she hands move to the device, knowing her cute little assistant would be even cuter if she was littler, but stopping herself, she was the best assistant she'd ever had, the Kara Danvers to her Cat Grant, who else would put up with the nearly weekly assassination attempts? No, Jess stays as she is, maybe she'll even be brought in on Lena's little secret later on<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm fine darling the threat has been dealt with' Lena says with a comforting smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Um, if you don't mind me asking, what happened?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The research into finding a non military use for kryptonite had reached a potential breakthrough, unfortunately Black Kryptonite had the problematic and previously unknown side effect of absorbing all negative thoughts and feelings in a person who touched it with their bare skin and use it to create a darker double of them. I suppose the only good thing about my shitty childhood is nothing she had to say I hadn't heard many times before from mother so she didn't bother me too much, we struggled and...' Lena bites her lip and Jess sees her fists clench '...I stabbed her in the throat with a scalpel. Her body faded to smoke when she died, so I'm not sure if she was physically there or just a mental trick but I don't really care. It stays in a lead lined box until I say so, that's the main thing'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess purses her lips 'Are you okay Lena?' she asks, much like the 2 Lena's she noticed that while physically identical the darker version's accent was thicker and more noticeable, something usually only seen when the original had been angry, amused or drunk, which all things considered make sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I will be fine Jess, it's not everyday you kill yourself though' Lena tries to joke but both knew it felt strained and Jess thankfully let it drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo... who will be Lena's 1st victim seeing as Jess is in the clear?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) <b>Kara</b>: Despite the blond's clear obliviousness to most of her flirtations, (besides her eyes wandering to her exposed cleavage more often than would be considered normal) Lena had stakes a claim on the sunny reporter. So with her lighter side unable to really do anything to stop her Lena take Karas as her pet/plaything, the fact she gets to take Supergirl's friend away from her too is just a bonus<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) <b>Sam</b>: Even though Lena, Alex and even Supergirl have told Sam what Reign did wasn't her fault, the part Kryptonian still felt guilt and a need to run away from all the pain <i>she</i> caused. Given Sam had basically given Ruby over to Alex, Lena saw no problems with helping Sam to disappear, it's just disappearing was code for getting shrunken down and becoming her toy, the girl had enough self loathing after this past year Lena probably wouldn't need to do much do have her submit to her, she might even accept it outright for all she knew.</span></div></div>",

She tried to yell, but Sam was crying enought loud to hear a tiny voice from DL's chest. But DL noticed this and put her hand on her chest, smothering her captive's screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam then stopped to cry, trying to think about what she could do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Lena...what do you think i should do if i can't leave and just disappear ? \" She asked, making Dark Lena smiling for a second as this was the question she was waiting for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" You know...Maybe you should pay for what Reign as done. And if you really wanna disappear, i have an idea that can do both. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What are you talking about ? \" Sam get confused, then Lena pulled out the shrinking device from her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I can shrink you with this, and keep you safe with me.

But clearly Lena's rational side won out and she's speaking from her heart. It didn't help Sam that her own heart was saying similar things: Reign was a part of her, that means she was Sam's responsibility, and what she did... all that blood is on her hands, even more so when you consider they technically shared a body. Besides, as mistresses go, Lena's not a bad choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay, let's do this, I was already on the way out so I might as well leave with you so to speak' Sam finally decides, her downcast head missing DL's wide grin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Marvellous darling' she chuckles before firing the device, shrinking her down to the same size as her double. Taking advantage of the dizziness caused by the shrinking process Lena picks up her tiny plaything and brings her up to eye level 'Now as my friend I should probably give you the best riding conditions, those being nestled between my breasts' her grin widens and shows all her teeth 'Unfortunately that room is occupied, so you'll have to make do with the rear seating'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wha...'

But she wasn\u2019t aware of the fact that Lena was busy these days. After many experiments with dwarfstar and kryptonite she managed to create a shrinking ray and synthetic black kryptonite. But in all this confusion, Lena forgot both on her table. Kara entered the building and immediately saw them. When she got closer she could not resist but touch the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright light filled the room and suddenly we gad two Karas. One was dressed as a civilian while the other one wore her supergirl outfit. both knew what happened. He mother once told her about the different kinds of kryptonite. Here the thoughts of the supergirl Kara:<br>\r\n\u201eBlack kryptonite.  But I feel like I want to hug and protect every human in the world at once. That means the other one is my evil counterpart. But what is right do to. I can\u2019t kill her but I don\u2019t want to be killed either. Uwu\u201c<br>\r\nAfter finishing this philosophical thought, the other kara grabbed the kryptonite that lied on the ground and attacked. Unfortunately for her, not only the kindness, also her strength was only a power the good part has. Kara easily blocked the attack and by accident, she killed the evil kara. Now she\u2019s the only kara left. After trying to digest what happened, Kara looked at the ray and had an idea.</span></div></div>",

That was the problem when there was no vilain to fight anymore. The team was boring, and had no other choices than hearing the Captain yells everyday. Mike didn't care, sometimes he even made things worst between Sara and Zari as he loved to see two sexy women fighting. Ray on the otherside, tried to reason with them, but he realized enought soon that doing that only put his life in danger.<br>\r\nAs the other team members, they found some other distractions, ignoring Sara and Zari as long as there was not any  new anachronism to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis day, the Captain knew this couldn't last any longer. No missions, and trapped in the timeship with a woman who didn't like to be ruled. How many times Sara tried to speak nicely with her ? She couldn't say but almost everytime it turned into a drama for stupid reasons. It had to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Captain Lance, the team is reunited for the meeting.\" Gideon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Thanks. I'm coming.\" Sara knew she had to talk with her crew and made this meeting happenning in the main room of the timeship. She joined them, everyone waiting to know what was this about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" All right guys. I'll make t short : i think we all need some vacations. So you are free to go wherever you want.\" the Captain said, causing some enjoyment among the crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" YEAAAH ! Send me back to a time with Knights ! I always wanted to be a knight ! \" Mike growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I agree with Mike, but...send me somewhere else, really far to him please \" Ray commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Vacations doesn't mean the opportunities for you guys to create another anachronism. It means you're going back to the present !\" Sara specified, knowing that some idiots like Mike would ask something like this. \" I'm going to give you all a watch so i can contact you if something happens\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara gave a watch to the crew as she said, except for Zari who was not surprised. She glanced at the Captain ; \" This is your only way to get rid of me ? Why don't you just tell me that you don't want me in the crew anymore ? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I told you. You are free to go, i won't be the one who fire you. I still think i can make something with you. \" Sara began with an arrogant tone. \"...you're staying with me on the waverider, that's why you don't need a watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZari didn't say anything, which meant that she didn't refuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Fine, now that things are clear, it's time to go move. Gideon, let's go back to Star City \"<br>\r\n________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took about an hour to leave each one of her crew (except Zari) to where they wanted to be, saying goodbye to each one of them, thought that some were disappointed to not spend their day off in the past. Once this was done, Sara was now alone with Zari in the waverider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" And so, what are we going to do ? Let me guess, you want me to clean the ship ? \" Zari was impatient to know what was Sara's plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" In fact....\" Sara took the shrink ray she had on her desk and pointed it at Zari. The totem bearer barely had time to understand what was going on when suddenly shrunk, facing not Sara's face, but Sara's boots walking toward her !</span></div></div>",

FUCK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Zari manages to hide herself long enough that the Captain gives up for the moment, only then does she move and try to find someone to help her (another Legend, or someone from either Team Arrow or Team Flash<br>\r\n2) Zari may be a great hacker, totem user and rather good at evading capture given her time in the ARGUS occupation, but Sara is a trained assassin, also she admits to being practically a ninja. So once Zari think's she gotten the better of her pursuer... she gets grabbed by either an annoyed Sara or amused Nyssa, and the games begin.</span></div></div>",

We will make things better and stop ARGUS taking over the world and enslaving basically everyone, you just won't be featuring as prominently as you had probably hoped'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZari looks contemplative 'You really thought this through, didn't you?' she asks to which Sara nods<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yep, even planned out an entire reward and punishment system, and given you some adjustment time of the entire vacation to get used to your new size as well as your place as my little one' Sara explains, leaving out that if Zari wasn't accepting of or broken by the time the others were back the girl would find her life rather than being her little buddy and plaything, to spending the rest of her life naked in a cage in Sara's room, only being let out when the Captain desires or when she wants to get adventurous with the right now still rather new arrangement she had with Ava &amp; Nyssa. She kind of hoped Zari could see being her pet was the best outcome before then, as that would be her point of no return otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZari's face was unreadable but Sara could hear very slight amusement when she asks 'So I guess me yelling I quit won't get me out of this?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Nope, just get you demoted from pet to object, at which point who cares what your opinions are you'll feel really nice right there' Sara answers with a similar jokey tone, rather liking she could make a woman pale so severely even after so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Zari doesn't quite agree, more just stop resisting which Sara decides to capitalise upon, taking her to her room and shoving a much softer side, as well as what Zari would be able to do if she behaved<br>\r\n2) Zari continues to resist, annoying Sara who decides to do her daily exercises with Zari in her shoe, maybe that will soften the stubborn brat up</span></div></div>",

The second part became more violent, as Sara decided to practice her kick, and fight skills. All of this last for about 30min, 30min of Hell for Zari who couldn't do anything. She even quickly lost strenght to fight the giant toes or even scream.

Tired the poor darling out it would seem, thought it would be best not to wake her'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara smiles before shaking her head 'No love, she needs to know it worked' she then plants a wet and sloppy kiss to her breasts directly on top of Ava, Nyssa groaning as Sara's tongue traces Arabic words into her skin, continuing to until she feels tiny fists against her lips<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn it Lance stop trying to drown me' Ava grumbles without heat, before smiling up to her first love<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sorry, but I did it, Zari is now officially our little pet. She's in a time out though...' she looks down to her foot, squeezing her toes so the wman would move and show she was still alive, then looking up to see neither were surprised by Zari's current position 'What?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You know we love you right?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It was obvious you and Zari were going to end up in this position, you two go at it like cats and dogs' Ava says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Or myself and Oliver' Nyssa adds helpfully, causing Sara to wince<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't remind me, I never want to think about the fact you married that guy' she grumbles, until Nyssa moves her head to look her in the eye<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I only did so because father forced my hand. The moment I became Ra's I dissolved the union due to never consummating the ceremony'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara grins widely 'So I'm still the only one to fist you?' she asks cheekily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If you mean getting your tiny body shoved into my hungry cunt headfirst to be fisting than yes' Nyssa grins and Sara blushes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Anyway, maybe one of us should take a crack at getting Zari to our side' Ava suggests 'I could do it, a more level head as well as a closer size difference for the moment might make things a little more palatable'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Or I could do it, you know I deeply enjoyed making the shrunken prisioners into pets, as well as the fact the defiant ones tasted devine' Nyssa purrs, until Sara boops her on the nose and reminds her no eating her crew, even if she is like a bug or rodent in size<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo who gets the next crack at Zari?</span></div></div>",

Then I did a few other things just to make sure I can do what I want, pretty easy actually\" Zari answers casually, not helping Sara's mood<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zari Tomaz you will change me back right this minute, I am your captain and you will do as you're told! Gideon, call the others, tell them what's happened\" to Sara's surprise the AI didn't respond or make a sound \"What did you do to Gideon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZari hums \"It's on the list of things I did, pretty minor actually, isn't that right Gideon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Captain Tomaz\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara pales as her mind can only think <i>'oh fuck'</i> \"Captain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. After shrinking you down you were no longer able to perform your duties as captain, so to skip all the arguments I hacked Gideon and made myself the new captain of the Waverider. I also gave you a new designation, as my property\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zari this isn't funny, I'm not your property!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're not a person, much too small, and as captain it's only fair the person who's pet you are, is me\" she grins as she picks Sara up, bringing her close to her face \"I have plans for you, don't cha know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Zari admits to having had a bit of a crush on Sara when they first met, and how could she not? Sara was a badass with big tits and a thick rear, the future girl was hooked. After everything Zari doesn't think she'd make a good girlfriend for the totem bearer now, but she can be put to good use and bring her the pleasure she's given so many other girls up and down the timeline. Maybe there's a romantic future for Sara, or maybe Zari lets her sleep between her tits rather than in her ass or taped to the sole of her foot<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) With how much of a pain in the ass Sara has been for Zari, she thought it was best if she does something about it. Standing up Zari pulls open her pants and drops Sara between her ass cheeks, clenching her muscles around the former captain and walking out to see to her new duties<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Zari decides to start Sara off with something simple, her personal foot rubber. Of course given how slippery the blond can be and her background as a ninja assassin Zari takes precautions, putting the girl in a box rather than on the ground and then pinning her on her back with her foot, leaving Sara no choice but to rub or be painfully, though non fatally crushed underfoot and then moved to her boot as an insole</span></div></div>",

The blond was reminded of when she first saw the girl, wanting to grab those big jiggling butt cheeks in her hands, squeeze them and bury her face between them... she really was rethinking that idea as she looks into an endless abyss that was Zari's ass crack<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like the view Sara? I know you've been watching\" Zari teases \"Now, given what i'm working with back there, it's no surprise I can't put you against one of my cheeks, as my panties aren't quite big enough to keep you secure, if I left you there you would eventually fall off and when you slid into my pants either escape on end up in my shoe and be unknowingly ground into my insole, which is a waste don't you think, if I'm going to make you feel like you're less than the ground I walk on, I want to be doing in consciously\" she smirks over her shoulder \"So instead you're going between my nice big butt cheeks, I'm sure you'll stay nice and toasty in there\" she winks and pushes Sara into the crack, not stopping until the former leader is buried in ass flesh \"Perfect\" Zari purrs, clenching her cheeks and moans at the struggling Sara pounding against her ass \"Hey Sara,  a little challenge for you while you in there\" that got her attention Zari assumes as the movement stills \"I'm going to put you IN my ass eventually, it's a guarantee, probably once you being as the mercy off my ass gets boring. The thing is, you get in my butt on your own, without me pushing you in, and I halve how long I leave you in there. I'll leave you to mull it over, I have captain duties to perform\" with that Zari proceeds to ignore her passenger and walks out of Sara's former, now her quarters, to inform the crew of the changes as well as actually do things to keep the ship and team running almost smoothly, luckily nobody has asked what happened to Sara, yet and she wasn't going to tell them she was currently being used as a chew toy for her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Sara decides that like Zari says she's going to end up there eventually might as well get this over with and crawls her way into Zari's ass, also letting herself enjoy the experience as she was unlikely to be getting much joy in her life anytime soon. Problem for Zari is having a little person wriggling around in her asshole makes it very difficult to perform her duties with any kind of professionalism or focus<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Whatever Sara expected would happen next, Zari using the fabricator to form a butt plug around most of her body, so only her tits and above were still free of metal or plastic wasn't it. Zari has decided Sara isn't going to see light very much or very often, and she's going to enjoy every moment of it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Getting bored of Sara not moving in her butt Zari decides to see if she can scare the girl into amusing her. She tells her as a tiny person she's not meat, and more importantly not unclean, meaning she's going to eat parts of the blond and use the med bay's future tech to grow everything back and keep doing it again and again, well if she tastes good that is...</span></div></div>",

She then pressed a series of buttons on the console and watched her creation take shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Sara whatever Zari had planned was a very strange process, feeling silicone form and condense around her body, as sell as moaning when offshoots filled her ass and pussy with the flexible material, then continued rising, stopping it's ascent near the middle of her ribs, directly below the swell of her previously huge bosom, before thickening and forming a fairly uniform pillar around her, with a thicker base about the height of her palms width. Sara tried to move, free herself from the structure, but the rods in her privates ensured any movement brought a wave of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the process was complete, and a grinning Zari pulls Sara from the compartment \"figured out what you are yet?\" She asks to which Sara shakes her head \"the fabricator can make anything, so I decided to make myself a sex toy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zari, don't you dare...\" Sara begins, but is interrupted when Zari puts all her free flesh into her mouth, sucking gently before letting her out with a pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you'll like the new job Sara, as my butt plug you'll spend most of your day in my luscious ass, pleasuring me as I go about my business, you might even get off yourself \" she grins and bends over, rubbing Sara against her jean clad ass before pushing it and her panties out of the way \"say hello to your new home\" Zari teases, using her free hand to spread her asscheeks and show off her winking pucker, before sending Sara deep inside. The pain from having something Sara's size enter her ass, was quickly overtaken, by the pleasure of her squirming, as well as the power trip she was getting having the former assassin, helpless after being swallowed whole by her perky ass. As she stands and readjusts her pants, Zari gives herself a spank, feeling the girl inside only writhe more frantically, and Allah did she feel good doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) even if she's shrunken she's still a human being, meaning Zari has to let her out for food and drink, during which Sara could try to escape, somehow<br>\r\n2) With how good she feels in Zari's ass, the totem bearer decides to see just how Sara feels when she's in the front instead of the back, using the White Canary, as her little blonde dildo<br>\r\n3) People are getting suspicious of Sara's '<i>absence</i>' so Zari has to tell them something resembling the truth in order to calm everything, but what would that even be?</span></div></div>",
