The prideful shinigami drove his muscular fingers into the sand, gripping it while shaking with rage and fear of his assailant. He'd tried everything he knew but the hollow was too strong, even his Bankai failed to penetrate the hollow's spiritual pressure far enough to damage his clothing. He looked up and glared at the smirking face of the hollow that towered over his tiny self, his face himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red-haired Shinigami was sent on a mission to investigate a series of missing souls in the real world. It turned out to be a powerful hollow which have been shrinking souls for easier hunting and killing. The hollow is also be able to take form of any soul, so it can take form of the red-haired Shinigami. Unfortunately, Renji didn't know about that until he was shrunken down to the size of a bug, facing the now giant hollow. \" Well, now it's time to stomp the crap out of you and end your life!\" The hollow said with Renji's voice and his usual cocky tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji tried to run away as the giant sole start descending on him, but was paralyzed because of fear. Then, he remembered about the contingency plan he once planned for this kind of situation. He fished inside his pocket and pulled out one small purple pill he stole from the Urahara's shop. This pill was still in experiment and was said that depend on the situation, he can teleport the person who eat the pill to the safest place. Renji didn't know about the side effects but it dosen't matter in this situation. He quickly gulped down the pill and immediately he felt a burning pain on his chest and a tugging feeling in his gut. He felt very dizzy and blacked out and teleported to another place as the hollow stomped down onto the ground. \"Where did that little bitch go?\" The hollow thought as he checked his sole, expecting to see a smeared body but saw nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** ******************************************************************************** ************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owww...,my head... Where am I?\" Renji groaned as he has just woken from his blackout. After he checked that he is alive, the first thing he noticed is the musty smell around him, his surrounding is all dark, and he seemed to be buried under something soft. *cough*cough* \"Oh my god! What the hell is this thing?\" Renji mumbled as he took a whiff of the nasty odor around him. \"Oh my god, I can't handle it anymore! I need to get out of here!!\" The red-haired Shinigami thought as he started to crawl towards the surface. As he crawled, he flet something moist and the odor seemed to be coming from everywhere. His face even once jammed into something slimy and salty, and the musky odor is overwhelming. Renji quickly wiped that thing off his face and spat some of that thing out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter crawling for a while, he finally crawled onto the surface. After gasping a few gulps of fresh air, he noticed that his sword is missing, and he thought that his sword must still being buried inside there. He also noticed that the 'ground' was colored, and the odor seems to be coming from the ground. It took a while for the red-haired Shinigami to realize that he was standing on a giant hamper of dirty laundry! The thing that his face jammed into is a pair of briefs, and the slimy thing that on his face is.... he quickly wiped his face thoroughly and spat all the residue in his mouth. He realized that he is in a male teenager's bedroom, according to the posters and all the other stuff. Oddly, the bedroom is clean for a male teenager's bedroom, with the tidy laundry and without the scraps on the floor, Renji quickly looked around and saw the humongous furniture around him. He recognized the furniture and realized that he was in Kurosaki Ichigo's bedroom! He wanted to get out of the laundry fast and started to run to the edge to climb down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a loud BOOMing noise. It was quickly followed by another BOOM\u2026then another\u2026then another. The booms were getting closer and Renji realized that the sound was footsteps. He tried to run quickly towards the edge and tried to climb down the hamper as someone enterd the room. Renji watched as the towering form of the orange-haired Substitute Shinigami, Kurosaki Ichigo appeared at the doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm home!\" Ichigo shouted as he walked inside his bedroom. Judging by his button-up shirt, Renji assumed that he just come back from school, and it must be a hot day, because his shirt was sweaty and stuck against his pecs and his abs sexily. Maybe because of his shrunken state, Renji was in awe of his towering rival and friend. \"Damn today is hot!\" Ichigo muttered as he wiped the sweat off his forehead and started to strip off his clothes. He took off his school shirt, revealing his large pecs, and a gorgeous eight pac. His biceps flexed as he removed his shirt, showing off the power of his huge arms. He quickly undid his zipper, and yanked his pants off, showing his tight undies with cartoon characters covering it. His bulge was huge, much bigger for a boy his age. His dick was pushing against the fabric, it looked eight inches long, and it wasn't even fully hardened! Ichigo's thighs flexed as he removed his tight pants, and his calves were very well toned. He wiggled out of his tight briefs, releasing that giant appendage concealed within. He removed his socks off of his huge feet, and tossed them towards the laundry hamper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji tried to dodge as he saw the giant sweaty socks flying towards him, but with no avail. He was completely covered by this sweaty clothing. A face full of male sweat was the last straw for Renji. He didn't care about the humiliation of his circumstances any more. He needed help from anyone who could hear him, and he need it now. He crawled out from under the dirty socks and screamed. \"HEY!! ICHIGO!! HELP ME!!! DAMN IT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped with glee as he saw the muscular giant started to walk towards him, as if the giant had noticed him. He continued to jump and shout his only saviour's name as Ichigo walked towards him and standing in front of the hamper. Renji was in awe with the titanic giant in front of him. His neck arched as his eyes climbed two muscular thighs, a light orange crown of pubes, a mountainous set of abs, two perfectly sculpted pecs, to Ichigo's handsome face. From this angle, Ichigo truly looks like a Greek god. The muscular body is glistening with sweat under the light. Renji shouted his rival's name loudly, hoping he would look down and notice him, but Ichigo seemed not to notice him. Instead of looking down, Ichigo started to flex his muscles in front of him! His biceps rose like mountains as he flexed, the veins was pumped with blood. His pecs bounced as he flexed and his eight pac abs clenched with pure power. Renji wondered why ichigo started to flex all of a sudden, as if he was trying to intimidate him. He turned around and he saw he was looking at...... himself. He was standing in front of a mirror! Ichigo didn't even notice him! He was just want to admire his muscular body!  Renji continued to stare his friend admiring his own body as he tried to think of a way to get himself noticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Renji tried to figure out a way to get noticed, Ichigo mumbled something as he bend down to grab something from the hamper. Renji was so consumed with his thought as he didn't notice Ichigo grabbed something and didn't got the time to get away. Renji was completely trapped in that thing as Ichigo started to putting it on. It is......</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After flexing and admiring his body for a while, Ichigo looked up at the clock and cursed.\" Damn, I'm going to be late!\" He quickly looked around for something to wear but couldn't spot any clean clothes. Obviously he hadn't done his laundry for days. He looked down on the hamper and spotted a pair of tight black used briefs. \"Guess this will do.\" He spoke as he bent down to grab the briefs with Renji in it. The red-haired Shimigami shrieked and grabbed hold of the fabric as Ichigo grabbed it from the hamper and dropped it onto the rugged floor. When the briefs hit the floor, Renji was dazed and disoriented\u2026but physically fine. He rummaged around in the folds of the black fabric until he reached an opening and peeked outside. His brown eyes widened as he looked up to see the towering, naked form of Ichigo above him. His rival's body looked damp with the sweats and his well toned muscular form glistened. Ichigo always has an impressive physique, but not always like to show it. Renji had caught glimpses of his rival impressive body, and was amazed of the young bodybuilder's body. Since then ,he started to work out hard to match his rival's physique.\"Well, up we go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji didn't have time to think about the past, since Ichigo had already introduced his two bare sweaty feet into the briefs. Renji yelped and avoided those sweaty feet while crawling to a different part of the briefs. He looked up and saw the giant Ichigo standing above him, his privates and muscular ass full on display. Ichigo bent down, showing his full ass, grabbed the briefs with both hands before yanking them up his legs. The bug-sized Soul Reaper could only scream as he was pulled up with the briefs......and heading right to the giant's bare ass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNOOO!!!\u201d Renji cried before Ichigo pull the briefs on completely and he was slammed hard against the teenager\u2019s right butt cheek. The pair of tight briefs had pinned him against the warm, sweaty flesh and prevented him from moving at all. He bit, poked and squirmed with all his might, but didn\u2019t accomplish anything except getting a mouthful of ass sweat and prickling himself with the tiny hairs on Ichigo\u2019s butt. The smelly stench of the butt didn\u2019t make it anything easier though. The stench was horrible and it made Renji want to puke!! Renji tried to cover his nose but both his hands were pinned against the butt cheek. Renji hold his breath and hoped that this horrible ordeal would soon be over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere we go.\u201d Ichigo made sure that the briefs was on nice and tight before he started grabbing other worn clothes from the hamper. He pulled on a pair of tight athlete shorts, adding another layer to Renji\u2019s prison. The red-headed Shimigami could feel the heat inside the briefs quickly increased as he started to sweat. After covering himself with a still wearable tank top, he snatched up a few other things and slipped on a pair of socks and sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter checking himself in front of a mirror one last time, the orange-haired young man dashed out his house and into the sunlight outside. \u201cIf I run, I maybe can still make it in time.\u201d Ichigo said to himself as he broke out into a jog. He was completely unaware of the little passenger trapped against his ass as he ran. Renji groaned in discomfort as the ass shook due to Ichigo\u2019s movement. To make matters worse, the ass was starting to sweat even more, like a waterfall to Renji. The revolting butt odor was getting even worse for Renji. These combined with Ichigo running was making Renji nauseous, but this was the least of Renji\u2019s worries! He could feel himself slowly moving against his will; The sweat on the butt was causing him to slip towards the middle! If this continues, it was only a matter of time before Renji slipped right between the giant\u2019s butt cheeks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hell no!\u201d Renji cried, getting a mouthful of teen sweat, as he desperately clawed at Ichigo\u2019s muscular firm ass. \u201c Get me out of here!! ICHIGO!!! This is not happening to me!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the way, where is Ichigo heading?   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Ichigo ran towards the gym, he didn't notice that almost everyone on the street seems to be eyeing on him as he ran past them, maybe because he try to navigate the shortest route to the gym. Men stare it with envy and women licked their lips in lust as the handsome orange-haired teenager ran past. Their eyes gazed at both muscular arms that show off beside his body. The men and women stare at the pecs that jutted out proudly against the tank top, the abs that was clearly visible through the fabric, and the muscular thighs that flexed while the teenager ran. As Ichigo ran past, their eyes were glued to the muscular firm ass that showed through the tight athlete shorts, unknowing that there is a little man fighting for survival inside it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the shorts, the situation was getting more hellish by the second for Renji. He was fighting for his life as he struggled not to slip towards Ichigo's smelly butt crack, but the swaying and sweating isn't helping. Renji could feel that he was getting more and more nearer to the middle. He tried to grab some butt hair for holding, but the sweat has made the hair too slippery to hold for a long time. Renji tried to shout for Ichigo's attention, but instead of getting his attention, he got a mouthful of Ichigo's  butt sweat. Renji groaned in frustration as he tried to get his friend attention, but instead he got unknowingly tortured by his friend\u2019s giant body. Renji silently prayed that hopefully this ordeal will soon be over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, as if his prayers were answered, the movement ceased and Renji wasn\u2019t slipping anymore. Outside, Ichigo had finally reached the local gym. He wiped the sweat from his forehead while resting for a while and glanced at his watch. Realized that he was already late, he quickly rushed into the gym. Unfortunately for Renji, a sudden jolt is all it needed for Renji to slip into the butt crack. Renji was resting from all that he endured just now and he couldn\u2019t get a hold onto anything when Ichigo suddenly moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNOOOOO!!\u201d Renji cried as he slipped between Ichigo\u2019s massive glutes as if they are swallowing him whole. He was wedged deep between them like a hotdog in its bun. Ichigo had worn those shorts that cupped his butt cheeks so firmly, Renji was squeezed by his twitching anal muscles as he slide deeper into the butt crack. The walls that hug him are feverishly hot and slick, they smeared a vile, bitter taste against his lips. He tried to spat the bitter taste out of his mouth, but when he opened his mouth, he accidently swallowed a big droplet of sweat. His face twisted with disgust as the foul liquid dropped into his stomach. He tried to crawl out from his smelly prison but to no avail, as the muscles are clenching him tightly, made him unable to move. Renji made a mental note to himself for not opening his mouth again as to avoid getting another mouthful of the teen\u2019s ass sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Ichigo quickly rushed to the locker room and started to get ready for his workout. He decided to go shirtless, showing off his pecs and eight pack abs, since it was hot inside here too. After putting his things into his locker, he went to the treadmill and started to jog. This day turned out to be a hot day, and there were only some regular members at the gym. Those members seemed to stare at Ichigo\u2019s body as he jogged at the treadmill, admiring his impressive torso and his thick thighs, but Ichigo seemed to be oblivious about those staring. Inside the shorts, Renji desperately tried to grab hold on anything he could, but every jolt or movement that Ichigo made had knocked him back to place, or worse, seemed to let him slide deeper into the butt crack. There was nothing else Renji could do though, as both mounds of flesh beside him pressed against him rhythmically, squeezed the air out of him, as Ichigo jogged at the treadmill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Ichigo finished his warm up as he walked towards the weight lifting section. Renji could feel that the movement ceased as the jogging turned into walking. He was suddenly filled with hope as he believed that Ichigo had finally finished whatever he was doing just now. Unknown to him, this was just the beginning. Upon entering the weight lifting section, Ichigo approached a nearby bench and sat down on it. He tossed the small dumbbell he was holding away and reached for a stack of bigger ones. His large hand grabbed the biggest one there, several pounds of pure steel, and held it with both hands. Taking a deep breath, the orange-haired  teenager began pumping as he lifted the weight to his chest and then lowered it. While he repeated this action again and again, Renji was busy trying to survive underneath the immense weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderneath Ichigo struggled Renji, barely able to move under Ichigo\u2019s godly crushing weight. All those heavy muscles he had stared when at Ichigo\u2019s room were now above him, their weight trying to squash him like a bug. \u201cS-Someone\u2026H-help me\u2026\u201d Renji begged as he weakly struggled against Ichigo\u2019s bulk. Nothing he did budged the behemoth and his body heat was slowly cooking the shrunken Shinigami, making him sweat profoundly while all he could do in exchange was waiting helplessly. All those extra sweat that Ichigo produced while he was working out didn\u2019t help either, as they were threatening to drown Renji. Every drop of sweat splashed at Renji\u2019s face like a waterfall, and he was forced to breathe at the musky scent of Ichigo\u2019s butt to avoid suffocation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn minutes Renji couldn\u2019t take the heat and pressure anymore, he was slowly losing his conscious. His thought fought to stay awake but in the end he blacked out, his last thought being of his body succumbing to the bigger male while he was unconscious. Then,...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Ichigo was just about to feel pumped from the workout, an audible ring tone was heard from nearby. Interrupted, Ichigo stopped his pumping motion and glared at the surrounding, looking for the source of the sound. He hated to be interrupted when he was concentrated on doing something. His eyes focused on his bag that he left nearby, realized that the noise was from his phone. Ichigo groaned as he let go of the dumbbell, and got up to grab his phone. That several pounds of pure steel landed on the floor with a very loud clang , drawing other members\u2019 attention. Ichigo ignored the attention as he fished out the smart phone that his dad bought him a few weeks ago as a birthday gift. Ichigo missed his old phone, as he still don't know exactly how to use this new smartphone except some basic function. Without looking at who's calling, Ichigo quickly answered the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Ichigo said, with an annoyed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ichigo nii-san?\" said Yuzu, Ichigo's younger sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuzu? What's going on?\" Ichigo quickly softened his tone, and wondered why Yuzu would call him out of the blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh. It's nothing.\" Yuzu replied. \u201cIt's just that it's nearly evening and I forgot to buy the ingredients for tonight\u2019s dinner. I was hoping that you can help me buy those ingredients?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I just started my workout session.\u201d Ichigo said, not wanting to stop his exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, okay\u2026\u2026\u201d Yuzu replied, knowing that his brother doesn\u2019t like to be interrupted when exercising. \u201cBut, since you\u2019re the best brother in the world, could you help your little sis for this time?\u201d Yuzu quickly added.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut-\u201cIchigo was cut off by a lot of pleases and praising for the other side of the phone.\u201d Fine.\u201d Ichigo grumbled, finally giving in to his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! You\u2019re the best, Ichi-nii-san!!\u201d Yuzu exclaimed. \u201d I\u2019ll send you the list of things after a while. Thanks, Ichi-nii-san!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk,ok\u2026\u201d Ichigo muttered as he hung up the phone. After a while, his phone received a message from Yuzu. Still unfamiliar with the new phone, Ichigo tried a few times for a while to open the message. Ichigo scrolled through the list of things, most of it were ingredients for tonight\u2019s dinner. His thoughts wandered as he scrolled through the list, and focused back when he saw something special. \u201cP.S. Someone is waiting for you at home now. Be back at 6.30pm!! :)\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo muttered a few curses as he noticed the time.\u201d Oh, shoot!! It\u2019s already six o\u2019clock!!\u201d Ichigo said as he quickly picked up his things, and rushed into the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji was started to regain conscious as the enormous pressure relieved from above. \u201dUgh\u2026my head. Where am I?\u201d Renji muttered as he tried to regain his senses. Renji then realized that he was still stuck to Ichigo\u2019s ass. He panicked and struggled to get free but the sweat stuck his body to the muscular ass like glue. He groaned with discomfort as the ass muscles flexed and clenching him between them tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden movement jostles Renji around his trap. It seemed that Ichigo was going somewhere suddenly and Renji started to slip into the hole beneath him. Renji tried to grab on something but everything was still slippery and wet from all the sweat. Fortunately, the movement abruptly came to a stop, halting Renji from slipping to his doom. Light shone into his trap and the briefs was removed. Looking around, Renji could see that he was still trapped between two slabs of muscular flesh, and he had a very pretty view of Ichigo\u2019s well developed backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo rushed into the locker room and started packing things up. Making sure that no one is in the locker room, he started to strip until he was naked.  Noticing that he didn\u2019t have time to shower, he quickly pulled out a washcloth from his bag and started wiping the sweat on his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji practically screamed as a giant white fuzzy object showed up in front of him. The object pressed against him tightly as it moved up and down. As the object moved away, Renji was dislodged from the ass and stuck to the white object. He was well past the point of screaming now as he was rubbed against the muscular backside he was staring at just now. Renji got a taste of the white fuzzy object, linked it to the action Ichigo was doing, and realized he was stuck on a washcloth. He was forced to explore his giant rival\u2019s body in a hard way. He nearly puked when he was face-first jammed onto Ichigo\u2019s crotch, the musk was overwhelming and was forced to gulp down all the ball sweat. He groaned with discomfort as he was roughly pressed against each ab, felt the hardness of the muscle against his body, with each ab as large as a car compared to him, as the giant flexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter wiping his muscular chest, Ichigo rubbed the washcloth along his arm, over the bulging bicep. Renji felt the muscle power beneath him as he was pressed against the hardened bicep. The washcloth then ran up into Ichigo's under arm, and then into his arm pit. Renji was quickly embedded in the orange hair, and as he realized it was curlier than the hair on the giant\u2019s head. He felt my arms and legs get wrapped up. He was trapped. The giant closed his arm, encasing Renji between his defined hard bicep and the side of his pectoral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo caught a whiff of himself as the slipped on a pair of clean gym shorts. \u201cMan, I reek!\u201d he thought. \u201cWell, I suppose some people have to like it.\u201d He muttered to himself as he slipped on a clean tight T-shirt, which shows off his muscular body, and unknowingly encased one tiny passenger to its prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter packing up his things, Ichigo quickly dashed out of the gym and started to jog to the nearest grocery store. His arm swung as he jogged, and Renji was grounded against the side of his hard chest. His armpit was still smelly and he was starting to sweat again. It was much worse than Renji\u2019s last trip at the ass, since the sweat and the smell was really intense plus the grounding. Renji could only pray that he would be found by Ichigo soon, since he cannot take much of this anymore. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a long jog from the local gym, the substitute Soul Reaper had finally reached the nearest supermarket near his house, which is a long way from the gym. Panting and sweating profusely, Ichigo wiped sweats off his brow as he took a breather in front of the supermarket. As he walked into the supermarket, he felt a contrast in temperature between his body and the cool air inside, feeling the cool breeze flow against his hot body. He let out a relaxed sigh as he pulled out the smartphone and tried to open the message. He is still really not familiar with the function of the smartphone so it took a while for him to open the message, while enjoying the cool temperature of the air condition. Unknown to him, an orange-haired tall muscular teenager usually stand out in a normal supermarket, which easily attracted many attention from the customers and workers of this supermarket. Almost everyone noticed the handsome teenager as he walked in, his head taller than the racks in the supermarket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the ride, Renji was feeling worse and worse with every jog. He was starting to get dizzy from all the motion, his face was turning green and the motion sickness has finally getting to him. He tried to have steady breath and forced himself not to spill his guts out, but the smell wasn\u2019t helping either. Although the musk wasn\u2019t as worse as his last trip to the ass, it certainly wasn\u2019t better.  The sweat was also raining on him non-stop, and a few drops of sweat managed to seep into his mouth. He tried to cough the taste out, but it only made more sweat flow into his mouth. He could only gulped down the foul liquid forcefully into his stomach, and made a mental note to himself not to open his mouth again. As he finally couldn\u2019t hold his urge to puke, the movement abruptly came to a stop. He shouted Ichigo\u2019s name for help, but the giant\u2019s own breathing sound has covered Renji\u2019s plea for help. He could feel that Ichigo was bending down, hands on his hips, taking a breather from the long journey. Suddenly, he felt a rush of cold wind flowing through the chasm between the giant\u2019s bicep and pecs, making his prison more bearable. He was tangled between the armpit hairs when he felt his giant friend moving, slower this time. He noticed the change in temperature, the air surround him become cooler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo finally managed to open the message, and scrolled through the grocery list. \u201cHmmm\u2026, beef, carrot, curry\u2026\u201d Ichigo read it in his mind as he scrolled through the grocery list. He thought of finding where all of the stuff is by himself but knew that it\u2019s going to take a lot of time. He quickly approached a nearby female grocery clerk, wanting to know where all those stuff is and quickly got home. Unknown to him, the female grocery clerk has already eyeing on him since his arrival, and could not take her eyes off him. Those toned arms, that muscular body, those thick muscular thighs\u2026\u2026 She could imagine herself lying in those arms, being caressed by those fingers, or being able to touch his muscular body, gliding her hands through his muscular pecs, his toned eight-pack abs\u2026\u2026 She was in her imaginary dream when Ichigo approached her. She finally noticed Ichigo was in front of her when he swung his hands in front of her face, trying to get her attention. She gave out a small yelp when she realized that her just met dream/crush was inches in front of her face, staring at her. Quickly, she checked if her hair was tidy, her uniform was aligned, making sure she was perfect, and gave him the sweetest smile she had, and asking:\u201d Yes, what can I do to help you?\u201d Ichigo asked where are all those things located in the grocery store, and showed him the list of things in his phone, while scratched the behind of his head, appeared embarrassed. The grocery clerk blushed a little bit as he came closer, as she could feel the heat radiated from his body, and hid her smirk when she was the handsome teenager in front of him scratched the behind of his head, appeared embarrassed.  She quickly led the way to all the places the things located, which was surprisingly at the same place. The grocery clerk kept purposely bumping into Ichigo, wanted to feel the muscles on Ichigo\u2019s body, and was satisfied with the feeling. Then, at the counter, the grocery clerk quickly go through all of the stuff, and was worried that he needed to carry all the groceries by himself. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Ichigo answered, \u201cI can handle it.\u201d He then lifted both of the grocery bag easily, without letting out a grunt. Before he left, the grocery clerk slipped a card into Ichigo\u2019s gym shorts pocket, and mouthed \u201cCall Me\u201d to Ichigo, which he could only nod with an embarrassing look. He then quickly got out of the supermarket, when he realized he didn\u2019t have much time left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the trip to the supermarket, Renji was feeling slightly better than at the outside,since he was in an air-conditioned place. Renji could feel the cool air flowing through his prison as his giant friend walked. Renji could not see a thing, his sight was blocked by the think dense forest of orange fuzzy hair. He could feel that Ichigo was talking, and was relieved when Ichigo lifted his arm, giving him some fresh air. During the brief relief, Renji scanned the surrounding through the armpit hair. He could see that Ichigo was at the supermarket, the place he went sometimes when he stayed at Urahara\u2019s house to buy stuffs, so probably Ichigo was doing the same. His relief was short-lived, however, when Ichigo lowered his arm again, encasing him with darkness. He tried to untangle himself from the armpit hair, but the think orange hair wrapped around him like tendrils, trying to trap its prey. Suddenly, he felt the bicep muscle beside him tightened, the space between both walls of flesh become smaller, pushing him against the hard pectoral muscle. He guessed that his giant captor was lifting something. He could only groaned with discomfort as the orange-haired teenager started to run again, and started sweating again since he was already outside. This trip was bound to be more unbearable, since Renji was grinding more harshly against his captor\u2019s body. Renji gritted his teeth as pain shot through his whole body with every grind, but he couldn\u2019t do anything due to his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a relatively short trip, Ichigo finally arrived to his house, the Kurosaki Clinic. He groaned as he heard the ruckus inside the house, the usual stuff that happened in the house. He let go of both of the grocery bags to the ground, let both of his hands and arms rest of a while. He rested his hands on his hips, and breathed in the evening air deeply, his chest heaving heavily. After the ruckus had ended, he heaved both of the grocery bag over his shoulder, and moved his body through the front door. He noticed that there is a pair of shoes he didn\u2019t recognize at the front door, indicating that there is visitor inside. \u201cI\u2019m back!!\u201d Ichigo shouted. Then, he heard some loud thumping coming from the corridor. With a sigh, he sidestepped out of the way as a large object flew away beside him, landing outside, face down. \u201cIchigo, your reflex has increased!\u201d Isshin, Ichigo\u2019s father, exclaimed, as he got up. \u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re an idiot, Baka!!\u201d Ichigo replied, as he walked into the kitchen. \u201cYuzu, I\u2019ve buy the stuff you wanted!\u201d Ichigo told Yuzu, who was preparing today\u2019s dinner. \u201cThanks, Ichi-nii!\u201d Yuzu replied,and hugged Ichigo. She then noticed the smell and Ichigo\u2019s body, and pinched her nose as she commented:\u201d Ichi-nii, you\u2019re smelly. Go shower!\u201d Ichigo chuckled at that comment, as he quickly hugged Yuzu, teasing with her. \u201cWho are you saying about being smelly, huh?\u201d Ichigo teased as he tickled her here and there, causing her to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIchigo!\u201d A familiar voice shouted, causing the orange-haired Substitute Shinigami to freeze. He quickly dropped Yuzu to the ground, and turned around to see the familiar face of\u2026\u2026  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was an ordinary day in Karakura Town.  Blue skies, white clouds birds chirping, no Hollows, no Arrancar, no bloody psychopaths wanted to become god. You know, the usual. That is until the peace and silence was interrupted by a large BOOM and suddenly black smokes were rising up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the backyard of the Kurosaki Clinic, a tall man with spiky black hair is stumbling out from the smoke-filled secret basement, covered in some sort of yellowish substance. The substance covered his whole body, on his clothes and even on his hair. The man tried to wash away the substances, but it\u2019s just too many.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the battle with Aizen, and Ichigo losing his Shinigami powers, Isshin Kurosaki has been working his ass off trying to find a way to restore his son\u2019s power. He could see that his son was acting more silent and closed off after losing his power. He hated to see that Ichigo acting this way. Every time he asked Ichigo if he was okay, he always said that he was fine, that now he can try to have a normal high school life. But he could see that his son has an undertone of sadness in his eyes. So, now, he\u2019s working on a reishi potion that he sneaked out from the Shiba clan family house that might have a chance to restore Ichigo\u2019s power. Unfortunately, something went wrong and now, he was covered in yellow slime and all work is lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously, what went wrong? Is it that I forgot to add that? Or did I add it too much? Or\u2026\u2026\u201d Isshin continued muttering as he walked back into his house. After having a shower and put his clothes into laundry, wearing only a towel on his waist, Ishhin sat on the couch, enjoying the uninterrupted peace of a Sunday morning. Apparently Yuzu forget to do laundry a few days ago, so he was forced to use Ichigo\u2019s towel. Today, he finally had he whole house to himself. Well, until Ichigo come back. Karin and Yuzu had gone to a one-month-camp, something about soccer and cooking\u2026\u2026 So they won\u2019t be back until next month. He was supposed to follow them to the camp, but at the last minute, Karin decided that it\u2019s too embarrassing for him to come with them, so she had locked him in a room when they depart, and told the neighbor to open the door an hour later. So now, only Ichigo didn\u2019t know that he\u2019s at home alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he felt a yawn coming out and he suddenly felt very sleepy. He tried to get up to his own room, but he couldn\u2019t even lift his arm up.  He was too tired to move. Eventually, he gave in to the sleepiness, leaned back on the couch, and drifted to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing he notice when he woke up is that he was under some kind of fabric. The fabric is moist and has a faint smell of body musk. He tried to lift his body, or tried to move around, but he found it difficult because of the heavy cloth pressing on him surrounded him like a huge tent. After what seemed like half an hour, Isshin was finally be able to crawl out from his cloth prison. The first thing he saw is the vast expanse that was once his living room. The TV loomed far away looked far bigger than a theater screen. The couch he\u2019s on looked like a mountain. The ceiling looked really far away. He noticed that the towel he\u2019s using just now was emanating a thick, pungent musk that is definitely not his and he also noticed a few pubic hairs that he didn\u2019t notice when he\u2019s using it. Those hairs are enormous to him!! \u201cOh shit, oh shit, I\u2019m shrunk!!\u201d Realization finally dawned onto him, and he started shouting profanities at the air, which would be comical if it isn\u2019t him that small. He estimated that he\u2019s roughly half an inch tall, which is somehow the same size of a flea, and he is naked. He glared at the pubic hair standing, humiliated that even one of the hairs is taller than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter calming himself down, Isshin started thinking on what to do now. He needs to get Ichigo\u2019s attention, obviously, to get help. \u201cIt must be the yellow substance causing this to happen to me\u2026\u201d He thought. Maybe he can ask Ichigo salvage what was left after the explosion, analyze the substance and hopefully find a cure. That is, until he can get his son\u2019s attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsshin Kurosaki is a resourceful man, and he actually has brains unlike what he usually portrayed himself. Hell, he is a doctor in the human world; he was also the Captain of the 10th division in the Soul Society! But now, he felt utterly helpless. Not only now he was reduced in size, the substance had prohibited the flow of reiatsu in his body, making him unable to use any of his Shinigami power, and now he is only a flea-sized soul in a slightly upgraded and durable Gigai, and who knows what else the substance had altered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, his only thought is to get off the couch. It is the most possible place Ichigo will go when he come back, although it is the best chance he can get his son\u2019s attention, Ichigo is not the most observant person, and judging by his size, his son wouldn\u2019t notice him and he will be crushed by his son\u2019s butt when Ichigo sit down, unknowingly obliterate his own father. The image of Ichigo\u2019s mountainous butt looms over him, casting a shadow and slowly lowering onto him, the sight of the enormous ass filling his vision, as it slowly smothering and crushing him, all while doing it unknowingly, making him shiver with fear. And the musk emanating from the towel isn\u2019t helping either, making him imagine that it is happening now. He shakes his head, clearing his thoughts as he continued thinking ways to approach the situation. But his thoughts always drift to the scenarios of him dying unknowingly in Ichigo\u2019s hands, being killed by many simple daily actions, getting stepped on, getting squished between his fingers, getting eaten, etc., etc\u2026 Suddenly, his thoughts are interrupted by a loud noise and a familiar voice shouting \u201cI\u2019m home!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, <i>shit</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo is back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a tiring day for Ichigo. First of all, he had to wake up early in the morning to help carry her sisters\u2019 luggage onto the bus, with his father\u2019s help. Then, school has been an annoying bitch today. Tatsuki is still not on speaking terms with him, and Keigo is annoying the shit out of him. And the hot weather isn\u2019t helping either. On the way back to his house, Ichigo had already taken off his school shirt and tank top due to the heat, showing off his muscular physique to everyone. The women along the road licked their lips with lust, while man stared with envy, but he didn\u2019t care, it\u2019s really too hot. By the time he arrived to the clinic, sweat was flowing like river on his back and both his uniform and tank top was soaked with sweat. He grumpily went inside the house, reflexively yelled \u201cI\u2019m home!!\u201d, and remembered that he\u2019s alone in the house. A wave of cool air hit his body, making him shiver with pleasure, indicating that someone left the air-conditioner open, but he don\u2019t care. Here he is, all alone, having the house for himself, with the air-conditioner on in this hot day. He slowly undo his school long pants, letting it fall to his ankles, and slowly shuffled to the couch, wanting to rest after such a tired day, while thinking that this is the best day of his life, with so much simplicity and peacefulness, unaware that his tiny flea-sized dad is frozen in place watching his every move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the worst day of my life!!\u201d Isshin thought as he watched Ichigo\u2019s every move, frozen in place on the couch. He stared at the colossal being slowly shuffling towards him, muscles contracts and relaxes with every move, the being moving in such fluidity that it\u2019s impossible for something this big. The distant scraping and thumping sound is getting nearer with every shuffle, and the sight of the body of his enormous son is getting clearer. Finally, Ichigo is able to drag his tired body in front of the couch, and he is rewarded by a full blast of cool air directly from the air-conditioner. He closed his eyes, and enjoyed and the cool air flowing around his warm body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Isshin is rewarded by the sight of his own son\u2019s gigantic muscular body. He stared in awe at the Greek god physique of his son; the sweat on his body reflected the ceiling light, giving him a godly glow. He knows that his son has a muscular and lean physique, and he is proud of it, but now the body is shredded!! Apparently Ichigo has been working out even harder after losing his power, and frankly, combining with his now shredded physique and gigantic size, Isshin is intimidated by his son. His eyes climbed on his son\u2019s knees, a pair of muscular thighs, a prominent bulge that barely contained by a pair of too tight briefs, a set of defined eight-pack abs, two perfectly sculptured and thick pecs, and the handsome face of his son with his eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsshin is still frozen in awe and fear when Ichigo turned around and starts to sit down, but apparently the sight of his son\u2019s ass looming over him is enough to shake him off his stupor and make him run for his life. Slowly, the gigantic ass approaches the couch and it made Isshin ran even faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo is enjoying the cool air on his body as he turns around and slowly sits down. He doesn\u2019t even bother to change clothes, or care about having sweat stains on the couch, since he has the house all alone. He sighs in content as he leaned forward, grabbing the remote control of the television and started changing channels, trying to find something interesting to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Isshin is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
