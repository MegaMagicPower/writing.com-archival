If only the police had let her in! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 She had come to the bank at 10 AM, Monday, to retrieve the large diamond wedding ring that her ex had given her. She had planned to sell the ring to pay for the down payment on a new car. Now she would have to contend with the old jalopy, at least until someone could find the robbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"The banks do not insure what's in the private safes,\" she lamented. Her ex had the insurance papers for the ring, and after their big scandalous breakup, he would give her a hard time to return them. Jessica would find a way to get the papers from him; she was sure of that, but who would rob a bank like Aloft National situated in the busiest shopping center of the town? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Jessica reached for her cell phone and dialed Darren. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Darren, I want to be in on the Aloft National robbery.

He was a nice guy and easily persuaded by beautiful women, which Jessica was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let her in the bank when the Chief was huddled over by the bank manger and two detectives.  Jessica overheard the manager saying he didn't understand why the alarm din't go off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made a mental note of the manager's concern and slipped into the bank, accompanied by Ben.  They walked back to the area of the safe.  It was a chaotic site, with papers and safe-deposit boxes thrown all over the floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would someone gain access to the vault?\" She looked over at Ben, who had a blank expression.  He was not usually involved in crime scenes, he was usually the cop that kept pedestrians and onlookers behind the police tape.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are no signs of forced entry, no explosive residue.  Whoever did this had access to top bank security information.\"  He kept his face down, surveying the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My goodness, Officer, you have surprised me with your insight!\" She smiled at him and thought that she had seriously underestimated Ben.  He end up being a very valuable asset.  Not only was he observant, he had access to the investigation.  He could supply her with details from inside the force.  She just had to play him the right way, to get him to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my safe-deposit box!  I forgot about it for a second.  I need to see if they took my ring.\"  Jessica walked over the mess on the floor carefully, as not to disrupt the crime scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is still here!  My box, it is the only box untouched.\"  Her eyes wide, she <br>\r\nlooked at Ben as if for an explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That couldn't be mere coincidence.  It has to be a clue or a message of some sorts.  Who would know your safety deposit box number?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it must be logged in the bank's system.  Besides that, the only person who knows is my Ex.\"  She paused for a long time as if trying to remember something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica? Are you alright?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is my Ex, the last time we spoke, he said I wouldn't be hearing from him for a long time.  At the time, I thought he was just upset.  Now that I think about it, he acted strangely.  He wasn't upset...I think he was trying to tell me he would be gone for a long time.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two detectives, Jessica and Ben had one thing in common. They both thought they could solve a crime better than anyone else. They agreed to work together on this case, no matter who said they couldn\u2019t <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police chief would not agree to letting Jessica in on the case since she had a claim to stake for property loss or if not loss than endangerment. She could not be entirely neutral when she needed compensation for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a ridicules rule because being compromised, as such, would only serve to make Ms Jessica more determined to solve the case. Right in thinking she had anterior motives. She was concerned for the customer\u2019s safe banking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here until the other detectives get finished with their findings. We can return when things have quieted down some. I want to check out another angle and then we can know better what we are looking for.\u201d Jessica suggested this out of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked out the front doors unnoticed. They drove off in Jessica\u2019s old jalopy lacking better transportation at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemind me to drive to the next investigation just in case we do this again,\u201d chuckled Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMighty cute officer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe headed toward her Ex\u2019s apartment in the busy downtown section of East 1st St. She parked around the corner on Wessel Ave. so as not to be too obvious. They climbed the narrow, rickety flight of stairs to the landing of three separate apartments. Her ex\u2019s was on the left located above the Town and Country Pet Shop. Taking out a key she opened the door. Tory the parrot flew at them, and Ben shut the door just in time to keep him from escaping into the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica walked to the file cabinet and opened up the middle section. She flipped through the folders until she came to the one she was looking for. Pulling it out she tossed it on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook through that one and see if you can find anything about insurance. I\u2019m looking for coverage on my wedding ring. It\u2019s here somewhere. I just don\u2019t want to get in a hassle with Bob by asking him to the papers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen searches through the thick folder, carefully, not missing a thing. He clears his throat and announces, \u201cI think this might be it. Come and see if you think it\u2019s the one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica stopped her search at the file cabinet and came over to the table. \u201cYes, this is the exact one. I was there with Bob when we insured it; I signed this document right along with Bob. So, this baby is mine since the diverse is final. He just neglected to hand it over to the rightful owner. Let\u2019s take care of this mess and get out or here. No, better yet, let\u2019s leave this file right here so he knows I\u2019ve readjusted his life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey scurried fast and made an exit in record time. Jessica didn\u2019t need to be caught leaving her ex\u2019s building or any other possible sightings involving her ex. They didn\u2019t agree about much and they certainly didn\u2019t like running into each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put the paper in the back seat and drove to a small building down near the peer. She got out and told Ben she would be just a minute. He wanted to follow her inside to see what she was up to, but he didn\u2019t..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she came out she was carrying a box the size of a small microwave. It looked heavy the way she strained to keep hold of the box; Ben jumped out and relieved her of it while she opened the back door; he put it on the seat. She was grateful to him and thanked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the car moved down the street Ben had to ask, \u201cWhat was that all about back there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that, I guess you would be curious\u2026I had to pick up my package of frozen fish at the dock. They called me this morning to tell me it was there. I just needed to do it while I was in the area. Sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to make it a mystery.\u201d She laughed and he smiled knowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly they heard a siren behind then and saw flashing lights reflecting off the front of the car. Jessica looked in her rear view mirror and uttered an unpleasantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWonder what they want, I was certainly not speeding.\u201d She pulled off the main drag into a parking space at the side of the road. Two officers exited the police car. They came to both sides of her car. She pushed the window lever and both front windows rolled down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOfficer Allen, what can I do for you and Officer Brian? Am I breaking the law?\u201d She smiled in hopes of looking relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Jessica, this is not an official stop. You know about the APB out on the robbery which took place during the night. The robber or robbers have called in to advise the bank that a bomb is planted and set to go off at two this afternoon. Don\u2019t go back to the area of the bank. The neighborhood buildings are being evacuated this very moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, officers we will wait until farther notice before we return.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica headed toward the police station after the news. She deposited Ben by his car and headed toward her home across town. When she opened her house door she heard a sudden blast, which knocked her across the porch and unto the ground.</span></div></div>",

She was uncertain whether she should open it, especially in front of all the law enforcement officers hanging around the crime scene.  She didn't have anything of extreme secrecy in her safe deposit box, but that didn't mean that she wanted the police snooping around inside it either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, curiosity won out over worry and she slid the key into her box and twisted it.  The box popped open and she and Ben peered inside.  To her shock, it was empty save for a single piece of paper resting on the bottom.  It read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jess,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm so sorry it had to come to this.  If you're reading this, I'm already gone... either to prison or out of the country, depending on how this heist went off.

My run takes me by my bank over there,\u201d she pointed to the Aloft National Bank. \u201cSo, I stopped there thinking I could save some time taking care of that errand on my way home.

I took off after her. I was going to question her, but she is hard to catch up with, and I am a seasoned runner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran out of breath; the policeman dismissed them and went on his way.

There are a lot of paths to follow, and not all of them lead in the right direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she returned to the bank the doors were shut and no one was around. She tried the doors, but they were locked. That is strange, she thought.

As she was soaking in the tub she head the front door bang closed. She had locked it like she always did when she come home. Her ex had the only other key and that was because he never gave it back after he moved out. The divorce was final; it was time for him to give it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe called out, but no one gave an answer.
