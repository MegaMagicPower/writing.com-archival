            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     Krystal marveled at the rolling countryside, the huge red barns and cows, horses and chickens everywhere. She'd never seen so many trees, having been a city girl all her life, she was more accustomed to a few trees and alot of concrete and asphalt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     She looked at the directions the realtor had given her. The log cabin she had rented for the summer should be just around the next curve in the road. Yes, there was the mailbox with the rooster on it. She turned a sharp left and followed the gravel driveway for about a  mile and there stood the cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     It was great! She opened the front door and went inside and her eyes could not believe such a marvelous place tucked into the woods. It had a good size living room with a rock fireplace and a cozy green overstuffed couch in front of it. That would make a great place to work on her novel, with her laptop cradled on her lap. It had french doors in back and all you could see were the woods. To the right was a small but efficient kitchen. It would serve her well, all she knew how to cook was tv dinners and microwave popcorn. Hopefully there would be some kind of diner in town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Up the creaky wooden stairway was a bedroom and bathroom. The bathroom had a clawfoot bathtub, she'd always wanted to take a bath in one of those. The bedroom and bathroom was the whole length of the downstairs, so they were very roomy. The bedroom had a canopy bed with fabric draped around the top. There was a walkin closet and a huge desk. She sat down at the desk and thought it would be a great writing place also. She glanced out the window beside the desk and saw a dark figure staring up at the window. It looked like a man, but it was too far away, at the edge of the woods. Whatever it was jumped back into the darkness as soon as it was aware it had been seen. It unnerved her some but she knew she had her pistol and was quite capable of using it. Living in the city had taught her to always be prepared and self-defense was not just a class for fun.</span></div></div>",

She came upon it and it looked like any other small town, with the town square, a grocery store, a hardware store, a feed store, the local diner, the VFW, where she learned from the grocer, held bingo on Saturday night, the gas station, and the picture show, as the young male gas station attendant told her, movies were only two dollars, but you wern't likely to see any of those Brad Pitt or Steven Segal movies. They were probably still showing Bob Hope and Bing Crosby movies, she thought as she loaded up her supplies into the back of her Jeep Grande Cherokee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Well, she thought as she took one last look around town, the people were friendly enough, but there was something about them that she couldn't quite put her finger on. It seemed that only certain ones talked to her. The grocery store owner talked to her but not one of the cashiers had uttered a word, they just looked down and avoided her, and the young man stocking canned goods had totally run away when she was about to ask him a question. The same with the gas attendant, he had talked but the other two attendants had steered clear of her. Perhaps they were very shy people, still there was something there she could feel that was strange and eerie.</span></div></div>",

She stopped at a fresh fruit and vegetable stand that was a stones throw away from the cabin she was renting. A handsome man, with dark curly hair and intense brown eyes was running the stand. He watched her with his thumbs clasped in his overalls, as she picked up the peaches and smelled them for freshness. She noticed his lack of a shirt under his bibs and his lean muscles underneath. She remembered she was there to pick fruit, not a man and told him she'd take a small basket of the peaches. His eyes darted around nervously as if he wanted to say something and then changed his mind. She handed him the money and couldn't help wondering what it was that was on his mind. His hands shook as he handed her the change and she looked at him pleadingly, to just tell her. He instantly turned around and started straightening the shelves of vegetables, completely ignoring her. She walked to her car and drove away.</span></div></div>",

Several rabbits hopped around and birds flitted around among the trees at the forest edge. She watched the rabbits as they froze and listened to something and the birds flew away to hide. She sat up and strained to see something, but pretty soon the rabbits relaxed and hopped away. She finished the popcorn and grabbed a fresh peach to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     She decided to get started on her novel right away, why the summer would be gone before she knew it! She climbed the stairs to the bedroom and set her laptop up on the desk. She wrote her cover page and started on the first chapter. Things were going pretty good, when she began to get very sleepy. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw a strange beam of light over the top of the forest, then another, then another. She'd never seen anything like it. She had to get a closer look at this, and she half stumbled down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     She stood on the back deck, marveling at the lights that had now took on strange colors, colors she had never seen before. They were drawing her to them and she felt the cool grass beneath her feet as she headed for the treeline. She was at the forest edge now, begginning to fight the tree limbs and find the strange lights when something or someone grabbed her by the arm and swung her around!</span></div></div>",

Someone had grabbed her from behind and put their hand over her mouth, just before she passed out. And yet, here she was on the couch and according to her watch, a whole hour had passed. The smell of peaches was overwhelming, but she had wrapped her peach seed in plastic before she'd thrown it away. She started to think that it was all a bad dream, the trip had made her really tired or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     She turned off the lamp and stood at the backdoor staring out at the woods. Nothing was out of the ordinary, but when she turned to go upstairs, the hairs on the back of her neck stood up again and a chill ran up her spine. She felt she was being watched again and hurried up the stairs and jumped into bed. She'd get a good nights sleep and get an early start on her novel. She just needed to relax and take it easy.</span></div></div>",

She woke up and felt so good, she decided to take a jog down the long driveway and pick up the paper from the previous evening. She jogged to the end of the driveway and retrieved the paper from the box. She was still jogging in place when the guy at the fruit stand caught her eye and she decided to go over and be friendly with one of the locals, after all he was so darn cute in those overalls and she'd like to get to know him better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     She watched for traffic and jogged across. He saw her coming and immediately went to straightening baskets and wiping down the countertop. She noticed that he'd look at her for a few minutes and then lower his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, my name is Krystal, I don't believe I know your name yet and we really should know each other's names, I'm going to be here for the whole summer. You're peaches are the best I've ever tasted. I'll probably be buying alot of them.\", she gave him her best smile and leaned on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, the name is Boone. The peaches won't last much longer, as a matter of fact, this is the last basket of them and they are already spoken for.\", he looked around nervously as he pushed a couple of baskets back under the skirt of the table, so that she could not see them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Well, so much for that ploy, she thought, as she noticed him admiring her jogging shorts .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you be selling anything else this season?\", she asked him, looking dissapointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, we'll have the usual garden vegetables, you know cukes, squash, green beans....\", he looked at her while also leaning on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     He must have realized he was so close to her and he immediately jumped back away from the counter, looking about nervously again. Maybe he had something else on his mind, perhaps she'd come back another time, when he wasn't so preoccupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Boone, I have to go now, I'll be back to get some of those vegetables.\", she waved to him and jogged back across the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     She looked back, when she was safely across the road and it looked as if Boone was in a trance or something, just standing there, staring at that last bucket of peaches. She spent the rest of the day working on her novel and enjoying the peacefulness of the woods, but the night was about to fall and it would be anything but peaceful.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Krystal gazed thoughtfully out of the dining room window as the last few rays of sunlight filtered across the sky. The town wasn't so bad really. Sure the people were a bit weird but at least here she could devote her full attention to the novel. Krystal's mind drifted for several more minutes before being interrupted by a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in, it's open!\" Krystal called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only more knocking in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said it's open!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the knocking continued Krystal made her way to the front door while muttering something about \"redneck hicks\" under her breath. Upon opening the door, a small figure lunged at her legs and quickly took hold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey let go! I\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal stopped in mid sentence as the figure looked up at her. Now hugging her legs was a young girl, about 9 or 10 years old at the most. The child's short blond hair was tasseled and full of knots. Her skin was covered with small cuts and bruises, most likely from running though the woods. As Krystal closed the door the girl finally looked up at her with a set of red rimmed eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name?\" Krystal asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheryl\" The child replied weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you way out here?\" She said. \"You're a long way from town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2026I can't\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she pushed herself away from Krystal and sunk to her knees. The child began to cry out in desperation filled voice while clutching at her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave me alone!\" Cheryl yelled. \"Stop it! I\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young girl fell silent and slumped to the floor. Krystal rushed to her side and quickly took the child into her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, don't hurt me.\" Cheryl whimpered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal carefully set the young girl down on a nearby sofa. Covering her body with an old blanket that had hung over the side, Krystal tried to comfort the child as best as she could. It was at that moment that Krystal felt her fingers touch something cold on the back of Cheryl's neck. Bending her neck forward, Krystal gasped when she saw the object imbedded at the base of the child skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe object was no bigger than a dime and looked as though someone had cut a marble in half. The color was a deep yet translucent blue, which sparkled ever so often. Branching out from there was a hair thin strand of the same material the encompassed Cheryl's entire neck, much like a collar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A gift.\" Cheryl said in an overly calm voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal moved back a bit as Cheryl sat up. The color had returned to her once horribly ashen face. Cheryl managed a brief smile before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your follies compound one atop another. Trapping yourselves in a perpetual living hell of your own making. Mankind's era of self-rule is at an end. Once you have been reborn through us is when you will know true peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't make and sense.\" Krystal said in confusion. \"I don't understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry child. You will soon.\" Cheryl replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cheryl pushed the blanket aside and stood up, Krystal began to move away from her. Looking to the door, she thought about trying to run away. Suddenly her entire body tingled for a few moments and she couldn't help turning back towards the little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run to where, Krystal?\" Cheryl said. \"To a world where compassion and kindness are viewed as nothing more than weaknesses? A world consumed with hate and ignorance? No, you belong here now\u2026with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave Cheryl alone!\" Krystal nearly yelled. \"She's just a child!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I want to hurt her?\" Cheryl replied. \"I just need to borrow her and the others like her for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Others like her\u2026and you.\" Cheryl replied. \"The kind, the innocent. Once I've rid this world of the hateful and cruel, people like you will be able to live as you should. Soon your soul will be intertwined with my own, you'll never be alone or frightened again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal felt her back bump into the wall. Cheryl seemed to sense the urgency in her actions. Lifting her hand, the little girl offered her palm to Krystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take my hand, Krystal.\" Cheryl said in a calming voice. \"Take it and I can show you things you could never even begin to imagine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I can't\" Krystal stuttered fearfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal didn't have many options and she knew it. The pistol was in a cabinet at the other end of the room. Even if she reached she wasn't sure she could bring herself to shoot a child. The Front door was nearby but it was pitch black out side and running around in the dark didn't sound like a very good idea at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the sound of footsteps came from outside. Cheryl turned and looked at the door for a moment and then back at Krystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, make this easy on yourself.\" Cheryl said. \"It's only a matter of time anyway. You can't escape your fate now\u2026only accept it.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She began running down hill and tripped and scraped up her knees and made them bleed. Up and running once again, she came to a clearing in the forest and heard the sound of several big trucks. She gasped as she came upon the sound and discovered a government testing area, surounded by an eight foot chain link fence with barbed wire across the top.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n     She ducked behind a boulder when she heard the trucks approaching, but they were not government vehicles, merely the farmers big grain and vegetable trucks.

A talented and imaginative scribe, she was heralded by her mentors, yet shunned by her peers.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHer grade school days had given her the strength to succeed in her adult life and had hardened her inner shell and conviction.  Self-esteem was sometimes questioned, but her self-respect and dedication to herself and her dreams saw her through those hard times.  They prepared her for the here and now.  She didn't have a clue where here was, but she definitely needed to draw upon her inner-strength now.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Keep a cool head, girl,\" she whispered to herself.  The almost inaudible tone was answered by a soft, shaken voice a few dark feet away.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Sh-sh-shhh,\"  the meager voice responded.  She turned abruptly to her left, surprised by the sudden, timid response.  \"Th-th-ththey don't l-l-like wh-when you s-s-sp-speak,\" it answered back, stuttering uncontrollably and obviously frightened.  Because of the hurried, broken words, she could not tell if her cellmate was male or female, but it was obviously a child.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I'm here sweety, don't be afraid,\" she pleaded to the child and held out her hand trying to both comfort and console.

She felt the child shaking beside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal suddenly couldn't stand it anymore. She grabbed the child and stood up. \"Who are you?\" she said loudly, with as much hostility as she could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-n-n-nooo,\" whimpered the child. \"L-l-let me go!!\" It wrestled out of her grip and disappeared into the darkness once again, leaving Krystal alone to face the silent figure, who had angled his head in an odd manner staring at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have been watching you, Krystal,\" came a synthesized, silky voice from the suit. \"That man, Boone, led you to us.

Stay away from me, you - you creep!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure advanced, reaching out his arm. \"Come to me, Krystal. I will not harm you. You are safe with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not. Leave me alone! Don't touch me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her, the child began to keen. Krystal tried to kung-fu the white-figured creature but it only grabbed hold of her ankle and began dragging her out of the room. At a steady, mechanical pace he pulled her out, even though she twisted and screamed and clutched at the nubbly ground. In the hall outside several more white figures appeared and swarmed her and began carrying her up the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal heard through the walls a loud steady chant. \"Kry-stal. Kry-stal. We-want. Kry-stal.\" </span></div></div>",

What little hair he had left was white and disheveled, like it hadn't been combed in months.  What caught Krystals' attention were his eyes.  The blue eyes of the only other person she could sense were clear, and bright.  The apparent life and intelligence in those eyes gave a lie to this figures apparent frailty.</span></div></div>",

Anticipating.  Salivating...hungry.  Halfway through spinning the cool metal bulb she stopped.  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Go ahead,\"  he intoned, too-gentlemanly.  \"As I have already told you, young one, there is not a thing I can do about it.\"  A smile that did not lighten his eyes (those magnificent eyes!) as it should opened his mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal took her surroundings into consideration and cursed at herself for her hastiness.  The room had only one door.  White washed walls, bleached of color and texture, surrounded the shellac sated concrete flooring that was shaped in an almost perfect square.  Disheveled pulses of fear caught in her throat as she realized she had been brought here, she had not been invited and she had not come under her own power.  She released the door handle, the resounding click of the latch sounded back to her off the walls of the bare room a few times then died out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man's smile faded, slowly and uncontrollably, and a snarl lifted the corner of his lip.  His eyes - which to Krystal looked like they belonged in a dolls head and not a living and breathing man - were partially covered as his eyelids narrowed to squint.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never wanted to be here in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue-eyes's sneer turned vicious, and for all the 'old' man's claims that he could not hurt her in any physical way, he leapt out of the mock wheel chair with the ferocity of a lion.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal gasped as he closed the distance incredibly fast - too fast for a mortal (and after the day's events she should not have expected any less) -  then snagged her arm with a mighty and muscular hand.  Krystal felt the deep burning sensation of pressure chocking the blood out of her arm, but it was the man's arms that shocked her more than anything.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer deformed, no longer pocked with sunspots or struggling hairs and flaccid skin.  Taught, tan and veiny, the monsters hand spun her around, much as in the forest - it must be the same one - and she squeaked in spite of her efforts to gag the reflex of fear.  Boone bore back at her with eyes of iron.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This could have been a lot easier.\"  He slammed his muscular hand into her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThudding dully, Krystal was surprised there was no pain.  Lying on the cool hard floor, the light in the room - which she realized she could not see the source, it seemed the whole room glowed of its own accord - muted, though she did not think Boone had moved the dimmer switch to set the mood.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could see Boone's tall form moving to the wheelchair again and she willed herself to move, but her body did not respond.  She looked down to her checkered slip-ons, criss-crossed with mauve and pink.  She always thought they went so well with her fuchsia skirt she wore now, and her thick black sweater top.  She thought Boone might have liked it as she left the cabin this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you just walk through the door like everybody else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could not respond, even if she wanted to, as a coin shaped object, similar to the one on Cheryl's neck, dropped in front of her face on the floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis bright blue menacing eyes appeared in front of her face and his breath smelled like peaches.  \"Its always easier if you just go through the door.\"        </span></div></div>",

Her head throbbed with the leftovers of strong drink - it must be - and she still could not open her left eye.  It wasn't until she swiped her hand across it that she felt the sharp line of hurt her hand caused and remembered - <i>it wasn't a dream!</i> - the Bright-eyed farmer, evil and not at all human, forcing his hand into her head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In a rush the nights events tumbled down on her like a landslide.

She could feel that much, but the fact that that creep Boone had done this to her was humiliating.  And she was not used to being disgraced like that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She grabbed her red-satin robe from the hook behind the bathroom door and swung it onto her shoulders.

A large sliding door opened and they walked out of the bright sunlight and into the darkness of florescent lighting. It took her eyes awhile to adjust and she noticed that the lab people were putting people on a long conveyor belt, single file. She stepped onto the belt and was trying to look over everyone's head to look for Boone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     It looked as if they were reaching a large domed room and she caught something out of the corner of her eye. It was Boone, about three feet below the belt, standing on a metal platform. He motioned for her to jump and she did. He caught hold of her, grabbed her hand and ushered her through a metal door.They went up a flight of stairs and along a catwalk. They could see the fifty or so people below, being passed behind screens and being placed into groups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on down there? What are those screens for?\", she asked Boone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are intelligence screens, to put it simply, they only want the smart ones. How can they rule the Earth with dumb people? I'd like to show them how dumb I am!\", he said with a hiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat about the groups?\", she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure you want to hear that part.\", he bowed his head and rested it on the metal railing, it felt cool on his hot face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me. I have to know everything. I want to get mad, so I can get even! I may be a dumb earthling to them, but I may have a few good tricks up my sleeve.\", she countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The small group of five, as you know, are the most intelligent, they will stay here, be programmed and be infiltrated into government positons so they can change any legislature that doesn't suit them. Some will be higher up officials in the law enforcement, so large numbers of people dissapearing will not be reported, those files will mysteriously dissapear too, no questions asked. The middle group there, not intelligent enough to use here on Earth, will be shipped to their planet, to be used for slaves, in their homes, workplaces, etc., until they get old.\", he sucked in air and started to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the older group of people down there?\", she asked slowly, looking at the group of senior citizens, reminding her of her gentle grandparents back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid they will be used for, to put it mildly, a food source.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     She covered her mouth as she gasped and thought of her own grandparents as alien food. She slid down the metal railing and sat there on her knees, thinking she might be sick but the feeling passed. Boone put his arm around her shoulder and she turned and layed her face against his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are awful things you've had to live with Boone.

This one was more secure and required a sequence of numbers to be punched in. Boone just had to remember the sequence, but the stupid thing just kept buzzing. Afraid someone might hear the noise, he took a moment to think back, search his memory for the numbers. He tried again and they heard a whoosh and the door swung open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Boone led the way down a narrow hallway and ushered Krystal into a room at the end of the hall. He handed her white lab clothes and grabbed some himself. They put them on over their clothing and checked to make sure no one was coming before they went back out into the hall again to yet another door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is where it gets a little hairy because there are more people wandering around up here.\", Boone told her in a hushed tone. \"Just act like we belong and I don't think anyone will bother us.\" He pushed open the door and they walked cautiously but steady down the hall. Now people, also in lab coats, were passing them in the hall, hardly without a glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   They now had to get in an elevator to ride down to the lower level. Boone was convinced his family could be located in the G sector, which was two levels below ground. He'd never been down that far and he really wasn't sure they could get that far, it was probably pretty secure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The doors opened and they got off the elevator and Boone was leading the way. Krystal saw the back of Boone's neck and what looked like the strange thing that was in the girl's neck. She took the pistol from her waistband and pointed it in his direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   He must have felt something was wrong, because he turned around and looked at her with eyes that were shocked to see a gun in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Krystal don't!\", he shouted, but she fired off two shots and he jumped at the reverberating sound.</span></div></div>",

Opening the door a crack he looked and listened for the sound of running feet somewhere in the hallway, hearing none, he pulled her from the little supply closet that they had hidden in.  <br>\r\n  \"Come on, this way\" he said, as he pulled her back in the direction they had just came from.  <br>\r\n   They turned down other connecting hallways until Krystal was sure they were hopelessly lost.  <br>\r\n   \"I sure hope you know where you're going\" she whispered to him. <br>\r\n   \"If the lay out hasn't changed, yes\" he said to reassure her.  <br>\r\n   Just as they went to turn another corner they heard the distinct sound of feet running in their direction.

He pressed Krystal and himself up tight against the wall in hopes that they wouldn't be seen.  They hadn't time to try for another door.  Krystal held her breath and said a silent prayer.

Their eyes locked and suddenly feeling awkward at the closeness she blushed and cleared her throat. <br>\r\n   \"I think we should go.\"  She said in a whisper. <br>\r\n   A slight mischievous glint sparkled in his eyes and his lip turned up into an ever so slight smile in the corners of his mouth.

She was flung to the floor with force and lay in a heap on the cold stone floor. Boone turned around to see two guards standing over Krystal, with pistols drawn and pointed towards him. At first he thought that she had been knocked out but he saw a slight movement and she blinked her eyes at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, don't shoot.\", Boone called to them.\"Look, here's my weapon, you can have it and I won't give you anymore trouble.\" He started walking towards them with the gun barrel down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were starting to get nervous because he was getting so close to them and they started shouting at him to stop.

They were punching it with their tripod appendages, passing it to another then back again. He felt like this device was somehow their means of escape and something was wrong with it.

The device was now making an almost melodic sound and the three stood as if in a trance staring down at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoone looked at his watch, only eleven minutes left.

It sounded like the call of a dying orca. With nothing but fear to fuel him, Boone rushed towards the three aliens the way he used to rush the quarterback in varsity football. He kept his head down and elbows out, putting all his strength into his legs. <br>\r\nUpon impact, in one great sweep, the short pudgy alien flew into the wall, smashing its head and spewing dark blue mucus on the ground. The taller one went crashing to the floor, sending the small gadget in its hand scuttling across the cold metallic floor. The third alien received an elbow directly in the neck. It shrieked, and in a quick gesture, Boone punched it square in the face. It\u2019s bone density was so weak that Boone\u2019s large fist went straight through the alien\u2019s face. <br>\r\nPulling out his fist, Boone shook off the purplish goo from his hand. He felt nauseous for a second, but remembered the tall alien on the floor. Wasting no time, Boone stomped on its head with the heel of his RedWing boot. Thank God they\u2019re waterproof, he thought to himself. <br>\r\nHe picked up the small gadget from the floor and began heading for the stairwell. Only one more level to go, he thought, feeling the adrenaline speeding through his heart.

He walked up to one and his heart was filled with sadness and rage. Inside the booth, was Mr. Calvert, a man he\u2019d known since childhood. He was never a bright man, but he was always kind and warm to Boone\u2019s family, and he knew about harvesting crops and keeping the land fertile. Mr. Calvert was suspended in a clear liquid, possibly water, with tubes inserted into his nose and mouth. <br>\r\nBoone looked into the next cell and saw Mrs. Coolidge, the widow from down the street.<br>\r\n He knew most of the people in this small town, and now he realized that they were here, alive; stored in a dormant state for easy transportation to another planet.

He felt helpless. This situation was helpless. Just get out of here, a voice in his head was telling him. He thought of Krystal; her soft skin; her hair; her beautiful face. Those eyes of hers, so piercing yet so compassionate. <br>\r\nHe looked up at Mr. Calvert again, hanging in utero like an unborn fetus, so exposed and helpless. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m getting you out of here Mr. C,\u201d said Boone. <br>\r\nHe ran down the corridor, past all the hanging bodies and reached the small panel at the end.

Suddenly, all the doors opened, spilling gallons and gallons of thick viscous liquid down the hall. Boone was up to his knees in the thick warm substance.

This one was much simpler than the console he had just used, it relied mostly on graphics that just needed to be touched with a finger. <br>\r\nHe touched the icon resembling the outside of the base. A detailed cross section appeared on the screen. He touched the first level below ground, and a little map of the level he was on appeared. He moved his finger down the corridor, and the camera view followed the direction of his finger. His finger came around the corner, and suddenly, he saw the corridor he was in. Right there in the palm of his hand was a flooded corridor, with a crowd of people standing in it. <br>\r\n\u201cTWO MINUTES,\u201d reminded the voice.<br>\r\nWith a stroke of his finger, he highlighted the people on the small screen and dragged them outside of the level, to the surface just outside the building.

He tapped the highlighted people standing outside and everything went black. <br>\r\nSuddenly, Boone found himself outside amongst the trees. The elderly people were there too, naked and trembling.

A psychopathic killer?\" A shiver went down her spine. \"Or was it something else? Something that wasn't human? Impossible!\" But somehow, the more she tried to convince herself the perpetrator had been human, the less she believed it. \"Maybe I should try to get some sleep,\" she thought eventually, as she was only making herself more frightened than she already was.</span></div></div>",

As she crab - crawled  backwards the silhouetted took a form she recognized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's alright.  You okay?\"  The voice was soothing and the man held his hands up in a 'I mean you no harm' gesture.  Krystal was able to make out the face as the man from the fruit stand she had come across earlier in the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah - no - I mean, I guess,\" she stammered.  He held a hand to help her up again.</span></div></div>",

All was silent until she heard someone whisper, \"Krystal, welcome to heaven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this was heaven, why was it so damn hot?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously, she opened her eyes.  Standing before her was a distinguished looking man graying slightly at the temples wearing a perfectly fitted tux and holding a martini glass with some kind of red liquor, presumably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is heaven?\" she asked, captivated by his eyes which were somewhere between gun-metal gray and blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm just messing with you.\" He chuckled. \"It's hell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe broke his gaze and glanced around expecting to find all the accoutrements one might expect in hell - fiery pits and such - but found she was in what appeared to be a penthouse apartment.  She was lying on a leather sofa which was without a doubt the most comfortable piece of furniture  she had ever been on in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a little...luxurious isn't it?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, why should I suffer?\"  He pointed to a window which took up the entire wall opposite the sofa.  \"That's their job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal got up gingerly and walked to the window.  Looking down about seven stories she saw something more akin to what she expected, flaming pits and all, but another structure caught her eye.  \"What's that?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man followed her glance.  \"Movie theater.\"  He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have movies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few - Gigli, Ishtar.  Oh, and anything with Ashton Kutcher.  Except for That 70's Show, that was actually not bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal shrugged a silent agreement.  \"No AC?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm comfortable.\" He said.  \"But let's get down to brass tacks.  The reason you're here and not down there is that you have an option.  You can stay here.  Well, not here,\" he corrected himself gesturing at the penthouse.  \"But, here in hell.  Or you can go back and save that quaint little town of yours from alien invasion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're giving me a choice?\"  She asked, incredulous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed.  \"Believe me, what's about to go down up there may even outdo anything I've come up with in quite some time. It might be fun to watch.  Either way, for me it's win - win.\"  He took a sip from his martini.  \"So what'll it be?\"</span></div></div>",

She at first screamed, unaware of what was about to happen, then the guy put his arm around her mouth. \"Shh, they could have heard you!\", he grabbed her arm again and pulled her to the wall. \"We have to climb now. This way\", he said as he pointed up at an opening in the wall just a few yards up. Krystal nodded and began to climb, not caring why there had been another guy in this hell of a place.<br>\r\nThe boy climbed beside her and helped her up to the cave. \"Thank you i have no idea how......\", Krystal stopped, staring at the walls of the cave. She pulled her knees to her chest and cried. The boy sat at the lip of the cave and kept guard, listening to her sobs.<br>\r\nSoon, sleep overcame Krystal and she closed her water-filled eyes and dozed off. The boy smirked and watched as the sky lit up with a strange, hazy sun light - the only light these woods knew.</span></div></div>",

So she decided she better get back to her mystery because her publisher had insisted on a deadline. She said to herself, \"I'm such a sissy! What's wrong with a little fog in the air?\" \r<br>\nShe shrugged her shoulders and started walking towards the house. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe kept walking and walking but couldn't see the house. \"I cannot be lost,\" she said. \"I never get lost.\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\nAs she was wondering where the house had disappeared into, her foot slipped. She was almost going to fall down but she held onto a tree branch just in time to see that she had come by the side of a lake covered with algae. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe saw the floating form of a corpse mostly hidden by the weeds. She felt a scream rising to her throat but she held her composure. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe corpse opened his eyes and said, \"You're the chosen. Nothing dies but this planet may come to pass. Its progress is a myth. It will be grand power versus grand loss. Now you go and let them know. Forget everything else. You have a job to do on a grand scale. I'll lead you on. You're not alone! Now go get to it, go! Now!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nKrystal turned to see if there was anyone else around but the woods seemed empty and the fog had lifted a little. She made out the vague form of the house in the distant. She started running toward it. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nAs she reached the French doors, she heard her cell phone ring, the sound of which comforted her. She ran upstairs to her desk and picked up the cell phone. As soon as she pushed the button her phone went dead.\r<br>\n \r<br>\n\"I have to go into town and call the police and the media,\" she thought. \r<br>\n\"No, we won't let you!\" A rough husky voice answered her thoughts.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe turned around to the sound of the voice. She saw nothing. She picked up her purse with one hand and held her gun with the other. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe opened her mouth to say, \"Who are you?\" but no sound could escape from her lips. She frowned at her own shivering. She wasn't the kind to be afraid. Or so she had thought. Yet she knew she couldn't give in. Probably the corpse was right. All this wasn't her imagination as she was suspecting at the back of her mind. She had a job to do. But what? \r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe decided to get back out again. It will be safer out in the open air she thought. She ran downstairs. She scrambled from door to door, from window to window only to find them shut tight. Someone had welded down everything. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe held her purse in her underarm and pointed the gun in front of her. With her other hand she yanked a lamp off from a side table and hurled it at a window but the glass wouldn't break. She tried to break other windows, other doors. It was of no use. She was caged in. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nIt started getting dark. Outside a strange wind had started to howl. She heard a crash, then a thunder. As another lightning hit the ground, she saw from the window a huge, gray, eerie and globular aircraft land on the grass. The craft's doors opened and out came some indistinguishable forms.\r<br>\n  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

Claustrophobia nearly took all of her sanity at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperately she drove both of her hands into the gel surface above her. The surface gave, but did not break. Pushing with all of her strength, it finally broke after she had nearly strained her arm muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could see light now, and she ripped and tore at the surface until it became wide enough for her to stick her head through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was in a vast chamber.

Hundreds of feet she flew, until she passed the center, and then gravity reversed again. Her direction changed once more. This happened about twenty times before the forces equalized and she was floating in the middle of the cylinder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother directional force, one she had not noticed, was pulling her in one direction through the cylinder.

All but one creature kept going about their business. It looked up at her, and that was when her heart stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the most haunting thing she had ever seen. It was everything she had ever seen on T.V., except its nightnmarish appearance was even more evil. It stood about seven feet tall and had a bald head, no visible ears, a small nose, gray, leathery skin, a small slit for a mouth, and deep, large sable-black eyes that looked up at her with an expression of pure malice and hate. The shock it gave her to see such a creature made fear darker than any labyrinth in her soul wrack her body. Her hands started shaking and her breath started to become labored. She started to cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Get a grip!</i> she told herself. Survival instincts and adrenaline were what took over from there.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she landed, she luckily landed in a secluded spot somewhat hidden from most of the creatures, behind a pillar-like structure.

Her heart rapped at her chest, but her adrenaline forced her to quickly lift the gun, and pull the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder echoed through the area, and the being's head was no more. A black ichor foamed out of creature's boneless neck, and it fell to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to run, but ran into another creature, and it bodily threw her to the ground. She got up and tried to run the opposite direction, and another blocked her path. Soon she was surrounded by the aliens. Yes, now she was certain they were not merely creatures, but aliens. Not fantastic or star trek aliens, but the ones everyone could recognize, the grays. They were far more evil than anyone had ever imagined.

Krystal thought she was safe, she turned away from the door and looked: hundreds of aliens stood in front of her, all wearing strange metal suits and carrying large rifles...</span></div></div>",

It was a packed night. A man in a black suit in a corner table saw them, and waved them over.

I knew your father Krystal, he was an agent for me. Before you were born, he led an attack on a Shapeshifter vessel. He was caught, and they injected strange chemicals into him, I'm not sure what. When you were born, these chemicals were born into you...giving you the ability to see things, normal people can't.\"Dr. C explained some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See what things?\"Krystal asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Krystal, I want you to concentrate really hard. I want you to use those chemicals in your body, tell your brain to send the chemical into your eyes.\"Dr. C replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't tell chemicals to go into my eyes!\"Krystal angrily shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you can Krystal, remember, you're not a normal human being. You have alien chemicals in you, they give you alien properties. Please, try it.\"Dr. C spoke once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal nodded slowly. She closed her eyes, and thought very hard. She told her brain she wanted the chemicals to go into her eyes. When she opened them again, the entire world was in a green tint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god. Everything's green...\"Krystal muttered in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Krystal. You have it in you. You are seeing what aliens see. Take a look at the men in the bar, in the green.\" Dr. C told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal turned and looked. Some of the men in the bar, now appeared as aliens in the green. They were already assimilating...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Krystal, I need your help. The aliens are starting their attack, and they're starting it in this town. I need you to come with me, I need you to find all the aliens for us. You're the only ones that can tell us who's real, and who's not. Will you do it?\"</span></div></div>",

One hand shoots to her pockets and searches in case, by some miracle, she had put some bullets in her pockets. No such luck. She swears. Loudly and her crazed and stressed mind imagines her old Bible School teacher staring at her disapprovingly. She looks to where she had heard the voice coming from. There is nothing. She turns again and she finds herself staring down the business end of a gun. The owner of the gun isn't like the aliens she had seen but there was something wrong with her eyes. The attacker was a tall and lean female with silver eyes. She grins, revealing sharp teeth.If you run she could shoot you. If you stay here gawking at her like an idiot she could shoot you.

There eyes are all glazed over and some of them have their eyes closed as if they are still resting in peace. Even though they are standing there arms hang limply by their sides and as they move forward they look more like they are being dragged than actual walking. The one closest to you opens his eyes but his eyes are still rolled up in his head so you can see only the whites of his eyes.
