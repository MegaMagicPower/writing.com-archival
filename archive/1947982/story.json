These two in particular seemed dedicated to making your every waking moment a living hell. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cLooks like the pipsqueak here doesn\u2019t want to give me what\u2019s mine!\u201d</span> He said, as the two of them toss you roughly onto the cold, solid ground of the barn. The other boy went about closing and locking the big wooden door while Eric paced over to you. You tried to climb to your feet, only for Eric to knee you in the chest, knocking you back down again. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cSeems he needs a little reminder who\u2019s in charge around here!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother kick hits you in the side as you lay on the ground, shivering, clutching yourself sadly. You knew an onslaught of kicks and punches was about to come, followed by them simply taking what little money you had. However, instead, the boys were distracted by the sound of something stomping on the ground. They looked up to see a huge cow, reared up and ready to charge, fuming with anger. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cHey!\u201d</b></span> She called. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you pick on somebody your own size?\u201d</b></span> With that, she started rushing forward towards them! The quickly split up, and the cow heads straight for Eric, sending him flying into the wall of the barn!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the cow rears up once more, the boy hurriedly unlocks the door, before helping Eric to his feet and rushing him out of the barn. The two escaped just in time to avoid getting charged at again. The cow calmed down quickly, seemingly giggling as she watched the two bullies trip over themselves in a panic as they darted away. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cPhew! I thought they were going to put up more of a fight then that,\u201d</b></span> she said, talking to herself as if you weren\u2019t even there. It occurred to you that she didn\u2019t know you could understand her yet. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cNow I just need to take care of this poor boy, and I can go back to nappin\u2019...\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cMy\u2026 stomach...\u201d</b> You said, clutching your belly in pain as you laid there, the pain of Eric punching you in the stomach earlier still remaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cow glances all around, startled, as if wondering who said that, before looking down at you. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cW-what?\u201d</b></span> She gasped, not really sure she heard you talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cIt hurts...\u201d</b> You repeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cOh my stars and garters\u2026\u201d</b></span> The cow gasps, her eyes wide. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cI can understand you!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nContrary to how you were expecting her to react to her situation, the cow actually started pacing around the barn hall excitedly, a huge smile dawning on her face. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cI mean, I\u2019ve never really wrapped my head around yer fancy human speak, and yet\u2026 I can understand <i>you</i>, somehow,\u201d</b></span> she realized, <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cand you can understand <i>me</i>! Ohmygosh! This is so exciting!\u201d</b></span> She practically hops in place with excitement, her hooves throwing up dust as she stomps loudly. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cI must be the smartest cow on Earth! Just think it - me, ol\u2019 April, speakin' <i>human</i>!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she turns to you again and sees the look on your face. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cOh! Oh, yes, I\u2019m so sorry, I got carried away,\u201d</b></span> she blushes, before trotting slowly up to you. Once she was close to you, the huge laid down on the ground by your side, offering her back. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cHere, go ahead and climb up on my back, sugar! I know somewhere comfortable where you can rest.\u201d</b></span> Still clutching your stomach, you carefully try to climb up her side, up onto her back. The cow was so large, it was actually quite a difficult climb, but eventually you managed it. Once you were in place, she gently stood up, and gently walked deeper into the barn, careful not to let you fall off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou relaxed against her soft, pillowy skin as she walked. She was a jersey cow, which means her fur was various shades of brown rather than the black and white color scheme associated with cows. She was actually surprisingly pretty by cow standards, with a big, expressive smile on her face as she walked. She wore a cowbell around her neck that rang out as she walked, and \u2018spoke\u2019 in a deep, motherly southern accent. She had quite a spring in her step as she navigated the barn, apparently excited to have finally met a human she could talk to. Eventually, she found a spare room in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cThis here\u2019s where the farmer used to keep his tools. Now, a stable boy has turned it into a room of sorts,\u201d</b></span> she said, gesturing to the worn-out, elevated cot in the corner. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cI\u2019m sure nobody would mind ya restin\u2019 here for a tad, sugar.\u201d</b></span> She gently slid you onto the cot, and grabbed a thick, wool blanket with her mouth, clumsily tucking you in. The cot was comfy, but not as comfy as her back was, though you were gracious enough to not complain. Once you were settled in, your injuries quickly started hurting less, and soon you had a smile on your face as you looked up at the cow. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cNow\u2026 uh, I\u2019ve never had a conversation with a human, before.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWell, what do you wanna talk about, ma\u2019am?\u201d</b> You giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cWell, I sorta want to know how we\u2019re talkin\u2019 in the first place,\u201d</b></span> she replied. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cEither I somehow learned how to speak <i>human</i> overnight, or you somehow know how to speak <i>cow</i>.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019ve never really had a \u02d3mom\u2026\u201d</b></span> You explain, sadly. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cSo, Mother Nature let me talk to animals, so I can find one to be my \u02d3mom\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cOh, Mother Nature, huh? Well, that explains it. She sure works wonders,\u201d</b></span> she smiles, nodding in understanding. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a mom, you\u2019ve definitely come to the right place, sugar. I\u2019m sure there are plenty o\u2019 gals around here willing to take you in. Question is, what kinda animal do you wanna be?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</b> You ask, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cOh! Um\u2026 you didn\u2019t know\u2026?\u201d</b></span> She looked a bit taken aback. She paused for a little while, trying to choose her words carefully. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cWell\u2026 I guess you can stay a human for a while, while you\u2019re making your decision. But if you really want to seal the deal, you\u2019re going to need to, uh, crawl up where the sun don\u2019t shine\u2026\u201d</b></span> She blushed a little at the thought. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cThen, you\u2019ll get changed into whatever animal she is, and she\u2019ll be your \u02d3mom from then on out\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were fascinated. You had never even considered these concepts before. You guess it made sense that you\u2019d have to be same kind of animal as your \u02d3mom in order for it to count. Not that you minded, of course \u2014 you loved animals with all your heart, and were always sort of jealous of them. Animals had such simple lives, and never got bullied, or felt lonely. You would jump at the chance to be like them. <b>\u201cSounds cool!\u201d</b> You said, sitting up in excitement. <b>\u201cWhich animals could I be?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stares at the ceiling for a while, considering it, her tail swishing back and forth behind her. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cHmm\u2026 well, I guess there\u2019s Penelope. She\u2019s a clydesdale mare, and she\u2019s been wanting a colt for a while, but there\u2019s just no stallions around,\u201d</b></span> she said. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cThere\u2019s always Rosie. She\u2019s a pig. If you like food and roughhousing, she\u2019d be the best choice.\u201d</b></span> She sheepishly averted eye contact as she continued. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cAnd\u2026 I guess, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ve always sort of wondered what being a \u02d3mom is like\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat there, dumbstruck. How could you make such a choice? Every option seemed so tempting! Noticing the look on your face, she offered. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cHere\u2019s an idea, though! While you\u2019re still a human, why don\u2019t you try spending a while with each of us, letting us be your \u02d3mom for a week? Then you\u2019ll be able to choose which one you like best,\u201d</b></span> she smiled, and you perked up. That was an absolutely genius idea! You were almost bursting with excitement as you made your choice...</span></div></div>",

And besides, I promised not to eat you so I think you owe me something in return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouse starts to speak but he is hard to hear from this distance so you decide to sneak closer and see what happens. As you crawl toward them the vixen's ears turn toward you. \"I know somebody is there.\" You freeze in place and then remember why your here in the first place. You make yourself known by standing abruptly but you crack your head on a tree branch above you. Everything begins to fade away. The last thing you see is the fox running toward you before darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhen you come too you are looking up at a stone ceiling to a cave. You are surrounded by soft moss and the entire cave is lit by the dull glow of some luminescent moss. The vixen trots through the mouth of the cave and sees that your awake. She runs to you and nuzzles under your chin. \"I hope your alright. You hit your head pretty hard. There wasn't much blood, but you've been asleep for two days. I brought you back to my den ad tried to tend to you as best I could. Are you hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know where to start, but you decide to explain why you were in the woods in the first place and end by thanking her for nursing you back to health. After a short silence she smiles. \"So you are looking for a new mommy? what if I was your new mommy. When you found me I was trying to get a mouse to agree to let me stick him in my pussy so I could feel what it would be like to have a cub inside me. I was just getting desperate. but now that your here I can finally have my own kit. If you wouldn't mind having a fox for a mommy.</span></div></div>",

The vixen is sitting less than a foot from you next to the bed squirms in place as her arousal begins to take hold. She inches a bit closer to you. \"So can we start soon? Like after you are better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle at her eagerness. \"Sure, I think I'm feeling better anyways. So let's start now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tackles you to the floor of the cave and licks over your face while you undress for her. \"Thank you, thank you, thank you! I love you so much.. my little cub. Now it's time for you to go to your new home for a while.\" Still standing over you, she turns around and lifts her tail to show off her clean pink tailhole and her already dripping wet canine pussy. She hovers the in front of your face for a moment before slowly moving back until you part her pussy lips with your nose. Taking in her wild scent you can feel your own carnal desire begin to overflow. Your tongue finds its way into her folds as she moves back more to begin to envelope your face. She shutters as you lick her deeper than she's ever been licked before. \"Oh yes, please don't stop. That feels so good.\" She pushes back hard and your head goes into her velvety soft pussy with a wet pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body is about the same size as your own, so you wonder how you will fit inside her, but she seems confident, so you keep licking even as your head is pulled deeper. You try to contort yourself by pulling in your shoulders so she can take you a bit easier. The vixen moans as you go deeper, your shoulders pushing past without much more effort than when she took your head. At this point your face is being pressed into her cervix. \"You are so close now my son. And this feels so amazing. Thank you again for letting me be your new mommy.\" She clenches her vaginal muscles tightly around you and steps forward to get a better angle to take the rest of your body into her pussy. When she starts to push back again her silky wet flesh slides across your bare body coating you in her slick feminine cunny. inside her body it is hot and wet. Her cervix is still tightly closed to you, but it occasionally leaks out a gush of her femcum over your face. The vixen is stuck bouncing against your upper body like you were an oversized dildo until her tight cervix finally gives. All at once your torso is pushed into her waiting womb leaving just your feet sticking out of her dripping pussy. She takes a few minutes to catch er breath and allow herself to get used to the sudden intrusion on her womb as well as the weight of your body. Her belly is obscenely large and every move you make can be seen clearly through her stretched tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her you try to get comfortable. You manage to pull in your legs and curl into a ball inside her. When you find just that right position her cervix is in your face and tightly sealed. You give it a few pokes and realize how real the situation is. You are locked inside a vixen's pussy, and soon you will be transformed into her new kit. You will finally have a mommy to love and that loves you. The thought makes you giddy to the point that you have to fidget a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen moans as you squirm around inside her. She is still somehow able to stand without too much effort But walking is a bit difficult. Her belly is nearly as big as her whole body. Even still she looks at herself and a smile spreads across her lips. She lays on the mossy bed and tries to lick herself clean of her feminine juices. You can feel every move she makes and as she walks, lays down, then bends over to lick her pussy you are nearly folded in half but it is still somehow pleasant to be manipulated by the warm, soft, and wet walls of her womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she begins to lay down to sleep after such an exhausting endeavor you relax as well and enjoy your new home until you wonder how you will get any nutrition. As if her body were reading your mind an umbilical cord descends to attach itself painlessly to your bellybutton.You feel more connected to the fox, your new mother, than ever before. Snuggling into the fleshy warm walls of her womb you whisper goodnight to her and drift off into a deep sleep, almost like a coma, as your body is slowly changed, cell by cell, into a newborn fox kit. As the change happens her belly shrinks down considerably. Even still you are very much visible as a small bulge in her lower abdomen. Another sign that she is carrying you is her teats have begun to swell with her sweet milk so that she can feed her new son when you are reborn.</span></div></div>",

Amber stayed behind because she knew it was almost time and they didn't want to risk her losing you.

Her gait is one of sovereignty but there is a look of benevolence to her gaze that makes you feel safe and warm while her amber eyes are locked on your own. She stands before you, her head on par with yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why have you intruded in my territory without a single offering?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot sure how to respond you ask, \"What kind of offering should I have brought?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems unperturbed by your ability to understand and speak her feral tongue. 'You can give my pack food or even a simple chew toy. Something that would entertain them or fill their bellies.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a second on how to appease her.\"I don't have any food. How about I give them my clothes? They could be fun to rip up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods. 'That will be fine.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou strip off everything leaving your teenage body exposed and offer it to a nearby wolf. The lupine looks at his matriarch. She nods and he snatches the clothing before having to defend his new toys from the rest of the pack. As they make a game of tearing your garments to shreds the female before you sits and asks, 'So why have you come here? Are you simply another human who wishes to see my pack up close? Or is there another motive?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stammer at first but manage to explain your story to her. The fact that you have been given the ability to speak the animal language for only a year, how you never had a mother growing up and you wished that you could restart with someone loving and caring, how you have always loved wolves, and that you wanted to ask if she could be your new mother. Afterwords she sits for a moment. Then without warning she steps forward to allow her neck to pressed against your own in her own version of a hug. You can't help but to return the warm and fluffy embrace until she pulls her head away. 'I am sorry, I should not have-'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cut her off with tears in your eyes and a smile of genuine joy.\"Thank you.\" Those are the only words that can escape your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles in return. 'Come with me.' The regal wolf leads you to her den, which is, like the rest of the enclosure, designed to look as realistic as possible. It is a cave under an enormous boulder supported by two smaller ones. Inside is a soft sandy floor with the only unnatural thing being some minor lighting that is so dim that it still takes a couple minutes to adjust to. Once you are able to see the wolf you almost fall flat on your butt as you realize that you have shrunk down at some point during your walk into her den. In front of you is the female wolf, and now more than ever is her gender so obvious as her pussy is plainly visible from your new perspective. She notices you staring and lifts her tail. Her pussy is jet black as is her tailhole. Before you can say anything she begins to sit down. But before you are squished under her shapely rear she stops cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Staring is rude. But since you will be inside me soon enough I don't mind if you admire the entrance to your new home.' She is squatting over you in much the same way she would if she were to have to pee. Seeing her like this has you thinking she might want to mark you as her own. The thought is something that...</span></div></div>",

You get an answer in the form of her nethers quivering before a flood of translucent yellow cascades down over your body. The wolf pants as she relieves herself over your diminutive form causing you to be swirled around in a puddle of hot lupine piss and unable to surface. Thankfully she continues for only half a minute or so before squeezing out the last few drops. You breach the surface and take a gulp of urine saturated air. The smell and taste of her hot pee is clouding your mind. All you want to do is stay in her piss and enjoy the warmth, the smell, and the slight oiliness covering your bare skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the wolf has other plans. She smirks down at you. \"Okay little one. Playtime is over. Time to go to your room.\" Her air of dominance and regal presence has given way to a more motherly and kinky nature. She lays on her side and moves her tail to expose her still wet sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you listen to your mother or do you want to play in the pool for a little while longer?</span></div></div>",

You are pressed against her soft folds face first. She growls lowly when she feels you make contact, it is a soft happy growl of eagerness and lust that causes her to start leaking her warm silky cunny directly into your face. The sudden torrent takes you off guard and you take in a mouth full of her sweet and musky nectar. It is wonderfully smooth as it gently glides down your throat, coating every part of you until it settles into your stomach. Anther gush of her feral lubricant coats the rest of your body and she allows you to pull away by relaxing her tail. As you part, several strands of her cunny stretch and ultimately break save for a few that manage to hold on as the matriarchal wolf towers over you in a squatting position once again. She positions herself sjust right before slowly lowering her slick canine pussy toward you. As your head makes contact you brace yourself for her weight, but instead, another gush of her female cum, much hotter than before, envelopes your body allowing your head and upper torso to glide directly into the silken flesh lined tunnel. As she feels you enter her the she wolf stops and savors the moment with another soft growl. She regains some composure and, careful not to hurt you, she sinks deeper until she is sitting on her haunches and can't help but wag her tail and pant as she feels you squirm a bit against the tight inner walls of her birth canal. She tightens her grip around you and stands slowly, taking care not to drop you. She lowers her head with her rear in the air before relaxing again. Inside her body you are surprised when you realize that you can see due to a dim glow from the warm pulsing walls around you. As she relaxes her grip around your body you begin to slide deeper. Her cervix is open and waiting for you to enter before closing behind you sealing you into your new home. A relaxing warm fluid fills her womb and suspends your body. Instinctively, you know that you can breath this fluid and take in a few lung fulls. As you acclimate to this, an umbilical cord descends to connect to your bellybutton while a membrane forms around your body to complete the process. Your new mother has been curled around her belly watching over you the entire time, but now that you are hers the alpha wolfess stands and walks to the mouth of her den to give a long and loud howl t let her pack know that there will be a new member joining them. After she is done she turns to ask you, \"My new son, please tell me. Do you wish to keep you current form? Or do you wish to be a wolf?\" Her question was simple and untainted with persuasions.</span></div></div>",

The warm, sweet, and musky scent of the alpha female would daze you as you softly squirmed in instinct, not to escape but to be a better toy as the process proceeds. As she murrs and clenches she takes a few steps forward, aligning your shoulders and torso under her like an over-sized hands-free sex toy, the soft squish of her folds sending another whiff of her scent through you as she growls in bliss and squats further. Your shoulders would give so little resistance you would wonder how many times she had \"punished\" pack members like this, or if mother nature had sent others on a path to meet her. In any case you were happy, engulfed in the loving embrace of your soon to be new mother.</span></div></div>",
