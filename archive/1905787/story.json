They weren't even that bright, but they were enough to wake you and you were not happy about it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally concede defeat and your eyes flutter open with a yawn.  You blink rapidly disorentied from just waking up and you try ot roll out of bed to start your routine.  Much to your shock though you couldn't find the strength to do so.  Looking down, as much as oyu could anyway, you see that a thick flannel blanket (that was surpisingly comfey) was wrapped aorund you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to your growing shock and confusion it was keeping your from moving.  A few tired grunts and some kicks though sees the entraping blaket kicked away from you, and thats when you notice the other changes.  Looking above you saw a series of colorful shapes spining above your head.  To either side of you were bard that seemed to stretch for miles upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThats when you noticed just how <i>huge</i> everything was. The bed you were lying in had to be huge, and all the furnature, the room even, was massive!  Finally finding the energy to stand up, you hear a soud like crinkeling plastic.  Confused oyu shift again trying to figure out the noise, and realsie that the noise gets louder and faster as you move!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKicking the blanket off all the way you find the souce of the noise.  A thick fluffy light blue diaper hugging your waist.  You gasp in shock your wings flapping instinctavly.  Wait wings?  You look aroudn and grab one of the appendeges, yes you had wings.  And there was a weight on your head that you confirm was a horn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWings, horn, a diaper?!?  You were in a giant nursery!  Or was it normal sized and you were just tiny?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that though you release a loud piercing wail involentary.  You try to stop, but you jsut can't and that just makes you cry harder.  Crying like the foal you are you realise that you have indeed become a foal again, an alicorn at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crys continue untill<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You look down and see thick, flannel blankets restraining you to the strange bed you are in. You look to your left and right and are confused to see hollow plastic bars surrounding you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally manage to wiggle out of the tight blanket. You are extremely and utterly shocked to see that you've...shrunk!...well, at least that's what you think happened. You finally gain the strength to sit up, but a strange noise that almost sounds like plastic distracts you. You shift from side to side, and the crinkling noise increases as you move around faster. You look down and gulp. It was worse than what you expected; a fluffy white diaper was neatly hugging your legs and waist. You try to shake yourself out of this 'illusion', thinking it's all just a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut moments later, you let out a sharp, piercing wail that involuntarily escapes your mouth. You try to stop crying, but you can't control yourself, as you now know your newly-christened baby body was too weak and undisciplined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

Rarity had just started cooing and rocking you, and the pacifier had calmed you down instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew you had acted exactly like an upset foal would have, and that just made you upset again wanting to cry or kick. And then you realized this was also the response of a foal and you reigned it in. Still you were confused and wondering just what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour confusion and questions were temporarily banished when you see the bright padded highchair set up in the kitchen and you realize what was happening.  The unicorn strapped you in despite your struggles. Its breakfast time sweetie. The mare coos tying a bib around your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later Rarity returned with a bowel in her grip. Open wide sweetie! Here comes the train! She said removing your pacifier and holding out a spoon full of foal food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gape at her. There was no way you were eating! \u201cGulp!\u201d The alabaster mare quickly shoed a spoonful into your mouth.  You gag at first, then stop licking your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis, wasn\u2019t the mass-produced goop you had feared. It, was actually good! You had no trouble eating the rest of the bowel bit of food ending up on your bib.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity uses it to clean your face off then gives you a bottle.  Feeling thirsty after that you take it without hesitation and soon the bottle was drained. Rarity gives you a few pats on the back afterwards and before you knew it a massive belch is escapes your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity makes a face and you can\u2019t help but giggle at it. The mare just sighs and shakes her head. Of the joys of raising a foal. She mutters though she is grinning the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity replaces your pacifier grabs you in her magic again. You briefly find it odd that she didnt eat anything, but maybe she ate before you woke up? Now. Let\u2019s get you dressed and then get your day started! Rarity says happily already levitating a entire variety of foolish outfits over. Onesies, sleepers, suits, even diaper covers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Rarity would have plenty of outfits for you. It took her only moments to select an outfit and get you dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumming Rarity then<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You woke up as a pony, a foal at that and somehow Rarity is taking care of you? What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow though you didn\u2019t feel scared. Worried, confused, and freaking out why you\u2019re suddenly a tiny pony wearing a diaper, but not scared. Maybe it\u2019s just your foolish mindset again like how the pacifier calmed you down earlier but seeing Rarity close buy calms you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course the question was what did you do now? All thoughts of a grand escape were out. Not only were the pens walls to high but you felt a deep instinctual fear at the thought of leaving by yourself.

Does my little pony need dis diaper changed?

The pacifier does calm you down, but that dosn't stop your whining and squirming as the unicorn changes your diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think somepony needs a nap.

You had been raised in secret by your aunt, Princess Celestia for 1000 years, You had finally seen your mother Princess Luna. She was so happy to see you again and you were happy to see her, but she was saddened that she had missed you growing up. But one day, after a year or so of Luna's return, Princess Celestia had made a proposition. She would use her alicorn powers to regress you to the age of a foal again so that Luna could have a chance to raise her only son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you're not to sure about doing this, but the more you thought about it, the more you seemed to like the idea, and you understood what it would mean to your mother. For starters, no one really knew who you were, and for good reason. If it had been revealed of your existence, you would have been in serious danger, for the hatred towards your mother's dark side that once had consumed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be brought back to the age of a foal again, no one would suspect a thing. To add to it, you would get to be raised by your mother and share the lifetime of 1000 years ago. The only thing that troubled you was would your mind stay the same. Celestia then told you that your memory of your current life would last for only a two or three days, after that, the foal mind would take over. Once you finally agreed, Celestia had regressed you to a foal once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so our story begins. You wake up in an open field, an apple orchard to be precise, and you were laying in a basket, but with no idea how you got there. The last hing you remember was that you had just been woken up by a noise on your second night as a foal, and somepony grabbed you. You realized stragiht away it wasn't your mother or the other two Princesses and you cried out for help in a babyish fashion since you could do nothing else at your current age of a newborn foal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember your mother screaming, \"My baby!\" and were soon in the air. Your mother had been in pursuit of your kidnapper after take-off , but then you remember as she was battling him to get to you, the Stallion had lost his grip on you and you fell, remembering nothing afterwards. It then hits you, your mother must have still been battling with him and didn't realize til after you were gone that he didn't have you, so you must have fallen from the tree above you into the basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho left it there was anypony's guess, for you have no idea where you are. You figure it is best to get your self out of the basket and explore you surroundings a bit. You didn't realize til after you were out of the basket that you couldn't even walk yet, or even talk for that matter. You look around and feel all alone, and this makes tears start welling up in your eyes. You begin to whimper, for no pony is there right now to take care of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know how long you had been crying for, but somepony in the orchard was there and had heard you. Who was it though?</span></div></div>",

She figured she would focus on that later, right now, she had to get you back to the farmhouse and check you over to make sure you weren't hurt. When the two of you got to the farmhouse, Applejack knocks on the door and she hears little hooves coming towards the door. Apple Bloom soon opened the door and Applejack says, \"Apple Bloom, go fetch me the first aid kit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on sis?\" Apple Bloom asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack turns to let Apple Bloom see you lying on her sister's back and passed out from the ride to the farmhouse. \"Oh, wear did he come from?\" Apple Bloom asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you later little sis.

She sets down the apples she had brought in near the window and comes back over to check on you. As she inspects you for any injuries, that's when she notices your wings. She had thought you were a baby unicorn upon first glance but now knew you were an alicorn. She continues to look over you, only finding minor scrapes and a bruise on you right shoulder.

We must speak with you and your sister,\" Celestia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, your majesty,\" Apple Bloom says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you had heard the mention of your mother and aunt, you were relieved they were here. Apple Bloom soon walks in with the princesses and a few guards. As soon as your mother saw you she couldn't hold back and ran straight to you. As she nuzzles you, she says, \"Oh, Night Shine, thank goodness you are okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your mother continues to nuzzle you, you hug her nose with all four hooves and she lifts her head only a little bit of the couch, just in case you lost your grip and you begin to put on your baby routine that would soon take over your mind as well and giggle, making your mother smile. \"Awwwww,\" the Apple sisters say in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess Luna, Ah didn't know you had a child,\" Applejack says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your mother has you let go and sit on the couch again, she says, \"Forgive me, Applejack. My foal was only born a few days ago, so we just haven't informed the kingdom yet. But last night, we had a pegasus who is traitor to the land in our castle who we currently have in custody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, but how does that tie in with your son showing up on our farm, if you don't mind me askin, your majesty?\" Applejack asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why we are here. Last night he tried kidnap my son and I being a loving mother wasn't going to let him get away. By the time I had realized my baby was no longer in his grasp I made sure he wasn't able to get away by giving him a leg lock enchantment. Once my sister showed up, I was searching frantically for my little one,\" Luna says with guilt in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's how he got here? Ah'm sure glad Ah found him. Ah can understand how you're feelin' Princess Luna. Ah don't know wut Ah'd do if Ah couldn't find Apple Bloom. (Apple Bloom nuzzles her big sister) Ah see now why you were here so unexpectedly your highness,\" Applejack says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite, I apologize for any trouble,\" Luna says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twas no trouble at all. The little guy wasn't a handful at all. In fact, he was a might quite while he was here, but Ah guess when you're only a few days old, ya'll don't know what to think. He has the cutest little smile too, and Night Shine is a very cute name for a cute and handsome colt like your son your highness,\" Applejack says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be getting any ideas in the future Applejack. He is too young for you,\" Luna says, as she and Applejack laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess and Applejack look over at you, which you did not notice, for you were watching Apple Bloom play picka boo with you, and even though you still had the mind of an adult, you found it funny the way she did it and were laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He had a bit of a bruise on his shoulder and a few minor cuts, but I already took care of it your highness,\" Applejack says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much Applejack. It is very much appreciated. I will have to drop by once in a while to let you see my son. He already seems to like all of you,\" Luna says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeyup, Sounds fine to me your majesty, but Ah reckon you want to get him back to the castle right now and have some time alone with him,\" Applejack says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed I do. Thank you once again Applejack,\" Luna says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for the princesses,\" Applejack says as she bows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come little one, time for us to go,\" Luna says as she comes to grab the back of your neck gently and Apple Bloom bows as well once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you are carried onto the royal carriage and Luna sets you down next to her as she lays down to curl her body around you. Celestia mounts another royal carriage and the pegasus guards soon take off dragging the prisoner behind them. Right now you felt safe and secure with your mother laying next to you. One thing you looked forward to back at the castle was a nice warm bath with your mother.</span></div></div>",

Then he notices you and his eyes widen. Um, Rainbow. Why do you have a foal with you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear the scowl in the mares voice as she responds. I found this little guy all by himself on a cloud! No parents, older siblings, baby sitter or even a diaper! Like some jerk just abandoned him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike gasped. That's horrible! I know. RD said patting your head. So I was wondering if Twilight had, I don't know, any records or something that can tell me who this little guy belongs to. I'm hoping that its just a mistake, or the little guy decided to go flying and got lost. She finished ruffling your hair a bit making you whine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her words clicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey thought you were an abandoned foal! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't right! You had to sort this out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbah! You cover your mouth in shock. Mam-pthhbaa! A-gah bah! A hole seems ot open up in your stomich when you realise you couldn't talk. A few more attempts only gets you more infantile babbling, and a smile and head pat from RD. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalkative little guy arn't ya? She aske playfully before turnign back ot Spike completly unaware of your impending freakout. So yeah, can ya help me out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon scratche his head. I don't know. Probably but Twilight is probably your best bet. But she won't be back till this afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare shrugs. Ok, cool. I just gotta watch over this little guy till then. I can do that. She said sounding, not that confident. Was she afraid to look after you? Not that you needed it! You wern't a foal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo yeah, I guess I better get this guy into a diaper. She said suddenly changing the subject. You got any from when you and Twilight babysit Spike? Your eyes widen at that. No way! You were not a foal and oyu didn't need diapers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think its a little to late for that. Spike suddenly said pointing at you. You blink, and suddenly became aware of. No way! You couldn't have! You didn't even feel the need!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh man! Sorry Spike, I'll clean it up. RD said apologetically stepping away from the puddle growing around you. Something inside you snapped. You didn't know why or how but when you came to again you were crying, the high pitched wail of a very upset foal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her credit Rainbow sprung into action almost immedatly rocking you, and hiding her grimmace. Hey, its ok. No need ot cry. She said trying to sooth you. To everyones shock it worked and you wails became whimpers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThats better! Dash said fixing a smile. Ok Spike can oyu give this little guy a bath while i get this cleaned up and some supplies? Sure thing Rainbow. Spike said holding you at arms length as you were passed to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome on, lets get you a bath. He said walking away. The prismatic pegasus gives you a wave as you are carrid away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get further away from Rainbow though you feel a sparp, almost pain in your chest as she gets further away.
