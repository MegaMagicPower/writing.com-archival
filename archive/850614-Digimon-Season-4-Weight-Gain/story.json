He couldn't get to sleep over what had been revealed to him earlier, in the afternoon. He sighed and looked up at the Three Moons and the stars shining harmoniously over The Digital World to remember the occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************************************************   <br>\r\n   The scene is a group of children lazily lounging in a grove of meat apples. The children are holders of the some of The Spirits of The Ten Legendary Warriors. A young boy with a strange and very large orange hat is chasing butterflies. An older girl with blonde hair and a pink ensemble is lounging on a rock near the foot of a river, with her shoes off, feet in the river and slowly moving them back and forth. A slightly heavy boy dressed in a blue jumpsuit with yellow pockets is cooking what look likes apples over an ample fire. A boy with his hair in a ponytail and wearing dark blue is sitting with his arms behind his head in the shade of a tree. Two strange digimon, one in red tights and one with a large, pink, waist-sized girdle were off to the side, arguing. Lastly, a boy with a green cap and yellow shirt, with a red unbuttoned shirt over it, is lounging right in the middle of all the others, apparently sleeping. The smell of cooking steak and hot dogs appear to wake him up though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Takuya yawns and stretches his arms an then sniffs the air. \"J.P., are the meat apples done?\" He asks drowsily. The boy cooking then turns to him and says, \"Almost, but I don't see how you can be hungry. All you do is sleep.\" J.P. then sighs and gets back to cooking. Takuya only smiles and says, \"I'm a growing boy! I need my meat, buddy!\" He then pats his stomach, which then gives out a very loud gurgling noise. \"You are growing Takuya!\" A voice suddenly shrieks in his ear. Takuya turns around to see... \"Kouji!\" Takuya screams in a half surprised, half annoyed voice. The boy with the ponytail only smirks and continues. \"In a horizontal direction.\" The boy known as Kouji states, demonstrating with his hands. Takuya then stares and blinks at him and then says, \"Huh?\" Ever-Clueless Takuya. Kouji sighs, but then giggles. \"I mean you're getting...\" Kouji says coming close to Takuya's face, making him blush slightly. \"Fat!\" he finishes while pulling up Takuya's shirt and grabbing hold of a small roll of flab. Takuya gasps and then blushes deeper and thinks,\u2019 Have I really gained weight?' He had noticed his clothes being slightly tighter lately. Everyone around him then laughs. \"W-well...I\" Takuya stammers before he sees something that piques his interest and then smiles slyly. \"So nice of you to notice Kouji...\" Takuya says coolly, causing everyone to stop laughing and look at him in confusion. He then pulls Kouji down to the ground and gets on top of him, causing Kouji to go scarlet. \"Maybe my new gut can compare to yours!\" Takuya screams in victory as he pulls up Kouji's shirt, and lifting up a new layer of fat occupying HIS waistline. If possible, Kouji turns an even deeper shade of red, while everyone almost falls over laughing at Takuya's rebuttal. \"You...two...need to go...to Fat Camp!\" The girl in pink, Zo\u00c3\u00ab, says; causing her, J.P., and small child, Tommy, to laugh what little sanity they had left away. Takuya and Kouji then stand up, both still slightly blushing. Takuya then shouts in fury, \"Hey! I'm not as fat as Kouji!\" pointing to the accused in blue. \"Are you calling ME fatter?! Take that back Takuya!\" Kouji screams in embarrassed rage! \"I'll prove it!\" Takuya sat fiercely back. He then takes a hold of Kouji, who becomes confused in the sudden movement, and takes off his shirt, and his own. He then rams his belly into Kouji's, whose is actually almost identical. \"Someone come over here to measure!\" Takuya screams, to deaf ears though. Kouji is Tomato red and too mortified to move, and Zo\u00c3\u00ab, J.P., and Tommy are gasping for breath on the ground. Zo\u00c3\u00ab, albeit giggling and in tears, came back to her senses first. \"They're...pretty much the same!\" she managed to get out before Kouji's stomach growled, followed by Takuya's, sending her back into uncontrollable laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   By the time everyone finally came to, needing air at least, it was night and Kouji and Takuya had their shirts back on, and were ravenously eating meat apples. Takuya with a large bump on his head, most likely from Kouji. Tommy was the first to talk. \"I can breathe again!\" He celebrated reaching for a meat apple. J.P. replied with, \"Dinner AND a show!\" Zo\u00c3\u00ab was the only serious one. \"Really you two; don\u2019t worry about it! You only looked to have gained about 7 to 10 pounds, and it isn't even noticeable with your clothes on! You'll burn it off really quickly, after our...uh...vacation.\" she ended in uncertainty. J.P. then continued, \"Yeah, those little bellies will vanish when we hear from Cherubimon or Ophanimon. We haven't heard from either in about two months, so it\u2019s understandable that you would gain a little weight in our \"time off\". I'd say you've done well not to gain more weight, especially in this grove of delicious meat apples!\" he then finished, taking a bite of his.<br>\r\nZo\u00c3\u00ab then hesitated and nervously said, while blushing, \"I actually...have been sneaking a meat apple or two every once in a while. I think I've gained weight too but-\" She was interrupted when Takuya and Kouji who had been silent the whole time, mad at each other and mourning the loss of their flat stomachs when they looked up at the mention of when Zo\u00c3\u00ab said she had snuck meat apples and asked together, \"You sneak meat apples too?\" She only nodded and sighed exasperatedingly at the two and continued, \"but I don't show weight in the same places as you two.\" She finished while blushing. J.P. was suddenly very red, but Takuya and Kouji only blinked. The Tommy tugged on her skirt tail and asked,\u201d Where DO you show it Zo\u00c3\u00ab?\" This made Zo\u00c3\u00ab\u2019s cheeks turn slightly redder, but only a little. 'Tommy is young.' She thought, or she probably would have smacked him. Then Takuya asked, \"Yeah where?\" followed by Kouji's \"What Takuya said.\" This made Zo\u00c3\u00ab furious. Veins popped out of her heads as she shrieked, \"TALK TO YOUR PARENTS!\" She then turned around to her sleeping bag, crawled in and fell asleep, grumbling. Tommy and J.P. shortly followed suit, fearing Zo\u00c3\u00ab\u2019s wrath. So then Kouji and Takuya were left, scared and confused in the dark. Kouji turned to Takuya, but then turned away in a huff, grabbing a meat apple, leaving one left, and slowly falling to sleep, mumbling something about stupid Takuya and enjoying his vacation while it lasted. Takuya tried to do the same but could not fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************<br>\r\n   Takuya sighed. The whole fiasco was comical, yet depressing at the same time. He looked over to Kouji. Sleeping, meat apple long eaten, and belly visible because of his shirt riding up and with a smile on his face. Takuya grinned. Kouji almost looked like he enjoys being chubby. He then thought, 'I guess Kouji was kind of right.' Then he looked over to the lone meat apple left and took it. 'Might as well enjoy my vacation.' He thought and took a bit while looking at his belly, just poking out of his shirt, and taking a bite. He then laid down in his sleeping bag, finishing the meat apple in one bite. 'Its only about 10 pounds. Easy to burn off. We'll hear from Ophanimon or Cherubimon...its not like I'm actually fat...I just filled out a bit...and soon I'll empty out...' Takuya finished almost in slumber. He subconsciously reached down and unbuttoned his pants, causing him to moan in pleasure, and letting his new waistline breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCherubimon's Lair... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"IDIOTS!\" Cherubimon roared trying to control his Dark Warriors, who were still slightly laughing still from the sights they had seen through Cherubimon's crystal ball. \"Do you know what you have seen?\" he questioned them. Ranamon replied first. \"Why the funniest show in the entire Digital World, honey!\" \"She Right!\" Seconded by Grumblemon. Arbormon and Duskmon remained silent; while Mercurymon finally gave Cherubimon the answer he was looking for. \"The added weight or fat to the group caused conflict, my lord. He said and bowed while smiling. \"The added weight also appeared to make them slower, weaker, and lazier.\" Cherubimon nodded in approval. \"You observe well, Mercurymon. Through my crystal ball, we have seen what this increase in weight does to the human children...and I have developed a plan...one I'm sure you'll all like....\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCherubimon... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He picked a few meat apples and finished them, burped loudly and went off to see what J.P was up to.<br>\r\n\"So are we ready to leave the grove soon?\" Takuya asked J.P as he saw his friend cooking lunch for the group.<br>\r\n\"I don't think so,\" J.P said, \"We don't need to right now...\"<br>\r\n\"But we have to defeat Cherubimon!\" Takuya cried.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but he doesn't seem to be attacking anywhere right now and we've got plenty of food right now. Maybe it's time to relax and have a little vacation for a while...\"<br>\r\n\"But!\" Takuya started, but then noticed his pants were tighter than normal. \"Just a sec, I have to use the bathroom,\" Takuya said, running off to a nearby tree.<br>\r\n\"That's funny, I don't have to go...\" Takuya said, trying harder than usual to button up his pants. He tugged hard on both ends trying to get them to fit his waist.<br>\r\n\"Come...on!\" he growled. Finally he got them over and buttoned over his wider waist and... flabby stomach.<br>\r\n\"What?\" Takuya said, and sure enough he had a soft little potbelly forming on his perfect soccer player's stomach.<br>\r\n\"I've gotta suck it in!\" Takuya said! \"I must of gained twenty pounds! No one should find out about this! I should eat less from now on!\"<br>\r\nSuddenly, the small bulge in his shirt started to growl loudly.</span></div></div>",

Within a matter of minutes, nine meat apples had been stuffed in Takuya's mouth and the other four had been eated by his friends. <br>\r\n\"Any more?\" Takuya asked eagerly handing J.P an empty plate.<br>\r\n\"No, Takuya... You kinda ate them all...\" J.P replied.<br>\r\n\"Jeez, Takuya,\" Kouji said, \"You shouldn't eat so much, you're starting to put on weight, you look like you weigh about 120 or so!\" Kouji gave Takuya's small bulge of a belly a firm poke.<br>\r\nTakuya burped loudly and then said, \"Nuh-uh! I've gained just about as much as you!\"<br>\r\nIt was true, Kouji's belly was round and beginning to strain his dark blue shirt. Kouji's arms and legs looked doughier as well.<br>\r\n\"You two boys should stop overeating,\" Zoe said.<br>\r\n\"Hey! I'll burn this all off by next week, it'll be easy!\" Takuya said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, me too.\" Kouji said in response.<br>\r\n\"Hmm, maybe we should run a bit,\" Takuya suggested.<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me,\" Kouji said, \"I'll race you to that tree up there!\" Kouji pointed to a large tree atop a huge mountain miles away from the grove.<br>\r\nBefore Kouji heard an answer, Takuya had already took off and was running fast... maybe a little slower than he remembered.<br>\r\n\"I think I can outrun chubby this time!\" thought Kouji as he started to sprint.<br>\r\nThey must have ran for about an hour, soon the two were neck to neck, panting, but they had reached the tree... at the same time!<br>\r\nThey both collapsed to the ground, panting heavily, sweating and laughing histerically. <br>\r\nKouji looked over at Takuya but his breath stopped when he saw that...</span></div></div>",

While it wasn't an entirely large change, one could clearly see that Takuya's stomach now bulged outward even more, hanging slightly over his pnats, now definately tighter. Kouji was so amazed, he leaned over for a closer look. \"T-takuya...I think you've gotten fatter!\" Takuya then looked down, and flinched in surprise. He proceeded to rub his belly. \"I..think you're right Kouji...\" Takuya was almost on the verge of tears. Had he really let himself go THIS much? Where he couldn't even lose weight on an hour long run? Takuya then noticed that Kouji was in a similar state and gasped. \"Kouji! You're fatter, too!\" the accused then stepped back to look at his own girth, which had indeed increased. The two had at least gained anywhere from three to five pounds! Kouji and Takuya then stand up, wobbling due to their new weight, and look themselves over, going from their body, to the other's and so on. There was no doubt about it. If their flabby stomachs weren't the proof, their tighter clothes sure was. The two then....</span></div></div>",

It's not funny!\" Takuya said,\"I dunno... maybe my body digested the food a little late, that's all...\"<br>\r\n\"You look like you gained fifteen pounds up there! You two must weight about 140 lbs!\" J.P exclaimed.<br>\r\nBoth boys were chubby around the edges and their shirts were bulging with their rounder bellies which protruded four or five or even six inches.

The brunette was in a panic. Instead of shrinking over night, he had grown! A lot! His belly was larger and stuck out further than yesterday and his arms and legs, once lean from siccer, were now completely covered in a generous layer of fat. His chest was also poofed out slightly in a feminine manner, the small amount of fat there barely being supported by his frame. he was a good 200 pounds! At least! Takuya slowly sat down and hugged his knees. 'What's happening to us?!' he thought desperately. He had woken early and had strolled over to a nearby meat apple tree, picked a few, and had started munching away when he saw his reflection in the lake. the meat apples and his shirt lay in a pile near the water. he had dropped the meat apples in his panic, and had peeled off his shirt to further examine his body. he had to resist the urge to take off his pants. they were so tight, cutting into the rolls of his stomach.

Next to him, Zoe was also in hysteria, her plump middles now hanging over her miniskirt and her top strained a bit as well. Kouji was blushing madly trying to pull his shirt over his drooping belly, but to no avail. The garment was just too small to cover the new rolls he had grown overnight. J.P., it seems, was the only one not going insane, a slightly irriated look on his face, but the seems on his jumpsiuit also slightly more stretched. Takuya snickered but remembered his own hysterics only miutes ago, and pulled his shirt back on, which he now noticed, no longer fit and left some of his belly hanging out, like Kouji, still fervantly to pull it down. he then walked, or waddled over, noting how his theighs rubbed together.<br>\r\nAfter the long and tedious process of calming everyone down, as J.P. had been chunky and was not as alarmed as the others, Tommy and zoe had stopped bawling, but were still sniffling, and Kouji reluctantly agreed to stop fiddling with his shirt and just \"let it all hang out\" as takuya had stated in trying to calm him, gesturing to his own stomach hanging out of his shirt. The group was now asembled, cool, and collected...well, for the most part at least. Now it was time to decide a plan of action. \"Hmm...\" Takuya mumbled, standing before the others.

However, I know the child of light can be prone to not talking, and after fights they may not talk at all. If they do not fatten up, you WILL be punished.\" Cherubimon finished, leaving a nervous Mercurymon. \"You all may leave now.\" The Dark Warriors bowed and then left Cherubimon's chambers. Alone, Cherubimon concentrated, his eyes glowing a deathly red, before stopping. \"It is done.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************<br>\r\n Takuya, amazingly, woke first that morning...or so he thought. Kouji appeared to be sitting undeer the shade of a tree. Takuya sighed inwardly. It wasn't even hot yet. 'I guess I should apologize for before though...' he thought and walked over to join the boy in blue, who slightly glared at the approaching brunette. Takuya then plopped down next to Kouji and proceeded to make himself comfortable. He then spoke. \"Kouji...I'm sorry for that little stunt I pulled last night, I guess I got a little carried away...I suppose I just got a little angry, I mean I only played soccer every day for ten years to see my flat stomach vanish in the wake of a layer of fat? I don't think so...\" By now Kouji's face was thoughtful. \"So i got mad when you called me fat, it not like I'm not though, but I shouldn't have called YOU fat, or made us strippers and a comedy show for the others...though it was pretty funny...\" Takuya stopped to remember the moment. Strangely, his stomach started to push up on his shirt more... \"It was...\" Takuya was startled by Kouji's voice. \"Funny that is. I just prolonged our little escapade, though, it wasn't just you Taku-kun. I was too parylyzed and embarassed to even resist you pulling my shirt off, or trying to get it back on, for that matter, and you don't have to beat around the bush, I'm as fat as you are.\" Kouji proved his point by latching onto a piece of flab, much like he did yesterday. Kouji didn't notice his own gut get flabbier. \"The proof lies right here. Whatever are we going to do to lose all of this weight? We can't let a god-like body of yours deteriorate to that of a pig's!\" Takuya squeeled at first, but then retaliated, grabbing onto a piece of Kouji's jiggley stomach. \"But what about your great physique? You Adonis-like pecs and abdominals? Are we doomed to a Kouji with a potbelly?\" They both laughed at their jokes and continued to poke, slap, or latch onto each other's rounded bellies...until they caught sight of a clueless looking Tommy and Zoe and J.P. about to burst out in a fit of giggles, causing deep blushes to rise forth from their faces, and immeadiate separation. \"Did we interrupt something? Your secret relationship perhaps?\" Zoe managed to say, with mock horror on her slightly pudgey features. \"We're sorry. Go back to cuddling.\" 'Oh no.' Kouji thought and gulped. This was like last night. Takuya would never let something like this go by without retaliating. He looked over to see the familiar fire in the gogglehead's eyes and moaned inwardly. He was right. Takuya then got up and wrapped his arms around Kouji, causing him to go scarlet. He then had a look of mock horror on his face. \"Oh no Kouji! Whatever are we to do? We have been found out, but our love shall prevail!\" This caused Zoe and J.P. to fall over in laughter. This apparently happens a lot around here. Tommy was still clueless, and now Kouji was up and about to bop Takuya on the head when Tommy asked a question. \"Are you two what they call ho-mo-sex-uals?\" The boys in red and blue blushed and froze. J.P. and Zoe only laughed harder. Tommy was smiling in apparent understanding now. \"You make a cute couple.\" Again, more laughing and more blushing. \"...but who's gonna' wear the wedding dress? And how will you get children?\" Everyone was silent after this, Takuya's and Kouji's blush more intense than ever. Then Zoe and J.P. commensed into the longest session of laughing ever, crying, snorting, and gasping for breath. Kouji and Takuya then looked at each other, and amazingly, joined in, leaving poor Tommy as confused as ever. Noone seemed to notice that Takuya's and Kouji's bellies had rounded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n************************************************** <br>\r\nTakuya sighed as he grabbed a meat apple. It had been a long day. After they had all recovered from their fits of laughter, and explaining some, ahem, 'things' to Tommy, they had gathered a huge amount of meat apples, and thrown a party. He burped and then chuckled. He felt the consequences, too. His pants felt tighter than ever. The gang may grow through rough spots, but they all meshed pretty well. Looking around, Takuya then discovered he and Kouji were the last ones awake. All the others, he realized, had retired at least half an hour ago. Kouji, like himself, was polishing off the last few meat apples, so he went over and sat next to the boy with ebony hair. This time, Kouji smiled at him, instead of glaring. \"You know-\" Takuya began, but stopped when he heard noises in the far end of camp. He looked at Kouji, who nodded at him, and they both got up to investigate. <br>\r\n Upon arrival they saw or heard no more, and found nothing after an investigation. They were about to leave when something strange happened... </span></div></div>",

In a sharp moment later, a rustling of leaves sounded closer to them... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear spread and polluted their faces for just an instant as their eyes widened and Takuya's mouth dropped slightly. Both Takuya and Kouji sprung up into the air, a little more clumsily and sluggishly than usual, but then again it was late at night... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji and Takuya quickly threw their arms up in a defensive state as a first thought. A few seconds passed by... Kouji turned to Takuya and smirked at him as he lowered his arms. In response, Takuya shrugged and adopted the same position as the two dismissed the source of the sound, whatever it was to be harmless and posing no threat to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys walked around to the other side of the thick tree they were originally sitting by where they found a fallen branch laying on the grassy field and a familiar purple-clad girl laying next to it, moaning quietly on the ground, rubbing a bruise her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow...\" she scowled, placing her other hand on her head, her eyes closed, \"That's really funny... that branch looked much stronger...\" Suddenly, her eyes sprung open and she saw that Kouji and Takuya were standing right by the tree, first looking at her with eyes that demonstrated curiousity, then embarassment, then admonition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quick as she could, Zoe picked herself up, dusted herself, and picked up the half-eaten meat apple she had dropped on the ground during the fall. Taking a bite out of the meat apple and smiling innocently, Zoe shrugged, \"Uhm... hi guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zoe...\" Takuya said, quickly searching for the right words- he didn't want to right away start asking if she had heard them, or if she was watching them the whole time, or, \"What... what were you doing up there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe had an equal look of thought on her slightly round face for a quick moment as she answered, \"Oh, I was eating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I thought you had gone to sleep a half an hour ago...\" Takuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did- but I heard something near the back of the camp... I couldn't find anything, so I decided to have a little midnight snack,\" Zoe admitted- Takuya nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But did you hear the noise after or before you were up in the tree?\" Kouji put in, finally talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe blushed, \"Well, maybe I was up in the tree before then- but what does that matter to you?\" Suddenly, the color in Zoe's face drained as her eyes shifted for a second. A grin appeared on her face, \"Ah... I see...\" she laughed, \"You two are worried, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worried?\" Takuya frowned, trying not to let any emotion show on his face, wondering how Kouji was able to do it sometimes so easily, \"What do you mean worried? What do you think I should be worried about?\" Takuya said rapidly and quite nervously, suddenly regretting what he had just spoken... he should have thought first...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Zoe smirked, \"If you must know-\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Beliamon grew even more nervous by the moment, and more and more unsure of her own abilities by the second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took note of her surroundings. The grove that the humans were sleeping in was a clearing surrounded by tall, dark trees. In the center of the grove was a concentretion of lighter, younger looking trees, they were much shorter and beared fruit. The fruit that hung onto the trees varied in color, but for the most part they were plump, white, shiny apples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese must be those meat apples I've heard about, Beliamon smirked as she turned her head up to see the white fruits waving slightly over on their branches with the warm, calm breezes of the night. Certainly, they must have been staying here for a while as their camp didn't appear newly settled and there was a bit of a cumulative mess towards the left side of the site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Beliamon noticed the humans themselves. Sure, she had know they would be there sleeping, but actually seeing them sleeping was seemed different altogether. Seeing them slumber peacefully under the cool moonlight while she was intruding and would ultimately break and violate that peace struck her, but just a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf they woke up, they would see her for sure, and they might jump to the conclusion that she was with Cherubimon or had her own evil motives, and for that, they would be partially correct. Beliamon found it hard to believe that these quiet, little, sleeping children could transform into some of the Ten Legendary Warriors, possibly with enough power to tear her to pieces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but lucky for her, she had quite a bit of power of her own to dispense so that wouldn't happen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe counted five of them total. There was one brown-haired boy who looked quite heavy already that was wearing a blue, zipper-down jumpsuit, and he appeared to be sleeping in a pile of leaves. On the opposite side of the camp, seemingly, as far away from this boy as possible was the only girl in the entire party- she had blond hair and wore a purple dress, striped top, and jacket that also happened to be purple. She was turned over to one side in a hammock between two of the meat apple trees- one of the white meat apples had fallen from one of the trees into the hammock and had landed to her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe I should gather a few meat apples before I leave... Beliamon contemplated as she looked towards the middle of the camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one, small, very young boy, who owned a large, orange hat and was currently using it as a pillow. He laid quietly sleeping close by another boy laying his back against a tree. This other boy wore goggles and had a yellow shirt on. He rested his hands on his belly, which seemed a bit swollen and was snoring loudly with his mouth wide open with his eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't want to harm them... honestly, she felt too bad about even being there. Although she did sigh a breath of relief that it was she, a mage that specialized in fattening, that was selected and not some quiet, assassain digimon to kill them. But there had to be a reason why Dark Lord Cherubimon wanted them fattened as opposed to killed if he hated them and wanted them destroyed so badly. She wasn't exactly even sure of why he wanted them in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, her eyes caught the last slumbering boy. He too was lying against a tree, although it was apparent that he spaced himself far away from the others. Beliamon could tell that he was a loner for one reason or another. He had long dark hair and wore a blue jacket and appeared distressed, even when sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then when Beliamon decided that she would take matters into her own hands. She would have to stall, and she wasn't exactly sure on what she was doing, but it was something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the boy who dressed in dark blue, she snapped her fingers and watched as his body began to slowly, eerily float upwards as he started to glow with a yellow aura. His body floated belly-up through the night air gracefully to Beliamon's side as she noticed a bag was left by the tree where he had been sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" she observed, whispering to herself, \"I might not want to leave that here,\" she said as she made it levitate too, directly to her hand, but it was much harder to levitate two things at once and she had to concentrete very hard until the bag was in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sure to put a few... well, to be truthful, a little more than a dozen meat apples in the bag. As she turned her vision to the boy who was floating by her side in midair, laying flat and parallel to the ground, she caught sight of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed indifferent and peaceful yet there was something about his sleeping face that signaled that even he knew something was going on. She looked directly into his face and whispered, \"Tell me your name,\" as his golden aura sparkled a little bit more brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubconciously and in the core of his sleep, he only muttered one word, \"Kouji...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kouji, huh?\" she asked as she started to walk away from the camp. Like magic, Kouji's body hovered and followed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had planned it that she would hide for just a while, do her job with one child before moving onto the next. By seperating the children and keeping tabs on where exactly they were, it would give Cherubimon a great upper hand... but honestly, she really felt she didn't have the heart to do it...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Where was he? How had he gotten here? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese questions raced through Kouji's mind at mach speed as his eyes slowly adjusted to the light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was in a cave, apparently, from the rough wallls and lack of light, but yet it looked somehow lived in. A large, round table of stone simply rose from the earth a few feet away from him,  and their were smaller rises littered around- chairs, Kouji would guess. Kouji himslef was sprawled out upund several cloth mats with a pile of straw beneath him, similar to traditional Japanese futons, basically in the center of the room. What little light that was filtering into the room came from a skylight of sorts behind him. Under that skylight there was also a pit and several branches and twigs, for a fire at night. Several torches also lined the walls but at the moment were out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStraining his eyes even further, Kouji was also to make out several passageways throughout the large room he was currently in. Unlike normal cave passages, they were vertical and rectangular in shape, like most modern doors, but were slightly wider. However, so far away to where he could hardly see them, there was a  quite large marble door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gaze locked on the door, Kouji's mind shifter from where he was and how he had gotten here to how he could get out. He would suppose those doors were the main entrance to the cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't bother even thinking about that door. There's no use escaping. Not only is its weight colossal, but I've mackicked it to where it would take all of the Ten Legendary Warriors or pehaps the Dark Lord Cherubimon himself to break through it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji jumped at the voice that had suddenly penetrated his thought and the silence of the cave. Now he was able to see very faintly someone sitting on the other side of the large table-like rock formation he had noticed earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShock quickly turning to anger, Kouji stood and took a figting stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And exactly who are you? Why did you bring me here?!\" Kouji growled. \"Are you working for Cherubimon?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure chuckled lightly and stood up to meander its way slowly into the dim light where Kouji was able to see it completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first he had thought her to be human-but then glanced to her folded ebony wings, her strnage clothing, and the markings all over her body Other than that she could pass for a normal human teenage female, with long blonde hair and an entertained expression lining her features. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Beliamon, and you, Warrior of Light,\" She said, lifting a dainty finger at Kouji, \"are my prisoner until further notice from Dark lord Cherubimon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes narrowing in fury, Kouji reached for his digivice, but found it gone. Gasping, he searched for it, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling more loudly this, tome, Kouji turned back to Beliamon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really Kouji, you underestimate my intelliegence! Do you honestly think I would let you hang on to that bauble of yours and actually become a threat to me?\" Beliamon asked sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is it!? And where are we!? And how do you know my name!?\" Kouji asked, his temper returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, you underestimate my intelliegence. Your little trinket will be returned to you when the time is right, and no sooner. As for where we are,\" Beliamon paused shortly and her eyes became clouded. \"We are in an isolated part of the Digital World that not even Trailmon have been able to reach for decades. This cave was once a temple for a village of arcane mage digimon, like myself, before...Dark Lord Cherubimon destroyed most of them...As for you name, you told me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji noted the hint of sadness in her voice, but was too angry at the strange digimon for kidnapping him to care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you may have my digivice, but my friends will come for me!\" He proclaimed, brushing off the fact on how she knew his name as her trying to mess with his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon glanced at his as if his IQ was three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, even Trailmon have not been able to reach this place for years, and while I suppose flying digimon could, I could easily dispense the Warrior of Wind.\" Beliamon stated confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IF you're so strong, give me my digivice and we'll fight.\" Kouji countered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Kouji's remark a hint of a smile came across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try, Kouji, but no. I don't want to hurt you. If you havn't noticed, this cave is quite dark, and darkness is your weak point, yet my strong point. Anyway, you'd lose.\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji growled again at the insult to his power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you so sure?\" He asked, fury lining his voice and pointed to the marble door in the backgrond. \"If you're so strong, how did you open and close that seemingly unopenable door?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon gave him a dry look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your current digivolutions, Lobomon and KendoGarurumon ae both weak in darkness, while I'm strong in it. Not to mention, while I'm at champion level, I can easily defeat an Angewoman. If I digivolve I can even hold my own with a Royal Knight. And I didn't use that door, it's been sealed since the destruction Ayzahn Ra, the village this temple resided in. I used the skylight.\" Beliamon pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji once again examined the light filtering down from the skylight, the gears in his head turning again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and by the way,\" Beliamon chimed in. \"Don't think of escaping through there either. I've magicked the opening to act as a forcefield, as while we can see out, no one else can see in. It also masks the smoke from fires we would light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji turned back to her and scowled at having his plan put out so early. Beliamon chcukled at the look on his face and threw something to him, which out of reflex he caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a cooked meat apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already cooked it. you can snack on it while I get Dinner ready.\" Belaimon stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji licked his lips in temptation, but laid the apple down beside of him and crossed his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't accept food from kidnappers.\" He said icily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you might as well,\" Beliamon huffed, putting her hands on her hips. \"There's no telling on how long you'll be here with me, though its more likely to be longer than shorter, and it looks like you've done a good job of feeding youself so far.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon giggled as Kouji gasped and realized the whole time he had been 'chatting' with Beliamon, his shirt had ridden up and had been displaying the slight roll of flab recently added to his formerly fit frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning scarlet, he hastily pulled his shirt back down to hide his paunch as Beliamon continued to giggle as she walked down one of the passageways and her voice echoed throughtout the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really nothing to worry about, Kouji. From what I understand of the Real World, a lot of kids are becoming fatter. Its not so uncommon. Some people even prefer being plus sized! You'll grow into it!\" Beliamon laughed at her joke as she continued down the passageway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill a bit embarassed, and keeping a check on his shirt, Kouji wondered about his captor. She had kidnapped him, and was apperently working for Cherubimon, but she didn't really seem evil. She seemed quite bubbly sometimes, like Takuya and Zoe, but like himself, he felt a great sadnes within her. She could also be serious, and yet sarcastic, and she also emanated power. He estimated she could hold her own against any of Cherubimon's Warriors and that her claims of power were true. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsentmindely, Kouji wondered what he was going to do until he was rescued....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIF he was rescued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing bored with the room, and wanting to keep an eye on his 'host', Kouji deliberated on whether or not he should follow her, as he could still hear her footsteps faintly and the rustle of her unique dress. Weighing the two choices quickly, Kouji decided to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kouji decided to wait until his captor returned from doing whatever she was really doing. Beliamon had told him that she departed to make dinner, but Kouji suspected something much more sinister. In fact, Kouji believed that all he would really get for dinner was the white meat apple that she had tossed him before- the same meat apple gleamed innocently and sat directly across from him as he looked at it with great discern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only he had his digivice, then he could escape and return back to the others. Unfortunately, accessing the powers of his digivice wasn't going to be an option for the near future... Perhaps Beliamon had implied that she had it with her, and maybe then he could try and take it from her at night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji shook his head. There was no way he could count on such a half-baked plan. Beliamon had mentioned that darkness was her specialty, and more than likely, she could catch him in the act before he was even close to reclaiming his precious digivice. That was exactly what Takuya would have done, but at least he would have tried something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't very much to see up in the skylight- not much, except to simply observe that it was starting to get dark out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must have been out longer than I thought,\" Kouji grumbled to himself as he tried to stretch his stiff joints. Theoretically, if he was taken by Beliamon when he was asleep last night, then he would have woken up normally by morning, but here he was just awoken at about late afternoon by his guesses. It could only have been Beliamon's spells that put him in such long a sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud churning, grumble came from deep within... not the caves, but Kouji's belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he felt that if there was one thing he needed, it would definitely be food. His stomach growling made him look back to the meat apple, which was directly in front of him, unmoving and unyielding and utterly appealing to the eye. It was smooth, solid, and a glossy, pale white- it could have just as well been made of ivory if he didn't know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remembered the first time he had meat apples. Bokumon had explained, as always, that when cooked, the snow colored apples took on the flavor of a meat... but what meat it tasted like was random and a complete suprise to the one who tasted it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji turned his thoughts away from the meat apple- he had to, it was just too tempting. There was no way Kouji would accept Beliamon's food. She had kidnapped him and was holding him hostage- why would he ever give himself over to her? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy would he ever accept any gifts from her? That would just prove that he was weak. That's the last thing he wanted her to think, that he was just some little weakling that could be easily held hostage and taken care of. He had to put up some struggle against her and stand strong! He had to fight that temptation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy in blue peered down a long, dark, cave passage. He took note that this was not the one that Beliamon had ventured down. What if he went down that mysterious passage? Where would he end up going? Perhaps to a way out, to freedom, and to his friends... or perhaps he would end up getting himself lost in a multi-layed labyrinth of catacombs that crumble and collapse ever so easily- then, almost instantaneously, he would find a quick and early grave... And even if he found a way out, the outside might be a complete wasteland or empty, dusty plain- like Beliamon said, even the Trailmon hadn't found their way here... and it all seemed hopeless... and now Kouji faced dealing with a sense of defeat, that he would have to deal with Beliamon's whims possibly forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was lamenting over his no-win scenario and sunk hopes, his mind zig-zagged and sidetracked back over to a familiar fruit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what flavor it really is?\" he asked himself as he caught himself reaching forward to the meat apple. Quickly, he retracted his hand as if it had just touched upon a hot iron, shocked at himself. Was he that weak? He wanted to slap that reaching hand so much... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was he thinking? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had almost submitted himself over to that tempting present, that devious meat apple. He had almost given in to the alluring, tantalizing sensation of... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach growled, groaned, and even started to pain him a little... He was starving! This was absolute torture to behold! It was horrible, and that terrible Beliamon had planned it all- she knew he would drive himself crazy over it, but when she threw it to him, it didn't seem that way. She tossed it to him lightly, almost without a second thought... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, he still wouldn't let himself be such a pushover... but he couldn't help but wonder if it was gingered pork, his favorite- it had always been one of his most favored of dinners and it also happened to be the flavor of his first meat apple: ginger pork, a combination of words that made his mouth water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a thought came across his mind... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one instance he could think of- one instance only, where he could eat the meat apple, and it would be perfectly acceptable and understandable, but itwould only be in an emergency. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Beliamon ended up abandoning him in the cave, then it would be alright for him to eat the apple, he guessed. You see, if she left him there to starve, then it would be a matter of survival. Yes, she could have been merely toying with him before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji then remembered something else- meat apples taste horrible if raw. Now he wondered if meat apples got this way if they cooled off for too long... and there was just only one way to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to stop himself, but then he realized that nobody was really there to stop him or even notice for that matter- besides, it was just a measly meat apple, and he was simply making a big deal about it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning over from his crosslegged position, Kouji quickly snatched the meat apple into his grasp. He sighed to himself in pleasure and relief when he found it still warm. Then, after turning it over and around in his hands a few times, he contemplated a bit, but then took a big mouthful out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, his mouth flooded with the sweet flavor of warm gingered pork- it was just too good to be true! His body swarmed with energy and increased strength as he savored the taste. It was all too good, and only a moment later he swallowed reluctantly. He looked around cautiously to make sure that nobody was looking, and then he took another bite greedily, then another, and another. He was pretty hungry, after all, and although he was content for the moment, he still had to admit he was a little hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, hiding the meat apple core where nobody could find it, in a large crevice in the cave wall, Kouji returned to the same position he was sitting in and continued to sit for a long while. At least he was content, but he prayed that Beliamon wouldn't find out... maybe it wouldn't be as big a deal to her, though, Kouji thought again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Kouji continued to wait... and wait... and wait, in that same cross-legged position with his head down. After a while, a familiar voice and figure became apparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... you just won't give up, will you? I'm telling you, you're so stubborn...\" came the voice of Beliamon as she emerged from the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji glared up at her but said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I hate to say it, but I've been here watching you for quite a while,\" Beliamon stated, \"And you haven't moved since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji grew a little nervous that she might have seen him pigging out on the meat apple, weakly giving into temptation, much unlike the Warrior of Light she took him to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dinner's only going to get cold, you know,\" Beliamon murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she had cooked dinner after all, Kouji thought with optimism. Lowering his vision from her, Kouji muttered, \"I'm sorry, but I can't accept your food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon placed her hands on her hips and looked worried, \"You're so stubborn!\" she exclaimed, \"Loosen up a little or you just might starve yourself to death- I didn't poison anything, for your information.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm, poison, Kouji didn't think of that yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji didn't reply, but rather gave an icy stare in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I spent all that time... Why don't you just follow me into the kitchen? I'm sure I made at least one thing you like- maybe you'll like my food as much as you did that meat apple,\" she grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji jerked nervously, blushed vividly, and felt like he was about to puke. So she had seen him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly pulling himself together, Kouji muttered, \"Yeah, well... go ahead, I'll get up and see you there when I see you, when I feel like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know...\" Beliamon remarked before turning around to return to the kitchen, \"I'm sorry, but I have a bad feeling that you'll be sitting there feeling sorry for yourself all night long. That's just fine by me if you want to be that way,\" she huffed as she sashayed down the passage, her dress audibly russling against the floor, \"I'll be in the kitchen if you admit you need anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji continued to sit, his legs falling asleep, and his mind a little befuddled.</span></div></div>",

I should just poison him, Cherubimon would be just as happy...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese thoughts whirled through Beliamon's head as she furiously stomped her way back to the kitchen, fully intent on letting him starve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although...\" Beliamon bit her lip. \"I would get in trouble for not following Cherubimon's orders...and I can't afford provoking his wrath now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon paused a moment and shivered a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No....not now or not ever again...\" She muttered, quickly picking up her pace again to prevent certain memories coming to her that she didn't want to remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally returning to the kitchen, she eyed the wonderful, delicious, delectible dinner that she had COOKED, to only have Kouji refuse: Several helpings of roast beef, flavored with saffron and ginseng, an ample serving of mashed potatoes, several rolls with butter, a tankard of frosty milk, and a small sized sundae. The meal, wasn't perfect, but again Beliamon hadn't used her magic. If she had, she could have made a meal twenty times as better and fifty times as tasty as the one before her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitchen, though still natural, was a bit more modernized than the room Kouji was in, what she called the common room. The walls here were made of a blue stone instead of brown and a skylight let light drift down into the room, and like the one in the common room, as well as all the other skylights in the temple, this  one had been magicked to prevent intrusion or escape. Littered around the room were several structures that looked like kitchen appliances, fashioned out of a black stone. Long ago, Beliamon had learned that the Mages of this temple had commisioned some artisan digimon in the far south to make appliances for them so they would not have to venture out of the temple for food. That had been when Beliamon was still classified as an 'in-training' digimon, and when Ayzahn Ra and this temple had still been flourishing. Amazingly, the appliances still worked and the Mages had left great stores of food behind, magicked to prevent spoiling. Also in the room were a 'table and chairs' similar to the ones in the common room, but smaller. Also, like the common room, several other pasageways branched off of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she had finished the meal, she had magicked it to keep what should have been hot, hot, and what should have been cold, cold, to observe her captive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been delighted when he had caved into his cravings for the meat apple, but her good mood had been nigh eliminated when he refused to come eat his dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Beliamon again glanced at the food before her and contemplated a bit. Rolling her eyes, she decided that she might as well take his food to him. He WAS going to eat, sooner or later. He wasn't just about to let himself starve, unless he wanted to eat the occasional bug crawling across the floor, and she wasn't about to let him get thin again and have his way with her. If she didn't feed him, he was liable to lose all the weight he'd already acquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he'd start eating more, and hopefully, he'd open up to her. That's when he would willingly eat whatever she gave to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mood lifting a bit, she put all of the food on a tray and levitated it beside herself and she quickly walked back towards the common room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, Kouji wasn't in the same position she'd left him in, but what she saw made her blood boil: He'd left the comfort of his straw bed and was on the floor a few feet away struggling to do some sit-ups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmeadiately, she pranced over to his position and hoisted him off of the ground. He was red in the face and beginning to sweat and his shirt had once hiked up during his exercise. At first startled by Beliamon and her angry expression and the tray of food hovering next to her, his face quickly formed a scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I ask what you were doing?\" Belimon asked, her anger obvious but controlled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji snorted ans crossed his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that its nay of your business, but as you pointed out earlier, I'm getting fat and I was trying to lose the extra pounds I'd gained.\" He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will NOT do any exercise while you are MY prisoner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And WHY not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon almost blurted out 'Because you're supposed to be GAINING weight.', but bit her tongue. Calming herself, she quickly thought up  an excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you havn't eaten anything. If you don't eat, you'll run out of energy. Not to mention the floor of this temple is rough. You'll hurt yourself. From now on, I forbid any exercise at all.\" Belaimon said regally while pushing Kouji back to his 'bed'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I don't listen?\" Kouji taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon's eyes darkened and Kouji felt a wave of power rush out from her. She smirked as she liad the tray of food on his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DO you really want to know?\" She asked playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji just glared at her, and then the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you I'm not eating anything you give me.\" He remarked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon gave him a withering look and sighed, pinching a small piece of roast beef and poppin it into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, its not poisonous.\" She tried to ease his worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the other food?\" Kouji questioned, still suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyebrow started to tick in irritation but Beliamon quickly sampled a bit of all of the other food on Kouji's plate, making sure he saw her chew and swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji again glanced the food for a moment, and back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I be sue you not just immune to whatever you put in it?\" He asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon growled in annoyance at Kouji's five-hundrendth question and bent down to come an inch form his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assure you that I did not in any way, shape, or form poison ro tamper with your food,\" She assured, a vein visible on her forehead. \"Now will you please just eat!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji's eyes widened at her outburst, but again looked at the food. She felt a small glimmer of satisfaction when she saw him lick his lips. He looked back and forth between her and the food a few mometns before sighing in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's not enough light.\" HE said matter-of-factly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile coming to her lips, Beliamon waved her hand and a fire appeared in the pit under the skylight behing Kouji. She laughed a bit when he jumped at the sudden light and noise of the fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how did you do that!?\" He asked in bewilderment as Beliamon took a seat in the floor across from him. \"I thought you said that your powers were derived from Darkness!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said my specialty was Darkness. I can do other magic and draw power from other elements as well. I told you that I used to live in the village beyond this cave of a temple, a village of quite powerful mages. I learned most of my magic, there.\" She said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh...I see.\" Was all Kouji said as he poked his food, and the two sat in relative silence for a while, with only the occasional sound from deeper within the temple to keep them company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said the floor was uncomfortable?\" Kouji asked after a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sitting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji looked at her strangely for a moment before she realized she was levitating just an inch or so off of the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlabbergasted, Kouji almost choked on a piece of roast beef. Beliamon giggled as she waited for him to right himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really must be powerful. Most digimon, to my knowledge, don't have those types of abilities, and most have to shout the names of their attacks.\" Kouji replied, a thoughtful look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon nodded, an almost sad look to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In Ayzahn Ra, there were many more powerful digimon than I....but yes, if I used an actual attack, it would be more powerful. I cna't just use them any time, though. They take a lot of energy, physical and magical. I can't use hem like I use my normal magic.\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo there's no limit to the type of magic yu're using now?\" Kouji asked in wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, of course not. Everything has it limits, magic included. And everything...has an end...\" Beliamon trailed off a sad look once again in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two once sat again in silence, and Kouji watched Belimaon with that look till present in her eyes. Finally, he decided to break the silence with a question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said that my friends or even Trailmon couldn't get here, why is that?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon jumped, snapped out of her reverie, and looked at Kouji suspiciously for a moment before coming to the decision that it was safe to tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your ventures across the Digital World, you've came across a few areas like bottomless pits have you not?\" She questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are ares in which the data that compromised them had been completely detroyed or absorbed by Cherubimon or his followers.\" She explained as Kouji gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We...knew that he was gathering data from Digimon...\", Kouji murmured, shocked. \"But not from the very Digital World itself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon nodded sadly and continued her explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ayzahn Ra, the surrounding area, and this temple, The Temple of Earth, if you're wondering, that's why its so like a cave, it was built onto one; are all that's not been absorbed in this area. Now what's left is like an island in a sea of nothingness.\" Belimaon said quietly, higginh her knees to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then...how did you get here?\" Kouji asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I used a teleportation spell. I could've flown, but the flight is quite tiring and many weaker digimon coudn't make it.\" Beliamon elaborated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother small silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said Temple of Earth...\" Kouji muttered, a spark of an idea forming in his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon smiled and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...surrounding Ayzahn Ra there were once nine other temples, dedicated to the elemenst of the Ten Legendary Warriors. Ayzahn Ra was a village of mage digimon dedicated to these elements in both Magic and Physical Combat...but  all the other temples and digimon were destroyed when their data was absrorbed.\" Beliamon said, a sad smile on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji gazed at the strange digimon that had captured him. It was clear that she carried a great sorrow in her heart and a great burden in her soul, but he could also sense she was not telling him something. He almost felt sorry for her, but he was still light years from trusting her, or even liking her, but she had some of his respect...some, not all. After all, she HAD kidnapped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm done.\" Kouji said simply and pushed the tray away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon glanced at the tray, then him, and scowled. HE hadn't eaten very much, though he had taken a large chunk out of the sundae. It appeared that Kouji had a sweet tooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon stored that fact in her mind for future use and got up to return the tray to the kitchen, guessing that this was as much Kouji would eat...for now at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll return this to the kitchen. If I were you, I'd get some sleep. Its gotten quite late since you woke up earlier this afternoon.\" She commented as she entered the passageway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite, being under Belimon's speel earlier, Kouji did feel a bit sleepy and curled up into his bed; it was actually quitr comfy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before he feel asleep, he heard Beliamon's giggles echoing through the passageways of the Temple of Earth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kouji's icy eyes snapped open, glittering and shimmering somehow in the very dim light, reacting to the sound, or lack there of, around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing, really, nothing at all was alive around him. There should have been the occasional rat or bug scampering about the cave floor, but now, in the cavern room he was in, there was nothing but silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warm, dancing flames of the fire pit had long since gone out, but in the back of his mind, Kouji wondered if the flames were really eternal and would just go on forever and Beliamon had to cause them to extinguish. Now, as a result, it was just a little too cool for Kouji's comfort. Kouji had to huddle up and bury his pale hands in his pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up at the skylight to observe an ashen gray cast sky. Not a cloud was up there, it was all uniform and bland. Kouji wondered and began to doubt that the skies were like that every day when the now-ruined city, Amon Ra, or whatever Beliamon had called it, was flourishing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji felt sleep pulling at his conciousness again, much to his annoyance. It might have been the only quirk his sleep patterns had: some days he would sleep perfectly, but on some nights, usually on those when he was somewhat distressed, he would wake up involuntarily at the heart of night or a waking twilight hour and stay awake for about an hour. He would start contemplating and worrying, only to fall asleep and forget it all, even after he had woken up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor about an hour, Kouji napped on and off. If Takuya or J.P. were here, he could just look at their wristwatches and figure out what time it was. It felt like three o'clock to him, but with that sky neither bright nor dark, there was no way of telling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring that hour, Kouji could feel the room begin to warm up, and warm mist and fog began to pour from the skylight. It was at this time when Kouji arose from his straw bed, holding himself up and straightening his back with two hands while he lay his feet out, sprawling apart.<br>\r\nHe was fairly confident that his friends would come and rescue him- not that Kouji needed any rescuing in the first place, he was just fine by himself, could probably find a way out of this sticky situation all by himself, and would find his way back all by himself... well, at least, that's what Kouji wanted to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong, drawn out yawns filled Kouji's mouth as he started to lay back down, his hands resting on his stomach. The boy in blue started to frown down on himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you really did dig in last night, Kouji,\" he whispered regretfully to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you really shouldn't have,\" he told himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if she came in her today with a frying pan and offered you a heaping breakfast, would you be able to resist?\" he asked himself, hoping to find the answer himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt really bad that he had caved in last night, although he HAD shown some moderation and didn't scarf down the whole meal- at least he had given resistance towards his odd captor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now you're sorry?\" Kouji smirked at his own feelings. Suddenly, his nerves gave way with a loud rumble from the belly. A reluctant smile crept up his face which soon loosed and widened with glee as it took form. Soon he was in food fantasy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you know just as well as I that it was so goood...\" Kouji sighed with delight. He continued to grin, as his eyes closed and he descended into a dreamlike table full of delectables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kouji turned his head in his half-sleep, a stray strand of straw tickled his nose and caused his eyes to snap open for the second time this morning- in a matter of seconds, Kouji was out of his self-induced trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was upset with himself for being hungry, but Kouji couldn't blame himself. It was just a natural thing. People DO get hungry if they don't eat properly, after all. However, he had to look at the facts cut and dry: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had already accepted Beliamon's first meal, now he faced the problem of drawing the line. Kouji didn't want to die of starvation, but he didn't want to trust Beliamon either. Besides, he was starting to put on a little bit too much weight for his own comfort recently. Perhaps he would eat just the crusts and crumbs- the bare bones, what he needed, and just enough to survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji decided not to pry any deeper into his thoughts. Sleep was starting to return to him; he just needed to give it a rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji shuddered at his own pun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a feeling he wouldn't wake up until morning (which would hopefully be a little warmer), maybe he'd sleep in some... although he had a faint hunch that sleeping in could only be a wistful thought and he'd be woken up again sooner or later by the only other resident of the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Kouji could only enjoy a few more hours of sleep, because about an hour after sunrise, his slumbered was abruptly terminated by...</span></div></div>",

No breakfast for you.\" Beliamon atttempted scolding Kouji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji, showing no inclination as to getting up, waved a hand in the air as if to dismiss her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine with me. If yo've forgotten, I STILL don't trust you. Plus, I'm getting fat anyway. I need to lose some weight, especiialy after how I pigged out last night.\" Kouji stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That was pigging out?' Beliamon thought to herself. 'Then I have more work to do than I originally thought...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of voicing her thought, however, Beliamon simply crossed her arms and decided to taunt Kouji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why worry about your weight now? YOu certainly weren't before I 'abducted' you? It was almost as if you were TRYING to get fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat caught Kouji's attention and, his temper flared, he turned to glare at his captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? Why would I want to become fat?!\" He exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon inwardly smirked as her taunt produced the desired effect and she feigned a look of surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well from what I've heard of the real world, many children are putting on weight-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where would you hear such things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before Ayzahn Ra was destroyed, a powerful clan of fire digimon watched over the Temple of Fire. Their leader was Agumon, and while only at Rookie level, had once held the form of WarGreymon, a Mega level, and had supposedly travelled with a human to the real world long ago. He told me a story once of how many of the children there seemed to be getting larger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story was true. When Beliamon had been but in her In-Training form, she had heard the tale from Agumon, who had travelled with the children known as the Digidestined long ago and was renowned throught Ayzahn Ra for his storytelling skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd believing her story, Kouji's teeth were clenched in frustration and he glared at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose that thats true...the precentage of overweight children in most modern nations has increased the past few years, but Japan's nothing compared to America! And even so, that's no reason for ME to get fat!\" Kouji grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Beliamon only chuckled and conjured a breakfast for her captive while he was destracted and sat down acroos from him on the floor with the food on a tray in her lap, much like the previous night, in hopes he would eat while talking to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she placed the tray of food, a generous helping of bacon and eggs, some french toast, a blueberry muffin, and a tall glass of orange juice,a relatively tiny breakfast, on Kouji's own lap(producing a wide-eyed look from the blue-haired boy), she decided to press the subject more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't see why it would be so awful, your friends were gaining weight as well. Especially the one who holds the Spirits of Fire, what was his name again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did THIS come from?!\" Kouji ignored her question and pointed at the delectible breakfast on his lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was here all along, you just didn't notice. Now eat and answer the question.\" Beliamon lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?...Oh! You mean Takuya.\" At the memory of his friend, Kouji laughed, absentmindedly taking a bite of the blueberry muffin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's his name. Well, he was putting on weight as well, about at your pace, and he seemed rather content.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that Kouji chuckled, now chewing on a strip of bacon as beliamon watched him carefully, excited at how her plan was working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You obviously don't know Takuya. From what he's told me, he plays soccer back in the Real World, he's a really active guy...but then again he's also got a really active apetite. I also hear that his mom is like, afraid of fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how could he possibly gain weight while travelling all over the Digital World, locked in a battle with the Dark Lord Cherubimon?\" Beliamon asked a bit dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji blushed a bit at this,stopping mid-chew on a piece of frecnh toast, as beliamon waited for him to say what she already knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...um, you see these past few weeks, there really hasn't been anything for us to be active about. We just made camp in this grove of meat apples until we got any leads on Cherubimon. So we were there, in a grove of very delicious meat apples and I guess we just started to chow down...\" Kouji mumbled, putting a hand to his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortuantely, as a result we also started packing on the pounds..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that several things happened. Kouji, reminded about his recent weight increase, had realized he had been eating ANOTHER meal from his captor, a quite fattening one at that, and it was at this time Belimaon cackled, picking up the almost finished breakfast from Kouji's lap, satisfied with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecovering, Kouji glared at the dark digimon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you tricked me!\" He exclaimed, pointing a finger at Beliamon, now towering over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, she once again feigned surprise and put her free hand on her hip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! You caught me! They call you Sherlock where you come from?\" She taunted with a sarcastic remark as she sat the tray on one of the table-like rock formations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji's response was a glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you TRYING to make me fat?\" He asked her with venom dripping from his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon chuckled to herself. If only Kouji knew how right he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, she sat back down across from the pony-tailed boy and gave him a sympathetic look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want you to eat. You have to eat something to survive. You really should stop worrying about getting fat. And even if you were to add a few pounds here and there would it be so terrible? What's so bad about being fat?\" Beliamon questioned her prisoner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment or two, fire danced within Kouji's eyes as he continued to glare at her, but he surprised her when a sad look came over his features and he glanced down at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kouji?\" She ventured, wondering why the sudden change in his behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmeadiately, the fire was back in his eyes and Kouji's fists clenched as he glared at Beliamon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its nothing. I just want to get out of this stupid cave or temple or whatever, get back to my friends, and, most of all, GET AWAY FROM YOU.\" He shouted harshly, causing Beliamon to wince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hurt look in her eyes, Beliamon said nothing as she rose regally, took the tray with the remains of Kouji's breakfast, and left down a corridor, without even a backaward glance at the miffed Holder of Light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji glared at her retreating form. Past his emotions, he knew he shoudn't have shouted at the human looking digimon. He knew she was a lonely soul, much like himself, but she had captured him, taunted him about his recent weight gain, tricked him into eating far larger servings than he would normally eat of quite fattening foods, probably making him gain MORE weight, and had almost caused some painful memories to resurface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to calm himself, Kouji decided to glare at a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was able to do so for about a few minutes before being driven out of his mind with boredom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What does she expect me to do for the other 23 hours left in the day?' Kouji sarcastically thought, rolling his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to pass the time, he tried to think of his friends. He wondered what they were doing now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji smiled at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could imagine them all. Tommy in his large hat, chasing after bugs in a field. JP professing his love for Zoe. ZOe knocking JP out. Takuya taking a large bite out of a meat apple and rubbing his stomach, smiling cheekily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji's smile fell, replaced with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of Takuya rubbing his stomach reminded Kouji of his weight problem, his hand moving to his now full stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe supposed that it woudn't be ALL bad if he was fat....he just didn't want to be the odd one out in the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, JP was fat, but JP was jolly and funny and had his jokes. Kouji's personality wasn't suited to be fat. It wouldn't be so bad if the whole group were fat, though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji blinked realizing what he had just thought. He woudn't wish obesity on his friends! Kouji shook his head as if to clear it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Kouji decided to try to go back to sleep as he lied down back onto his bed. He would just have to eat less, and watch out for Beliamon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji then closed his eyes and cleared his mind of thoughts, trying to pass the long day. It was when he was almost asllep that a sound surprised him, causing him to sit up...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A piercing scream echoed throughout the hollow halls and still air of the Temple of Earth. Kouji's back bolted upright out of his straw bed and he gasped, a chilling sensation of fear and sudden awareness taking hold of his body. His eyes snapped open, and he took in the daylight of the afternoon. The dark waters of great apprehension began to flood his mind, and this showed in his eyes as he hastily rose to his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had just woke up, and his throat and mouth were dry and it was as if they were coated with some thick sort of batter. Strangely, even though he had only been sleeping on straw on the floor, his back didn't feel cramped up in any way. In fact, it felt relaxed, as if he had been resting on the softest of mattresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the wrenching sound reached his ears and reverberated over and over again, softer and softer down the halls, Kouji felt the urge from deep down inside of him to hurry up. With each passing repercussion of a past cry, cold drops of sweat silently crept down his body as made a tight knot in his stomach as it pained him a little. Kouji's hair must have started to stand on end just a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji fearfully knew that it could only be Beliamon, the one other person... the only other in the Temple... or was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind still churning from waking up, Kouji didn't stop to contemplate the issue any more. He was on his feet and Kouji was pacing rapidly down the dark brown-tinged alleys, and Kouji secretly hoped he was heading down the direction where the cry had originated from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon had just screamed, and Kouji knew it wasn't merely one made out of frustration from his behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe echoes had faded so much now that Kouji could barely hear them, and now the only thing Kouji could hear was his own heavy breaths and footsteps. He was sprinting down the hallway now, as fast as he could muster, fatigue already beginning to take its toll on his body. He could even feel his small paunch bobble up and down in turn with his lunging strides. Hot beads of sweat from excercise started to join the cold ones formed by fear. It was getting terribly dark down in the cave halls, and Kouji hoped and prayed desperately that he hadn't become lost in the tangling web of halls throughout the Temple of Earth. He had only made a few turns, and he had at one point a hopeful feeling that he would find Beliamon's location...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere ever she was... Kouji felt his fists tighten as he turned around and started to run faster down the tunnel, searching new pathways frantically with a dire newfound vigor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she in danger? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would he do if she was? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas he too late? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Then what would happen to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking a sharp turn into a large yet unforseen hallway and making an entrance into a large chamber, Kouji gasped for the second time that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt tension build up in his body. His face felt warm and flushed. Kouji couldn't help it at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beliamon!\" he called out, his voice echoing through the caves just as the scream had as he continued to search the caves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kouji!\" Neemon called out into the thick overgrowth of field and trees that surrounded the meat apple grove. The sounds of wings flapping and twigs breaking filled the air as few birdlike Digimon frantically burst out of the nests and trees in which they had been sleeping in response to Neemon's screeching calls. Once the birds had took to the air, a still silence distilled itself again over the thick brush of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, give it a rest, already,\" Bokumon scolded, grabbing his red suspender clad companion and dragging him back to the grove where the others had formed a circle around a former campfire ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a full, fruitless, futile day of searching in the surrounding grounds and calling out for Kouji, the children were both exhausted and feeling a bit disheartened in their attempts. Tommy had almost ended up getting lost himself in the woods while looking for Kouji by himself the other day. Kouji hadn't responded to any of the messages they had sent to him via digivice, which was strange because Kouji was generally good about making detailed replies to any messages sent to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where could he have gone off to?\" Takuya scowled, kicking at an ashen log from last night's fire, \"I mean, it's not like him just to run off like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't have said that a few months ago,\" Zoe responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Takuya looked astonished as he blinked slowly with his mouth hanging open widely, \"No, I wouldn't!\" he protested almost automatically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you would,\" Zoe insisted, crossing her arms, \"Kouji used to always leave us and journey on his own for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you bring it up...\" JP nodded, \"That does seem like something Kouji might have done a while ago... but back then, we didn't really know him that well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he got tired of just sitting around doing nothing,\" Tommy suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing but eating,\" Takuya smirked, standing up with a sly face, rubbing his chin, \"I think that's pretty smart of him, then. I bet he though if he went on a really long hike, he'd drop all the pounds he put on, so when he comes back, he'll be the slim, healthy one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Takuya, it would all do us well to lose a few pounds,\" Zoe added before allowing herself to fall back onto the ground, relaxing on the wide spread of green grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy sighed, hanging his head low, \"I hope he comes back soon. I hope nothing bad's happened to him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't he be back by now even if he was on a hike?\" JP asked, \"I mean, how long can it possibly take?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it possible he might have recieved a message from Ophanimon on his digivice on the night he disappeared and has to go somewhere,\" Zoe proposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he just runs off without telling us?\" JP questioned, \"That sounds pretty irresponsible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it was a secret message, or a mission that only Kouji can know about,\" Zoe shrugged as she looked up at the clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if he got hurt in the woods?\" Tommy sighed curtly, \"What if he needs help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we searched the woods all over yesterday. It's not a very big area, and if he was stuck, wouldn't he have called back when we called his name?\" Takuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and even if our buddy, Kouji, was in trouble outside the forest, he'd still be able to let us know by sending us a message with his digivice,\" JP added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So maybe he just wants to be left alone for a while... and knowing Kouji, that doesn't seem odd at all,\" Takuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we can't just lounge about like this forever,\" Tommy cried, \"Especially with Kouji gone. Maybe he...\" Tommy sniveled slightly, \"Maybe he needs our help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we should stay here for one more night at least so he knows where to find us,\" Zoe nodded, \"But Tommy's right. Maybe Kouji was kidnapped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's the case, then we're really in trouble,\" JP said cautiously, a small glint of fright in his eyes, \"And again, if that's the case, I think I know who may be behind it all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cherubimon,\" Takuya stated, spitting out the name like venom, \"Alright, so we'll stay here one more night and continue to send him messages on our digivices. If he doesn't return by then... well, then we've got a problem on our hands... We have to leave the meat apple grove soon, though. Too much time's gone by,\" he smiled, patting his slightly larger gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where will we start to look if he doesn't show up?\" Zoe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we should start to look for clues and ask around... maybe we'll have to split up to cover more area- into teams, of course. We don't all want to get lost,\" Takuya said, \"But in the meantime... I think a little more lunch isn't going to hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others sighed and rolled their eyes. Takuya would never know how much good leaving the meat apple grove would do to his figure. It was just too tempting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold still,\" Kouji instructed warily, his voice shaky and nervous as cold sweat dripped down his back. In his hands, he held a white, porcelein vase filled with cool water he had found in a basin and a damp cloth bandage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am...\" an irritated Beliamon who was in pain grumbled, sighing through clenched teeth, \"You should really steady your own hand if you must insist on-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I can do this...\" Kouji sighed, attempting to examine the damage on her upper arm. Quickly, Beliamon draped a fold of the black dress she was wearing over the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe digimon who was holding Kouji captive started to blush, \"I would prefer it if I treated myself,\" she said stiffly, discomfort very apparent in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji humphed and crossed his arms while giving Beliamon an icy glare. Even though he probably despised her above all else, Kouji still felt compelled and wanting to help his injured captor. From what he gathered, Beliamon had been cooking dinner and something ended up burning her upper arm, what exactly, she declined to say. Kouji guessed scalding water could have burst out and landed on her arm, or maybe she had slipped and her arm briefly touched upon a hot cooking surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't just leave her like that... Kouji noted that now Beliamon's eyes were closed tight and she seemed to be in a lot of pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remembered the long summer he had spent at summer camp a year ago. Every day, from dawn to dusk, he would go to a different activity or class with a break in between... and every bright morning was spent in  a sterile room with an instructor wearing thick glasses. Every morning he had first aid class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could understand why Beliamon was resisting his help and attention... if she was his captor, why would she ever submit herself over to her prisoner's care?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beliamon... if you can trust me, I can fix up your burn,\" Kouji explained, struggling for words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe golden haired looked cautiously at Kouji, her eyes wavering for a moment before she proceeded in removing her sleeve for Kouji. Kouji returned her action with a nod of gratitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon closely examining her arm, Kouji saw that it was red and blistered instead of the smooth, pale skin like on her other arm. He identified it as being a second degree burn. Carefully, he poured the vase of cold water down the burn area. He didn't immediately see any sinks where he could run cold water over her burn, so he quickly decided that it would have to suffice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments, Kouji had Beliamon's arm bandaged up, \"That should be good for about a day-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't worry about it,\" Beliamon smiled, leaving her bandage arm free, \"I heal quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uhm you should try to drink a little...\" Kouji advised quietly, \"So you won't be dehydr...\" Kouji stopped and started to turn away. He never really was somebody who reached out to be helpful, but when he sensed someone was in trouble... or if cared for someone, he always tried his hardest to make sure they made it out alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Kouji's eyes met Beliamon's. He noticed that they seemed different, somehow... maybe just a glint brighter than before, although he could still detect that she was making an active attempt to conceal the pain from her face, \"...Thank you...\" she smiled, her voice soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Kouji mumbled, not sure of what to say, knowing that his face was flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although, do you have to be so melodramatic with your entrances?\" Beliamon chuckled to herself as Kouji's light blush deepened even further.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Beliamon chuckled openly as Kouji tore into the chicken heaped on to plate, the blue haired boy looking up, his cheeks turning crimson, and rsumed at a more slow and neat pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Kouji had helped Beliamon with her arm, the human-like digimon had practically pushed her captive into the kitchen, saying that if he was so sorry that she had gotten hurt, that he should eat all of his dinner: Some fried chicken, mashed potatoes with gravy, and a few rolls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the spat she had had with Kouji earlier, Beliamon had been afraid to push to much food on him, so she had made dinner smaller, and with fairly small portions, but she had been surprised when Kouji had tore into the food like there was no tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching as Kouji spooned some of the mashed potatoes in her mouth, Beliamon smirked, leaning her head on an elbow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here I thought you didn't trust me.\" She remarked, to which Kouji shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is the third meal you've given me. I figured if you're going to poison me, you'd have done it already.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what about gaining weight?\" Beliamon asked, her eyes widening. She then mentally slapped herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji's increasing weight, she had discovered, was NOT a good topic to discuss with the bandanna-wearing boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as she suspected,  Kouji immediately stopped eating and his gaze lowered a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I really don't have a choice.\" Kouji said after a moment, making Beliamon's eyes go wide with shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave him a questioning look, to which he shrugged and resumed eating, though at a slower pace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think I'm not going to try my hardest not to, though. I'm still not going to eat ALL of the food you give me, but even with small portions, I'm barely getting any physical activity, if you don't count the little sprint I did earlier when I was \"coming to your rescue\". I guess the guys will just have to get used to it, when I rejoin them at 300 pounds.\" Kouji explained, ending with a dark chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Beliamon had paled slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The others...' She thought bleakly, and gulped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCherubimon had wanted her to fatten up ALL of the children oppsing him, and even though she and Kouji had talked about his companions a bit, she had completely forgotten that she had to work on them as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me a moment, Kouji.\" Beliamon said curtly, earning a curious clance from her prisoner, but was too caught up in his own self-pity at the moment to suspect anything, and resumed eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon then quickly stepped from the kitchen and dining hall area of the Earth Temple to a corridor, making sure she coudn't be seen or heard by Kouji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she concentrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, a ball of violet energy appeared in one of her outstretched hands and slowly began to widen, the center of the sphere becoming clearer and clearer until a picture materialized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick look at the picture, and Beliamon's fears were realized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image of the campsite in her palm was a very different one from the campsite she had abducted Kouji from just a day and some odd time ago; everything was packed up and the children were gathered around a campfire, each holding his or her digivice and glancing at it from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appeared that they were soon to go searching for their misssing friend. If they were left unnatended and wandered the Digital World, they were sure to lose weight. And that would put Beliamon in a pot of hot water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gears in her mind quickly turning, Beliamon forced the energy in her palm to condense, the image of the campsite fading, and opened the energy again, ezcept this time, instead of an image, she pulled forth Kouji's digivice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelaimon smirked as she tried to activate the messaging function of the device, probably the only one she could use, before finally finding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had hidden Kouji's digivice where he would have never suspected or been able to look for it: Inside herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing her thoughts aside, Beliamon then typed up a quick message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          Guys<br>\r\n               Needed some time alone.  Should be back in a few days. Don\u2019t go anywhere. <br>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<br>\r\n\t\t\t<br>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKouji<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosely examining the message a time or two, Beliamon then pressed what she suspected was the send button and made the digivice disappear. She still had a grim look on her face, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a gamble on her part. On one side, the kids buy her little message and stay in the meat apple grove for a few more days, prolonging and adding to their weight gain, or they realize that the message was a fake, as she didn\u2019t know Kouji\u2019s writing style, track the message and leave the meat apple grove, and try to rescue their abducted companion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon hoped and prayed that the second option didn\u2019t play out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalming herself down a bit more, Beliamon then re-entered the kitchen to see that Kouji had finished dinner, or finished about half of it, and Kouji was still moping from the last part if their previous conversation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did you go off to?\u201d Kouji asked, noticing her, his curiosity back for the moment, at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Beliamon stuttered. \u201cPotty break.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDigimon have to go to the bathroom?\u201d Kouji asked, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. Digimon may be digital, but we\u2019re still alive, and of course, we have to do things just like you humans do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon then busied herself with taking up the remains of Kouji's dinnner and depositing them in a basin to be cleaned with water later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat done, she turned back to Kouji and stared at the youth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....what do you want to do now?\" She asked timidly, rubbing her uninjured arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji stared at his captor a moment or two and a bead of sweat began to form on the back of his head, and his eyebrow began to tick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You captured me and you don't even know what to do with your prisoners EXCEPT feed them?!\" He shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Beliamon huffed and put her arms on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if I were you, I'd be thankful! I don't know anyone else whp cooks their prisoners meals and doesn't even lock them up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMassagin his temples, Kouji sighed and tried to control his temper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....what IS there to do around here?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon opened her mouth to reply, but paused and placed a finger on her chin in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...well...there's sleeping...and eating...and, um talking?\" Beliamon ventured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, I really want to spend my day getting fat and talking to an evil digimon.\" The blue haired boy sarcastically remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, excuse you, but I am not an evil digimon. What gave you the idea that I was?\" Beliamon questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji gave her a flat look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kidnappped me, dresses in complete black, specializes in dark magic, need I say more?\" Kouji counted off all of the reason on his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For your information, digimon can't really help what they look like. This dress is a part of me. I was ORDERED to kidnap you, or one of your friends, you just got lucky, and Darkness and Evil are two seperate things. Most evil types just tend to specialize in darkness.\" Beliamon countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you said that you just had to kidnap one of the group?\" Kouji questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon nodded. 'Well, close enough anyway.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji slumped and held his face in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it just HAD to be me. Why not Takuya? Or JP?\" Kouji cried, calling out to the fates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon giggled and winked at her prisoner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you just have good luck like that!\" She remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And you were one of the most powerful children, as well as the one who needed my ckills the most. The other strong one, Takuya, he can fatten himself up easily if under the right circumstances.' Beliamon added as an afterthought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji glared at his captora moment or two, before getting up from the table and exiting the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going, my prescious?\" Beliamon prodded the boy as he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somewhere to get away from you...\" Kouji muttered, though Beliamon could tell that the bluenette was only a little bit miffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon sighed heavily and got up from the table as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could get lost. You don't know your way around!\" Beliamon called to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll manage.\" Was her reply, and Beliamon excused herself from the kitchen as well, muttering about Kouji and his attitude problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she left, however, she cast a quick glance towards various supplies, packed in simple boxes, that were around the room and gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were running low. Soon, Beliamon would have to visit the supply bunker, a keep of non-parishable supplies kept in an underground room after the...attack on Ayzahn Ra had begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon bit her lip as she hurried to catch up with Kouji. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat meant, soon, she would have to return to the city again...all of the destuction and death...and all her fault.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kouji settled down onto his straw bed. He tried to relax by stretching his back out and lacing his hands together behind his head. The gaze of his deep blue eyes ascended up towards the skylight carved into the cave ceiling. The atmosphere was a thick, dense, dark blue of late afternoon. Cloudy or not, it was still a time when the day began to cool off and shades stretched down over the streets; it was a time where Kouji found always found solace being by himself outside on a walk, or even napping underneath a tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy in blue sighed with relief as his body began to feel at ease. Kouji turned around in his bed, facing a smooth, brown tinged cave wall, wondering how extensive the tunnels ran through the Temple of Earth. When he had went off to find Beliamon, seemingly hours ago, he had noticed that the Temple encompassed much more area than he could have ever thought. Especially when returning from his dinner, Kouji really noticed how easy it was to get lost in the winding tunnels. He had almost gotten lost a few times while finding his way back, and Kouji had to take one or two more detours than he was comfortable with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter roughly an hour of moving around in the tunnels, which Kouji observed were lined every now and again with torches, especially towards intersections, he had luckily managed to find an area which was familiar from his first venture, and from there, he remembered the way back. The dark blue haired boy hoped he would try to remember his way and make an effort not to get lost so easily again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji's stomach felt warm and almost full, as his appetite was still wanting more before it would be truly satisfied. For a scant minute, thoughts of the hot, creamy, buttery mashed potatoes and crispy chicken invaded his thoughts. Kouji bitterly knew that he perfectly well had it in him to finish off the entire dish, and the pickled memories that floated around in his mind about the half finished meal still in his grasp didn't help. He should have been able to put the food down well before that point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji crossed his arms and humphed at himself, blowing a stray lock of his hair up into the air with a heavy sigh....He really wasn't getting any thinner...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust by looking down at himself, Kouji could see that while his weight hadn't noticably increased since he first entered the Temple, his weight hadn't decreased at all either. A bulge was beginning to protrude and become very apparent from under his yellow shirt. Even his arms were beginning to show a little pudge on them; although this was obscured by his jacket most of the time, he had decided to remove his jacket while resting, as it was still relatively warm in the cave. Now Kouji was beginning to regret that decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, Kouji tried to curl up and get a little sleep, or, at least, descend down in his thoughts for a little bit of deep brooding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking an extra level of caution not to disturb her bandaged arm, Beliamon scrubbed away at a stray dish as vigorously as she could with a soapy sponge dowsed with hot water. After she had washed away all debris off the plate, she dried the plate, and then placed in on top of a few others she had finished... a small stack in comparison to the grim, towering, mountain of dirty dishes that dwarfed the minute progress she had already made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon had already considered magicking the dishes to clean themselves, but with the current negative conditions, that possibility would take a lot out of her, maybe even considerably more than it would by just doing the chore by herself. She didn't want to take any chances, so Beliamon elected to do it as anyone else would. Still, it was a pain for her to do all by herself. She hadn't cleaned dishes in quite a while without magic... and still, back then, she was accustomed to working with others as a team to get the job done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDismissing her thoughts quickly before she could reminisce, Beliamon looked dismally towards the dishes she had left to do, and exhaled deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... what IS there to do?\" a cloudy memory of Kouji asked her over, and over, and over again... Why, oh, why didn't she make him help her with the dishes? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji was supposed to be her prisoner! The least she could do was ask him to do the dishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought occured to the golden haired digimon long since Kouji left, around the time when she had started her long, arduous chore; since the time the boy in blue had left, Beliamon had been having some deep thoughts about the coming days and the dwindling supplies. It was only when she realized the time and the dismal dishwashing job ahead of her, that she snapped out of it and began to work. Beliamon had then decided the perfect response if Kouji asked her what he was supposed to do as a prisoner again: she'd definitely make him do the dishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she began to imagine scenarios where she'd magick forth a mountain of extremely filthy dishes for poor Kouji to scrub away at while she laughed deviously with glee in the background at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon catching herself cackling a little at the thought, Beliamon paused. Would scrubbing dishes be too much excercise for him? Especially considering he didn't even finish his meals...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell... maybe she'd help him a little with the dishes so that wouldn't happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs with most things, keeping a prisoner was, indeed, more challenging and difficult than intially imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bright, green, spring day. Birds sang the same song patterns as they did every year, and the blue skies were clear, albeit for a stray, white, puffy cloud here and there. The sun shone down on a soccer field, wet with dew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA medium-sized class of young, white and blue uniformed students where out on the field, playing a game of soccer like small children would, that is, a good part of the game was spent giggling, tripping, and forgetting how to play the game. A slightly muscular gym teacher watched his entire class out on the field, ableit for one boy, who sat under a sturdy oak tree, stray from the rest of his class, reading a comic book and munching down on a chocolate bar every now and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you don't want to join your friends, Kouji?\" the gym teacher called over to his first grade student, who responded by looking back at him from under the tree and nodding his little head before returning to his comic book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat Kouji was a real puzzler, thought the gym teacher, he was a very slim boy and he seemed healthy enough... but why didn't he want to play out on the field? He'd made several attempts to get Kouji introduced to the class, but he seemed detached from the activity for some reason, much unlike the rest of the enthusiatic group, and simply uninterested in sports. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well, shrugged the gym teacher, there've been kids just like him before, it's probably just a phase; give him a while, and he'll shake out of it, he'll be playing out on the fields in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I'm getting a message from Kouji!\" Takuya cried, making everyone else's heads spin around to face his. In the immediate moment, the rest of the group began to move in towards the goggle head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh! Whatsisay? Whatsitsay?\" Neemon cried frantically while attempting to leap on Takuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says you'd better move over so I can see!\" Bokomon snapped wisely, nudging his yellow companion aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeemon's face took on a confused light, \"Really?\" he inquired, pushing Bokomon the other way from behind Takuya's back. Before long, the two Digimon had started to brawl behind Takuya while the others gathered around his digivice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya accepted the incoming message. Once it displayed on screen, he was a little suprised by the length, but he proceeded in reading it out loud, which everyone obliged to do in perfectly synchronized fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeemon blinked as he finished reading the message he had once held with indirect anticipation, \"That sure was short.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it wasn't long,\" Bokomon responded, crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe nodded, a concerned look on her face, \"That's what I'm worried the most about. I'm glad Kouji got our messages and was able to send us a reply, but...\" she faltered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kouji really isn't... well, frank, when he writes,\" JP stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe he's really upset about something,\" Takuya boldly suggested, while Zoe returned him with a bleak look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Takuya,\" Zoe mentioned sarcastically, \"We already figured that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he certainly wouldn't just run off if he was perfectly happy with everything,\" JP said with slight, hopeful cheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least we know he's coming back in a few days,\" Tommy safely said, winning nods of approval from everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in that case, we'd better unpack and get ready for a few more days of camp,\" spoke Takuya, \"So why don't we start on-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say it,\" Zoe and JP popped up and warned in unison with unimpressed voices. Was food really the only thing Takuya could think about in a place like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gym teacher sighed as she looked under the same old, elm tree as ever before. She had tried countless times, and still tried every day, to get Kouji involved in the game with other children since he had first moved to town at the beginning of the year, but even as whole months came and went, the boy was very adamant towards the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out towards the field, the teacher noted what Kouji was missing. As the children got older, their manner of play developed as well. Less time was spent being silly on the field, joking and giggling. Now, a majority of the time and students were being quite serious about the game; maybe too much because frequently they were bickering and arguing about the score, and who did what, and what counted as an accident and what didn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gym teacher suspected that Kouji still hadn't made a single friend since he moved. Kouji seemed very introverted and collected, always spending most of his time in P.E. under the same tree, reading a comic book and eating either chips, candy bars, or some other incarnation of junk food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only Kouji would just make the move to start playing with the other children... She knew well enough that Kouji got teased and made fun of not just because he was a new kid, and not only because he was a quite chubby boy, but mainly because he declined to participate with the rest of the third graders. Maybe because of this, he seemed aloof to them, and this brought about the teasing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Kouji... she had to feel bad for him, even though he turned down all her advice to play. The gym teacher had been informed that Kouji moved a lot, almost more than once a year. She figured that at one point in his life, Kouji felt a little afraid to go play and make new friends because of the teasing and strange looks he recieved from being a new kid, and, after several moves, it just became a habit not to even try. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was really taking a negative toll on his mind and body, the gym teacher noticed. She looked over to the elm tree and saw the tubby Kouji reading and eating some kind of chocolate caramel bar. He had a soft face and his round belly protruded and stuck outwards, making a visible bulge in his shirt. Even his little limbs seemed somewhat flabby. Eating all that candy isn't going to help, thought the gym teacher, but she noticed something else about Kouji, aside from his weight: his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Kouji may have gotten a little chubbier over the course of the third grade, but the biggest change she was noticing was also an effect of Kouji's lack of friends. At the beginning of the year, Kouji was generally happy, like most third graders, and the gym teacher actually expected that he would reach out and make friends like every other new student after the first few weeks. Although, as the year dragged on, Kouji began to lose more and more hope day by day as teasing got worse, and the gym teacher herself had to intervene at times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji never really was a problem, aside from the fact that he declined to play- some P.E. instructors would go nuts over that fact, and say that if he wasn't playing, she wasn't honestly doing her job, although she couldn't blame little Kouji after seeing some of the teasing and bullying he had to go through. Kouji was good-natured and quiet, and he never argued with the other students, even when they started teasing him. As the year went on, he started to put up a little resistance and stand up for himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji was beginning to get colder in personality, and the gym teacher hated to see that happen to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really hoped Kouji would get out of his predicament. Each and every day she tried to convince the boy to play, but she had very little luck in doing so. She still had hopes for him, that he would make friends and finally fit in. She hoped that Kouji would never have to move ever again so that these friends would last him, however futile this hope was. Hopefully, this year, he would slim down like many boys did over the summer, and finally find the courage in him to enter the game and start anew. Maybe if he couldn't find a school or a home that would last the move, maybe he could find a love for a sport that would stay with him wherever he went and help him make friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really hoped things would be alright for Kouji in the future...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt suddenly grew much colder in the cave, and Kouji huddled tightly in his bed, his jacket clutched closely to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji had, indeed, begun to slim down that year when he hit a growth spurt. Luckily, he didn't gain any his puppy fat back. Suddenly, everything seemed so much easier to Kouji from there on in... well, at least for the physical fitness part. He was able to run and swim with times that were actually above average- not that he actively pursued those sports outside of school. Kouji still shyed away and found it very difficult to talk to others until he came to the digital world, where he was able to loosen up a little after sharing experiences and just being in the general vicinity of others trapped in a strange world just like him for quite a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe might have even said that aside from the perils, dangers, risks, and conflicts of saving the digital world from certain doom, he was actually doing pretty well with Takuya and the gang. Aside from the occasional moodiness, deep down, he actually felt content, and well, wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe really had friends... although he'd never directly admit it to anyone right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji sighed heavily once more as he looked down on himself, and maybe admitted to moaning a little with melancholy before descending into the soft bed of unconciousness.</span></div></div>",

This is Cherubimon. What is your progress on the task?\" He asked to the orb, but got no answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Beliamon? Beliamon! Answer me!\" Cherubimon growled as he glared at the orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Beliamon's image appeared within the orb, looking quite frantic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you really caught me at a bad time.\" she complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough. Why have you not reported on your progress?\" Cherubimon demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Beliamon stumbled, \"I've been quite busy. I've devised a plan that could yield wonderful results, but even a tiny error will shatter all the progress I've made so far.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A plan? Please enlighten me. How has it affected the children to this point?\" Cherubimon asked curously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh...child.\" Beliamon said quietly, clsoing her eyes in preparation for the outbust that was sure to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CHILD? You mean you've only been fattening ONE child?! When you could have been disabling ALL of them?!\" Cherubimon roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, my lord, allow me to explain. With the absence on one child, the group becomes frantic over the loss of that one. I however sent a message to them via Digivice impersonating my prisoner, the Warrior of Light, and telling them not to worry.\" Beliamon paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Continue.\" Cherubimon gave premission for Beliamon to further explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, in their current position, a grove of meat apples, they've fattened themselves up quite nicely. The message I sent them should stall them for a few more days. Once I finsih with the Warrior of Light, i can begina on another, but I'll need your help, or rather, the help of your Dark Warriors.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what should you need them do?\" Cherubimon questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have Arbormon and Grumble create and impassable barrier of stone and trees around the grove, ro even better, have them drain the data of the land surrounding it. Whatever you have them do, it is imperative that they not leave that grove. If they did, my plan would fall to peices and they'd have contact with Ophanimon again. To keep this from happening, have Mercurymon and Ranamon spy on them, but under no circumstances engage them in battle.\" Beliamon finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Cherubimon ran Beliamon's plan through his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was sound, had no visible flaws, and if everything went according, should yield better resluts than those orignally hoped for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. But Beliamon- do not try my patience like this in the future again. Failing to report in again in the future may just reslut in your destruction.\" Cherubimon warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my lord, I understand.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, exactly WHERE are you. Your energy siganture is coming from a void in the Digital World.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiamon's face twitched a moment and she wass silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A small island with a cave that was missed when the region's data was drained.\" she said monoutanously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn' a lie, but it wasn't true either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, strange that it was missed, but I suppose it can happen. You very well can't hold a prisoner in the middle of an empty space.\" Cherubimon reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my lord.\" Beliamon agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now to matters of the warrior of light. How has his progress been?\" CHerubimon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Subject was taken in already a few pounds overweight. Since then, his weight has not decreased, but only increased a tiny amount. Subject is very...touchy about his increasing girt, and at first has shown little interest in food, and has even made attempts to exercise. However, more recentyl, subject has shown a greater apetite, if only a little, and appears to be subissive to his fate. Subject has also begun to show small signs of trust to myself.\" Beliamon droned on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, it appears that you have been doing a good job after all Beliamon. It surprises me he would actually trust his captor. I cannot wait until he sees that you've been working for me the whole time. The utter betrayal of it all!\" Cherubimon shouted and laughed loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon's neutral face shifted for a moment, and her eyes shined a bit, but she quickly put on her stony expression again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...he is a fool.\" Beliamon muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCherubimon nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, then. I've heard all that I've need to know for now, but remember to keep me informed in the future.\" Cherubimon ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon nodded, and her image disappeared within the orb of black power and CHerubimon then let the darkness in his palm disssipate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then stared down at his Dark Warriors expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stared back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCherubimon gwoled in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you have jobs you should be doing? If I recall, you have some data darining and espionage to do!\" Cherubimon barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercurymon, Ranamon, Grumblemon, and Arbormon all mumbled a \"Yes, my lord.\" and were off, leaving Duskmon alone with his master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...I was not assigned a task...\" the warrior of Darkness mumbled, almost sounding dejected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its just as well Duskmon, for you see, I have a mission for you myself. Call it...insurance. As the Warrior of Darkness, you are quite skilled in espionage yourself and I want you to keep an eye on Beliamon....she seems odd.\" Cherubimon ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my lord.\" Duskmon said and bowed, vanishing in the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beliamon...\" CHerubimon though aloud, now alone in his chambers, \"For your sake, you had better not betrayed me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kouji had uttered a deep and languished sigh when he first opened his dark blue eyes that morning. He didn't seem to find himself surrounded not by the clean, white walls of his bedroom, nor looking up to clear skies with a campfire from the night before long since extinguished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, he was still enclosed by the same, old, rock walls of the cave... Sitting up on his straw bed against the earthen wall, wrapping his arms around his legs, Kouji collected that it really was a wistful feeling one gets when waking up after sleeping away from one's home...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy did he, even in a twilight half-concious state, honestly assume he was away in the security of his room or resting under the stars with his friends when both of those couldn't be any farther away from him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, all in an instant, his eyes snapped opened, reality returned, and it all vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments soon settled and distilled into slow, quiet, unmeasurable minutes as Kouji remained seated in the same position. The scarce, pale sunlight from the above skylight beamed down faintly on the boy clad in blue, his eyes glinting as he looked up, and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I didn't know you were up,\" remarked a now familiar voice. Kouji spun his head around quickly to see the golden haired Beliamon leaning a pale arm against a smooth surface near the cave entry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing his arms, the dark haired boy merely looked at her, nodded curtly, adknowledging her presence, and tried to remained silent as long as he could before mumbling softly, \"...What do you want now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis captor's face twitched for less than a moment before she muttered sarcastically in return, \"Well, it's nice to see your smiling face this morning, too, Kouji,\" as she entered the cavern, slightly shaking her head at the ponytailed boy's warm greeting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I fixed you some breakfast,\" Beliamon stated as took a tray with a plate stacked full of steaming, golden pancakes, napkin roll of utensils, and crispy bacon and a small pitcher of maple syrup and placed the two in front of Kouji's straw bed, \"And I strongly suggest you actually eat up this time- you might actually need the energy today,\" Beliamon recommended as she leaned back onto the cave wall opposite him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji huffed and peered up at Beliamon, tenatively making a grab for the napkin roll in front of him before freezing, \"Hold on... what's so special about today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Beliamon started, letting the word hang in the air for a while, rolling her eyes, \"You might say we're going on a little excursion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Kouji sighed blandly, pretending not to be interested in the least, much contrary to his true thoughts of question and anticipation. Where did she plan on taking him? Out of the caves? To another location? Why? Because his friends had almost found their location? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe now shrugged, undid the roll, poured some syrup on the pancakes, took out his knife and fork out, and put the first, fluffy, sweet mouthful of pancake into his mouth. He closed his eyes, if only for a moment, they were so good. But, again, quickly, as he snapped open his eyes, reality came back to him, and letting Beliamon know he was actually enjoying her cooking was the last thing he wanted to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, so, as soon as you're finished, I think it will be a good time to set off, that is, given I go and gather a few things,\" said Beliamon, to which Kouji only nodded in mild approval as he stuffed half of a syrup-smothered pancake into his mouth. Beliamon smiled slightly at the dark haired boy, although she was hoping that her little smirk wouldn't cause him to grow suspicious and lose his appetite altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the two of them could have sworn they heard a moderately loud, crisp, cracking noise in the far crevices of the cave, echoing and reverberating all the way up the passage to their ears before it faded softly and altogether into the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon grew silent and paled a little, and luckily for her, Kouji didn't notice her expression because he was too busy worrying about her noticing him enjoying breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What wath that?\" Kouji mumbled with his mouth full, blushing a little when he noticed his muffled voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure... hopefully it wasn't a cave in,\" Beliamon sighed, but she knew well that the elder mages had long since cast reenforcement spells and enchantments on the rock walls of the Temple of Earth so that it would stand strong throughout the ages, so that no such transient thing would happen to it, among all other stone constructs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it was a mouse or a bat or something,\" Kouji shrugged, now staring down at a trail of syrup and a what once was a tower of pancakes. All that was left was some strips of bacon, which he helped himself to without much question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin not even a minute, the bacon had been polished off, and Kouji placed the plate on the stone ground without so much as a clatter, \"Done,\" he stated, getting up and stretching his arms out fully. He felt his small paunch peek out from under his yellow shirt and jiggle slightly as a result of this, but he quickly tucked it away before anyone could notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then,\" Beliamon said after carefully giving a quick look down the surrounding hallways, \"Shall we start?\" she asked with a tilt of her head, indicating a nearby tunnel to the left hand side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod of his head, Kouji obliged to follow Beliamon's lead as they proceeded to walk the passages strange and unknown to him, awaiting what destination she may lead him to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Beliamon and Kouji had been walking for quite a while now, they had departed soon after Beliamon had gathered some supplies, now in a backpack over her shoulders,  through the cavernous tunnels that made up the Temple of Earth. They had walked so far into the temple, Kouji noticed, that the torches Beliamon had put up on the paths they normally used, like the one to the kitchen, had disappeared and Beliamon had resorted to using a ball of flame balanced in her palm for light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji ran a hand through his hair, realizing it was mildly wet with sweat. Kouji wondered why Beliamon would take him on such a trip with the exercise he was getting, but decided not to speak up lest she conjure a flying carpet or something for him to ride on. At least like this, he might burn a pound or two off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here have some jerky. Keep your energy up.\" Beliamon suddenly said, handing back a few pieces of the dried meat to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she'd turned back around, Kouji stared blankly at her back, eye twitching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOR she could just stuff him on the way there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...where are we going anyway?\" Kouji asked as he tore into one of the pieces of jerky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need supplies. Eventually one of these passages should take us out of the Temple and into what's left of the city outside. We'll stop there for lunch then head back with the supplies and make it back just in time for Dinner.\" Beliamon stated, rounding a sharp turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...I thought you said the only ways out of this place was either the main entrance or that one skylight?\" Kouji asked suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I did say that didn't I? Well it just so happens I myslef had forgotten about this particualr exit until this morning.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how can you be so sure I won't use it to escape?\" Kouji suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Kouji. I don't think you can remember all the twists and turns to get to this exit without getting lost, and even if you could, you havn't been paying attention to the paths we've taken so far. And besides, if you did escape through these tunnels to leave the temple, we're still on an island with no ticket off for you other than myself.\" Beliamonexplained with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. So I guess I really am stuck here until my friends get the picture and come and rescue me, huh? I don't suppose you plan on releasing me soon.\" Kouji muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Beliamon trailed off. \"I don't know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know? What do you mean 'I don't know.'?\" Kouji asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean I don't know exactly when I'll be able to relase you.\" Beliamon said almost neutrally, but that was a hint of sadness in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Kouji didn't catch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You can relase me at any time you want to! I don't understand you at all! You capture me, but sometimes you act like a...a babysitter more than a warden!\" Kouji spat hotly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon turned and gave him a hard stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think I'm doing this by my free will? Did you ever consider I might have been forced?\" Beliamon asked, keeping her anger in check and staring holes into Kouji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pah. You? The way you talk about yourself? You yuself said you could hold your own with some Digimon above Champion level.\" Kouji retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No matter how powerful you think you are, there is ALWAYS someone more powerful than you.\" Beliamon stated, and the way she said it made Kouji feel as if she was talking from past experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Beliamon turned around and briskly resumed her pace, and not wanting to be left in the dark tunnels, Kouji followed, but both stayed silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Beliamon...what is she? She's evil, or at least I think she is....she captured me! Of course she's evil...though she seems almost too...hyperactive sometimes to be evil...ugh.' Kouji thought furiously as he continued to follow Beliamon, his mind at war with itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon, ahead of him, was also quite out of order, but for entirely different reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I know you're here. If you tink I'm so stupid as to not feel you, lurking in the shadows, right behind us, then you're insane. I felt you when you first teleported in...Duskmon. But...for some reason you feel different from the others...' Beliamon though, knowing very well that the Warrior of Darkness had intruded upon the Temple of Earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to make things a lot harder on her. She obviously had to step up on puttting the pounds on Kouji, and she couldn't be as casual unless she found a way to get Duskmon out of her temple soon. She was foolish to forget Duskmon when reporting into CHerubimonlast night. Of course, the bastard would send his little corrupt warripr to spy on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon then subconsciously glanced back behind her, seeing know Duskmon, but she knew he was there. She could feel it. Hopefully, he wouldn't stray from the Temple of Earth into Ayzahn Ra once they got there....at least until sunset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Beliamon glanced down at Kouji, his face set on the ground and his brow knit in deep thought as he followed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe really was getting too much exercise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'll just have to macke sure he eats all of his dinner I suppose...' Beliamon thought idly as she turned back around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the rate Kouji was eating now, Beliamon would almost bet money that those other kids she'd left behind we're fattening up more, although she did notice that Kouji was increasing in size albeit very slowly and almost unnoticeable. However, Beliamon's sharp eye didn't miss how his little paunch could be noticed now even while wearing clothes and how Kouji had taken to adjucting his pants every now and then, taking this as an indicationt that they were just a little too tight for comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'In any case, something has to be done, ow we're BOTH screwed...' Beliamon thought sulkily, putting a hand to her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Beliamon? Is that the exit, over there?\" Kouji then asked, snapping her out of her thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon then noticed she had missed the correct turn off an had been about to lead herself and Kouji into a labryinth of tunnels even she didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Yes, that's it. I had my mind on other things, sorry about that.\" Beliamon apologized and walked over to the tunnel exit and looking out, Kouji following her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Behold, Kouji, the cty of Ayzahn Ra...or what's left anyway.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji stepped up to look out through the portal of stone and his jaw dropped at the sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyzahn Ra was a maginificent city. The buildings were made out of a deep gray stone and the roofs looked to be almost Italian from the way Zoe had described them before and ranged from deep red to yellow, orange, cerulean and emerald, and sparkled amost like gems in the sunlight. Yet almost all of the buildings were ruined or partially collapsed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat held Kouji's attention the longest though was a tower at what must have been the cneter of the city. it was fashioned from the same gray stone, yet the roof was gone, and exposed was a shinign golden bell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wehn Cherubimon attacked, that tower was really the only thing that survived. In fact, the bell still rings sometimes.\" Beliamon said, referring to the belltower and staring at it herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cherubimon...destroyed this city?' Kouji asked, both bewildered and angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. And all of its inhabitants...except for one, to which he dealt a fate worse than deletion.\" Beliamon stated, proceeding to walk down a path towards the remains of the city. \"But enough of that. Hurry up, we don't have much time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji nodded absentmindedly, still in awe of Ayzahn Ra and he and Beliamon then descended into the dead city, more specifically, towards the....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two proceeded down to the faded city. Colorless rubble lay where once solid, gigantic stone walls cast with runes acted as a gateway to the entrance to the Temple, which was now a gaping hole, which the two calmly paced out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Beliamon and Kouji walked down a gray hill that descended to the streets of the city. Strangely, the hill still had some covering of  grass, even though the entire area silently screamed of lifelessness. Strangely, the grass seemed to be devoid of color, and it was mostly gray, maybe with a spot of drab, dull hazel here or there. Even the dirt was a grayish-brown, and the dusty, rocky material covered the hill where the grass did not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji thought he saw Beliamon shudder, but it probably was only a flinch. He certainly had shivers running down his spine, even though he had never been to the place before, and the city didn't really have a place in his heart, although he tried to conceal these strange sentiments from anyone else, namely, Beliamon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld, bare, dried out trees dotted parts of the hills, standing dark and silent like shriveled-up, gnarled hands out of the soil. Trees might have grown where they were walking...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji turned his attention back to the belltower, standing tall among most of the other buildings, but as they descended, it grew taller and taller as they got closer to the streets. He guessed that was where they were heading first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air hung thin and dry in the slight distance of the city, and swallowed up everyone's words in its mysterious sorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon seemed strangely quiet. After her introduction of the city to Kouji, she proceeded to walk forward at a steady, almost dreamlike pace. After exiting the tunnels, not once did she try to slip him a strip of jerky or any other food, a startling notion indeed. Since then, not once did she turn back to make sure that he was following her, although, Kouji had to admit that the two of them were blatantly out in the open now, not in a labyrinth of dark, twisting tunnels where it was easy to get lost forever in, and he would have to run at least a mile away or into the city before he could be out of Beliamon's plain view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, he kept on walking and following her. Kouji felt a bead of sweat drip down onto his nose, which he wiped away. He could feel his pulse beating more. His slight weight was starting to catch up with him. The mildly pudgy boy in blue exhaled deeply and took a breath, hoping he wouldn't run out of breath in a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, he began to wonder why he would think that he'd run out of breath because Beliamon's pace soon slowed to stopping. She just looked folornly up at the partially ruined belltower and toward a few other, crumbling buildings, and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll stop for a break before we enter the city,\" Beliamon told Kouji quietly, her voice crisp and bereft of happiness. Her eyes were partially obscured by a shadow as she tilted down her head. Kouji nodded silently and plopped his behind down on the hard, dusty ground with an, \"Oof...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Beliamon lowered her own body to the ground and sufficed to sit down with her feet flat and knees pointed up, over which, she crossed her arms. Her eyes gazed down toward where the city lay in ruin. Kouji wondered whether she saw the city or saw nothing at all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Kouji gasped when he looked beyond to one side of the hills; one side of it had dissappeared totally, a whole side of it raw craggy rocks and dirt, with hard, gnarled roots hanging out, grasping into nothingness. It formed a kind of canyon of sorts, two, tall, imposing rocky cliffs, except with no bottom. If one were to fall in there, they'd never land, and just keep on falling... into the dark gray abyss... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then when he noticed that the darkish, grey hue of the skies wasn't because of clouds, but because that the 'sky' was an absense of presence. The 'sky' was made of nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't as if the sky was darkness or anything, where one could not see, but it was as if Kouji was staring beyond it, straining to see reality, but it was too far away to see. It was a hard concept for even Kouji to describe, and he had to look away within a few minutes as his eyes began to hurt from the strain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an ocean of emptiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them sat there quietly, now both were gazing down at the city. Kouji could see that the city must have once been a spectacular place, full of people, or Digimon, should he say, and the thought that they were all deleted, save one, chilled him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he had a closer view of the city, he could now see that there was one area toward the outskirts that had been partially deleted, with one building standing cleanly cut in half. He could see the floors in it and the different rooms, however aside from that, he was still far away and couldn't see the furniture and what might lay inside, and thus he wasn't able to tell one from another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon had told him that Ayzahn Ra was a village of Mage Digimon, and that ten temples had been built around the city after the Ten Legendary Warriors. Of course, they were residing in the Temple of Earth... now, turning back, Kouji noted the ornate entry way and carved stone sign and torch holders that marked the way to the Temple. Kouji didn't see anything like it in the surrounding area, and if anything, just areas of hill, some whole to a point, others deleted severely, the ocean of emptiness almost reaching the city itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji thought he saw a glimmer of water in the distance and perhaps it was a winding river leading into a somewhat small pool, which was partially obscured by a rock wall hanging over it, and he wondered if that was part of the remains of the Temple of Water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji shuddered as another chill took his body. It wasn't brought about by wind or the cold... it was just the strange, eerie feeling he got being in the area. Maybe it was the emptiness and lack of life. Whereas even those dimly-lit tunnels of the Temple of Earth were quiet, they were still full of life and they were still part of the earth. This place, however, seemed to be... thrown off of the natural balance somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to look at Beliamon, who was still staring down at the city, with a stolid, unwavering look on her face, as if nothing at all in the world would bother her in the least. It was just then, while looking at Beliamon, Kouji noticed something startling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your bandage; it's gone,\" Kouji cried as quietly as he could, \"And your arm, it's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Healed, I know,\" Beliamon smiled curtly, now turning her gaze to the boy in blue, \"I guess Digimon recover faster than the average human, but, still, we do need patching up when injured. We're not invincible, you know...\" Beliamon's voice and eyes trailed off to the city, before her eyes turned down, she closed them and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We really should get a move on, then,\" Beliamon said, \"We've been staying out here on the hills for too long, and we're so close to the city, too,\" she stated, getting up and dusting her dark dress off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji groaned and got himself up off of the ground too, dusting his pants off along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what they say, so little time, so much to do,\" Beliamon said as she continued to walk down the hill, \"Come on, Kouji,\" she waved as she motioned to the belltower.</span></div></div>",

As if, Ayzahn Ra itself, or what was left of it, glared down upon them as they continued their trek to the belltower, and telling them to return the way they had come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even stranger was how Beliamon was acting, quiet, stoic, and serious. Not the bouncy, sarcastic captor he had come to know, the city seemed to have taken her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole city oozed nothingness, as empty and devoid as the abyss that bordered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...we're going to the belltower?\" Jouji questioned, observing the stones that made of the street, noting how varied they were in size and how ornate they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. After the initial attack on the city, the digimon that were left used the belltower as a fort to fight against Cherubimon.\" Beliamon said and sighed. \"Though he wiped them out easily and efficiently. Yet even after he attacked them, their refuge still stood. There's still a good deal of supplies there as well, all magically enchanted to never spoil or attract disease.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These mages...they must have been extremely powerful to create such spells and build such a city...\" Kouji mused, eying what was left of a shop appearing to have sold magic texts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...though they may have well have been fleas compared to Cherubimon.\" Beliamon muttered bitterly. \"Ayzahn Ra was a city influenced by its environments. Many digimon lived him and the influence of the Temples made it a vibrant and beautiful city...but now, you see those things are gone. All that is left is the Temple of Earth and the abyss. As such, Ayzahn Ra is only a shadow of its formr magnificense. In fact, if it wasn't for the Temple of Earth, what's left of the city now would probably have been destroyed as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...you seem to know a lot about this city..\" Kouji muttered suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...travelled through it several times, learning magics.\" Beliamon quickly covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Kouji mumbled, shoulders drooping in disappointment. \"But Cherubimon...he really destroyed this city? And he deleted all of the digimon?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...yes. He was ruthless. The city went from prospering in the morning to like it is now at night.\" Beliamon said, looking up at the belltower, it ringing out as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji's eyes narrowed and he clenched his fists in fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe him! How could he be so heartless, so cruel as to do this?! I swear that I'll destroy him and avenge everyone who was deleted!\" Kouji shouted, his voice reverbrating throughtout the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon chuckled darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be stupid. Cherubimon is a Mega level digimon and he has the power of five Legendary Warriors. What makes you think you and your ragtag griup of friends can avange Ayzahn Ra? OR save the Digital World for that matter? THat same kind of thinking got Ayzahn Ra destroyed originally.\" Beliamon spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...there has to be some way...we can't just let the Digital World be destroyed...\" Kouji muttered, frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon glanced back at him a moment, as if thinking, but then shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen...if I were you, once I'm able to relase you, I'd just find my friends and look for a way home. Even if you could defeat CHerubimon-IF; then you'd have to defeat Lucemon as well and that's just impossible.\" Beliamon warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Lucemon?\" Kouji asked, confused. \"I've never heard of him before...you mean Cherubimon actually WORKS for someone?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon sighed and prepared to tell the tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes he does. Why do you think he's collecting data? Many many years ago, there was a war between the digimon of the Digital World. It went on for ages with no signs of letting up until a powerful Angel digimon arose to quell the fighting. That was Lucemon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji nodded for her to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After that, things were okay for a while, but Lucemon became corrput. He became a tyrant and began to destroy the Digitla World. It was then the Ten Legendary Warriors stepped in and, in a grand battle that took their lives, defeated Lucemon. But even they couldn't fully defeat him, so instead they sent him to the center of the Digital World, where he continues to sleep to this day. And then, Lucemon hadn't even been at full power. After that, the power of the Legendary Warriors, the Spirits you use, was divided among three powerful Angel digimon. Five were divided among Seraphimon and Ophanimon, and the other five were trusted to Cherubimon. After he fell to the dark side, however, he corrupted the Spirits he held and the Dark Warriors were created. He then captured Ophanimon and Seraphimon, whose Spirits were then scattered across the lands, until found by you.\" Beliamon told darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...I can't believe this...so much we didn't know...\" Kouji muttered, awed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shocking, no? Well, you would have learned it sooner or later. Now do you see the utter hopelessness of facing Cherubimon? Not only is he a powerful digimon in his own right, but he has Lucemon backing him up. Not to mention the Dark Warriors.\" Beliamon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji's eyes were glued to the pavement as he walked, but the fires of determination still burned in his eyes, Beliamon noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Beliamon stopped her pace as she and Kouji arrived at their destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But who am I to tell you what to do. I really don't have that much experience with humans. If you're able to destroy the Dark Warriors before Cherubimon revives Lucemon, you might just have a chance.\" Beliamon somewhat encouraged, walking over towards the Belltower's entrance. \"Now, come on. Help me find where those old wizards stashed the food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji nodded, noticing Beliamon act a bit like her normal self, and walked over to the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wonder what everyone else is doing right now...' Kouji absently thought and sighed. 'I bet Takuya's lost weight by now...boy am I gonna get it when they finally DO rescue me...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji and Beliamon then descended into the only building still functioning within the ruined city of Ayzahn Ra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Idly waving his arm through the air, he managed to snag an already cooked meat apple from the backpack he had hanging on another, nearby branch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the life...\" he muttered contently, closing his eyes, taking a big bite out of the ivory colored meat apple he clutched in his hand. Somewhat sweet and salty tastes flooded his mouth as he chewed down on the tasty morsel, \"Mmm... ham.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe setting was absolutely wonderful. It was a nice, sunny day, as it always was in the meat apple grove- another advantage it had over a few other areas in the Digital World. There were clear skies, with an exception for the puffy white clouds that hovered above them all. Takuya found himself looking up at the cottonesque formations in the skies more often than ever before now, trying to get others to guess what shapes they resembled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya had also found his little niche in the area, branch, to be more precise. He had climbed this very meat apple tree he was currently resting in when he had first come to the meat apple grove looking for something to do while dinner cooked. It was then when he discovered it: the perfect resting place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just the ideal, and strangely, most comfortable branch imaginable. Takuya could be warmed by the sun and still be shaded by the leaves without getting too hot or cool. It seemed to be pretty thick and sturdy, but the way Takuya liked to stretch his body out on it caused him to lay over some of the thinner areas of the branch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\" went Takuya as he continued to devour the meat apple. It tasted just as good, if not, even better than the first meat apple he had even eaten. It was strange because it had been all he had been eating for days, weeks even, and yet he still didn't get bored of it... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course!' thought Takuya, 'It's probably because meat apples change flavors all the time. You never know what you'll get... it will be ham one day, the next-'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were interrupted by a familar voice calling his name. Groaning, opening his eyes, and turning his head down to earth, from his paradise high in the air, he could see a miffed looking blonde haired girl tapping her foot, \"What is it now, Zoe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you, Takuya. You're lazing about again?\" the blue eyed girl asked with a raised voice, looking up to face the carefree boy resting in the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" he blinked, shifting from his current position and pushing himself forward so he could turn around to face her. \"Is there anything wrong with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Zoe started, but soon lost momentum as her voice trailed off and her eyes looked to the side, \"I guess-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her scolding words were interrupted as a loud, dry, snapping noise cracked in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh,\" Takuya squeaked nervously. Instantly, the branch Takuya was resting on was now starting to tilt rapidly towards the ground as it broke off and fell about six or seven feet to the ground, Takuya plunging after it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the fall, if any, was mostly muffled by the springy, green grass, and that's not to say that Takuya's abrupt drop wasn't cushioned at all because of his rearend. In fact, all there were only two sounds that resulted from the fall, and the first was Takuya groaning an, \"Oof...\" as the pale faced, somewhat suprised boy dusted himself up and got up, now bereft of his perfect resting spot and feeling quite mournful in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next reaction was, of course, the hysterical laughter coming from the girl in the pink and purple ensemble. She threw her face up with chuckles and continued to giggle until she was a little red in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see what's so funny,\" Takuya grumbled, putting his hands on his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it!\" Zoe cried, throwing her hands in the air, thus concluding her laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, sorry, I still don't know. What's it?\" the thick-headed boy asked, tapping his head with his knuckles a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe sighed, tilting her head down before rising back up to answer him, \"Well, eating meat apples all day long that you smuggled to your tree can't be good for you, and... well, if now you're heavy enough to break the branch you've always rested on since we first came here... it says something, you know?\" she stated, tilting an index finger to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Takuya lamented softly, now looking down at the snapped off branch laying across the grass wet with dew. Suddenly, Takuya blinked and snapped out of it as he understood something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" he cried, \"Are you saying I'm getting fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sneaking the amount you do every day isn't going to make you any smaller,\" Zoe remarked, smirking. Takuya started to blush as he looked down at himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the handful of days since Kouji left (probably to work off the extra poundage), Takuya was sure that he had done absolutely nothing in the way of excercising to get back in shape after the uncomfortable ordeal he had with Kouji right before he left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Takuya had probably GAINED weight since then! He had a definite potbelly now, bulging against his yellow shirt, and even though it wasn't huge, it was still apparent, and you could still tell he was getting out of shape from just a glance. It also probably wasn't a good sign that his butt had probably entirely cushioned the fall from the tree...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're no better!\" Takuya accused as he pointed a finger at Zoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" she cried, her face flushing into a shade of red as she nervously ran her fingers through a lock of golden blonde hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you said you snuck meat apples too, didn't ya?\" said Takuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes, but not as much as you...\" Zoe smirked weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh reeeally?\" Takuya asked, giving her an evil smile, batting his brown eyes back and forth towards her body, which was beginning to get quite chubby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe started to sweat nervously. She looked down and surveyed the damage that snacking had done to her... now, even the weight was showing up on her stomach, and it really was starting to stick out: something that she was lucky enough not to gain the first couple of days at the meat apple grove... But now it was starting to jiggle slightly when she was ran or was walking and stopped abruptly. And still, that wasn't all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, she took a step forward, swung her hand toward Takuya's face and promptly smacked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" he cried as his face glowed red in the affected area, \"What was that for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You must have been looking at me all the time to notice such a slight difference...\" she growled as she spun her head back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I-\" Takuya started, poking two fingers together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh... never mind,\" Zoe said, calming down, \"Oy, this is so much like deja vu to just a few days ago with you and Kouji it's not even funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kouji,\" Takuya said, resting his head down and wondering where he is, \"I bet he's so skinny right now, running through the woods on hikes and what not. Maybe he'll come back a little more muscular too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, it wouldn't hurt us to take a hike in the woods ourselves,\" Zoe suggested, placing a hand below her slight gut and bouncing it up and down for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but we said that we would wait a few days here for him to come back,\" Takuya reminded Zoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, well, we could always meet him in the woods, right? I mean, we could always send him a message with our digivices to let him know where in the woods we were, maybe signal a landmark or something,\" Zoe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Zo. I'm in favor of playing it safe for a few more days,\" Takuya said, \"Honestly, I think he's bound to be back tonight or maybe tomorrow night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so, Takuya,\" Zoe smiled as she nodded, indicated for him to follow, and the two went off to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You've sat on it ever since we've got here, munching on meat apples and sleeping! And since it didn't get thinner then you've had to have gotten thicker!\" Zoe shouted, frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya crossed his arms and turned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I havn't gained THAT much weight...\" Takuya defended, but all the same putting his hands on his stomach and looking down at how sperical his belly had become, barely able to see his feet from under the mound of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong gone were the few muscles gained from playing soccer. In place of them now was a month a three quarters worth of meat apples. Any slight upward movement of his arms would lift his shirt up, revealing the Buddha belly and his pants; they were so uncomfortable now, he'd almost taken to wearing them around unbuttoned. They were sure hard enough to get back up after using the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takuya,\" Zoes said matter-of-factly, \"I can see belly pushing against your shirt from here! You certainly havn't gained muscle! And soon you'll even have boobs! if you havn't got them already, that is. At thte rate you're going, no, the rate we're ALL going, we'll outgrow our clothes in the next few days!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...okay, so I'm a little chubby. It'll melt right off when Kouji comes back!\" Takuya said, dismissing the subject. \"Now let's eat; I', starved!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Zoe and JP sighed and shook their heads. If Kouji wasn't back soon Takuya would probably grow to sumo wrestler proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you even care that you're getting fat..?\" Zoe asked weakly as Takuya took a hearty bite from his first meat apple, but certainly not his last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...maybe?\" Takuya responded with a clueless look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'M going on a diet! No more meat apples for me!\" Zoe resolved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I should probably hold off on them too...\" JP agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya shrugged and simply tore into another meat apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well. More for me!\" Takuya shouted gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Tommy sconding the opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJP and Zoe then endured several long minutes of Takuya and Tommy devouring the juicy, delectible meat apples without remorse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth licked their lips subconsiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, to hell with it...\" Zoe cursed, walked over to the meat apples and dug in herself, JP following suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn their feasting, they were unaware of they two cerulean orbs observing from the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beliamon was sure right...let them continue at this pace, and they'll be as bif as hogmon!\" Ranamon exclaimed quietly through the communication device connected to both Cherubimon and Mercurymon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah..so she was not lying. This is good. Mercurymon, how goes things on your end?\" Cherubimon asked from his castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things are proceeding according to plan, my lord.\" Mercurymon responded as he surveyed Grumblemon and Arbormon drain the dat of the land surrouding the area the children were in. \"Its coming slowly but surely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Soon the children will be trapped. Then they can gorge themselves to immobility. Then we strike!\" CHerubimon exclaimed and cackled, his laugh resounding throught his chambers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord...I have doubts as to if this...plan of Belimon's will really succeed.\" Merucrymon offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCherubimon's face curled into a frown. He wanted a zero xhance of failure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elaborate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even eith Beliamon's ruse, the children will begin to suspect something eventually. And once they see that we've cut off their escape, they'll be positive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but they'll still be trapped.\" Cherubimon countered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what to keep them from continuing to eat the meat apples. Surely after they figure out that they've been tricked, any time devoted to stuffing themsleves wil be diverted to getting out of their prison and rescuing their friend. And speaking of this friend, the one who holds Light, we havn't even heard of how he's progressing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCherubimon's frown deepened. Mercurymon had a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it comes to that, we'll empoly Beliamon again. She'll just have to fatten them all up at once, but seperately, so as not to cause trouble. As for the Holder of Light, Duskmon arrived on what was left on Ayzahn Ra earlier, but I've yet to hear anything yet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're spying on Beliamon?\" Ranamon questioned, slightly shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. When we last spoke, she seemed a bit...strange. Almost as if her time with the boy had lessened her loyalty to me and Lord Lucemon,\" Cherubimon said, thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You honestly think she'd betray us? She knows what you'd do to her.\" Ranamon said, still skeptical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything is possible, Ranamon.\" CHerubimon responded sagely and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mercurymon, continue to oversee Grumblemon and Arbormon until they finish. Ranamon, before you return, fertilize as many trees as you can, without being seen of course, to promote fertility and bounty in the meat apple trees. I want them to have the best and most fattenign apples available. After you all finisg, report back to me. By that time, I may have heard from Duskmon.\" Cherubimon ordered as he turned off the communication device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my lord.\" Both Ranamon and Mercurymon stated before the device went out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon...soon those foolish children will be out of my way. Soon they will be too large to do anything to stop me!\" Cherubimon said to himself, as dark, deranged, evil digimon often do, and waited for his Dark Warriors to return.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kouji and Beliamon were now just steps away from the keep underground in the belltower. However, it was easier said than done. Upon entry, Beliamon had to, again, light the way using a ball of flame she apparated slightly above the palm of her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the strong gates that once barred the outer walls were all missing, getting to the keep was still a challenge, as there was a somewhat mazelike interior. Thick, sturdy wooden doors appeared every now and again in the passages, although many were bolted or equipped with heavy, rusty, iron chains, padlocks, or rings. Some were even boarded up with lumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly, Kouji noted that there was little to no dust in the area. He kept on following Beliamon, who strangely seemed more intent on observing the walls or the floor than the path she was taking. She knocked her idle hand against the wall every now and again without a second thought, intently listening closely for something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji stepped softly and tried to remain as quiet as possible, so that he might hear whatever it was Beliamon was listening for. After several, similar turns and about five minutes, Kouji gathered that they had just carefully paced and listened to the same walls three times. They were going in circles... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Beliamon?\" Kouji asked, his voice a little heavy in his throat for not speaking for a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" the golden haired Digimon replied, turning to face him. Kouji and Beliamon were now just steps away from the keep underground in the belltower. However, it was easier said than done. Upon entry, Beliamon had to, again, light the way using a ball of flame she apparated slightly above the palm of her hand. <br>\r\n\"Uhm... well, where exactly is this keep?\" the dark haired boy questioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, er, it's...\" she started, before suddenly, Beliamon leaned back, so her hand hit a certain stone in the wall. Spinning around, she quickly knocked it out of the wall, fished her hand in the hollow, and removed a gray key, \"I knew it was hidden somewhere within these walls,\" Beliamon smirked, her grin twitching weakly as she returned the stone to the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you were looking for a key the whole time?\" the slightly pudgy boy raised his eyebrows as he placed his hands in his pockets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... yes, this is how to get into the basement keep where the food is stored. All the doors are locked after all,\" Beliamon nodded as she turned down the hall, motioning for Kouji to follow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you couldn't just first try to knock the door down or pick the locks?\" Kouji doubted, \"It seems pretty lucky that you just reached your hand out and-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could do many things,\" Beliamon retorted, \"But I choose not to. Anyway, don't worry about it, Kouji,\" she said, turning the key in a rather bulky looking padlock, \"We're almost there...\" she said almost silently as the padlock fell to the ground with a crash. Beliamon pulled away the chains that bound the door locked and placed them off to the side, the links clinking against one another. She put her hands on the iron ring and gave a swift pull as the wooden door creaked open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon increased the flame burning above the palm of her hand as she descended down a cool, steep, stone staircase; strangely, they weren't damp at all. Kouji didn't fear the vast, unknown that lay below him, the great darkness, with Beliamon standing near him, illuminating wherever the two stepped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could he even honestly THINK he felt safe with his captor!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stepped down the staircase, whenever she passed by a torch post, she lit it, putting some of the flame near her hand on the unlit torch, spreading light where she passed. Kouji followed Beliamon as the two descended several flights of stairs, and with every landing they passed, the way became brighter and brighter. Soon, Kouji could see the bottom as light spread to the depths of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, as if in a dream, Kouji felt his foot hit solid ground. Beliamon then went to light any torches in the corner of the room, fully illuminating the entire vastness of the keep, bringing the fullness of the room apparent to Kouji's eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon dropped her backpack onto the ground with a plop. Stretching out her arms for a bit, she sighed. Nonetheless, Beliamon soon picked her backpack up again and started for a large, sturdy set of sliding doors, similar to those in a western saloon except for the fact that they covered the full entryway, stained a deep, dark red. Engraved all over the door were obscure runes similar to those that Kouji noticed here and there there over the city ruins and even certain parts of the Digital World.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon made a motion for him to follow her. The now borderline chubby boy in blue could only guess that she was heading towards the store. Kouji increased his pace to keep up with her, sadly noting the small bouncing of his belly with his steps. He certainly had gotten some excercise done today, and hopefully he had lost a pound or two by the time they returned back to the Temple... if they were even going to go back there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Beliamon made an quick, gasping noise in her throat that lasted half a moment, almost undetected by Kouji's ears. But Beliamon stood there, frozen, turned away from Kouji, her arms straight against her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beliamon?\" Kouji asked, with a strange, creeping feeling beginning to surround him, \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds of silence pulsed on throughout the room... but a few seconds can seem all the longer when they bar the way to what one anticipates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon's head was, again, turned to the ground. Kouji's eyes widened when he saw some shapes lined up near the wall. Rags? Bedsheets? Pillows? All of them were faded, dusty, and hadn't been touched in a while... but there were many of them surrounding the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji now could see how the staircase wound to the side of the walls, the landings were confined to  the corners, and he fathomed that the entryway was somewhere way up there on a ledge... it had to be some tremendous refuge the two of them were in- almost the size of four basketball courts, paired two by two. Hundreds, maybe thousands of people could fit in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind,\" Beliamon said, trying to reassure Kouji, shaking her head and biting her lip, \"I'm fine,\" she grinned falsely, placing both her hands onto the large doors to the food store. Kouji lined up next to her and tried to push the doors along with her... they were heavier than he thought, but the doors both swung open, revealing a somewhat dark room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are,\" Beliamon said, her mood brightening up a little. Quickly lighting a few, ornate, paper lanterns using her magic, the store was soon brightened up. Kouji could see that it wasn't your average kitchen cabinet. There was a central walkway dividing the room into two columns of aisles of cabinets and shelves to the back wall. Then, lined up to the wide shelves were sliding ladders, which could reach the higher shelves. There was even a platform above, reaching from shelf to shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon immediately went from one shelf to the next, hurrying and scuttering about with her backpack in hand, observing the rows of shelves, pulling out a few drawers and examining their contents. Kouji just stood, watching her blankly as she managed to stuff a large jar of flour, sugar, a box of eggs, several cartons of milk, a container of what was supposedly a cake of yeast into her backpack. Beliamon pushed the drawers back into place and picked up her backpack, which Kouji could tell was already quite hefty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all?\" Kouji grumbled meekly, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, no, no,\" Beliamon laughed, \"These are only basic ingredients- I could barely make more than bread and maybe sugar cookies with just this, but then again... you might be amazed with what I could make in a pinch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHefting the backpack up, Beliamon crossed the corridor quickly as she began to take out sacks that were found in another drawer and fill them with things like apples, raisins, and melons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hard to imagine how much is still left in here,\" Beliamon commented, as she put a block of cheese into the backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Kouji remarked, not sure of what to say, watching as Beliamon struggled to put a large bag of rice into her backpack, \"Uhm... how is this all fitting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic, silly,\" Beliamon giggled before going back to stuff her backpack with more food. Kouji sighed and ran a hand though his hair... Melancholy and depressed one moment, but gradually becoming bouncy and a little bubbly a while after... would he ever be able to fully understand her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look a little wiped out,\" Beliamon noted as Kouji wiped a bead of sweat off of his forehead, \"Why don't you go take a rest while I pack up, or maybe...\" Beliamon stopped, but continued to suggest, \"When was the last time you took a bath?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Kouji exclaimed, slightly alarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, I didn't mean you reek or anything,\" Beliamon smiled, holding up her hands in peace, \"You saw the stream, right? There should be a hot spring off to the eastern side of the bank close to the city, and there are towels there, both hot and dry- why don't you go there and relax for a bit? It should be perfectly safe if you strictly stay to the hot spring area and don't go wandering off to the far reaches of the river.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Kouji said, considering the idea. He wouldn't mind a nice, hot, relaxing bath at all. In fact, it seemed desirable. Too good to be true, almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on,\" Kouji started, \"I'm supposed your prisoner, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, again, there's nowhere to run off to- but this is the first time I've ever heard a prisoner telling his captor her job,\" Beliamon stated smugly, \"And what, you'd want me watching you take a bath?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no!\" Kouji cried, now it was himself holding his hands up in peace, \"It's just that... oh, I don't know,\" he sighed, \"Sure, I'll go. Could you give me any hints on where to find it so I don't spend most of my time finding my way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's right by the remains of the house with the red roof,\" Beliamon noted, suddenly with a tinge of sadness, as if she remembered something special about it that now ceased to be, \"I'll wait for you in front of the belltower when I'm done, so that's where you can find me,\" she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... I guess I'll see you later then,\" Kouji said awkwardly as he walked out, pushing the doors with the spells on them aside. Beliamon watched as they closed behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon began to wonder if she had made a mistake in letting Kouji free to the hot springs for a while. It wasn't that she felt he would acquire a new sense of freedom and rebel against her; no, she wouldn't believe that in a thousand years. She hadn't been a good tyrant to him, after all, and Kouji didn't seem like he was about ready to do that do her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs mentioned before, he had nowhere to run off to... but what was worrying Beliamon was Duskmon. Kouji was absolutely defenseless without his digivice... However, Beliamon was almost certain that he was stuck in the labyrinths of the Temple of Earth, and was struggling to find his way around. She had sensed him moving around outside the Temple, and she could only fathom that he was still in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully, the Warrior of Darkness was still at bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut aside from that, there was another thing clouding her thoughts, the instigator of all the terrible memories she held and had to relive with every step she took in this dead, deserted city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCherubimon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat twisted, fallen angel of a Digimon was still monitoring her, perhaps even closer now than ever. He was the reason why the risk of Duskmon was about in the area. She could have almost sworn he was oblivious of her exact location, seeing it was, for the most part, cut off from the rest of the Digital World, but he had to have known if he were to despatch Duskmon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't allow herself to feebly be afraid of him, but she had to admit that he was very, very powerful, and she should know he very well had the power in him to destroy her several times over. Plus, he had the backing of Lucemon, a power incomprehensibly greater than he. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was in enough hot water seeing that she had only proceeded in her plan on only one child. The fattening of the others was a cheaper, backup scheme that he had concocted only minutes before conferring with Cherubimon a while ago. But that wasn't the only reason the Dark Lord had to be angry with her, for Kouji had barely fattened up since she captured him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCherubimon's face was seething with a feeling that he had been betrayed by her. Beliamon knew that he sensed something wrong with her, and she also feared that in the back of his mind, he recognized her from long ago somehow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon had been summoned by him to do a task... to fatten the chosen children up for him, a task that she was recognized as specializing in for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPacking baking chocolate into her backpack furiously, Beliamon wondered what to do. Cherubimon wanted progress from the Warrior of Light and he wanted it fast. But what could she do? More importantly, why would she do it other than to save her own neck? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was always the possibility of her conjuring food up with magic, but no... that would be wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, it would drain a little energy out of her, but that was nothing she couldn't get back with a little sleep. It was just that when she... magicked up food, it was... perfect. It tasted delightful and never ceased to please, and maybe it could be considered a little addictive. Perhaps her magical confections could be thought of something far and beyond the caliber of her homemade foods, the like of which Kouji had only eaten thus far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy using magic, she could do many things; one of them was to instantly cause something like a cake to appear by apparating ingredients immediately and using magic to combine and cook it all in the same instant, using memories of how the food was prepared; it was all very complicated and hard to do, but she had mastered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magicked food could be very fattening, and it could probably speed up his gain make him more willing to food, but very unnaturally. Beliamon was almost sure he would eat the meals she cooked if he completely trusted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn't be fair to Kouji if she were to give him magicked-up food, she thought as she stuffed several varieties of fish into the backpack before zipping it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hated the thought of abusing Kouji's trust, especially seeing that Kouji was one of the few out there she had trust in at all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon sighed, shook her head, cleared her thoughts, and struggled to heave the incredibly heavy backpack onto her back. She proceeded to carry it to another aisle as she still had some things she wanted to load into it before she headed up.</span></div></div>",

Upon arriving, he'd spied a dilapidated changing stall and was amazed to find a few bathing suits strewn about, and human ones at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Though...Beliamon is human enough for a digimon...I guess there could have been others.' Kouji thought as he absently put a hand on his belly, grimacing as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd been lucky that he'd been able to squeeze into the tiny garmant. Even now, he feared the elastic band would break, leaving him unclothed and forcing him to sprint back to the changing tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji sighed and examioned his small paunch, calmly sitting in his lap under the water. While he wasn't fat, he wasn't anywhere near being thin. He had gained enough wait to inhibit him in swimming and running at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji drew his knees to his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And enough for people to tease me again, too..' he mumbled bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he had a full view of his body, Kouji also noticed other parts of him with increasing in size as well. His chest, if ever so slightly, had began to pooch out just. His legs no touched and rubbed together where there had once been empty space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling and trying to clear his head, Kouji pushed out from the sides of the hot spring and just let himself float, staring up at the gray sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji grumbled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pale belly stuck up out of the water like an island jutting up from the ocean, almsot obscuring his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed no matter what he did, he couldn't get his weight off of his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Kouji returned to his previous position and absently wondered what Beliamon was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young Kouji slurped happily as he finished off what was left of his chocolate ice cream cone, stains of the cold, chocolate confection littered around his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind him, his father and stepmother were both lying on a large beach blanket under an umbrella. His father had his hands behind his head, a look of bliss on his face, as he snoozed away, letting the sun tan him. His stepmother was flipping through a book and wearing a large sun hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom..?\" Kouji asked, getting up from his own place in the sand and waddling over to his stepmother, \"Will you buy me another ice cream?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji's stempmother, glanced up from her book and gave her stepson a worried look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankly, she didn't know where the boy was putting it all. Ever since she had married Kouji's father, she had watched her stepson grwo in size, and he wasn't the thinnest kid then, perhaps a little pudgey, but nothing serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow her stepson was bordering on becoming a full-fledged butterball. Kouji's skin was pale, from staying inside and watching television all day, and his stomach balooned out over the rim of his swimming trunks and fell over like a cascade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting her book aside, she supposed it was partly her fault as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji hadn't accepted this new woman in his life that well and acted as if she was the plague. She had taken to giving the boy anything he wanted to accept her, including food, but now, she was really beginning to start to worry about the boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think you've had enough, Kouji?\" she asked, not wanting to hurt her stepson's feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm hungry...\" the young boy whined, placing a hand on his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kouji, we ate just an hour ago, and that was your second ice cream cone since we got here....\" Kouji's stepmother tried to reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care! I want another ice cream!\" Kouji shited and stamped his foot down, bordering on a temper tantrum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji's stepmother smiled awkwardly as a few other parents and children stared at her and Kouji, hearing his shouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Kouji's stepmohther shook her head and sat up, latching onto Kouji's hand to take him over to the ice cream stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, listen Kouji: THis is the last one, okay?\" she asked him, to which he nodded enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji blushed as he recalled the memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I guess I really should have listened to her more...maybe then, I wouldn't have gotten so big...' Kouji thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was glad that he had indeed lost the weight during the growth spurts of puberty. If not, he could still have been that heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kouji?\" Kouji heard his dad's vouice sound throughout the new house, the third so far this year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Dad?\" A pre-adolescent Kouji asked, not really paying attention as he watched some rerun on television and munched on a bag of potato chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you come here a moment?\" his dad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji sighed, grunting as he got up and proceeded to follow his dad's voice, eding up in the dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a seat, son.\" His dad commanded as Kouji noticed the troubled look on his dad's face, as well as his stepmother's, seated beside his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji did as he was told, the chair creaking under his weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kouji...we've been worrying about you...more specifically your weight.\" his father said, trying to ease into the conversation gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji bristled and he immediately sent an angry glare to his stepmother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHE talked to you again didn't she?\" he asked accusingly, his stepmother recoiling at the look he sent her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter. Kouji, look at yourself. You literally eating yourself to death! Your hlaf MY weight, and I'm four times as old as you are.\" his father pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SO WHAT?! I know I'm fat! I don't need you, or HER, or anybody else telling me!\" Kouji shouted, getting up and leaving the dining room in a frenzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kouji-\" his stepmother started to call after him, but Kouji was already halfway to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there, he slammed the door behind him, locked it, and let himself fall to the floor against it, hugging his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew they were right. Its just...he didn't care anymore. He'd tried to lose the weight in the past, but he'd just ended up getting heavier. They moved, usually, more than twice a year, he never had any friends...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruly, he was terrified of how chubby he'd became. The taunts behind his back in school, not being able to keep up in gym class, staying indoors during summer while everyone else went to the beach...but then again, he never stayed anywhere long enough to make any friends, so why care what others say about him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing and supressing his feelings, Kouji rose from the floor and went over and flopped on his bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully, he'd have a few growth spurts in puberty and the weight would melt away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji shuddered, despite the hot water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had been one one of worst moments in his life, an everpresent reminder of what his life had been like when he'd been larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji chuckled darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course, then, there hadn't been anyone to be fat with...' Kouji thought, referring to Takuya and the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA frown then formed on Kouji's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The again, they've probably lost all the weight by now...' he thought glumly, looking up at the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya would never let him live it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing grumpily, Kouji submerged himself in the hot water to refresh himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't Beliamon be here by now?\" The blunette asked himself wondering how long his captor was going to spend in the belltower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji paused a moment to think over what he had just asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well. Not my problem.\" he muttered, trying his best to get back to relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile....</span></div></div>",

Takuya struggled to sit up straight, his head still spinning from the impact, with his large, soft, and heavy gut now becoming an obstacle. Now it was like the hardest sit-up in his life... The goggle head struggled to use his stomach muscles, now covered in thick flab, to pick himself up. After much work and sweat, Takuya managed to sit upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow...\" he moaned, rubbing the area where the projectile meat apple had hit, \"What was that for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To get your attention for one,\" explained the blonde haired girl wearing a purple beanie, \"Honestly, after putting up such an act with Kouji... I thought you were really concerned about your weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh, it will all shed off once Kouji returns and we're running all over the Digital World again. Trust me on this on, Zoe,\" Takuya smiled, giving her a thumbs-up as he picked up the large meat apple from where it had landed and dusted it off with his yellow shirt. Even as he stretched it slightly so he could clean it, his potbelly, now larger than ever spilled out from under his shirt. His exposed pudgy gut revealed its soft rolls and the deep navel Takuya now possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Takuya had finished cleaning the apple, he let his shirt loose, but it started to ride up. \"Shoot! Not again...\" he grumbled behind clenched teeth. He then proceeded to yank his T-shirt over his oversized belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sure, whatever you say, Takuya,\" Zoe grinned, giving Takuya a skeptical look. It was true, though. He was even bigger from the day before... his face was rounded and he was on the verge of having a double chin. His arms seemed now thickset, softer, and flaccid, and Takuya's tan pants looked painted on and painfully tight, maybe they were at the point of bursting. Even his chest was beginning to poof out with all the weight gained, as it appeared Takuya was developing slight, flabby breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, have you seen the size of the meat apples lately?\" Takuya asked, almost drooling as he held the volleyball-sized apple in both hands before taking a bite into the plump, pink fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you'd have me believe even that might make you stop?\" Zoe shook her head as she placed her hands on her newly rounded, wider hips, \"If they were fattening before, just imagine what they're going to do to us now...\" she sighed deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, a guy's gotta eat,\" Takuya stated with his mouth full, chewing off a chunk of the overly juicy fruit, some pink drops dripping down his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe began to crack a smile and laugh at the sight, \"Takuya, sometimes you act like such a pig, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya smirked but continued to chow down, until Zoe tapped him on the back. Takuya rose to his feet, his bulging belly jiggling as he stood upright, \"What is it?\" he asked, turning to face Zoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't cook that apple, Takuya. Isn't it bitter?\" Zoe asked, a little concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya looked suprised down at the half-eaten apple he held in both his hands, \"Well, if it wasn't, I couldn't taste a difference... it was warm and delicious, and maybe even better than any meat apple I've ever had. I haven't had one that tasted like turkey since who knows when...\" he said, rubbing his belly tenderly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, I don't know... Yesterday?\" Zoe asked sarcastically before continuing, \"It's really strange how the meat apples all grew to the size of melons overnight,\" Zoe observed, looking to see that the ripe meat apples were all at least the size of grapefruits and were either dangling, weighed down off of a branch or on the ground, \"They've turned pink too.\" All the meat apples were a beige color before they were cooked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh, I noticed that too,\" Takuya nodded, licking the pink juices off his lips, \"I guess that's because they're so plump and full of more juice than ever,\" he smiled, \"Before you had to cook them to bring the juices out, but I guess that work's done already for some reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you've certainly become an expert on meat apples in the past few days,\" Zoe complimented, giving Takuya a pat on the back which caused his chubby stomach to bobble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Tommy ran onto the scene, a meat apple cupped in between both hands, \"Hey guys,\" he smiled. Even Tommy with his high metabolism was starting to pack on the pounds. His white shirt seemed tight and strained, as it was holding back a newly accumulated potbelly, which was only just beginning to peek out from under his shirt, \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know... just teasing Takuya about his weight and considering a diet, the usual,\" Zoe smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny, Zoe,\" Takuya sneered as he discarded the finished apple core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Merucrymon and Ranamon were silently observing the rounded children, hidden by the foliage of the meat apple grove. Both had slightly awed expressions on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must applaude you Ranamon. It appears that not only have you accelerated the growth process of the meat apples, but you've also eliminated the cooking process alltogether!\" Mercurymon exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, sugar. Its hard to believe that feisty little bunch of kids that from just a week ago have become so lazy!\" Ranamon replied as she saw the forms of Takuya, Zoe, and Tommy vanish between the trees on the path pack to their campsite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. Lord Cherubimon was brilliant in devising this plan. You can see the effects in even the way they walk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercurymon was right. The children, when being observed before by eiher himself, Ranamon or another Dark warrior, always carried themselves quickly and on guard of any possible attacks, but no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow their strides were slower and more clumsy, and Mercurymon ventures that they hedn'y touched they're digivices since ythey had tried to contact their comrade, which Beliamon had taken care of by sending a false message, or so he was told. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not that they need their digivices now.' Mercurymon thought with a smirk. The area the children were in had always been free of inhabitants, even though it had always been bountiful. And now, thanks to Grumblemon and Arbormon deleting the data that made up the land around the grove, the kids were now trapped on a floating island of sorts. Nothing could get in and nothing could get out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Ranamon and himslef had been assigned to make sure the children never discovered that they had been trapped. For if they did, their whole plan could go up in smoke. Or a great portion of it, at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mercurymon, Ranamon.\" Both dark warriors attention were then drawn the the communication orb in the palm of Mercurymon's left hand as it flared to life and Cherubimon's face appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I trust everything goes as planned?\" The dark digimon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my lord. Not only have the children gained weight, but they've also become extremely lazy and have been lulled into a false sense of security.\" Mercurymon stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They also have never travelled to the edge of of their prison. The farthest they travel in a day is to get to the ripest and best tastin' meat apples, since the trees around their own campsite are practically bare.\" Ranamon added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if they should somehow continue this process until they reach the edge of their island prison?\" Cherubimon questioned, promting a smirk from Ranamon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If such an emergency arises, honey, I can make all the trees bountiful again in just a few seconds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect. You'll have to gives the trees an extra watering before you leave then, Ranamon. I need both you and Mercurymonto go on another mission for me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another task, my lord?\" Mercurymon questioned. \"Is not making sure the children do not discover their Shangri La is indeed a trap more important?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IF Ranamon makes sure all of the trees are bountiful, then I suspect they won't be going anywhere near the edge soon. Right now, there are rebellions rising up in what seem like every corner of the Digital World. I've already dispacthed Grumblemon and Arbormon to the south to crush the disturbances there. You two I need to send to the north to quell the digimon there. I may even have to recall Duskmon from his reconnaissance in Ayzahn Ra to destroy some minor disturbances in the west.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's quite a bit of rebellion, my lord.\" Merucurymon stated the obvious. \"There hasn't been this much uproar since we had to destroy Ayzahn Ra in the east.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know. Another good reason for umprisioning those blasted children. It seems that whever they go they spread rebellion. All traces of rebellion have come from places at least one of them has visited. But back to mattes at hand. Mercurymon, return immeadiately. Ranamon, wait until night so you can water the trees without chance of being caught, then return as well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood.\" Both dark warriors chimed as the communication ordb went black once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember, Ranamon: You cannot be caught under any cirumstances.\" Mercurymon warned as he began o telepory away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanamon, in reply, rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotcha, sugar. I do have SOME brains, you know.\" She replied sarcastiaclly and turned and walked into thr trees, vanishing from Mercurymon's sight, to wait until darkness arrives and she could perform her duties.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That morning, Takuya was the first to wake up. He got dressed, then he groggily lumbered out of the tent. His eyes shot open when he saw the area around the campsite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meat apple trees that were devoid of meat apples just hours ago were now flourishing. The meat apples were now even bigger than ever, as they were now the size of pumpkins. There were quite a bit, as the few that were still attached to the trees rested on top of the small piles that had formed on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fruits themselves were also different. They were still a pink color reminiscent of the middle of a rare steak. The stems were still the size of normal apples, and the meat apples were so huge that the stem no longer formed a pit. In addition, the cores were the same size as before, but due to the size of the apples, they no longer reached the bottom, leaving the bottoms smooth and flawless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya, in disbelief, walked up to one of the meat apples, inspecting them to see that they were actually real. He poked one, and to his surprise, it wobbled a bit. Seeing that they were real, Takuya could hardly contain his excitement, and he tried to lift it up, using both his arms to heave up the fruit. He brought it back to the campsite, then saw that Zoe and J.P. had waken up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing the new fruits, Zoe became suspicious. \"What is this?\" she questioned. Takuya dumbly responded, \"They're meat apples, and they've gotten even bigger. These can last forever!\" \"Aren't you concerned about where these came from?\" was Zoe's skeptical response. Takuya just said, \"Who cares. They are probably delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe was not satisfied by this, so she expressed her concerns, saying, \"We have already gained quite a bit of weight, and now we'll just gain even more. What if someone wants us to be fat?\" J.P. finally spoke, saying, \"She has a good point.\" This would cause concern in Cherubimon, however, due to the rebellions, no one was there to watch over the kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, Takuya responded by saying, \"You're just getting paranoid like always. I don't see why we can't enjoy this time off.\" This angered Zoe, who responded by saying, \"You're so infuriating.\" She then stormed off, mumbling to herself, \"I wish Kouji were here. He'd probably know what to do.\" Meanwhile, J.P. ran after her, and the two began talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the campsite, Takuya walked over to one of the small heaps of fruit, and hefted up another one, bringing it closer to the campsite. He went to get a third one when he heard Tommy stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy groggily walked outside in his pajamas, then he saw the new meat apples, and practically jumped out his pajamas in excitement. His pudgy belly jiggled as he did so. Either way, he exclaimed, \"This is amazing! These meat apples are probably even better than the old ones!\" Takuya responded with the same amount of enthusiasm, saying, \"I know, this is amazing! I can't wait to try them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, the two boys walked up to the tree, and continued to bring the fruit to the pile that Takuya had started. Takuya decided to heft a fruit in each hand, while Tommy found a big one that was four times the size of his head. It was so big that Tommy had to roll it to the pile. After a half of an hour, most of the trees near the campsite had no fruit left, and there was an immense pile of pumpkin-sized fruit in the middle of the campsite. The two boys were awestruck at the mere sight of the pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy blurted out excitedly \"C'mon! Let's eat!\" He pick up a gargantuan fruit, and right before he dug in, Takuya interrupted him, saying \"Wait! I have a better idea. Let's have an eating contest!\" \"That's a great idea!\" was Tommy's eager response. \"What does the winner get, though?\" Tommy questioned. \"I never really thought about that\" Takuya responded. \"How about the loser has to bring the winner more apples?\" Tommy responded cockily, \"I'm gonna win then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sat down next to the pile, and they each brought a fruit in front of them. Takuya began by twisting the stem and pulling it out, like with any other apple. When he pulled it out, however, a small, white core came out with it, leaving just the flesh on the ground in front of him. Juices also started to leak out of the hole that he created. Seeing this, Tommy followed suit, and they both began digging in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya began by drinking the leaking juices, which tasted like gravy. It was amazing, delicious, and fattening. Takuya slurped down quite a bit of juice, then he began scooping out chunks of flesh with his hands. He ate the chunks, finding out that this apple tasted like a good steak. He ate with gusto, and every few bites, his stomach, which was already sticking out a bit, pushed out a little bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy took a slightly different approach. He held the bottom of the fruit, then stuck his face in the fruit, sloppily taking as many bites as he could. The juicy flesh left quite a bit of juice on his face, and his pajamas, which he was still wearing. His fruit tasted like roast chicken, and Tommy loved this flavor. His belly also grew a bit every few bites, becoming slightly more firm by the minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back in the forest, Zoe and J.P. were talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm concerned. Takuya won't listen to reason, he will just eat himself to death!\" Zoe began. J.P. responded by saying, \"I know. Soon, he will be to out of shape to defend himself. I don't want that to happen to me.\" \"Maybe we should talk to Kouji about this.\" Zoe added. Then she got out her digivice, writing a long message explaining her situation. They then walked over to a nice, shady tree, and sat down, waiting for a response. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wisps of steam steadily continued to rise from the sweltry hot spring, making the air around it transform into a humid and moist very moist cloud. Somewhere within this floated a very bleary looking Kouji; now, even his face and shoulders had broken out into a heavy sweat. The dark haired boy's head started to spin as he began to feel light-headed and wobbly due to the heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gasp, Kouji took in as much dense air into his lungs as he could and swam off to the bank of the hot spring, away from the steam in the center. The swim was seemingly long and tiring, and by the time he reached the desired location, he was exhausted! He drew in a deep breath of the thinner, cold air as his entire body felt total relief from the deep humidity from before. With the cool air, his energy slowly began to return to him, and perhaps he felt more energized than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clasped onto the side of the spring with both his hands and pushed up hard, trying to get his knees out of the water and onto the bank. It took him a while, but eventually Kouji managed to pick himself out of the water and sit on the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlistening with droplets of water, the blue haired boy sighed as he looked down at his plump abdomen protruding outward and softly resting in his lap. Kouji realized that swimming, or even getting out of the water was a more difficult task than ever before, due to his newfound pudge- perhaps it had been more than that... maybe a little bit of a struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, Kouji told himself, \"The heat must have gotten to my head; it probably made me a bit weaker,\" he assured before grinning slightly, \"Although, it was boiling hot out there, so I probably burned off a few pounds just by sitting in the steam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching sight of his chubby belly, Kouji let out a deep breath, \"Aw... who am I trying to fool anyway?\" Kouji's blue hair, now loose, untied, and drenched in water, hung halfway down his back at the longest. He also had wet locks of hair obscuring his forehead and draping a little over his eyes. He watched as a round, fat water droplet slided down a damp clump of his hair, and splash into the hot spring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, where did I put it?\" Kouji asked himself as he searched the ground around him for the small, durable, blue rubber band he always used to tie his hair up. Bereft of this important device, Kouji's long hair would be awry and falling all over the place. A wet lock of hair flopped over Kouji's eyes and hindered his vision. Sighing, he parted it away with his hand as he bent down on his knees and began to scour his surroundings for that all-important rubber band.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHowever, as he bent down, he noticed his bathing suit, especially around his rear end, felt a smidge tighter than was comfortable. The blue haired boy shrugged to himself in annoyance, but wouldn't let it bother him. He already knew he was out of shape... it just kept on being brought to his attention one way after another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrushing away a few pebbles and parting away blades of grass seemed to yield no results. Kouji groaned in frustration as his lengthy hair cascaded over his vision for the umpteenth time. Why hadn't he been more careful with it? Or why did he take it off in the first place? He knew his blue mop of hair would get like this if he didn't... Sighing to himself again, Kouji gazed across to the horizon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, he became enlightened once he peered over the hot springs. The boy with the slack blue hair gasped audibly as his eyes snapped open with astonishment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the conventional slap in the face, although the blow was softened by his hair which had fallen back in the nick of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changing stall and the house with the red roof was standing on the OTHER side of the hot springs! Kouji must have been so light-headed in the heat that he floated all the way over to the opposite side of the springs, and if that wasn't bad enough, he didn't realize it until just now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudging back to the bank of the spring with a somewhat defeated look on his face, Kouji Minamoto edged the hot springs to reach the changing stall where he bet he had left his vital band. He didn't swim across the spring like he did last time because he didn't want to risk having his vision obscured by his loving locks in the clouds of hot steam; Kouji noticed that the temperature in the steam cloud had probably risen even more, and the steamy whisps extended closer to the edges. Now he was grateful he didn't rough it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Kouji pushed up and got his partially flaccid legs out of the water before walking off to the changing stall to fetch his band. He looked down to see his belly jiggling very slightly with his every step, just too much for his own comfort...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't planning on getting dressed right away; he'd just straighten his hair off and head back to the water... maybe to sit by the edge with his feet dipped, letting the rest of his body to dry, or maybe to get back in if Beliamon didn't show up anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe became a little at rest when he discovered his hairband was resting on an ivory colored basin near the side opposite the large rows of changing stalls. A mirror lay above the basin, and he was able to tie his mess of hair up, pushing the renegade locks away, in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji headed back out to the edge where he sat for a few minutes, gazing into the steamy water. He tried to just lay back and get some more relaxation after his little fiasco swimming across the hot spring, but there was a few pressing matters on his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Kouji wondered what exactly was delaying his captor, or, if not that, simply taking her so long... he had easily been gone for about an hour and a half, and he didn't think Beliamon was one to become lost in Ayzahn Ra, especially when she knew of his own location. After a while, he idly began to drum his legs with his hands, and to his vexation, there also was a slight jiggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his face towards the gray skies... not a cloud up there for him to wonder about; they were just gray, stolid, and never changing... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"And that's IT!\" Beliamon cried triumphantly as she slumped over her backpack, sweat pouring down her face and her hair a mass of tangles and knots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe truly had needed to shop, especially if the Temple of Earth was no longer the safe haven it had once been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing was more, but decideing it was high time she got out of the belltower, Beliamon hoisted herself up from her position on the floor against her backpack and tried to lift the thign, but no no avail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, to heck with it.\" Beliamon muttered, and using a generous amount of magic, levitated the backpack, near bursting point, and creating a ball of flame for light in her palm once again, began the trek back out of the Belltower, cringing once again as she past the area with beddings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This...must have been where they made thier final stand...' She thought sorrowly as she turned her head back to the path ahead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still too painful. It was STILL too painful after all these years. A whole city destroyed; because of her. So many lives lost; because of her. Teacher...deleted while defending her. And her friends. Tara...Rao...Eri..and...Yoi. All perishing in a fight she herself brought about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon stopped momentarily and punched the ancient wall with her free hand as the hot tears began to roll off of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only she hadn't been so cocky! She thought...she thought that if they banded together they would be able to defeat him. But it was all for nothing. The elders had warned her, but she hadn't listened. Instead, she captivated her peers, Ayzahn Ra's younger gerneation. And after she had convinced the young to fight, what choice did the old have but to fight as well? They certainly would not let their students go into battle without their aide. So the old then joined the young in their fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And then what happened, Beliamon? What happened after the older generation joined the young and Ayzahn Ra began rebelling?' Beliamon asked herself sarcastically as she pounded the wall again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlumping to the floor, Beliamon replied in a voice so soft, she herself could barely hear it: \"They were deleted. All of them. Except for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem troubled, Beliamon.\" a voice suddenly sounded from the darkness, and Beliamon gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding, and firously wiping away her tears, she cursed herself. She had been so lost in her emotions that she had not sensed the dark presence worm its wat out from the cavernous Temple of Earth and into the city, into the very belltower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-my lord Duskmon, what...brings you here?\" Beliamons asked the darkness, her voice a little shaky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is none of your business why I am here.\" Duskmon replied simply as he materialized from out of the darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Beliamon did know why he was there. He was there to spy on her. She was also faily certain that he knew that she knew he had been in the Temple of Earth, if that made any sense at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising up to her full stature and smoothing her dress some, Beliamon tried to seem as taciturn as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, my lord. Do you desire anything of me then?\" Beliamon asked coolly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf possible, an awkward look came over Duskmon's face then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seemed..troubled. I simply wished to know what had been bothing you.\" Duskmon replied in any even more awkward fashion, and for a moment Beliamon was struck dumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Dark Warrior, one of Cherubimon's right hand digimon, and the Warrior of Darkness no less, had just shown HER compassion?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something wrong with that picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...I see. Thank you my lord, but I was just overcome by the past for a moment there.\" Beliamon replied, still a bit awed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether this was a plausible answer or not, Duskmon nodded and the two stood again in a strnage silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuskmon was still looking at Beliamon awkwardly, but she had abandoned her awed expression and was studying Duskmon closely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I expect everything goes well with my counterpart?\" He asked afte quite a pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Everthing goes fine with Warrior of Light. He's bathing right now, in fact. If I'm lucky, the minerals in the hot spring I sent him to will have slowed his metabolsim down a bit.\" Beliamon replied with not even thinking, she was still looking hard a Duskmon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about him seemed familiar...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a picture of Kouji ran through her mind and Beliamon gasped. With Kouji's picture came another and with that picture came even more. Memories, names...and a mission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It can't be...is it even possible? Do either of them know?' Thought ran through Beliamon like bullets for a moment before Duskmon again snapped her out of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beliamon? Are you positive you're well? For a moment there you looked as if you had...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, my lord. I apologize for my...lightheadedness today. i just realized that Darkness is Light's reflection.\" Beliamon said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuskmon looked at her surously and was about to ask a question when the communication orb strapped to his waist came to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe immeadiately abandoned all rpervious thought and focused his attention to his master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Report Duskmon? Have you noticed anything strange about Beliamon?\" Cherubimon's voice rang out and reverbrated through the large undergroud room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuskmon looked awkwardly at Beliamon and Beliamon smiled wickedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too good to pass up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon strode over next to Duskmon to  where she could be seen through the orb as well, and with as much gusto she possesssed, gave Cherubimon a big smile and exclaimed: \"Lord Cherubimon! How are things back at the castle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Cherubimon just stared blakly as Beliamon, then switching to Duskmon and then back to Beliamon again before he made a rather strange sound like a Duckmon being roasted alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beliamon! Err...how goes it with the Warrior of Light?\" the dark lord asked, trying to cover up his tracks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite well, my lord. Progress is coming along smoothly. In fact, I just restocked my supply of ingredients.\" Beliamon replied, still smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful. I knew I could rely on you Beliamon.\" Beliamon almost laughed there but quickly caught herself as Cherubimon turned his attention to Duskmon. \"Duskmon, I need you to return to the castly immeadiately. There are several rebellions going on in various corners of the Digital World and I nned to sedn you to crush one of them. Leave as soon as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood.\" Duskmon replied as Cherubimon faded from the communication orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a small snigger, Beliamon returned to her previous position in front of Duskmon and smiled amiably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I take you'll be leaving now, my lord Dusmon?\" She asked playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...yes. I must return to Lord Cherubimon as soon as possible.\" Duskmon replied as he began to telport away, back to Cherubimon's lair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Well it was nice talking to you,\" Beliamon's eyes locked on Duskmon and she smirked just as Duskmon was practically gone. \"Kouichi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuskmon's eyes widened at the name, but just as fast, he was whisked back to CHerubimon's castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon chuckled to herself again. Oh, what a discovery she had just made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This may cause complication to arise in the future, though.' She thought as she levitated her backpack again and resumed her trek out of the Belltower to rendezvous Kouji. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she suposed she could deal with that when the time came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well, it sure did take long enough...\" Kouji grumbled as soon as he had noticed his captor's arrival. He didn't turn around to face her, but remained still in his position, sitting off the edge of the hot spring. His legs were submerged into the warmth of the waters, and he had wrapped his arms around his knees. He gazed out to the clouds of steamy mist toward the middle of the spring out in the distance... swiftly they rose, opening their faint maws to breath in the world, extending their ghostly talons to grasp the air, but all too soon vainly getting dissolved by the cold. And once the steam wisps had evaporated, there was nothing to look out in the distance, not even the sky. Just the ominous, grey nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, did you miss me?\" Beliamon smiled slightly, her voice containing traces of jest. Kouji jerked, but glared into the water instead, watching his own face flush, and declined to retort. Then there was quiet until a soft thud sounded as Beliamon allowed her overloaded backpack to gently float to the ground. She hopped onto a low, fairly smooth rock in their midst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as she faced Kouji's backside, she could observe progress... if she really wanted to call it that... Still, he had to smile when she noticed the soft rolls of love handles developing on the once lithe, now burgeoning waist of the youth. The direct results of her own cooking, no doubt... and one more reason for her 'prisoner' to be so troubled, no doubt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji turned his head around to finally look at Beliamon. \"I guess I'm not the only one who's been reminiscing...\" Beliamon thought as she noticed there was something lying underneath his dark blue eyes, a kind of cloudy depth and distance in his pupils. At least Beliamon was now in better spirits since her own unwelcome recollections at the belltower, thanks to her awkward little run-in with Cherubimon and revelation about Duskmon; so it was very lucky that at both of them weren't in a moody attitude...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...still, Beliamon remembered long ago, when someone special she knew well was taking a much deserved break in the hot springs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to break more than one sheet of figurative ice, Beliamon remarked, \"So, have we been enjoying ourselves?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess,\" Kouji shrugged before rising to his feet. He was wearing nothing but a blue bathing suit that could have probably have fit him just fine a while ago, but now almost looked a smidgen too tight for comfort. To add to his, his bulging paunch was now starting to slightly drape over his bathing suit. The few water droplets that were still scattered about his body started to slide down as he stood up. The blue-haired boy had broken out in a vivid blush as he approached Beliamon; obviously, he detested having to display most of his flabby, out-of-shape body, in front of the one who was supposed to be his captor, nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji halted, tilted his eyes up from the ground to Beliamon's eyes, and opened his mouth, as if he were about to say something... but just continued on his destination of the changing stalls to scope out a towel and retrieve his clothes. Beliamon couldn't tell if it were sweatdrops from the hot spring or sweatdrops from sheer humiliation that dripped down his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many days has it been?\" Kouji questioned as the two wandered through the cobbled streets that were dilapidated with age and wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About three,\" Beliamon answered curtly, \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three?\" Kouji repeated, \"Well, I guess that must be right... it seems a little longer than that, you know?\" he nodded as he looked back up at the grey nothing where the skies should have been. Again, his eyes kept on searching past all that distance for something to focus on, but to no avail, as he had to turn away when they started to strain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what the others are doing?\" Kouji thought to himself as he continued to walk with Beliamon through the pathways of the ruined city, \"It's been three days- they've got to suspect something's wrong by now...\" Then he sighed and smiled sarcastically, \"Sure, even if they've already set out and are looking for me, it's really likely they'll end up finding THIS place, all isolated from the rest of the world, literally floating around in the middle of nowhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon and her alleged prisoner passed by a crumbling, ancient fountain, dry as a bone- and as pale as one too! The largest, bottom basin was very large, broken out in cracks, and probably had a diameter of around thirty feet. The lopsided ruins of a destroyed second bowl remained on a low-lying, decaying pillar, and it was a real wonder why it didn't topple over and crumble into a cloud of dust and rubble. Then Kouji looked up and saw somewhat of a dim glint and noticed an strangely shaped formation of what seemed to be copper holding it in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That used to be a fountain- oh, and that used to be a statue,\" Beliamon explained as she saw Kouji observing the distorted figure barely holding the fountain together, \"It used to be quite something... but now, you can see, all that settled to the bottom is dust and... coins...\" she swallowed as she noticed the dark silvers and coppers still lying there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji blinked, \"Hey, we've never passed this way before... we're not heading toward the Temple of Earth, are we?\" he asked, looking at her with analytical eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not right now,\" Beliamon said honestly as she re-levitated her backpack and continued, away from the fountain. Kouji hesitated and wished he had a little more information, but advanced along with her anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji let out a deep breath. If only he had ended up with the unrelenting, stereotypical evil villain for his captor, someone who reveled in torture and hated his prisoner to the core of his being, but was entirely incompetant and could easily be outsmarted...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with Beliamon... she was much more complex than that- bouncy and cheerful one second, and completely solemn the next- just like before he had left for the hot springs, and even when she had returned to fetch him, he noticed she was exuding some invisible aura of merriment, there was definitely a jovial glint in her eyes. Kouji had entirely mixed feelings about her and no idea whether he was right or not... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, she may be working for Cherubimon and she was supposed to be holding him captive, but... she wasn't being very diabolical about it as one might expect. When all was said and done, under the thrall of Beliamon, the worst she'd actually done to him was try to feed him, if not very generously at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh... Kouji, what are you complaining about?\" Kouji asked himself in thought as the two of them turned a corner, \"Do you really want things to get worse than they already are?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We havn't walked that far at all.\" Kouji stated, crossing his arms and giving his companion/captor a scrutinizing look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, they had only walked a few blocks since they had passed the fountain. After a few turns they had ended up it what appeared to be a less glamourous part of the city. The streets had narrowed, though they were still made of the beautiful but faded stone. The buildings were also different. They were taller, some two, three, and a few even four or five stories high and to Kouji they almost looked like apartment complexes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing Kouji's observations, Beliamon's eyes saddened a bit but she chuckled nonetheless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...is where the students used to live.\" She responded a bit flatly, and Kouji looked at her strangely once again. \"Students and aspiring students.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji continued to look at her strangely, but eventually his attention was pulled away from her to again examine the buildings that could have once been the liveliest place in Ayzahn Ra before it fell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Beliamon, look up there. I'd started to think there wasn't any color in this city.\" Kouji grabbed her attention and she followed his gaze to a certain building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd her heart stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the railing of the building, a potwas hanging that was littered with cracks. And in the pot, beautiful blue flowers overflowed, small green vines dancing in the jumble with them. They seemed to look down upon her witha familiar smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon stepped back and gasped, paying no heed to Kouji whatsoever as her sudden action caused him to jump a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...it can't be...\" She mumbled. \"Tara's flowers....how they they still possibly be alive?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Beliamon abandoned her fous on the flowers and frantically examined the building. Her eyes widened further as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loose handrail near the bottom steps, the faded blue roof, and...and Taramon's flowers blooming right there in front of...their old dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had Kouji had miraculously stopped right in front of where Beliamon had used to live back when Ayzahn Ra had been flourishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...this can't be..\" Beliamon uttered, clutching her head as a flood of memories she had tried to bury overs the years assaulted her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beliamon!\" Kouji exclaimed, at his captor's eyes, and Beliamon was surprised to see, even in her hysteric state, worry in her eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverwhelmed, Beliamon screamed, unable to take the memories any longer. With one final sigh, she collapsed, and was out cold, a nervous Kouji hovering over her still form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she began to dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLei...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voing rung out in her mind, but she ignored it...snuggling deeper into the warmth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice sounded more impatient this time, but still she ignored it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LEI!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the sudden exclamation, she jolted up and held her head. Across from her, she now heard chuckling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally. Hurry up, sleepyhead. Do you want to miss chores? You do want to get into a Temple right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over and saw her friend, arms akimbo, and giving her a quirky smile. Her silken blue hair drifted down to her shoulders in a cascade, in it a solitary blue flower. She had pale skin, only further accentuated by her sea blue dress, trimmed in white here and there to resemble waves cresting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never been a light sleeper, Tara, you know that.\" She, Leiamon, said and ywaned again, finally rising out of bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I do.\" Taramon said with another giggle. \"What would you do without me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...fail?\" Leiamon ventured and gave her friend a blank look, who returned it with a balnks look of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen both digimon burst out in laughter, clutching their sides in amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you would get by Lei.\" Taramon said, recovering herslef and wiping at her eyes. \"But seriously, you better hurry up or you're gonna miss HIM.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon flinched at Taramon's emphasis on the word 'him' and blushed a little. Her roomate cackled as she opened the door, letting sunlight and a fresh morning breeze into their fairly small dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, Beliamon concentratedand closed her eyes. Lifting a finger and drawing a few runes with it in the air, she was soon dressed. Looking herslef over with a satisfied smile, she joined her friend out on the patio. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon's style, however, was a bit different from her friend's blue ensamble. She was decked out in black. Instead of a dress, she wore some loose balck jeans and smooth blakc top with the sleeves coming down to her forearms. Her shiny blonde hair was tied up into a ponytail with a black hairband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I miss him?\" Leiamon asked urgently, looking at Taramon for an answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just made it. He's coming down that way.\" Taramon said cheerily and pointed with one hand, while with the other she was summoning water to nourish some blue flowers she had hanging in a box on the railing in front of the door of their second story dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon gasped and leaned over the railing to look past her friend. Surely enough, a figure was swiftly jogginf dwon the street, dodging students as they left their dorms to go to daily chores. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon began to blush as he got closer and Taramon chuckled next to her as she continued to tend to her flowers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful there, Lei. Don't fall over the railing.\" Her friend chastised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon only spared her friend a withered look before turning her full attention back to the figure coming down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she was able to begin to make make out his features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a lithe frame, only a bit taller than her actually, but one could easily see the muscles on his arms, chest, and legs as he powered his way down the street. Currently, sweat was pouring down his face from his brown shock of hair and he was dressed in just some blue drawstring workout pants and a white workout shirt as he continued his morning run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Yoimon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, and then suddenly, it was all over and Yoimon's figure was than of a retresting one as it became further and further away until it was gone alltogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon sighed dreamily again, and let herself drop to the floor to lean against the rail, while images of her and Yoimon danced in her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough something wasn't right. She liked Yoimon well enough, but something struck out in her mind about him. It was like...he wasn't the cutest hge could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well, in her book he was cute enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaramon sighed as she pulled her friend to her feet, closed the door, and began to head out to do their own chores. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really have it bad for that guy, don't you Lei?\" Taramon asked, a hint of amusement in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon only continued to stare out into space, a look of bliss on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I do.\" She said finally, with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you are gonna talk to him, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I can't do that!\" Leiamon turned to her head away, embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then someone else will just snag him!\" Tarmon replied esasperatedly, skaing her head as if she and Leimaon had had this conversation before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...maybe..\" Leimon mumbled, unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no maybes about it! If you don't talk to hm soon, someone else will. Mark my words.\" Taramon warned, giving her friend a serious look. \"But right now, we're gonna be late if we don't hurry!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon sighed but then smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, a bet Yoimon is a heavy sleeper too. I wish I had chores with him sometime.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, unfortunatley, that I think is impossible. Yoimon is in the Redroof Dorms. We're in the Blueroof Dorms, and they split who you do chores with according to dorms.\" Tarmon replied as they raced down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Leiamon mumbled, a devious glint in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaramon began to sweat a bit as she caught the familiar look on her friend's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though I suppose if there was anyone who could find a way around that arrangement, if would be you Lei.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat caused another giggling fit between the girls as they raced to begin another hectic day in Ayzahn Ra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were almost to their assignment station when suddenly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Beliamon!\" exclaimed a voice sharply, as her body was shaken a little too vigorously by unseen hands. In an instant, the dreamworld crafted out of her memories shattered. The vivid colors of her recollections faded and the dull grays of the ruined city slowly returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Beliamon's eyes snapped open, revealing the bland gray expanse of the empty sky and. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon's head was resting on something warm and comfortable. . . and she found herself looking up at the dark haired boy, who was standing near her side, looking down with his blue eyes that somehow seemed much deeper than before. Beliamon thought for a second that she detected tension in his face, and saw the slightest thin line underneath both his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh. . .\" Beliamon moaned groggily as she turned her face around, \". . .Kouji?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji let out a deep breath as his face softened and became more at ease. A small smile touched his lips as he nodded his head. Then he turned around, gazing toward the distance, and was silent for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You. . . you were out cold for quite a while,\" he finally said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, was I?\" Beliamon remarked rather quickly and bittersweetly, not forgetting that Kouji had witnessed her little breakdown from before, something she'd have hoped she could have hid from him. Beliamon hoped that Kouji would have somehow forgotten that. . . and Beliamon wished she could do a little forgetting of her own as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose memories. . . they were all still well and alive in her head. And this rotting corpse of a city reeked of nostaglia and threatened to tap into her mind and provoke the memories into exposing themselves again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head ached and swam around, she could still feel it pound and reverberate deeply in her mind. Her entire body seemed racked with fatigue brought about either from her hysterical emotions from before or taking a rough fall. Beliamon shook her head and ran a hand over her forehead dotted with droplets of chilled sweat. She could have really benefited off of one of the few healing spells she knew to help her get along, although they'd probably put her to sleep or make her drowsy at the very least, something she couldn't have. She'd just have to rough it and let her body heal itself, even though she couldn't say the same for her memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Kouji turned back to her, and tentatively added much more softly, \". . . And, uhm. . . it's good to see you're alright. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Kouji had spoken too soon. Just as Beliamon made an attempt to sit back up, blunt, stiff pain spread up her back and sore joints, making her clench her teeth and grunt underneath her breath, \"You don't say?\" Beliamon remarked bittersweetly, closing her eyes to bide the further hammering in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't exactly collapse in the most comfortable location,\" Kouji lamented as he indicated a small pile of rubble where they used to be standing, in the middle of a narrow, stone street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch- that would explain the bruises,\" Beliamon observed sarcastically as she noted the mess of dull crumbled stone across the tight street. Kouji closed his eyes and nodded candidly. In that moment, Beliamon noticed that her prisoner's dark blue jacket was nowhere to be seen- he was clad only in the yellow shirt he wore underneath it that was slightly strained by a protruding paunch. Beliamon blinked as her head cleared for a moment, and immediately she found out where Kouji's jacket was, what her head had been resting on, and why she wasn't laying around in the rough pile of rubble where she collasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Beliamon sighed to herself and attempted to rise to her feet once again. In a few moments, she managed to sit up and prop her back against one of the tall walls of the buildings. Just then, she realized Kouji was standing at her side and his hand outstretched toward her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" he mumbled frankly, blue eyes darting the other way as his cheeks turned a vivid color, saying nothing more- but he had gotten his point across. Though he didn't see it, there was gratitude that glinted only a little in her eyes that, even Beliamon had trouble entirely supressing it. Taking hold of his hand, Beliamon was standing up in no time, and in no time at all, their hands had seperated as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then even more silence followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them were having an extremely awkward day, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no speaking or even moving for those few moments that seemed to last minutes- Beliamon wanted to recover a little more, and Kouji dare not fall astray if not for incurring the wrath of his captor, then simply for the fear of getting lost in a dead, empty city. Since the muffled voice of others in the distance, clattering steps, or even the wind were all absent from the area, it was true silence. And that eerie silence rang through the narrow streets- up until the point that Kouji spontaneously yawned, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bored?\" Beliamon muttered lowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji shrugged, \"No, not really,\" he said as he bent down and retrieved his bunched-up jacket from the sidewalk where Beliamon had been out cold earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon let her head fall toward her shoulder, it had been a long while since they had left the Temple of Earth. Chances are, it could be getting late, but neither of them would be able to tell- the skies over Ayzahn Ra were an eternal gray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji noticed Beliamon had re-levitated her enormous backpack and started a modest pace down the narrow street again, calling back to him, \"Come on, Kouji,\" but never looking back. With little contemplation, the ponytailed boy began to follow after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the two were out of the blocks containing the dormitory complex and were in a much more open area again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI really wonder where we're headed, thought Kouji to himself as the twosome crossed a deserted plaza. Beliamon did say were weren't headed back toward the Temple of Earth. . . but, then again, that WAS a while ago. Kouji felt that both of them were starting to tire, and knew that they were going to have to take a longer, more peaceful rest sooner or later. But where?</span></div></div>",

She felt unusually tired for some reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No we're not.\" Beliamon turned to Kouji and opened her mouth as if to speak again, but bit her lip in hesistation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji only stared at her and she sighed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't tell you earlier, but I ran into Duskmon after you left the Belltower. I think it would be best if we relocated.\" Beliamon stated simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duskmon?\" Kouji asked, blinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's right. I suppose you wouldn't have met him yet. Cherubimon does keep him cooped up fairly often. But anyway, Duskmon is a Dark Warrior, in fact he's your counterpart.\" Beliamon answered, heaving herself up and levitating her pack, and moving on leaving Kouji with the choice of following or being abandoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course he followed, Beliamon was able to note, by the second pair of sounding feet that soon joined her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a Warrior of Darkness too?\" Kouji asked, slightly surprised as he caught up with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Cherubimon uses him for most of his...dirty work, I suppose.\" Beliamon answered, turning her head rapidly from left to right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it was true she wanted to relocate, had wanted to ever since she has felt Duskmon's presence within the Temple of Earth earlier, that wasn't all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had felt strange since entering the city, or actually, since she had abducted Kouji. She hadn't known why she had though to hide him away within the Temple of Earth, it being so close to Ayzahn Ra, or what was left of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as if Ayzahn Ra had been almost calling to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had felt it when she had brought the unconscious Kouji to the Temple of Earth, when she had grocery shopped in the Belltower, and had grown even stronger when she encountered Taramon's flowers, still in bloom by their old dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was STILL growing more powerful, even as she was walking down the streets right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe city, though she had no way to explain it, was...guiding her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that frightened her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beliamon?\" A voice questioned and Beliamon was jolted out of her reverie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to Kouji with an inquisative look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji sighed and gave his his captor a withered look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was asking how you could have fended off Duskmon by yourself.\" He stated, for appearently the scond time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon snorted as she and Kouji rounded a field, a dull green pasture coming into view as they neared the city limits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whose said we fought? You seem to have forgotten, Kouji, that Duskmon adn I have the same employer. \" Beliamon paused and added quietly. \"Though neither of us chose to serve him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji stared at Beliamon for a minute before huffing and turning away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You also forget my power. Now, I can match ANY of the Dark Warriors, even destroy them. I'd say Duskmon, and perhpas Mercurymon would only stand a chance against me. And thats if I don't digivolve to my Ultimate form.\" Beliamon said passionately, and Kouji looked at her curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean how?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said now. Almost like you fought them before and lost.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...hehe. Of course not. I just meant that...I used to be very weak.\" Beliamon said nervously, waving her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suuuure.\" Kouji said dryly, and sighing, turned his attention forward again. \"So..we're headed to that field up there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon looked towards the field herself and gulped. She was being pullled toward it, that much she knew, and as they got closer she began to recognize it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That field is where the Temple of Light used to stand.\" She said sadly, nothing that now, only rubble littered the pasture, sometimes piled in high heaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Temple of Light?\" Kouji asked from beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it was said to be one of the most beautiful temples.\" Beliamon said and closed her eyes as memories of crystal buildings accented with creamy white marble and shimmering opal rose within her mind. \"It used to be beaitiful, to watch the sun rising over the Temple of Light, the light catching on it's crystal turrets.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji turned his attention back to the field as his imagination tried to picture what the Temple used to look like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, as the duo grew closer to the field, the buildings, or what remained of them, became clearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiant piles of dirty white stone, marble and opal dirtied from destruction and fire, was apparent as was slivers of dirty crystal, now just dull glass, in even bigger assortments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only structure still partly whole was a giant set of dirty marble steps leading up to a rather large ruined building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That used to be the Great Hall of the Temple.\" Beliamon noted as they both stared at it's remains. \"Many classes were held here. It was also a kind of an Administration building and held the offices of the Headmaster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Beliamon felt a pain in her chest, and with a cry collapsed to the ground, writhing in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji was immediately beside her and gasp at what he saw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust below Beliamon'n neck, shining through the black fabric of her dress, was the symbol of Light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a swift motion, the light intensified, as did Beliamon's shouting, and the light then shot out from her chest, making its way quickly up the steps, before pasuing just over the rubble of the Great Hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flash of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon gasped, deeply inhaling air for a moment as the pain finally left her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...in the world....?\" She gasped, grabbing onto Kouji's shoulder for support. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji wasn't looking at her though. He was staring out to where the light had flashed, a look of awe on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Beliamon followed it, and ofr the second- or maybe third- time that day her heart stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere there had once been rubble, there now stood a partially complete Great Hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light that had shot out from her, no doubt from Kouji's digivice she noted to herself, had apparently removed a veiling spell cast upon the Great Hall to persaude passerby it had been destroyed, though it had been, at least to some extent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe marble steps were now restored to a somewhat ivory state and now led up to an actual building. The building itself was made of an opaque crystal with traces of opal running here and there throughout it. The right side of the building, however, seemed to be completely destroyed, and even the rest appeared to be slightly damged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost amazing however, was that from the center of the Great Hall, a turret emerged and thrust into the sky. It was of a seethrough crystal, and steps of marble wove their way around the tower to the top, which was crowned by a large chunk of hollow crystal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd amazingly, it was undamaged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The...the Great Hall...\" Beliamon managed to choke out. \"If some of the outside has survived, then the inside must surely be functional! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji turned to her with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So can we stay here then?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The pearly doors burst open and light spread into the entryway of the Great Hall for the first time in eons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twosome found themselves in a medium sized chamber, one which Kouji found comparable to the size of a typical classroom, with a good exception being the heightened roof which stood at least ten feet above his head. The floor was a milky colored marble that shined and reflected the light that flooded into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScanning the room with quickly darting eyes, on the wall opposite them stood an even greater double door crafted of a material that resembled ivory; each was adorned with a sizable ruby ring to help open the massive door. The large doorway was flanked by a set of pilars and holsters magically bolted to the wall that at one time may have contained some kind of torch. Also, two, similar tall doorways stood on the left and right walls, each guarded by a pair of wooden benches padded with relaxing looking faded red pillows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji noticed that although the place may have had a lot of fancy details, strangely, he felt more comfortable and at ease. . . Maybe that was because he was the Warrior of Light, after all. . . and also because he had a nice bench right in front of him to lay back in, with a comfy looking pillow nonetheless! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, after a moment's of hesitation, Kouji promptly fell back into the soft cushions of the closest bench, and kicked up his legs, \"So this is where we're going to be staying for the. . . night, I guess?\" he shrugged as he upturned his gaze towards the lacking, constant nothingness gray of the sky he could still see out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so, if that's what you want to call it,\" Beliamon nodded, \"I thought it would make a nice change from the Temple of Earth- oh,\" Beliamon blushed before breaking out in a grin, and rubbing the back of her head, \"Erm, honestly, I've never been here before myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Kouji's eyebrows shot up in astoundment, \"What do you mean, you've never been here before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon shook her head, \"Just because I lived in the city for a while doesn't mean that I got accepted to learn or study magic in one of its ten most prestigious temples.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Kouji said blandly, \"But hold on- how come you knew so much about the layout of the Great Hall?\" he questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Word of mouth?\" Beliamon suggested, \"Many, if not all, of students frequented out of the Temple dormitories and mingled in the city. They were everywhere; so it really wasn't out of the blue to meet one on the streets or listen to them at a restaurant or inn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Kouji nodded, defeated again, as he leaned back into the soft bench. Just as he started to lean back further and maybe try to take a small rest, Beliamon had already approached the double doors opposite him, made a strange flicker with her arm across the door, and was attempting entry. Quickly, Kouji jumped to his feet and went to join her in pushing the heavy doors aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe double doors parted with a loud creak, revealing what could possibly be the largest room either of them had even seen. The floor was also made of the white colored marble, except this time, it was highly polished, and the two of them could see their own glossy reflections below them, and it expanded onward and onward until it hit the distant wall, seemingly far, far away. Also seemingly distant away was the ceiling, which made Kouji's eyes widen when he peered upward and saw the almost limitless ceiling with all the arches and buttresses held above him. The vast opaque crystal walls of the room were also lined with faded banners. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two observed that four or five long banquet tables of a light colored wood with long rows of benches on either side were set up across the ballroom sized chamber, and had probably been set up like that for a long, long time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief moment of silent awe, Kouji remarked, \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me?\" Beliamon exclaimed, her cry echoing throughout the immense room, making Kouji jump and his belly bobble slightly, \"If climbing up a set of stairs, front and center, and getting past a pair of doors was all it was to it, I would have easily snuck into here ages ago. . . uhm,\" she blushed as her quicky commentary echoed excitedly across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But yeah, believe it or not, Kouji, this used to be much, much bigger,\" Beliamon nodded solemnly, \"Obviously much of the Temple has been destroyed. . . I remember there used to be some kind of crystal wall around the campus, so that the staircase we walked up a while ago would be in the middle of a courtyard. I also remember seeing several more buildings aside from the Great Hall reflecting the light every morning. . .\" Beliamon sighed as she remembered that one morning, where she had decided to camp outside the dorms for that special day off. . . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had fallen asleep around the wooded height of the meadow, and when she woke up that morning, there it was; a vibrant pink sky with thick, smoky clouds dragging across the horizon, remnants of the night. But most radiant of all was the Temple of Light in the distance, reflecting the light in wonderful, shimmering flashes of a multitude of color and intensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a deep, grumbling sound interrupted her reminiscing, and leading her mood to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Beliamon's eyes deviously rolled over to look at a pallid looking Kouji, whose own eyes darted away in hopes of avoiding her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's right,\" Beliamon said, a smirk coming to her lips, \"You haven't had anything at all to eat today, have you? Why didn't you remind me?\" she laughed, \"After all that excercise. . . \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji's only response to this was a stony glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did stock up on ingredients today, so how could I forget?\" she nodded, indicating her backpack, \"So I guess you're in for a treat then, Kouji,\" she cackled as she gave his bulging paunch a healthy poke, making the ponytailed boy blanch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, really, I'm fine!\" he protested flailing his hands, his face now breaking into a deep blush, as he saw Beliamon silently head off to the entryway to hunt out a kitchen, or, at least somewhere where she could cook or concoct something for him to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji sighed for what had to be the umpteeth time that day as he exited the humongous room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the door to the Great Hall ajar, Kouji shook his head before collapsing onto the bench that he had sat down in before; he was in for a nice, refreshing, well-deserved rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, he knew it in his heart that Beliamon probably needed it much, much more than he did.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cerfeully, Beliamon opened yet another of the doors that lined this part of the Temple of Light. Poking her head in slowly, so as she didn't rush in to a room that could be in wreckage or collapse, she saw that it was a small parlor, still mostly intact, where professors could relax or work on tomorrow's lessons after a busy day of teaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving the room only a few more seconds of inspection, Beliamon sighed and closed the door behind her, turning her attention to the twenty some doors they had left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And then there's the fact that some rooms may have others branching off of them.' Beliamon noted to herself, and continued her trek, this time choosing a door on the left side of the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo tell the truth, she was getting just a bit...creeped out. For being part of the Temple of Light, the part she had explored thus far was terribly dim. She could only imagine how it would be at night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeeking her head in again for this room, she found it to be a small lab, the kind that were only reserved to the professors for experiments they believed were either to dangerous or too complicated to be taught or observed to even the brightest students of the Temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon closed the door and grumbled to herself as she made her way to the next door in the long line she needed to expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was becoming far too tedious. She had hoped to have a good meal in Kouji's belly, hopefully before it became completely dark outside, in order to replace all of the calories he'd lost during the day and then some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtherwise, he would start shrinking again. And that was a no-no in every possible way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping that this door would at least give her some sort of clue as to where the kitchen would be located, she opened it to find a classroom this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon stared into the room for a few moments, her eye twitching, before she slammed the door in frustation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was surprised, however, that such a force upon the door caused it to fly off of its hinges and hit the floor with a resounding thud, dust scattering everywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to think, she crossed her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If I was a kitchen, now where would I be?' She asked herself. 'Well, the kitchen would most likely be adjacent to the cafeteria, and I imagine the cafeteria wouldn't be behind one of these little doors. It would probably be in a part of the building that was easily accesible and...maybe it had big doors?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon scanned the halway to test her theory and was excited when she found a large set of doors at the very end of the hallway. She guessed it was also accessible from the outside, as it appeared to be on the end of this hallway and...well, it had big doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than walking, a habit she had adapted from being with Kiouji, she supposed, she levitated herself and moved down the hallway and a fairly quick speed, reaching the doors in just a few seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeaving the large set of doors, she hopefully looked inside and was ecstatic to find that it was indeed the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cafeteria itself was rather large, scattered with either crystal or marble tables, many of which were broken though a few still stood in usuable if worn condition. The ceiling itself was mostly a grand skylight, with a few crystal chandeliers hanging in place to provide light during the evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemonding herself that the cafeteria was not her actual goal, she spied the room to find any signs of a kitchen door, and found them not too far away from where she stood, on the left side of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering hastily, Beliamon gasped at the sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitchens were all she had hoped for and more. The room appeared to be in practically perfect condition, with spotless countertops and silver ranges and sinks lining both sides of the wall. Pans and pots of all sizes hung from the ceiling, small and large enough to make anything from a single serving of mashed potatoes to the largest pot roast anyone had ever seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were also many cabinets for storage lining the rooms and what looked like a pantry further back in the room, and upon inspection and to Beliamon's delight, both were found to still be partially stocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Beliamon stopped in front of a range, and smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was definately going to have fun with this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping the sweat from her  brow away with a cloth, Beliamon admired her work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had made quite a feast, even if she did say so herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the entree, she had made peppered steak, tenderized fully and seasoned with the best spices she had found in the pantrym along with grilled salmon, vut into bite sized pieces and also seasoned with spices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor side dishes, she had prepared a small but generous mound of garlic mashed potatoes, also seasoned with freshly ground pepper, in addition to a small loaf of bread, freshly made and coming with various spreads and jams she had placed on the tray with the bread for Kouji to choose from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd lastly, for dessert, Beliamon had prepared something of a chocolate moose. Chocolate as well as vanilla ice cream layered with hot fudge, crumbs of chocolate cookies, pieces of broken fudge, and a few pieces of caramel littered her and there throughout the chocolate masterpiece. It was also quite large, one of the reason why Beliamon had made the other portions of Kouji's meal smaller than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just hoped Kouji had a sweet tooth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting her dessert and the rest of Kouji's meal on a cart she had found, as well as several drinks she had chosen; Apple cider, creamy whole milk, and severl varieties of juics and soft drinks, Beliamon then strained to levitate the cart as well as herself, and began making her way back to Kouji at a slower speed than she had arrived, but faster than it would have been if she had walked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the kitchen behind her and then quickly moving beyond the cafeteria and coming back to the hallway, all the the time being careful not to drop any part of her feast, she soon arrived back to Kouji, who to her happiness, was almost asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body tended to store more fat when it was sleepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as soon as Kouji caught sight of the feast Beliamon had prepared, he balked and looked at her as if she was insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned his look with a cheshire grin of her own. Perhpas she was insane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're hungry, Kouji darling, I worked hard on this meal.\" Beliamon said jovially, before eying the almost plump boy. \"And that means you had better eat it all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're crazy if you think I can eat all that.\" Kouji replied, but nonetheless sitting up and taking the first few bits of the peppered steak and the grilled salmon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon shrugged and bent down to retrieve ther beverages she had brought with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may surprise yourself. You havn't eaten all day and you've been walking.\" She replied, adding a bit more in her mind to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Take that and the fact that, while its only been minor so far, your body has grown slightly accustomed to doing nothing all day and then eating.' She noted with a secret smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What to drink? I've got apple cider, milk, soft drinks, orange, apple, and grape juice...\" Beliamon listed the beverages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure brought a lot.\" Kouji told her as he shoveled a spoonfull of mashed potatoes into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Beliamon shrugged, and deciding for Kouji, poured him a large tankard of milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can actually keep these drinks here in their jugs and they won't begin to spoil. Its when they leave their jugs, magically enchanted, that they begin to spoil, so as long as we leave them in their containers, they won't spoil!\" Beliamon excplained to Kouji happily. \"I can probably bring you some snack foods with the same effect tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji's response was a roll of his eyes, but he continued eating, this time a piece of bread covered in blackberry jam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And while we're here we have the whole building to explore, or at least what's left it.\" Beliamon noted as she turned her gaze off towards the parts of the Temple she had not yet explored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. Well what do you expect to find?\" Kouji asked offhand as he tore into more of the grilled salmon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon, however, didn't answer. She was still staring off into the unexplored regions of the Great Hall, a strange look in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji shrugged Beliamon's lack of an answer, contributing it to one of her odd moods or...or perhaps she hadn't yet fully healed. Either way, he continued eating his meal, for the first time, not thinking what it would do to his waistline, though he undoubtedly would later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What am I going to do..?' Beliamon thought to herself, amidst the jumble of thoughts plagueing her mind. Sighing deeply, she banished the thoughts from her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt really didn't matter. No matter what path she took now, it would end ugly. All she could do now was to try and get through this with as little pain as possible...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Beliamon tread down a lonely and dimly lit passage in the Temple of Light, once more going it solo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji had chose to stay behind, claiming he wanted some time to himself. Looking back, Beliamon saw Kouji did have a point with his excuse. . . both of them could probably benefit from some more time alone. However, Beliamon suspected that Kouji would resume his nap on the bench, and this time sleep soundly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon could tell that Kouji was truly tired just by the look on his face; and if he was going get some sleep, she'd certainly have to leave the area. It wouldn't be likely for Kouji just to allow himself to comfortably take forty winks in the midst of her presence. And after that abundant meal Beliamon had served up for him, she had little doubt in her mind that Kouji would have no trouble at all getting to slumberland, given he was by himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing her ventures down the unexplored corridors of the vast and dilapidated Temple of Light, Beliamon peered ahead and saw that the narrow confines of the hallway would soon open up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she emerged from the shadowy hallway, Beliamon entered what seemed to be a deserted terrace. However, parts of the smooth moonlike marble had crumbled away, and only half of it seemed walkable. An intact bench without a back made of a similar marble stood on the firm marble ground, next to a balustrate on the edge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd no there was no sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky was clear and flushed a bright cerulean blue while white, fluffy clouds drifted their way across the open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He DIDN'T come!\" cheered an overly delighted voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get your hopes up just yet,\" sighed a second speaker flatly, \"Were you looking out the entire time? Maybe he passed by quickly while you were daydreaming or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon recoiled before cracking a sheepish, twitchy smirk, \"No way... besides, if Yoimon bolted the street, who do you think would be the first to notice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaramon didn't glance back as she continued watering her flowers, \"Leiamon, I still don't think this is a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, come on, Tara,\" Leiamon sighed, aimlessly straddling the nearby desk chair, \"We've gone over it before. . . True, it may have taken me a while to come up with it in the first place, but I'm sure it'll all work out just fine!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaramon spun around and shot a skeptical eyebrow up at her friend, \"Alright, Lei- you have one last chance to convince me to help you with this. Explain how this is going to work one more time for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon folded her arms over the back of the chair and massaged her forehead, \"Okay, first, we wait until Yoimon accidentally sleeps in, gets lost, or for whatever other reason- basically, he has to end up showing late for chores-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaramon nodded for Leiamon to continue, \"So, as you know, chores are rotated continually and normally assigned by dorms; that is, you, me, and everyone else in the Blueroof Dorms will be assigned and divided up among other Blueroof boarders. The same goes for the Redroofs- so normally, no matter what, Yoimon would only be working with other Redroof lodgers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then I remembered that if you show up late for your chores, you still have to report to work in the afternoon, except the work load's supposed to be a lot more than the morning chores. But the interesting thing is the workers for the afternoon chores are lumped into one big group, no matter which dorm you stay at. I think that's because pretty much everyone gets their work done in the morning, so the numbers for each dorm are much smaller in the afternoon. I guess it's so much easier to divide up a larger number for the afternoon tasks. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basically. . .\" Taramon summed up, shaking her head, \"What you're saying is if Yoimon slept in today, we should show up late, report in for afternoon chores, and do double the work. . . just so then there might be the small chance that we'd end up working with Yoimon, one out of hundreds of Digimon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon nodded, \"Well, there's always a glimmer of hope, right, Tara?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long silence before Leiamon added with a diminished voice, \"So, what do you say, Tara?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaramon cast a glance that lasted a little too long at the door, \"You know, Lei,\" she started, \"I know you put a lot of thought into this, but. . .\" she stopped, \"Well, you know, there's a lot of things that can go wrong with this,\" she stated, changing directions, as she brushed a strand of her blue hair aside with a finger, .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what?\" Leiamon implored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, for starters, Yoimon could have decided to jog a different route to work this morning,\" Taramon explained, \"And like I said before, even if all these conditions are met, the actual chances of getting to work with him are very small ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon stared back blankly, \"Oh yeah. . .\" she blushed, \"But Tara, I've been waiting days and days for even a sign that Yoimon's going to turn up late; besides, he runs down this way every time. Besides, this is the only way I'll ever get to work with Yoimon. I mean, yeah, the chances might not be great, but if it happens- that could be a great opportunity. This could be it. . .\" she sighed passionately, before clenching her fists and snapping, \"Besides, what do we have to lose, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My perfect attendance record, for one,\" Taramon joked, but her face softened as she peered back at her friend, \"Listen, Lei, I think that you're right this time, if you really like Yoimon, you should get a chance to know him; you've definitely got to make a move at him before it's too late. I suppose two or three tardy days and a little extra work wouldn't hurt you or me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Tara,\" Leimon smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon gasped as her head emerged from a fairly large crowd of young Digimon aspirants. Bewildered, she staggered away from the pile congregating around the large bulletin slate fixed on an easel that contained the work schedule for the afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Taramon asked, \"Are our names even on the list?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon took a deep breath and shrugged, much to Taramon's vexation, \"There were a lot of names; so I'm guessing the names of everyone that didn't show this morning were just cast down here as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're right,\" Taramon nodded, \"I'm also supposing the actual table is different than the morning version.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah,\" said Leiamon, \"But from what I hear, today's there's a really light work load from the norm- only three work periods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's only one more than from what we typically have,\" Taramon said, a little surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet Yoimon couldn't have picked a better day to sleep in,\" Leiamon laughed, causing Taramon to chuckle in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few moments, the crowd had dissolved and thinned up as a few took off to their respective work stations, although quite a few chose to lounge about until hours started. Leiamon and Taramon both approached the board to examine it more closely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith butterflies soaring in her stomach, Leiamon anxiously scanned the lines and columns of the chart. Tension began to well up with her, as this was the moment of truth, determining whether or not her plan would be a waste. Like Taramon had said, after all, it was a very, very small chance. . . and the chart was quite big, well over hundreds of names. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Taramon clapped a hand on her shoulder, \"Don't worry about it, Lei. I'm sure he'll be here,\" she assured her, \"And even if you don't get chores with him, we'll know where to look for him after we're done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon nodded several times over, took a nervous gulp, \"Thanks, Tara,\" she sighed, and a small, comforted smile creeping up her lips. Then, very slowly, her eyes scrolled over to the bottom of the list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yoimon'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt shot out toward her eyes like a glint of gold in a dust field. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It said, 'Yoimon!' Leiamon grinned, \"That means he's here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaramon gave Leiamon a warm smile, before saying, \"It also says we have kitchen duty together first,\" as she traced her fingers across both their names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on. . .\" Leiamon's eyes widened, the whites huge and her pupils standing small in the center. Her mouth began to fall agape, \"Did you just tell me. . . we have kitchen duty first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaramon checked over her reading once again, just to be sure, \"Yeah, at least, it says so right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's. . .\" Leiamon whispered in a hoarse yet tremendously excited voice, \"That's what. . . what. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in an instant, Leiamon had let out a cry of rejoice, and was springing off her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Yes! Yes!\" she cheered enthusiastically, thrusting a fist into the air with every 'yes' she could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately understanding, and perhaps even interpretting the screams of bliss, Taramon began to laugh, overjoyed that all had worked out fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as soon as Leiamon and her revelry started to calm down, Taramon broke out into a chuckle again as she ran across the schedule again, \"Well, Leiamon, Yoimon really DID pick the right day to sleep in. Look what he has after kitchen duty,\" she suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon was speechless and blankeyeed for a few more moments after she had read the next grid of both of their schedules, \"And then we both have dishwashing... together,\" she giggled softly, her eyes dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And apparently just the two of you alone- or at least, of that we know of,\" Taramon put in, smirking, \"During second block, I have to scrub the floors clean in some bookkeeping building.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But look,\" Leiamon put in, \"We both get to wash sheets together during the last block.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Taramon snickered, \"And will Yoimon be there too?\" she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny,\" Leiamon stated blandly, \"But, no, it doesn't look like he has chores with me during the last block.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Lei,\" Taramon said as the two headed off for their first chore, \"It looks like things are going very, very well for you so far. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a well known fact, or at least a well known fact to Taramon, that Leiamon had some interest in cooking. With the little amount of cash she could hold on to, Leiamon was able to gather up some ingredients to scrounge up a meal for herself and Taramon every now and again, cooking it all up on a small, makeshift magic fire. Even though every a warm and well-prepared meal was free, available, and waiting to be eaten by all boarders every morning, night, and afternoon, Taramon still enjoyed trying Leiamon's homemade dishes whenever she made them. . . even if she was still learning and her skills still needed refinement every now and then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what we'll end up making for kitchen duty,\" Leiamon pondered. Taramon shrugged honestly as the two crossed another street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaramon seemed to know where their assignment station was located, and the pair of friends arrived inside a large but crowded scullery. The walls seemed to be lined with polished countertops, large washbasin sinks here and there, and of course, racks hanging high above lined with pots and pans, and large bins and cabinets storing common ingredients. There were even a few doors leading to the front, a double door to the main kitchen and a few doors leading to what could only be pantries fully stocked with a variety of food and myriad of ingredients. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge number aspiring students were present, most of them were all sitting at two, long, battered, wooden tables that had been set up for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so, it was a huge room, and Yoimon could be anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you see Yoimon?\" Taramon asked her friend, competing with the collective racket of the small talk of several young Digimon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on,\" Leiamon urged as she quickly darted her eyes across the room, rapidly over the head of everyone. She shook her head, \"Not yet. He just has to be in here somewhere,\" she stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this was the only place holding kitchen duty today,\" Taramon stated as she nodded, also looking over a few faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the double doors burst open with a clatter, silencing most of the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please be seated,\" sounded a bellowing voice issuing from that direction. Immediately, Leiamon and Taramon took the closest seat they could find. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn stepped a businesslike looking Ogremon wearing horn-rimmed glasses with a white apron strapped about him. One of his long, green arms was wrapped around an enormous, steel pot almost the size of Leiamon, while the other grasped the ends of an equally large, burlap sack. It only took him a moment to reach the front of the room, and he placed the pot down in between the two tables, a peal of water licking up from it as it hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sack also fell to the ground, the Ogremon retrieved a small, white slip of paper, \"Today you will peel potatoes,\" he read frankly from the sheet, receiving a few rolling eyes and sighs, \"Each Digimon will start off with five potatoes. Each Digimon will get a towel. Each Digimon will peel potatoes with a potato peeler,\" the Ogremon read off, and continued to blandly describe the procedure on how exactly to peel a potato to his audience of roughly a hundred young Digimon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not eat the potatoes. And, as always, with any chore, do not use magic,\" he concluded before folding up the sheet and passing out the bins with the peelers to the tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon sighed before her work after she returned with five potatoes from the sack, \"I was hoping we'd actually get to make something...\" she remarked and started to idly peel away, looking around for any hide or hair of Yoimon among all the turned backs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaramon shrugged, pushing a lock of her blue hair aside, \"It figures that we have to do the preparation work for the chefs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, the five potatoes were peeled, Leiamon and Taramon walked up the aisle, dumped them into the pot, and got five more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering around on her way back, Leiamon could still only see the backs of unfamiliar heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the process was continued again and again, time and time again. As time passed, the potato skins had formed taller and taller heaps on the expanse of the towels that were presented to each worker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, the Ogremon had left for a few moments. Shortly after his departure, conversation flared and a few Digimon had gotten up to sit closer to their friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon had just finished her fifth potato and bundled them all up in her arms, \"I'll be right back,\" she told Taramon as she got up to dump the potatoes into the pot, get some more, and possibly scope out Yoimon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon turned around, looking over the backs of those seated at the table across from where she was sitting to see those facing them, trying to find Yoimon. This was really frustrating her. She had already secretly searched the row she was sitting at and the row across from her at her own table on her trips to and from the potato pot to no avail. . . Where could he be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon released her bundle of shaven potatoes into the deep waters of the big kettle and turned her glance back to her own table, slightly staggering to the side so she could get a closer look at the faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a thought flashed into her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer was just under her nose! What if she had totally missed Yoimon because she was so intent on examining everyone who was seated, and he just had simply gotten up out of his seat to deposit his potatoes? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in her thoughts, Leiamon didn't know just how right she was until it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud smack, Leiamon in her absent-minded state had just crashed and fallen right into...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A squawk followed by several thumpings noises pulled Taramon's attnetion away from peeling her potatoes to the front of the room, near the potato pot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaramon began to sweat a little as she stood up to get a better view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Lei just went over there...I hope she didn't fall into the pot..' She thought as she quickly got up and began walking over to said pot to rescue her friends from whatever predickament she had gotten herself into this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing her best to weave through the mass of digimon that had erupted, she managed to peek through several groups to try and spy her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd almost tripped in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLei was standing over someone, obviously Yoimon, looking like a criminal caught at the scen of the crime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaramon's eyebrow ticked but she smiled nonetheless as she redoubled her effort to reach her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly Leiamon could pull off such a performance with incredible odds against her and then manage to mess up in the final act. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon was rooted to the spot, completley mortified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well....I was right at least.' She told herself in consolation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoimon had indeed been bringing his potatoes up to the pot at about the same times as she had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnofrtunately, in her zeal to locate him she had kind of...knocked him over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I am SO sorry...\" Leiamon squeeked, her face crimson. She then bent down and tried to gather up Yoimon's peeled potatoes, which had taken a tumble with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching for one that had rolled under part of a table, her blush increased. She could hear stifled laughter all throughout the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...heh...don't worrry about it..\" Yoimon siad a bit dizzily as he sat up from his place on the floor. Focusing on Leiamon, he flashed her a good-natured grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For being so small you sure do pack a punch!\" Yoimon said with a chuckle before a slightly panicked look came to his face. \"Not that you're like puny or anything!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon giggled and smiled to herself at what she hoped had been a compliment. Shyly, she allowed herself a glance of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\" Taramon mewled as she struggled to get to the front of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike herself and Leiamon, most of their workmates had opted to talk, and the aisles were now sprawled with people and limbs who had gotten up to talk or had moved into a more comfortable position while their supervisor was away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, she was having a bit of a hard time. Unlike Lei, she had to worry about getting her dress snagged or dirty. It was also much harder to walk. Not to mention she was wearing heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Outta the way, Grandma.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaramon barely had time to register the voice before she was shoved into a mass of people. Ignoring the sounds of protest of the people she had been shived into, and trying to control her temper, she turned towards the voice of her attacker, now openly laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, with all those ruffles I though you would be more graceful.\" The voice remarked sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow certain of where - or who - the voice was coming from, Taramon frowned in distaste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were even more black than my friend. But at least she's clean.\" Taramon said with a sniff before rolling her eyes at her attacker in a condescending way. \"But I suppose some creatures don't have the intelligence to know what soap is. I was wondering where that stench was coming from, so know I know at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaramon was delighted with herself when she heard a growl and fully turned to glare upon her attacker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaller than here by almost one and a half heads, Taramon figured him to be a little taller than Yoimon, and like she said, he wore black like Leiamon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, instead of looking like a mage digimon specializing in dark magic, he looked similar to a back alley gangster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was wearing black boots and black jeans and also a black shirt and a small black jacket over his shirt. Everything was black, including his hair, which was tied back into a short ponytail, with the exception of a simple silver necklace he was wearing, a small silver earringfixed to one ear, and his belt- which was actually a silver chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a problem with me, Granny?\" He asked,annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaramon eyebrow twitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should be the one asking you that! You all but shoved me into those nice digimon! And my name is not Granny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, after hearing you talk for a bit, you sound more like a princess than a grandma.\" He said, smirking. \"Nice talkin'to ya, but I have to go help my friend. Some blonde klutz completly bulldozed him a second ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaramon's rage stopped a moment when he mentioned who she knew to be Lei, but quicklly recovered by takking hold of a firm grip on her attacker's necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making a strangled noise, he turned on her, a slightly startled look in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh uh uh..you're not getting away from me so easily.\" Taramon taunted. \"And for your infomration, that 'klutz' is my friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYanking away Taramon's hand from his necklace and this time looked at her if she was insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're a friend of Yoimon's then.\" Taramon stated and sighed. \"How in the world would he get to know a lowlife like you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name's Raomon, Princess!\" Taramon's attacker, now known as Raomon growled. \"And I can say the same for you. That blonde may be a klutz but I don't know how anyone could become friends with a snob like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snob?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, snob.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least I bathe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going back to syaing I stink again, huh? You must be running out of comebacks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are intolerable! You..you hooligan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again you prove that you're a grandma. Who says 'hooligan'?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaramon, massaged her temples, trying to calm herself, but was having trouble doing so. Friend of Yoimon or not, this guy was unbearable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful Granny; you might overheat you brain.\" He taunted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaramon snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, she offered Raomon one of her brightest smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right.\" She said placidly beforing eying him evilly, her smile transforming into a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me cool yours off too!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked even better close up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face, framed by brown, innocent eyes which were currently sparkling with amusement and a shock of brown hair, falling over a red hairband just short of said eyes, was alit with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up and dusting himself off, she noted his clothes, which only accentuated his features further: Wearing some faded jeans and white sneakers, as well as a sleeveless blue top shat displayed his slighlty muscled arms, he really did look like the runner she had imagined him to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep within her own musings, she had almost missed the hand he was offering her. Taking it and letting Yoimon pull her up from the floor to a standing position she smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...thank you.\" She said awkwardly. \"I really am sorry about before. And your potatoes, they're dirty. What will Professor Ogremon  or whatever he is say?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoimon was about to reply, but zoned out suddenly, his attention moving to something behind Leiamon. Turning quickly, she nearly fell over again with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take this you jerk!\" A shourt was heard throughout the room and everyone's attention, which had gradually radiated away from Yoimon and Leiamon came full circle to who Leiamon could scarcely believe was Taramon and the poor guy she just drenched with a jet of water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...my...\" Leiamon was floored for a few seconds before reality came rushing back to her along with the laughter of their workmates at the scene! \"Taramon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rao?...Oh!\" Yoimon asked outloud from beside her and began to jog over to where Taramon and the other digimon before he realized he was still holding his potatoes and quickly running back and depositing them into the pot, dirty or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then rejoined Leiamon and the two made their way over to their friends; Taramon victorious, with her hands on her hips and smiling pleasantly at who Leiamon guessed was Raomon, who was spluterring curses right and left and lokking at Taramon incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquuezing their way into the circle that had formed around their pair, Leiamon and Yoimon regarded their friends with varied approaches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taramon..Why? Um, How? When maybe..?\" Leiamon stumbled through her words. Yoimon, however, greeted his friend with more gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. She completely showed you Rao. Or should I say showered?\" Yoimon said with a chessy grin, laughing at his own joke, \"I guess you're not as bad as you think you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph.\" Raomon responded, still tryinh to shake some of the water off. \"Now I can add Witch to my list of titles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon glanced at her friend nervously, but was surprised to see Taramon only giving him a goofy smile as she held up the V for Victory sign with her right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, keep talking. I've won the round today, so whatever.\" She replied victoriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were competing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since when!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rao, don't be a sore loser.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you! I thought she knocked you over? Shouldn't you be out cold?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't talk to her like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who says I can't?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon sighed to herself and stepped back from all of the bickering for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything had worked out well....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon nearly fell down, suddenly remembering she hadn't told Yoimon her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly, she tapped him on the shoulder, ulling him out of the bickering meatch Taramon and Raomon were having. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at her questioningly and she blushed, looking down at the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way...I'm Leiamon.\" She said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoimon blinked and then broke out into a wide grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah! I'm Yoimon. Kinda weird, we forgot to tell each other our names.\" He said, scratching the back of his head and offering her another smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes...now, everything is on the right track..' Leiamon thought to herself as she and Yoi turned their attnetion back to theri friend' argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly the doors to the room opened again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay...maybe not...' Leiamon thought to herself once again and turned to see that..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The doors burst open with a bang. With that noise, the workmates scattered about the room in a mad dash back to their seats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking that as a cue, Raomon shot one last sneer out at Taramon who returned him with an intimidating glare of contempt that made both their hairs stands on end. The two then scowled in unison at each other before both tramping back to their seats at exactly the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking that as a cue, Yoimon started to make a move toward the once elusive location of his seat- but he turned and stopped suddenly, and his warm eyes were now on Leiamon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking that cue, Leiamon briefly nodded and strided forward with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on,\" stammered the Ogremon, reentering the large chamber. Pushing his thick spectacles back up, his vision focused and sharpened, and what soon came to his eyes did not impress, but then again... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his gray mane of hair, the great green Digimon took a heaving sigh. So they decided to lax off while he was gone. It wasn't really anything new to him, and he never really was in the mood for kicking anyone in shape like a few of his colleagues always seemed to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe banged his fist on a table several times, drawing the attention of at least half the populace, an accomplishment in itself, \"Alright,\" he cried, \"Make sure you all get back to work-\" With a peer back into the pot, he added, \"And there's still a lot of work to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few of the younger workers let out a deep breath of relief, only seconds earlier fearing they might all have been pummeled to death for such insolence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon apprehensively started on her first potato, hastily setting the other four off to the side. Apparently, Yoimon, who was sitting right next to her, had just done the same thing, but her eyes were glued down below, either focusing on her potato or the ancient table's grains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel her face beginning to flush scarlet and grow feverish. . . How should she start? What would she sa-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, I'm sorry if Rao was being a jerk to your friend,\" Yoimon apologized, scratching the back of his head earnestly, \"Sometimes he can be like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about it,\" Leiamon laughed, lifting her face to Yoimon's eyes, \"By the looks of it, Taramon didn't let it get to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoimon's lips smirked as he recalled the scene only moments ago, \"Yeah, she really took care of him,\" he chuckled, \"Did your friend really hit him with a water blast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon nodded, \"Yeah, Tara's been doing water magic like that for a while now- as long as I can remember at least,\" she remarked offhandedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's pretty cool... Not that many others have even started to study magic like that- nothing beyond the basic stuff we all have to study.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon's eyebrows raised as she noticed Yoimon was clearly interested by Tara's prowess, \"Oh. . . well, you know, I do magic too,\" she muttered softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Yoimon's head flinched back suddenly with astonishment, \"Really? That's awesome!\" he exclaimed cheerfully, making Leiamon smile, \"The two of you are probably way ahead of the rest of us in terms of magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we all do have our strengths,\" Leiamon stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, definitely,\" Yoimon agreed, \"I'd say that my one real strength would have to be running- I guess it might be because I have a single-tracked mind,\" he grinned sheepishly at his own pun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can tell you're really committed,\" Leiamon put in before tentatively adding, \"-because I've seen you jogging down the street a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really?\" Yoimon simpered, a light blush setting into his complexion, \"Well, I guess that would make sense- I really haven't alternated my jogging route in a while,\" he nodded, \"So, where do you live? Since you've seen me jogging, I'm probably familiar with the area.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon's lips slowly curled into a subconcious smirk of joy. Everything WAS on the right track!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Tara and I share a room in the Blueroof dorm,\" Leiamon gladly admitted, \"Our apartment's one on the second floor, and it has a patio facing the street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, then it wouldn't be that hard to scope me out,\" Yoimon responded, smiling, \"Yeah, I know where you're talking about- the Blueroof dorm's right around the end of my jogging route, although, I don't live that far off myself; I stay at the Redroof dorm, right next to the hot spring area they have there- not that many people still use it though, not after that huge bathhouse moved in down the block.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon quickly scrutinized her current potato for any remaining skin, and then set it aside with the other four, \"Wow. . . I'm through five potatoes already? That went by pretty fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time flies,\" Yoimon shrugged as he finished off what seemed to be only his second potato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon picked up her peeler again and held out her other hand, \"Here, let me help you,\" she urged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure,\" Yoimon nodded, as Leiamon went ahead and grabbed one of his potatoes. Focusing intently on the work in head of her, Leiamon's peeler gracefully, but also very carefully glided over the skin swiftly with smooth, round motions. She held the potato firmly with her free hand turned it around in turn with the peeler skinning the spud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in only less than a minute, the potato was bare, its offwhite color exposed for all the world to see and its brown skin all in one, long, winding peel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're pretty good at this,\" Yoimon acclaimed, really impressed with Leiamon's job, \"I didn't know you were so handy with a knife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I tend to work a little faster when I'm focused,\" Leiamon nodded. However, she looked a little more critically at her own work, \"Well, there still are some stray skins here and there,\" she admitted, peeling those away, \"And some skin gets buried in the deeper eyes, you have to pick those parts out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but still-\" Yoimon persisted brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" Leiamon nodded, looking at Yoimon's warm brown eyes, \"Nobody's completely perfect, and I am learning, after all,\" she adknowledged, grabbing another potato, \"Well, cooking that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cook too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" Leiamon smiled, holding up both her full hands, \"It's only something I do on the side in my free time, like a hobby,\" she said as she began to peel the new potato, \"When I heard we were going to work in the kitchen, I got a little excited. I thought we were all actually going to make something, and not just peel potatoes- I should have known we were just going to end up preparing the ingredients for the real chefs,\" she chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a water droplet fell down onto the wooden face of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon peered up from her work to see none other than Yoimon's friend, Raomon standing behind them, a little paler than before. Another bead of water formed at the tip of one of his locks of hair. His black clothes still seemed to be saturated with water; in fact, his whole body still seemed to be drenched and dripping, for the most part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey, Rao,\" Yoimon addressed his friend, \"You're still wet?\" he asked, a little incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet I'm still wet!\" he snapped. Immediately, he started to shake his head swiftly from side to side, water droplets spraying everywhere. Once he stopped, a big, fat droplet slid down one of his stray locks and splattered onto the floor. Then, he continued to shake his head from side to side, water still spraying all over the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you're getting everyone wet,\" Yoimon sighed, getting bombarded by a few dewdrops himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see?\" Raomon scowled in frustration, ringing out his slack, black shirt, heavy with water, \"I'm still wet. . . whatever I do, I can't dry myself off!\" he cried, taking a nearby towel and trying to wipe his now moist, clammy hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon gasped, her eyes widening a little as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Raomon latched onto that expression, and faced Leiamon, \"Hey, what's that? I bet you know what that's really going on here- I bet you know what that witch did to me!\" he exclaimed, launching himself towards Leiamon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Rao-\" Yoimon started, but Leiamon stood her ground and propelled herself toward Raomon's belligerant, dripping figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, she's not a witch, she's my friend- and she has a name; it's Taramon,\" Leiamon snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaomon harrumphed, \"Well, then, what did Taramon or whatever her name is do to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, obviously she didn't just spray you with water,\" Leiamon said, \"Now, I think what she did was. . . uhm,\" Leiamon stammered, \"-used a certain spell that sprayed you with water?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaomon was clearly not impressed, \"What's the difference?\" he snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, will you relax?\" asked a familiar voice, \"You might be wet and unable to dry out for now, but you should be well in an hour or two- just hope you don't catch a cold or anything in those two hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taramon,\" Leiamon nodded as she saw her best friend arrive on the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if it isn't the witch!\" the damp Digimon growled, clenching his fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoimon stepped behind him, clasping a hand on his saturated shoulders, \"She does have a point, Rao. Maybe you should just calm down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaomon gritted his teeth, \"Come on, Yoimon. We're going,\" he urged his friend on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, now wait a minute, Rao,\" Yoimon shook his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first block's going to end any minute now,\" the dripping Raomon added, \"So you might as well say your goodbyes, and I'll say my good riddances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaramon turned to face him, \"Well, I, for one, am glad to say I won't be seeing you anytime soon,\" she said saccharinely, closing her eyes and shooting him a smile just as overly sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here, witch!\" he yapped loudly, taking off, but not before adding, \"It's off to scrubbing the floors for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last inadvertantly acrid remark struck Taramon like a sledgehammer violently swinging down upon a small ceramic box labeled, 'Sanity'. As that single moment stretched exaggeratedly to an entire hour, her eyes slowly widened, bigger and whiter, the long strands of her blue hair stood on its edge, her complexion paled, and her clenched teeth gaped wider and wider in utter shock, disbelief, and terror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaramon might have just then given in and shrieked, \"WHAAAT!?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead, she shut her eyes and bit her lip, trembling while she bided her inner hysteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a loud pealing clash resounded from the front throughout the entire room. Nearly the entire room diverted their attentions to the head of the room, where their Ogremon proctor was standing. He was carrying a large wooden spoon, and had just apparently struck the suspended top of the large pot the potatoes were currently floating around in, \"Alright, then,\" he called out, \"Finish up- get your last potatoes in, clean up, wash and deposit your peelers, and proceed onto your next station.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sizable swarm of students formulated a messy procession to the front pot to set down their final potatoes, while a few others scurried around wheeling around bins to throw all the leftover potato scraps and skisn in. Once again, chaos disguised in an orderly fashion ensued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore confronting the mad mob of workmates, Yoimon turned around to face Leiamon, \"Well, it's really been nice meeting you,\" he said, \"Although, I'm sorry it kinda ended the way it did- Hey, maybe we should meet up again. That would be pretty cool,\" he suggested, making Leiamon's heart fly leaps and bounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" a vividly blushing Leiamon agreed softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, she recalled the schedule, and tapped Yoimon's shoulder before he went up, \"Wait- do you know where you're headed next? I know I'm dishwashing-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good question,\" Yoimon nodded, \"Let's see. . .\" he pondered for a few seconds, \"I think I'm dishwashing too,\" he smiled, before chuckling, \"It's kinda funny how that worked out, huh?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Leiamon blushed slighlty, glancing ever so discreetly to her left, where Yoimon stood washing and rinsing the dishes that had accumulated over the day, perhaps the last several days, before handing them offf to her to dry and stack neatly in a pile at the counter they were working at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everyone had finished putting in their potatoes into the pot in Block 1, everyone had proceeded to to meander to their second block of chores, some more enthusiastic than others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNamely, Taramon and Raomon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter discovering that they would have together, or at least be in close proximity of one another for another work period, the two had exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr rather, Raomon exploded while Taramon barely restrained herself from blasting him with another jet of water. After Ogremon had dismissed them, Taramon had left as quickly as she could in heels, which was surprisingly swift, actually, with only a brief farewell to Leiamon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others had then gradually filled out, with Yoimon and herself bringing up the rear of the pack, a distressed Raomon grumbling behind them with his hands in his pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut in the sunlight again, if only briefly, the group began to chatter away as everyone broke off into smaller clusters as they headed to Block 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon giggled to herself as she dried another dish and stacked it in with the other clean ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and Yoimon had almost gotten lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile both of them knew they had to wash dishes, they  were both unsure of which kitchen to report to, as there were countless kitchens throughout the city and the campuses of the ten temples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, they had ran into another digimon who had Dish washing duty, or actually, a friend of a digimon who had dish washing duty, who pointed out to them that Block 2 Dish washing was held at the kitchen in an off campus administration building of the Temple of Steel, one of many in the city that answered questions of aspiring students concerning various matters about the Temple they represented as well as tested the abilities of said aspiring students. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such, in addition to those who worked there, off campus administration buildings also operated small dorm buildings(usually marked with the clor or symbol of a Temple) to house students who were oficially being looked over and tested by the Temple of which the administation building belonged to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis in turn, prodcued a lot of dishes, with aspiring students coming and going at random times and comsuming what they could when they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you don't want me to wash the dishes Yoimon?\" Leiamon asked, noting that Yoimon's hands had beocme a bit...pruned. \"I really don't mind. I mean, usually Taramon washes dishes at the dorm, but I know how to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoimon chuckled and smiled at her amiably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries. I'm used to it by now. Raomon cooks in our dorm, and I'm the one usually washing dishes.\" He said with a sigh. \"Of course...he's never let me cook anything since that one time I tried to make sashimi and it ended up tasting all sugary...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon went rigid and chuckled nervously for a second, before looking at Yoimon to see that he wasn't joking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe...well then...I guess he does have a point there...\" She muttered awkwardly as she went back to drying dishes, then glancing around to take in the kitchen they were working in more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, she'd seen better kitchens. Actually, the Temple of Steel wasn't exactly her favroite temple o begin with. Everything about it wreeked or...order. And everything was cold and impersonal, or so she heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she were to use their kitchens as evidence, it was probably true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitchen in this administration building, one representinhg the Temple of Steel, was the definition of cold and impersonal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor was of a stark, white tile that stretched the length of the kitchen, which was quite long indeed. Light was provided by stiff, chrome fixtures affixed to the ceiling every few feet down the center of the kitchen, over various island counters that stood in the center as preparation areas while counters on either side of the central island countertops provided additional workspace as well as locations for appliances, such as stoves and refrigerators, and of course the sinks the Block 2 workers were using for dishwashing duty. The only windows in the room were placed high on the wall, unreachable and, Leiamon ventured, unopenable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to her work, Leiamon shivered. This was not what a kitchen should be like. There was no way she, at least, could cook in such a stifling environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing her eyes, she brought up one of her fonder memories of cooking in Taramon and her own dorm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon sighed to herself deeply, breathing in the rich smell of the spaghetti simmering on the stove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, she wiped her hands on her apron before brushing away a few drops of sweat on her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Spring, and everyone had been excited to finally be able to get outdoors again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its almost ready Tara!\" She called with a smile, sticking her head around the corner to where she could see out the front door, where Taramon was diligently watering her flowerbed, nurturing the small buds that would bloom in a few weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friend turned to her and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Lei! You know how I love your cokking! I'm almost done here, I'll be in soon!\" Her friend replied before turning back to her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and your flowers, Taramon.\" She said, before returning to stir her spaghetti somewhere, ocassionally glancing out the window, down at the busy streets below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of students or those aspiring to be students running around and laughing, the shouts of vendors selling various odds and ends, and the occasional magical sounds lifted her spirits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as enlightening as her spaghetti was tasty, if she did say so herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure said spaghetti was in no danger of burning, she stuck her head out the window and took in a deep breath of fresh air, scented by the blooming of fresh spring flowers and was delighted in the cool breeze against her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a beautiful day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance the waters of the Temple of Water could be seen glittering in the sunlight, the turrets of the Temple of Light matching theier brilliance in the east. To the north, the forests that marked the campus of the Temple of Wood were swaying in the gentle breeze, a vivid emerald color with the return of spring. Even the Temple of Ice, which she had seen earlier in the day to the south, was shining  stupendously today, even though its patron season had given way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the sky!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so perfectly blue today, not a cliud to be seen in any direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her eyes to the street, Leiamon noted that the people were as joyous as the Temples seemed, and their actions reflected the sounds she had heard earlier. Everyone was meandering along or having gun or selling their wares with a smile on their face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm so glad I'm here.' Leiamon thought. 'I'm so happy that I can...wait...who's that guy? he's moving pretty fast.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon leaned down out of the window a bit more, to catch someone bobbing and weaving through the crowd with a runner's pace, far faster than anyone else on the street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Is he...working out?' Leiamon noted, absently notcing that this digimon was quite slim, if not muscled, and as he came closer, she noticed he was quite handsome too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis brown, chocolate hair fluttering a bit in the breeze where it wasn't a bit dampened from sweat, was held back by a red hairband. He was indeed quite fit and was dressed for running, and powered his way down the busy street with a confident stride, yet was always careful to never bump into anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wow...he's really...cute...' Leiamon barely heard herself think as she leaned out of the window further as the mystery runner came closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloser...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloser......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloser.........<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lei!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon blushed, coming back to the present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been at that point that she had almost fallen out of the window. Luckily, Taramon had just came into the kitchen and caught her friend before she tumbled down out into the street, possibly on who she now knew as Yoimon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That would have been a fantastic way to meet...\" Leiamon thought sarcastically. 'Hi, I'm Leiamon. Sorry about falling on you from a two-story window. I was entranced by your beaughty.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had been...what? A little over a year ago? Time had really flown since then. Here she was, lessthan three feet away from the digimon she had admired from a distance for so long, and they were actually speaking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leiamon?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep!\" Leiamon squeeked, brought out of her thoughts by Yoimon's voice, and glanced at him shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that she had been daydreaming, he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lei, I THINK that one dish is dry now...in fact, I've never seen one more clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon blinked, then looked to her hands to discover that she had been polishing the same dish for quite a while now and a fairly sized stack had piled up during her daydreaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah!\" She exclaimed, putting the dish she had been holding onto the stack of clean dishes and resuming her task with a renwed passion. \"Oh, if I don't hurry, I won't catch up! Oi!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoimon laughed heartily again and waited a few minutes for her to catch up to him before resuming his own job of washing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You looked really spaced for a second there.\" He noted with a grin. \"What were you thinking of?...Er, that is if you don't mind me asking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon giggled as he hastily added that last part and then smiled serenely to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...was thinking of the first time I saw someone..\" She said dreamily, catching Yoimon's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" He asked, looking at her awkwardly from the sides of his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded and gazed out the window, small as it was, but delighted that she could still see the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little over a year ago. The sky was so blue that day...so blue.\" Leiamon mumbled dreamily to herself. \"And my spaghetti was good too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to her, Leiamon hadn't noticed, but Yoimon had jumped a bit at the mention of spaghetti and the pretty day a year or so ago, and now wore a slightly shocked expression on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he too, smiled and the pair continued their chore of washing and drying dishes as sunlight was calmly filtered into the room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You know,\" Yoimon started tentatively and a bit softly, breaking the few minutes where scrubbing and running water were the only noises to be heard, \"A little bit more than a year or two ago, I guess something happened to me that changed my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Leiamon asked, now interested, prompting him to continue while staying intent on the dish in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoimon nodded, \"Yeah. . . that was the first time I saw the Ayzahn Ra Marathon for real,\" he muttered lowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. . .\" Leiamon looked out the slim window. She could remember all the fuss about that big race taking place in the city just fine. But why wasn't she there to see it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad that been one of the days when she geniunely overslept and had to miss out on the day's festivities to do chores in the afternoon? How ironic would that be? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she was busy with something else at the time. . . Had it been one of those occasional instances where she been training with her mentor?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it's really a big deal to be a top runner in the Marathon- you have to have a lot of guts to hold your own for that amount of distance, \" Yoimon stated, \"The course's supposed to be long and challenging, and the competition's wild- hundreds, maybe even thousands enter, but still, time after time, dozens make it through. . . and on that day, I saw the winner burst through the finish line, and collapse to the ground wearing the biggest grin I've ever seen, just before every one else came crashing through. . . \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoimon paused, before shaking his head in disbelief moments later, \"He must have been the happiest guy in the world...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After I saw that race, I became determined to run the next time it was held. That's when I started taking my training and running more seriously,\" Yoimon nodded as he finished washing the last dish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, at that moment, he froze, staring back at the opaque reflection the soapy-film covered plate sent back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\". . . I guess I've come a long way since that day, years ago,\" Yoimon stated softly before a firm grin appeared on his face and a low chuckle started to resound from his mouth, \"Wow. . . I can remember my first week out running like it was only a month ago or something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon could tell just by looking at the growing smile and subconcious chucklings that ensued that Yoimon was taking another trip down Memory Lane. . . or, maybe another run down one of Ayzahn Ra's streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Yoimon's eyes darted from the plate to look to Leiamon. \"Hey, you know the street right outside the dorms' area, the one with the bakery on the corner?\" Yoimon asked her, a little bit excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Leiamon nodded, an image of the bakeshop immediately popping into her mind, \"How couldn't I? I pass by it almost every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoimon's brown eyes seemed to be laughing and he peered at her, almost emitting high spirits from the place he stood, \"Well. . . wanna hear something embarrassing?\" he inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon almost shivered with excitement; now he wanted to let her in on a little secret, \"Sure!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not that many people know this,\" Yoimon began very calmly, before taking a brief pause, \"When I first starting taking my morning runs, well- this is kind of embarassing. . . every morning, as I made the turn around the corner, I bolted smack into the bakery signpost on the corner!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright blush now spread through his complexion, yet a small smile still remained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I kept on getting hit in the head by that bakery sign every single morning- it must have been hanging too low or short, or maybe it was even out of my line of sight...  But when I made that same turn every morning, I always never saw it coming or even remembered why my head was sore. . .\" Yoimon shook his head incredulously and chuckled again, \"Man, I really got some nasty bruises on my head, all from that sign.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stacked up the last dish, Yoimon nodded again, shaking away any further reminiscings before stating, \"Every day, I stretch and run my routes around blocks of the city, anywhere around town- sometimes, I even go through parts of the route that the Marathon has used in the past, just to get familiar,\" he admitted before adding softly, \"I guess you could say it's my dream to one day make it into the Marathon and come out on top.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon noticed that even among a sheepish expression and an increasingly deep blush, Yoimon's eyes had a tone of firm determination and resolve within them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yoimon, that's great!\" Leiamon piped in, blushing a little herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shucks,\" Yoimon muttered, his blush becoming even more vibrant, as he snatched a towel and subconciously dried the plate he just washed, \"It's kinda dumb, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Leiamon shook her head, \"Yoimon, I think that's great,\" she repeated again, \"You shouldn't give up on it or be ashamed if that's your dream,\" she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Yoimon asked, looking at her, \"Thanks, Leiamon,\" he said, softly, taking another dish to dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft silence came, and their blushes started to subside and transform into warm, genunine smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after Leiamon and Yoimon, who had chosen to lend a helping hand, had just barely finished drying the teetering tower of dishes to dry, the twosome were dismissed off to Block 3.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the last set of dishes, the pair had already discussed the final block. Perhaps it was not only Leiamon's disappointment when they exchanged the fact that they wouldn't be working together for the remainder of the work day. Yoimon had to go cut firewood for some temple's hearths and furnaces that night, even though it was the beginning of summer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Leiamon couldn't join him, as she had to go wash sheets with Taramon, who she had planned to meet up with at the bookkeeping building where said best friend was washing floors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she had passed this way with Yoimon before entering the cold confines of the Temple of Steel's campus adminstration building, Leiamon was still surprised to see the stark differences between the inside and outside of the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe campus itself was located a short distance from the main core of the city, a much more calm and quiet area where students in question could perform at their peak. Leiamon guessed that other adminstration buildings had similar locations, but she knew for sure that the Temples themselves were much more distant, and much, much more grand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the two had emerged through the polished steel double doors that swung heavily behind them, they could sense the thick, muggy atmosphere around them. Those same skies that Leiamon recalled were so blue seemed a bit more somber than before, as a dim, smoky cloud passed over the sun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to rain in a while,\" Leiamon noted as the duo found themselves at a busy crossway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, well, I guess this is where we part ways?\" Yoimon said hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" Leiamon said reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I just want you to know. . .\" Yoimon started before taking a deep breath, \"That I really enjoyed talking to you, and. . . uhm, well. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh- never mind. It was nothing, really,\" Yoimon dismissed hastily, before taking a look at her and sighing again. \"I had a great time talking to you today, and well, I wouldn't mind it if we met up again. You know, we don't live too far apart, and I'd really like to get to know you better.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came a pause that seemed way out of proportion for both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'll try to keep in touch,\" Leiamon smiled softly, knowing that she'd do a lot more than 'try'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool,\" Yoimon nodded, turning hesitantly as he walked down the path, \"So, uhm, I guess I'll see you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon returned the nod and couldn't hold back a soft giggle, \"See you soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Leiamon watched Yoimon break into a jog, and after a few moments, he was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I don't hurry up, I will be late for Block 3 after all!\" Leiamon thought to herself as she frantically sped down the busy, puddled streets of Ayzahn Ra, \"And not to mention soaked...\" .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must have took a wrong turn somewhere. \"I've lived here for as long as I can remember, I can't be lost,\" Leiamon reassured herself. Even though she had resided in Ayzahn Ra for seemingly forever, this was a sector of the city Leiamon didn't frequent as much, so as a result, not everything was as familiar to Leiamon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still,\" Leiamon thought offhandedly, \"This place is a little far off for doing chores. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, Leiamon pressed on, keeping in mind the advice a vendor had given her a few blocks down, underneath a large wooden umbrella. After a little explanation, Leiamon found out that the vendor had seen a large herd of students-in-training stampeding off to the East Sector of the city to go wash floors in East Central Library, one of the largest in Ayzahn Ra, as it was well overdue for cleaning. Leiamon was only a little familiar with the area in general, and needed directions to get to the library, to which the vendor gladly helped her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne more turn, and Leiamon found herself at one of Ayzahn Ra's smaller plazas. Sturdy benches were to be found on all sides. A fountain with running water in beautiful arcs and streams was to be found in the center of the cobblestoned open square, faithfully spouting water in spite of the light shower from above. Here and there, a few odd peddlers were stationed, mainly selling used books, Leiamon noted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, Leiamon's eyes widened as she looked up and saw twin sets of marble staircases directly climbing up a short hill that flattened out into a terrace; resting on this was very large library sweeping up several stories. Even though it was fairly high up and a slight walking distance away, Leiamon could still spot it among the few shops and stalls in the plaza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This must be it,\" Leiamon told herself as she started towards the stone flight of stairs closest to her. Taking a guess, Leiamon had some time on her hands, about a little more than an hour, so she really wasn't in a hurry. Although, if she could find Taramon soon, then maybe the twosome would make it to their final chore, worry free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting heavily, Leiamon brushed her shoes against the carpet at the library's entryway. It had really started to downpour on her ascent up the stairs, and an image of the drenched Raomon came to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at least her final job of washing sheets was one that involved water as well. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, Leiamon opened the inner doorway of the library at once, and was swept away by its lofty, flat ceiling that arched formidably over a vast array of almost equally tall bookshelves. Even more alarming was the carved sign that read 'Ground Floor,' in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must have been bigger inside than it was outside!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to wait around or waste any more time, Leiamon trudged off, determined to find her friend on her own within the next handful of minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering outside the deep-set window, Leiamon shook her head in pure disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had already stopped raining already and the sky was clearing up. . . Already she had spent more than two handfuls of minutes and then some, and still, she had found no progress in locating Taramon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren't in any of the lengthy stretches of bookcases, lined with ladders and stuffed with all kinds of thick, leatherbound volumes, thin paperbacks, manuscripts, new magazines, ancient scrolls, and mysterious looking boxes alike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren't tidying up the rows of desks in alcoves. They weren't cleaning the desks used for studying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a single slacker was relaxing on any cushioned sofas or chairs in one of the reading rooms, but an elderly Digimon had decided to fall asleep, face forward into his book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNor were any of them to be found mopping the hallways leading from any one of these rooms to any other. And she hadn't even begun to cover anything past the second floor, let alone even venture down the spiraling staircases to the lower levels!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This might take a while. . .\" Leiamon sighed to herself as she marched back down to the chamber she had originally entered at first, and waited in front of an old, sturdy looking counter that must have been sitting there for the past three hundred years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilting her head up, Leiamon peered around, looking for any signs of librarians or even just assistance in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments passed, and still nobody came, aside from the occasional Digimon busy browsing the aisles or skimming a thick book<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is enormous, they could be anywhere,\" Leiamon scowled at her abysmal situation, before a sharp twist came to mind, \"Or Taramon could have even left by now. . . Maybe she's looking for me, wondering where I could have run off to.\" Leiamon tapped her forehead ungently and let out a deep breath of frustration. . . was she even supposed to be here in the first place? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, could I help you?\" asked a nearby, seasoned-looking Digimon carrying a sizable bundle of books, leaning down to glare at her suddenly. His manueverings across the floor were mysteriously adroit and scurrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" Leiamon smiled sheepishly, \"Hi, I'm looking for a group of-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwiftly, the Digimon shifted the weight of all the books over to one arm as he freed his other and raised a sole finger, \"Shh. . . please try to remember that this is a library, after all,\" he tried to explain as quietly and as polite as he could, keeping his voice at a crisp rustle that barely could reach Leiamon's hearing, let alone any of the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm,\" Leiamon stammered before lowering her voice, \"I'm looking for a group of students-in-training that were sent to clean the floors of this library. Did you happen to see them? Could you please tell me where they are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knowledgable looking Digimon lowered his head and hunched shoulders and scratched it with his free hand, \"Now, let's see,\" he breathed lightly, \"Oh yes, that's right, they were supposed to come around sometime this month. . . and it's about high time they got here; this place hasn't seen anyone take a mop to the floor who was really serious about it in, well, probably half a century.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecoiling at bit at the suggested timespan, Leiamon sighed, \"So you haven't seen them around, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" the Digimon answered honestly, \"But I do pay attention to the happenings of this library. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to my irration, I've heard the hastening footsteps of what could only be hopeful young Digimon, who would otherwise have no business or desire to be here, scampering up and down the stairs in my rounds- even they can remember that this is a library, after all, and silence must be paramount. . .\" the Digimon shuddered. \"Thank goodness they should be done and dismissed out in no less than a half an hour,\" he said in his clipped, faint voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Under half an hour? Well, thank you,\" Leiamon said as the Digimon nodded and crept off, journeying down a long aisle to do his business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Under half an hour. . .\" Leiamon repeated to herself, thinking of all the time she had to spend until then. Well, she could leave the library and wait outside for Tara. . . the place did give off a little bit of an eerie touch. . . but then again, that very feeling and mystery of what might be out there waiting for her crept down her spine, teased her fascinations, and made her all the more interested to stay and look at some of the vast oceans of books belonging to the ancient edifice. . . at least until Tara showed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like we're almost finished,\" Taramon muttered to herself, washing away the accumulated dust and dirt of a decade or two off the stone floor, taking immense care not to soil or soak her dress. A few others had just now started to pack up their materials and take leave. \"Although, even I have to admit, this really has taken a long time,\" she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had sure been in there for quite a while. . . probably because it was a smaller group of workers divided up throughout the expansive library with at least the intent of tidying it up, probably something that hadn't been attempted in at least a lifetime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for her, Taramon had yet to see neither hide nor hair of that arrogant Raomon since they broke off into groups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully, his group's done and all over with, Taramon thought to herself, shaking her head at the mere thought of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good riddance,\" she muttered bitterly under her breath as cautiously knelt down to polish off the very last bit of grimy floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Taramon had spoken too soon. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne second, Taramon was on her knees, vigorously scrubbing. . . and the next, there came a firm push from behind, and she knocked to the ground and sent sliding down the saturated stone hallway, which was both soapy and dirty at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a splash, her arm crashed into the corner of a wall. Shock spread throughout her body from the impact as the water droplets slid down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smallest chuckle sounded down the hall as Taramon braced herself from the shock and picked herself up. As she steadily rose to her feet, Taramon gazed down at her now dripping dress, the front of which had been entirely drenched. To add to that, black smears of grime streaked across her once nice clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she slowly turned her head upward, Taramon's eyes were overshadowed by her dripping locks of hair before they burst into flame and started to glare directly down the hall, searching toward the only one who could possibly be responsible for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer icy eyes peered down the hall, but Taramon only saw nothing a sparkling clean hallway, a staircase bound downwards, and a few other workmates finishing up the job, packing up their materials. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her ears revealed to her the screechy sounds of wet, boots that were, no doubt, black, scrambling frantically down a flight of stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScowling loudly, she deftly slammed away her sponge, and dumped her bucket violently into a large pot of dirty water, and quickly pursued his lead, stomping down the flight of stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** <br>\r\nA quick scan of faded gold-leaf titling suddenly recalled the memories Leiamon had just shared with Yoimon earlier, once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Leiamon grabbed another thick-bound book from the shelf that was so heavy, it required the usage of both her arms and a little bit of sweat, \"This entire book is all on how to prepare pasta to perfection?\" she alliterated, as she skimmed over a few pages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head in disbelief, Leiamon returned the wide book to its original postion on the shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis place is amazing, Leiamon thought to herself. Over the past twenty minutes or so that she had been waiting for Tara, Leiamon had been practically poring over the writings, and staring in awe at the sheer volume the library had acquired. Now that she had the time, she could finally take a moment and appreciate it all. . . and notice all of the cookbooks and spellbooks among other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is really incredible, Leiamon thought- even though she wasn't known to be the biggest bookworm, she did have a yen for cooking, and when it came to magic, well, she was next to Tara, going above and beyond her own level and making sense of how she could get it to work in her own life. The two sometimes bought such books that they could use later on with spare money at the market district every now and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd imagine all this at our disposal, Leiamon sighed taking a look at the already seemingly infinite hallways of shelves soaring to a high ceiling. And this is just the first floor. . . I wonder what might be on the others, or in the basement floors, Leiamon thought steathily, or any secret floors, areas that only select personel are allowed in, and only choice members of the most elite Temple students are allowed to even think about reading a word from. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon rustled her hair briefly. That was her speculations getting to her, if not anything else, then her imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even still, she thought, I'm probably not supposed to be here in the first place. . . I don't see any other trainees in here checking out books or reading, and that Digimon from before seemed pretty disturbed to see anyone half-grown set foot within a mile of the premises. He was so worked up just because of the nois-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, an echoing stomping sounded off distantly behind Leiamon that suddenly grew louder and louder; they footsteps that seemed to be bounding down a staircase frantically, jumping down two steps at a time to escape, or perhaps pursue something, or someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly twisting around, Leiamon's eyes looked out to a staircase which had its flight worked into a wall. . . The echoes became clearer, crisper, and louder, and suddenly, there came a clap as whoever was bolting down the stairs suddenly emerged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon's eyes widened as she saw it was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Leiamon blinked, watching as Raomon scrabled down the remainder of the stairs, his black boots squeeking as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked as if he was on the run from the devil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raomon?\" Leiamon voiced as the black-clad digimon raced past her, seemingly not noticing her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back, Raomon shot Leiamon an urgent look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! Gotta run! No time for-\" He began, but was suddenly cut off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHA!\" A loud shout was emitted throughout the library, one that Leiamon was sure would make the older digimon she had seen earlier jump, either from surprise or indignance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpinning, Leiamon caught sight of her friend, only not quite as...clean as she had last seen her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaramon in question was hurrying down the last few stairs, a murderous look in her eyes, which were overshadowed by her dripping and unkept bangs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daaamn...\" Leiamon muttered, and turned again to give Raomon, who appeared to be frozen with fear, a pitied look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn't last long, however, as the prankster muttered a few choice words before turning heel and running- no sprinting- for his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Raomon, what's the matter? A big, strong, masculine digimon such as yourself running away from a little, helpless digimon like me?\" Taramon taunted, a smirk coming to her face as the evil glint in her eyes only increased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping ever so slowly, Raomon swished around and gave the bluenette a wary look. Taramon's smirk widened to show her teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon mentally smacked herself, having long stepped to the side to ensure her own safety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Idiot.' She thought, 'Should have kept running while you had the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwiftly, in one speedy motion, Taramon had brought down her left arm to point at Raomon with her index and middle mingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at her oddly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the example of her left arm, Taramon then brought down her right, only this arm was balled into a fist. Slowly, she began to pull her right arm back to herself as her eyes narrowed in on Raomon. A light blue glow began to swim around her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon chuckled to herself. He was going to learn the hard way...again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing danger, Raomon had turned to run again and was nearly to exit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, before he could reach his salvation, Taramon uncurled her right fist, unleashing her attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frozen Spray!\" Leiamon's roomate shouted, sending an array of swift, arrow-like jets of water at Raomon, or rather, Raomon's feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the jets of water hit Raomon, he stopped and stumbled slightly, most likely taken aback by the low temperatures of the jets now covering his feet and legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttempting to recover himself, Raomon again made a a mad dash for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly he couldn't. The icy jets Taramon had shot at him had encased his feet and some parts of his legs in just that: ice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice shot, Tara.\" Leiamon remarked somewhat hesitantly from her spot on the sidelines. She may have been Taramon's friend, but that by no means measnt that she was any less susceptable to one of her fits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to see Leiamon for what seemed to be the first time, the rage slowly ebbed from Taramon's eyes and she issued a deep sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My marskmanship was off. I was aiming higher.\" Taramon replied, sashaying over to her prisoner, looking all the part of a princess at a ball, despite her disheveled state. \"And it's been a while since I've fused elements. I'm surprised I pulled it off as well as I did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Higher?\" Raomon squeeked as Taramon approached him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon mentally raised her eyebrow at a squeek coming from Raomon. It would have been kind of cute had Raomon been in a different position than his current one and had she not been completely and utterly devoted to Yoimon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaramon cackled to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes. I'm sure you know where.\" She said with a laugh before eyeing him as a rather hungry cat eyes a rather plump mouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaomon gulped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's with the ice anyway? I thought you were a water mage?\" Raomon asked, attempting to wiggle himself free from the ice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara snorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please. Even someone like you knows you can fuse elements. That was an Ice and Water fusion spell, obviously. And I specialize in water magic. That doesn't mean I can't wield any of the others. In fact, I can wield all of the elements to some extent with the exception of Earth. But REALLY, how hard is it to figure out? I mean its basically common knowledge. Why I'll have you know that...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon massaged her temples as Taramon began to rant and sat down in one of the chairs she was thankful that lined the room. She suddenly had a headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Taramon didn't hurry up lecturing Raomon, they were all going to be late to 3rd Block. And then they would probably have to do afternoon chores again tomorrow. And it wouldn't be fun without at least having the prospect of perhaps being working in a block with Yoimon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head was pounding now. 'Gee...this was sudden.' Leiamon though to herself, the mental process causing her to wince as glancing in Taramon and Raomon's direction. They came through as blurry blobs. Despite her sudden headache, she could barely hear their bickering voices. 'At it again I see.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiamon blinked, adjusting her eyesight. Had it gotten darker? No, everythig was gray. And where was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing arounf as her eyes gradually got used to the surroundings, she found herself to be on a balcony...or the ruins of one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait...balcony?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sharp intake of breath elicited her reaction as reality crashed down onto her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't Leiamon, she was Beliamon. Leiamon was dead. She died quite a while ago. She wasn't with Raomon or Taramon. They were dead too. Everyone was dead. Even the city was dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beliamon? Sheesh, what's wrong with you? You'd think screaming in your ear would work...\" Someone muttered from beside her, shocking her a tad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to see...Kouji? Yes Kouji. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head wearily, Beliamon mentally noted to guard herslef more closely from now on. These visions were stirring up memories that were better left forgotten, especially now when she couldn't afford any weaknesses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Beliamon?\" Kouji asked again, looking at his captor with a look mized between worry and suspicion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it isn't my favorite little human.\" Beliamon joked, smiling sweetly. \"But on to business, do you need anything?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji blinked at her as if she had grown another head...or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I was just...seeing...if you were alive.\" He remarked rather blandly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alive? Well, duh? I look alive don't I? At least I hope I do.\" Beliamon retorted, shifting to give herself a look here and there. As she did so she noted quite a bit of stiffness in her bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah....you LOOK alive, but you sure weren't acting alive up until a few seconds ago.\" Kouji said as he gave her a poke, just to make sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that.\" Beliamon chastised, swatting him away. \"And what do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...when I found you you were sitting here, straight as a board, staring into space...or lack there of.\" Kouji said, gesturing towards the balcony's grand view of the non-existant sky.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...was?\" Beliamon asked rather sheepishly. Yep. Reeeally needed to stop having vision...flashback..thingies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji only nodded as if he was telling a toddler that the sky was blue. Which would be true in most places, with the exception of Ayzahn Ra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head again, Beliamon sighed heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that explains the stiffnes at least.\" She remarked before glancing at her 'prisoner' again. \"But then...why were you looking for me? I thought you were asleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Kouji's eyes widened and he blushed slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well I woke up a while ago and wondered where you were. Its not like you to stay in one place for a long time, at least I don't think it is.\" Kouji mumbled as he rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. \"And I was kind of...alittle bit..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Beliamon prompted, but delighted that he had been concerned for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I was wondering...if...you had any snacks.\" Kouji admitted, and shouted when Beliamon stared at him in shock. \"What?! Is it against the law for a guy to have a midnight snack around here?! I mean, not that you can even tell if its midnight or not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon's shocked visage was soon replaced by one of happiness as she smiled and gave his knee a quick pat, resisting to instead pet his paunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha! I knew you'd see it my way sooner or later, Kouji!\" She shouted in happiness, jumping up from the bench and quite a few of her bones popping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her, he only sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, joy. Another chance for you to feed me and fulfill you duties to your employer. Like I need it. My clothes can't take much more.\" Kouji said, standing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExaming him, Beliamon got a good look at the boy and chuckled mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis clothes sure didn't leave much rom for thought, at least. The yellow shirt that Jouji wore under his jacket clearly outlined his expanding belly in addition to the twin indentations that indicated the started of breasts; and this was standing up. Beliamon imagined that his form's appearance must give him constant distress when he's sitting down or lounging. In addition to this, Beliamon also noted that his pants appeared a bit snug in the rear, not to mention that the boy was tugging at the seems quite a bit now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough....his progress still dwarfed that of his friends. Something had to be done about that. It was a shame Kouji actually exercised self-restraint when it came to food, unlike the others, especially the noisy one and the small child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling nervously, Beliamon tugged Kouji off of the balcony and back into the hall, this time taking a side route in which she believed would deposit them near the kitchen, where she had stashed her food supplies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Kouji, you're just bloated. And don't worry about your appearance. I honestly still don't know why you do.\" She said, making a turn into a darker hallway and breaking out her ball of flame for light as she did so. At least the trance she had been in had seemed to have regenerated her magic energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could almost feel Kouji roll his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you don't take into account the many health detriments, there is the fact that...that no one makes fun of thin people...\" Kouji retorted, ending a bit weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing this, and resisting the urge to question Kouji, Beliamon continued on her trek to the kitchens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...its not like I'm aiming to make you the size of a whale, Kouji. If that's what you're thinking, you're wrong. I'm only plumping you up. You're not going to die because of that.\" She chuckled. \"You'll just be a bit more round. I find nothing wrong with that. And as far as scorn is concerned, you have friends. Friends that, if my guess is correct will stand by you through anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji raised an eyebrow at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would you know anything about the others? And I even really known them that long either.\" He countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I've been watching them, Kouji. Or rather, I've had people watching them for me. They're hearts are pure. They've accepted you. All you have to do is accpet them.\" Beliamon continued talking, knowing this was a serious subject for Kouji but trying to keep the tone of their conversation carefree and light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, I find it hard to believe you've been watching them. Secondly, I find it even harder to believe that you could know that they;re good people.\" He remarked. \"Zoe, the girl, she's conceited. J.P, the big guy, he's arrogant. Tommy, the kid is a crybaby. And Takuya, he's a loudmouth, a hothead, and is sometimes more of a kid than Tommy, among other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon sighed tiredly as the pair rounded another corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you Kouji are insecure, self-consious, and unwilling to trust. That doesn't make you a bad person now does it? Nor does it make you a bad friend.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the only sound within the Temple of Light's corridors were the sounds of footsteps and the quiet crackle of of Beliamon's sphere of fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would you know?\" Kouji asked suddenly, breaking the silence, and in the dim light, Beliamon smiled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I once had friends similar to yours. There was a girl, my best friend, a bit conceited, but she had a good heart. A loudmouth who got himself into trouble a lot, eveen with his best friend occasionally, but was loyal to all those he considered friends. A small one who knew little of the world and its cruelty, and was often victim of it, but continued to hope and live with a heart filled with with happiness on the days where the skies were a brilliant blue. And...\" Beliamon trailed off suddenly. \"I'm sorry...I'm rambling aren't I? We're almost to the kitchens. Then we can get you that snack.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they abandoned you, didn't they?\" Kouji asked, an edge to his voice. \"Your 'so-called' friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSiddenly, Beliamon stopped and the pair stood still in the hallway, their shadows on the walls dancing softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Beliamon turned to Kouji, and he was surprised when she offered him a smile paired with a gaze that screamed of sorrow and ached with unshed tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid the opposite occured.\" she spoke quietly. \"They died protecting me and this city. In the end, it was I that abandoned them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Beliamon quickly resumed her walk towards the kitchens. For a few moments her footsteps were the only ones sounding before they were again joined by Kouji's. Both of them stayed silent from that point on, however. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji was dodging left and right as Beliamon threw things from the cabinets in the kitchen with abandon, nearly getting hit in the head every few seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving to the kitchens, Beliamon had dissipated the somewhat stifled atmosphere they had incurred by cheerily asking him what he was in the mood for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaught off guard by her sudden mood swing, though he really shouldn't be by now, he had replied something sweet. In turn, his captor had begun haphazardly tossing things from shelves and cuphoards in her search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I KNOW I picked up candy! Cookies at least! Aha! Come to mama! Oh wait. No, that's a box of crackers. And this? What's this? This isn't even marked?\" Beliamon muttered to herself as she chucked said items over her shoulder and nearly at Kouji. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing heavily, she removed herself from the storage units and put her arms on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to Kouji, she smiled cheesily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I forgot where I put all the prepackaged stuff...\" She said weakly and straightened herself. \"I kinda planned on cooking your meals. And I didn't plan on many snacktimes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you really do that far too often.\" Beliamon noted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. What I don't understand is if you're job is to fatten me up, why don't you just do it? I'm pretty much defenseless you know.\" He remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon sighed. He was full of questions tonight, that's for sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its...kind of complicated. As you know I work for Cherubimon who works for Lucemon...basically. I think. And Cherubimon commanded I...well, you know do what I'm doing. BUt I like what I'm doing. As in I like putting weight on digimon...er people. Things, let's just say things....no. Humanoid type digimon and now humans. But only to a certain extent That works. However, I don't like working for Cherubimon. In lamens terms, I'm doing something I like for somebody I don't like. But even if I didn't like what I'm doing, I'd be forced to do it. So I'm kind of a prisoner too. Sort of. Did that help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji gave her a look and she sighed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mainly, know this: I'm not a bad guy, Kouji. If anything, I'm a pawn.\" She said tiredly, returning to rummaging for something sweet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...so I'm your prisoner, and your Cherubimon's prisoner, making us both his prisoners. But since Cherubimon is working for Lucemon...and I'm just believing you on the premise he even exists..so we're REALLY...Lucemon's prisoners?\" Kouji asked, unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me!\" Beliamon exclaimed from her current spot within a walk-in cuphoard. \"Grah! THat's it! I'm baking cookies! Forget finding the already made ones, for now at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...if we're BOTH prisoners...\" Kouji mumbled to himself as Beliamon exited the cuphoard with materials for baking snickerdoodles in hand. \"Why don't we both just leave?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...because Cherubimon would kill us? Well, kill you. Technically, I would be deleted. But that's basically being killed.\" Beliamon replied, setting her supplies down on an island counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...you DO know that the group I was apart of before you so visciously kidnapped me was working to get rid of Cherubimon, and I guess, ultimately Lucemon, right?\" Kouji asked, coming over to her with a raised eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...you DO know that Cherubimon would kill you and your little friends like the insignificant bugs at his feet you are, right? Plus, Lucemon could be revived at anytime. It took the power of ten Mega level digimon then, in addition to their followers, to only SEAL Lucemon. Now, half of the remains, well more than half, are in the hands of children, yes, children, while the other half have been corrupted by Cherubimon, and I hate to sound repetitive, but ultimately Lucemon. AND, the other two Great Angel Digimon, Serapimon and Ophanimon are currently indisposed, either due to deletion or imprisonment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look on Kouji's face told Beliamon that he was about to reply when he suddenly stopped and looked thoughtful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mega level digimon?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? You prove my point. Mega level is the highest level a digimon can reach to my knowledge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you said we have more than half of the spirits. We have five, no more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat caused Beliamon to freeze suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...my mistake. You're correct. Silly me.\" Beliamon said, inwardly cursing herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't time to play the Duskmon card, no, not quite yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling his eyes, Kouji turned his attention to the pan Beliamon was getting out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you really going through all that trouble just to bake cookies? Just for me? In the middle of the night?\" Kouji asked as if the answer was obvious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I do have the ingredients out don't I?\" Beliamon asked in return before Kouji quickly grasper the pan away from her. \"Well, do you wan't a snack or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want you to have to bake THIS late!\" Kouji shouted, putting the pan back into a cuphoard. \"I really don't need a snack anyway...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" Beliamon mumured, thinking quickly. \"Well...there is ONE more option. I could....magic the cookies up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic them up?\" Kouji asked, looking both afraid and skeptical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well its not like \"Poof!\" and instant cookies. I make them by magic instead of by hand.\" Beliamon explained, gesturing to the ingredients. \"There's only one catch...they can be very addicting and have many more calories than cookies I cook by hand. THis goes for all food I make by magic, really.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing Beliamon's explanation, Kouji had first appeared wary, but to her delight, now looked only slightly afraid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...why not?\" He finally replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon gave him a sideways look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Highly addictive.\" She reminded him, clucking her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They can't be addictive if you only give them to me every so often. Its not like I can raid the kitchens for them.\" Kouji replied with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving him another look, Beliamon finally smiled at her charge and shooed him a few feet away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really should feed you at night more often. You seem to be more agreeable.\" She remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji gave her a flat look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, stay back. I'll be using fire to bake, of course.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking in a deep breath, Beliamon braced herself, holding her hands out before her and closing her eyes to concentrate. It had been a while since she had cooked food magically. Going over the recipe in her mind, Beliamon knew the show had started when she heard an intake of breath via Kouji. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her mind's eye she saw the dish coming together, as if she was cooking by hand. In reality, the ingredients- water, eggs, flour, spices, and milk to name a few- were leaving there containing in swift motions and buzzing towards Beliamon's hand to create a wonderful cataclysm of a mixture. This she kept at for a few minutes until she felt the mixture was thourougly mixed. To add an extra fun touch, Beliamon then shaped the dough with her mind, making them into shapes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now for the fun part.' she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her mouth ever slow slightly, Beliamon wished she could have seen the face to match Kouji's surprised yelp as a jet of flames was brought forth by blowing on the mixture gently. Again, this continued for a few minutes until Beliamon was satisfied that the snickerdoodles were cooked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And...done.' Beliamon thought, two cookies hovering in her palm as she did so. Blowing on them to cool them off, she then presented her masterpieces to Kouji. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eye twitching, Kouji made a face at Belimaon as he examined one of the cookies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made...me into a cookie...I don't know what to say.\" He muttered while Beliamon chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cookie itself was rather embarassing: It showed himself now quite chubby, rubbing his stomach with a grin on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other cookie, also shaped like a person, he didn't know. It looked like him in a way, but something told him that it wasn't him. In addition to this, this cookie appeared sad and was also thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHo's this?\" Kouji asked, but Beliamon had scampered off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All in due time, Kouji, all in due time. Now, let's go to bed! It may have been cooking by magic, but that's still cooking.\" She called from the door they had entered earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...sure.\" Kouji replied, looking down at his cookies awkwardly. \"Beliamon, I'm sorry about earlier in the hallway. I shouldn't have acted the way I did about your friends.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon gave him a strnage look before giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't apologize, Kouji. If anyone should apologize, it's me. Freaking out on you like that. I mean-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Beliamon was surprised at the firmness in Kouji's voice as he cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Kouji repeated. \"Beliamon...your friends..it's obvious that they meant a lot to you...more than the world. I shou;dn't have said what I said. And its make me think. The others...my friends..I think you're right about them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Beliamon really did stare at Kouji before breaking into a genuine smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He's coming out of his shell I think...at last.' She thought as Kouji returned her smile, albeit somewhat weaker, but just as real and as genuine as hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Kouji.\" Beliamon said, winking as the boy walked over to her. \"But really now, we need our sleep. OR at least you do. You're a growing boy after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing at at Beliamon's joke, Kouji bit his head off, or rather, his cookie self's head. His eyes widened as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are really good!\" He exclaimed and began munching on them posthaste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon chuckled nervously, wondering if she had erred in giving Kouji magical food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did indeed want him to look like she had portrayed him in his cookie, but not if he lost all will and self control in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Beliamon straightened her gown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, right now the playing field was a bit sketchy. All they could do now was wait for the other pieces to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now things will be getting interesting.' Beliamon thought, the sounds of their footsteps joined now by the sound of Kouji munching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Perhaps I should have told him those two cookies are equal to a a dozen normal cookies each...oh well, don't want to ruin his apetite now.' Beliamon thought as the pair continued down the hallway on whatb would be their first night in Temple of Light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kouji's mouth gradually widened into a lethargic yawn as he sleepily wandered his way through the once busy hallways of the Temple of Light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flow of relaxation passed through his body, but when that stopped he felt a rigidness somewhere in his back. Impulsively, Kouji slackly threw his arms up and nonchalantly stretched himself out, letting out a tired moan of relief. With that, his shirt may have ridden up at that point, exposing the slightest bit of his pale belly to the world, but he was too sluggish to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only partially wakeful wanderer ran a hand over his heavy eyelids as he trudged in the direction of two double doors, where he had heard all the ruckus of pots and pans clanging- that's where the blunette guessed, in his twilight state of thinking, it all must have been coming from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a push of the twin doors, or more accurately, a lunge of his body onto them, he recieved entry. The doors unfolded to reveal a large chamber covered with smooth or broken marble tables, with a chandeliers floating from a vaulted ceiling, suspended higher above Kouji than he was used to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, many of the details of this vast room became lost to him in his drowse. Plodding his way on inward, a wave of fragrance from the cookery wafted over to his senses, as well as the increased volume of the pots, pans, and utensils scraping vigorously away in the other room; both the sounds of cooking and a life other than his own in the Temple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBriefly, he took a peek inside and saw Beliamon already busy. She been ready and waiting for him- already there was a big fire going, the stovetops flaring, and a stack of broken wood to use to feed the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door silently, so as not to attract attention, Kouji sauntered to the closest intact table. He was glad to see it was nice and smooth, just albeit a little worn over the centuries of usage. The Warrior of Light settled down, and collapsed softly on top of it, resting his head on top of a soft cushion made by his two arms.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then closed his eyes, drifting back to resume the slumber that had been interrupted by his wristwatch minutes ago, that had. . . said he had. . . over. . . slept. . . and it was. . . time to. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\nA low sizzling had been hissing comfortably in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just then, a deep snicker sounded off in the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, good morning, Kouji,\" an all too familiar voice spoke right within said boy's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf a second later, Kouji's eyes snapped open and he gasped deeply, as if he had just emerged from the watery depths of his own reveries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking right back at him, sure enough, was Beliamon. As she caught sight of him, Kouji thought he saw some life and vitality restoring itself back into Beliamon's eyes, as well as a trademark smirk as she saw the state of her prisoner before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must have been a long night, he inferred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, good morning t-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Kouji stopped. His hands quickly darted up and started to feel the back of his head, patting it up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blunette let out a scowl of frustration, disheartenment, and maybe a little bit of embarassment. Said blue hair was now slack and flowing long and free down below his neck, a little awry and messy from his sleep. In his drowsings, he had forgotten to tie back his hair, and not to mention bandana!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a second's notice, Kouji felt his back pocket, which seemed a smidgen smaller and tighter than ever before, for some odd reason. Luckily enough, not only was there was a rubber band handy but his trusty bandana, which he had completely neglected to tie over his head. Gathering these two all important relics in his hands, Kouji swiftly turned to a corner, and tied his hair back and his bandana across as fast as his hands could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he spun back to face Beliamon, he observed her smirk from before had developed even further. And when Kouji slightly blushed, thinking he had done a completely sloppy job, and hurried to make slight adjustments, she started to snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're fine, trust me,\" Beliamon dismissed, waving her hand, \"Anyway, your breakfast will be ready shortly. It's cooking on the stovetops right now. I'm sure you've brought the same appetite you had last night,\" she nodded and grinned, her eyes bright and wide awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji just stared blankly at her for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\". . . Ugh. . .\" he grunted groggily, as he ran a hand through his bed head, or 'bench' head, \"You're going to have to stop being so cheery and energetic in the morning,\" he moaned sarcastically, as he rubbed a sleepy eye, squinting at the auroral light of her sobering enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe masked her mouth briefly, concealing yet another abrupt chuckle, \"Oh, I see. So did my so-called 'prisoner' get a good night's sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, you know-\" Kouji mumbled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking to himself, sleeping was increasingly becoming a little harder to do. Even though the bench was comfy, his clothes were not, or at least they were getting that way. All the while, they were definitely getting all the smaller on him, and a little constricting to his reluctantly admittedly growing body. Using his jacket as a blanket, he had recently taken to just wearing his underclothes when he went to bed. Now he understood why pajamas existed in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, I guess I always could use a few more hours,\" he replied, before turning the question to his captor, \"How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sable clad captor shrugged, \"Meh, hardly,\" she stated nonchalantly, her eyes darting to the side, as if recalling some sleepless hours. An exhausted tone flickered and translucently etched its way onto Beliamon's smiling face just briefly. Even her hair seemed slightly disheveled that moment. But it was not even a moment before it had already disappeared as fast as it had come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gaping expression of her prisoner's face brought back a chuckle to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How!?\" Kouji outbursted, astonished that his captor could even be. . . functioning at this hour 'hardly' sleeping. His eyes were at their widest since he woke up, \"What? When exactly did you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Kouji's palid face, she simply sighed, lowered and shook her head and said, \"Some nights I just have trouble getting some rest. It's nothing new. I'm thrilled more than anyone to say it's finally a new day, after all, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon suddenly sniffed a disturbance in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was cut off by a trailing column of smoke emitting from the kitchen- to which she let out a bewildered yelp, and practically shot out of the room into the smoldering confines of the kitchen. She deftly pried the door open in a fell swoop to let fresh air pour in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd before Kouji could even yell back much less get up and see whether everything was alright, the ardent scurrying and scraping of the kitchen returned, as well as an incredulous, \"I can believe how these turned out! They're not completely charred at all, but I hope you like your sausages well-done, Kouji!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning inwardly, Kouji slid back into his seat, slouching before scrunching back up. With his head slack, he was given a perfect view of his paunch when sitting in such a manner, jutting out potently and ponderously over his lap as well as straining his yellow shirt considerably. He moved to give his soft midsection an idle poke, but it only made him yawn again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What time is it?\" Kouji asked nobody in particular, as he picked his wrist up and read the green display of his light-up watch, \"10:47?\" he cried in disbelief, \"How can that be right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he had been in school, he might have been full of energy, ready to tackle a tricky math quiz at his desk right now, not nodding off at the breakfast table, waiting to be fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had to be one of the most serious cases of jet lag he had ever experienced- or digital lag- or reality lag, or whatever it was, it was seriously messing around with his internal, biological clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji remembered he thought his watch was broken when its alarm beeped irritatingly almost an hour ago, telling him he had overslept, disturbing his slumber. It felt like it was three, maybe four in the morning. But the alarm kept hammering its high pitched rings, and Kouji didn't want to get out, he didn't want to get up, and he was starting to get very, very ticked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly, the joke about the boy throwing his clock out the window to see time fly had flashed through Kouji's crazed twilight state of mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Kouji had wandered, crossed the vestibule of the Temple, and meandered his way over to the cafeteria. . . when he peered into the kitchen, he had seen Beliamon tied up, thrusting skillets around an open flame and preparing what looked like eggs, stirring some kind of batter, and making a load of sausages to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, sure enough, a clatter sounded under his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight in front of him was a plate racked with a moderate amount of hot, steaming scrambled eggs next to a pile of waffles that must have been fresh from the iron with an odd number of sausages to a corner of the plate that were still sizzling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd also, right before him was a Beliamon who was practically glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWordlessly, Beliamon rolled a cart over to Kouji's table as she quietly, and once again, selected a drink for him. After an antique, but thoroughly cleansed due to Beliamon's care, tankard had been filled with the thick, creamy milk from its enchanted jug, she tapped it and sent it levitating over to Kouji's lips for a sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Kouji might have borne witness to several tricks like this before, his expression was still so incredulous and bug-eyed, it made Beliamon scoff up a few airy chuckles as an alarmed Kouji, now more than half awake for sure, tentatively downed some milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon transfered a set of silverware over to his which landed to his side, a napkin that descended to his lap, as well as a jug of maple syrup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, eat up,\" she beamed pleasantly, \"After last night's request, I had a feeling that you'd be definitely hungry within a few hours notice. So dig in; it's not like you have to hide it from me this time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji responded with only a partially unexcited side glance, as he started to cut a bite sized piece out of the plump breakfast sausage, \"Alright, alright, I'll try not to,\" he smirked sarcastically before popping it into his mouth and moving onto the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before he had cleared away the last of the sausages, Kouji saw Beliamon trailing back to the kitchen. A feeling of anxiety started to crawl in as he expected Beliamon was going to wheel in some huge monstrosity she had been working away at for him to devour. . . or worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm,\" Kouji started, \"You wouldn't happen to have something else in there, like, you know. . .\" he gulped before uttering the word, \"Seconds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Beliamon spun around before she stated, \"No- I'm just about to fix up something for myself. Digimon's got to eat too. We can't just live off air alone, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially after last night's excursion and sleep, or lack thereof, she did need all the energy she could get, despite how well she could conceal this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Why, do you want me make some more for you, Kouji?\" she implored eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, no, I'm fine!\" he cried, an outrageously wide smile ripped across his face and he held his hands up, waving them rapidly in defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so,\" Beliamon nodded, heading off into the kitchen to make her own breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the clattering of the kitchen came back to life, Kouji proceeded to clear through the delicious yellow folds of the scrambled eggs. At first, he was eating at a leisurely pace, but the warmth and flavor he experienced compelled him to move from a casual ladle to a hurried yet impassioned scoop and even to a ferverous shovel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the shuffle of silverware in the background among the rattling of her own kitchenware prompted a smile from his captor in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill cooking, over her shoulder, Beliamon called out, \"I hope you're not shy with that maple syrup as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn irritated scowl filled the room in response to her quip. Any giggling on her part was completely concealed by the shifting of pots and pans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, thought Kouji, it's not like she's watching me or anything. He let out a guilty sigh as his hand moved toward the jug of maple syrup and let it pour loose over the golden brown waffles. As he savored the sweet and light texture of said waffles, he also tried to scoff them up to prevent his captor from seeing he had so willingly resorted to such a notion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon set aside what she had been cooking and scurried with some sort of tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My breakfast's still cooking, but I still have time to spare,\" she explained as she set it down on the table, \"Here,\" she indicated the tray, \"I hope you like watermelon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, Kouji didn't seem as opposed to the idea as she had anticipated. He just shrugged and actually took a slice or two onto his plate as he finished off the last waffle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he was done chewing, swallowing, and downing the respective mouthfuls of milk to wash it all down, Kouji let out a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon just watched him attentively, as if scrutinously observing the mean amount of rotations his disappearing jawline went through per minute. As soon as he caught on, he blanched, and just leaned forward, staring back at her in return, somewhat mortified. In reaction, Beliamon burst into laughter, and a still mortified Kouji now leaned backwards, contemplating once again her sanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn awkward moment passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji went placidly silent. He cleared his throat and opened his mouth, like he was about to say something, but no words came out. His lips promptly shut, hesitation etched all over his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Kouji?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just have to say. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blunette's eyes veered off to the side as he paused again, looking as if he were struggling with possible consequences of what might come with he was about to remark on. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is really delicious,\" Kouji admitted softly, looking down, \"You're really a wonderful. . . cook. Did you know that?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Kouji,\" she said, looking at him sincerely, \"I know all too well, unfortunately,\" Beliamon remarked a bit morosely, \"Anyway, I suppose it's always bit a bit of a hobby for myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA foolish grin spread across Kouji's face, as he let out a chuckle, \"Heh, I remember the last time I tried to cook. We were all in some competition to make a better hamburger than each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes returning to Beliamon took on a softer tone as well as his voice which sheepishly admitted, \"I tried to make a squid burger or something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis won an astonished eyebrow arch from Beliamon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Kouji blushed and continued, \"Well, Takuya's was much worse. That blockhead had no idea what he was doing. I swear just the look of whatever he had the courage to call a hamburger made me want to puke!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's kind of rough for someone who 'oh-so-desperately' wishes to be reunited with his fellow comrades,\" she chided playfully, clasping her hands together dramatically before she started laughing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well,\" Kouji started, \"We're guys, you know? Sometimes we like to mess around with each other like that,\" he smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon stopped and gazed, as if some truth she knew all too well had struck once more. She nodded in an almost dreamlike affirmation.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I actually miss them.\" He said, after a small silence, looking at Beliamon with eyes that doubted his own words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOffering, him a small, sad smile, Beliamon quickly gathered the remains of his breakfast and placed them on the cart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew that you did. You're not as cold as you'd like to think, Kouji.\" She replied as she wheeled the cart back into the kitchen to deposit the dishes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling to himself, Kouji stretched once more, shaking the remaining feelings of sleep off, and propped his elbows up on the marble table, his heard resting in his hands, as he waited for Beliamon to return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...you say that they're going through the same...process...that you're putting me through?\" Kouji called offhandedly as he glanced down at the belly he still wasn't quite used to seeing pooled in his lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhhm.\" Beliamon shouted from her place in the kitchen as she left the dirty dishes in a basin to soak and simply incinerating the watermelong husks with a few small jets of flame via her magic, depositing what dust that was left into a small wastebin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a rather nondescript answer from you.\" Kouji said sarcastically as Beliamon walked back to the table where Kouji was seated at and took a seat herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon shrugged as she brushed some of her blonde hair out of her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Comapred to our situation, their own IS a rather nondescript one.\" She replied. \"To put it simply, they're still in the meat apple grove I retrieved you from, though...I suppose a few variables have changed since then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And those variables are?\" Kouji asked, raising an eyebrow suspiciously at Beliamon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...you know how Ayzahn Ra and what remains of the Temples are basically islands floating in a sea of nothingness, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since then, the meat apple grove at which you and your friends were camped has become a similar place, though not to such an extreme degree as that of Ayzahn Ra. Furthermore, the trees there have been hydrophonically enhanced to produce larger and richer meat apples by Ranamon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And they havn't figured it out yet?\" Kouji asked, incredulous. \"They havn't wondered where I'VE been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling slightly, Beliamon nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes they've wondered. But they've been distracted not only by the larger meat apples but also by the fact that...\" Beliamon coughed here. \"But also by the fact that someone sent them a message on your digivice poing as you and telling them that you would be back in a few days...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji stared at Beliamon for a few moments before giving her a very flat look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I wonder who that could have been?\" He asked dourly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's to know?\" Beliamon asked brightly before giglling awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComposing herself, she then gave Kouji a professional look as she crossed her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since then, their weight has been increasing at an admirable pace and they've been carefully watched over by Ranamon and Mercurymon, though the girl- Zoe is it?- seems to be realizing that something isn't right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Kouji brightened, but not for the reason Beliamon had thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then I'm NOT the only one getting fatter! Ha!\" He shouted jubilantly, standing up and striking their aire with a fist. \"Heh, at least Takuya won't be able to talk when I finally see him again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling, Beliamon nodded as she reached over and quickly grabbed a part of Kouji's paunch that had been revealed when he had stood up so hastily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he's made a lot of progress. They all have. More than you actually. You have some catching up to do.\" Beliamon said giddily ad Kouji blushed and smacked her hand away before resuming his sitting position with a huff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Progress, my foot.\" Kouji scoffed. \"You mean to tell me that they all weigh more than me now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, of course not. The girl and the child are lighter than you of course and the one big guy, he weighed more than you from the start. I was referring to the speed at which they were gaining weight.\" Beliamon explained as she massged her temples. \"Up until recently, you were far more reluctant to eat than they were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...well that makes sense I guess. Takuya and J.P love food, always have. And Tommy, he's a kid. He'd probably prefer candy but I guess meat apples work too. And Zoe...well I guess the pounds have to add up sometime.\" Kouji said simply as he turned his head up to look at the decrepit marble ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing heavily, Beliamon stood up and looked around the cafeteria herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpressive upon seeing them for the first time, much of what remained of the Temple of Light made her feel like she was in a mausoleum. The white, worn structures and furniture, much of it destroyed and lying in heaps of rubble here and there, coupled with the musty smell of powdered marble and emptiness, made her feel like she was stuck in a decrepit world, void of color. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place must have been so much more beautiful when everything wasn't broken and light was streaming through the windows...\" Beliamon muttered offhandedly, suddenly finding herself feeling very stifled and bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to her, Kouji yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'm still a bit sleepy after all.\" He said as he rested his head on the table again, as he had done before Breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eye ticking, Beliamon quickly yanked Kouji up and began to drag him off down a corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What's the big deal? Where are we going?\" Kouji asked as he finally managed to free his shirt from Beliamon's grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Somewhere. Out into the fresh...well...out into the air that's at least not as stale as the air in here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping quickly, with a flick of her wrist the cart she had used earlier raced to her side with a speed that should have broken it's wheels, now fully loaded with pre-packaged snacks and drinks that Beliamon had apparently found. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji's steps and the sounds of the cart rolling along magically behind her, Beliamon breathed in deeply as she finally emerged on the steps leading up to the once hidden portion of the Temple of Light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't that much better outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shoulders sagging, Beliamon sighed as she looked out over the portion of the city she could see from here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I at least wish that the sky was blue.\" She said, mostly to herself. \"If the sky could be blue, if I could see the sun, the moons, and the stars from here, if the air could be fresh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji stepped up to where she had stopped on the steps and looked at her concernedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was acting odd again. He hoped she didn't go into one of her fits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But no,\" Beliamon was still ranting. \"The air is thick with dilapidation and the lack of life. Night and Day are just two shades of gray. Neither the sun nor the moon has shined on this city in ages.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beliamon?\" Kouji ventured carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon didn't respond for a few long seconds, but finally sighed, and turned to Kouji, eyes closed and smiling slightly, repressing the feelings that had threatened to overwhelm her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" She replied simpy. \"I giess...I guess this city is starting to get to me. The emptiness, the lack of color, the...lack of life.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her now, Kouji's jaw suddenly dropped, his eyes trained on the skin between her chest and her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing his gaze, Beliamon was shocked herself, that upon glancing down at where Kouji was looking, she found a symbol, seemingly burned into her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's...this?\" She asked, gingerly reaching out to touch the scar. To her relief, it did not hurt, not even in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the symbol of Light.\" Kouji responded, studying it closely. \"It looks almost like a tattoo. It must have happened when that beam of light shot out from your chest yesterday and revealed the Temple of Light...or what's left of it at least. I must have been to groggy earlier to notice it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon winced at the memory, taking her hand away from the scar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of that...how exactly did that happen?\" Kouji asked as Beliamon again looked out over the city. \"You obviously didn't cause it. Not willingly at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon gave Kouji a look and then giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess the secret's out of the bag, finally.\" She saidas she began walking down the steps, the cart slowly following her so as to prevent it from falling over. \"You're correct. I didn't summon the beam of light yesterday that revealed the Temple of Light. On the contrary, it was you. Or your digivice rather.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My...digivice?\" Kouji asked, a third confused, a third disbelieving, and a third astounded. \"That beam of light came from within you...which means that my digivice-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is inside me.\" Beliamon finished as she again touched the scar on her chest. \"Its nothing that extraordinary, really. I specialize in the power of Darkness, so I reached into myself and placed it in one of the folds of darkness that lies around my soul...if you can say digimon have a soul that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...how will I ever get it back then?\" Kouji asked as he stumbled to catch up to Beliamon, now at the bottom of the steps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either when I give it back to you, which may be never, or...when I am deleted, which truthfully, could be at any time.\" Beliamon responded phrophetically and the two walked in silence for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Obviously, Kouji is thinking of ways to retrieve his digivice.' Beliamon though, smiling at how she had come to know his mind worked in such a short amount of time. Perhaps it was because they were, in some ways, similar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...my digivce is empowered with my Human and Beast spirits, both of whom are Light digmon. Wouldn't having them inside of you hurt?\" Kouji asked with real concern in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...it never hurt until yesterday,\" Beliamon replied, taking a different road other than the avenue they had walked the other day. \"Before that, it always felt like the soft glow of a candle or the winking of stars on a moonless night. The other day, it felt like it...like it was eating away at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...and you still want to carry it within you?\" Kouji questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no choice. I can't let you have it, not yet at least. Right now, its hidden where the only way it can be taken forcefully is if I die. And not to brag but, short of Cherubimon and a few select Mega level digimon, I'm pretty powerful.\" Beliamon replied as she tried to match up any of buildings they were passing now with her bearings from the Ayzahn Ra of the past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I believe if we keep heading in this direction we'll reach a crossroads that leads to the Temple of Wood and the Temple of Water- or what remains of them at least, if anything.\" Beliamon said as she noticed the buildings get smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Water and Wood Temples?\" Kouji prompted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know for a fact that the majority of the land the temples were housed on and most if not all of the temples themselves were deleted, but both the Water and Wood Temple had very beautiful grounds dedicated to them, and as far as surface area goes, they were two of the largest.\" Beliamon said as the pair past the last buildings on the street and the street became a path that wound its way over to the edge of the makeshift island Ayzahn Ra was situated upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing over the edge into the gray abyss, Beliamon moved a few steps away from the perilous drop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And be careful here, Kouji. With the weight you've gained recently your center of balance is bound to be off and this path may be littered with debris. If you trip and fall into the abyss don't say I didn't warn you.\" Beliamon half taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha. Ha. Ha. You're so funny.\" Kouji retorted but nonetheless followed Beliamon's example of moving away from the abyss. \"So, what did these two Temples look like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing dreamily, Beliamon stopped for a moment and got her bearing once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both were very beautiful, like all temples, but unlike the others, their beaughty was found equally in nature as it was in their structures.\" Beliamon stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Temple of Wood was, of course, made of wood, and most of the buildings were small, but they were all very...elegant? No, that's not the word. They were'nt as..proper I suppose. Some were built on top of tress, others were normal buildings on the ground, some were built into trees themselves. Some of the professors didn't even use rooms! Instead they just used plazas or gardens. Most of the cafeterias were like this too, stone benches and tables, flowers everywhere, and these streams fed by the Temple of Water. All the outdoor areas were magicked with invisible shields to keep bad weather out, not that there was that often in the Temple of Wood.\" Beliamon said euphorically, breathing in as if to remember the scent of it all. \"It was like a giant garden eternally in bloom. Of course, it did have it's central building. The Living Tree it was called. A giant tree in the center of the Temple of Wood, with rooms inside it and outside it and in its branches. Hewn out but still alive. It was all so beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unlike most of the other Temples, the Wood and Water Temples were open to most all residents of Ayzahn Ra. They not only served as places of learning but recreation areas as well. And oh, I've only explained the Temple of Wood.\" Beliamon stated, and Kouji could tell she was enraptured in her memories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Temple of Water was as beautiful as the Temple of Wood was, but it also had a mystical sense about it. Giant shells, suspended by magic high above the Temple of Water were contuously gushing water down into the Temple, you see from the Temple of Water was esentially a giant lake with lake with islands and buildings scattered throughout it, and the sound of running water was always heard. And the buildings seemed to just rise up out of the water and were made of the deep, brown-gray stone covered by ivy and all of these green plants and some were underwater alltogether! Water lillies and a rainbow of different colored flowers grew on the lake or <br>\r\nunder the surface of it. Coral, you humans call it? The water was so clear that you could always see to the bottom and giant trees grew right out up out of the water and cast shade so that when the sun was shining, everything was in beautiful contrast...the central building of the Water Temple was this castle made out of the same stone as the lake floor and most of it was underwater, you had to swim to enter it actually, and the spires of the castle rose up out of the water and water fell from openings in the spires just like the shells...Ikaku Castle I think it was called. And I was told that most of the interior was actually dry...and I could tell you more but I've ranted so much already.\" Beliamon ended breathlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...they both sound so beautiful...\" Kouji responded, lost in Beliamon's descriptions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were. It was a great loss for Ayzahn Ra when they were destroyed.\" Beliamon replied and sighed but birghtened. \"But there might just be something left. Just a small remnant of their former glory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji, reaching for a few cookies on the cart that had loyally followed Beliamon and making himself a nice snack, had a hopeful look in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so. I'd like to see what they might have been like, even if its nowhere near how they used to look\" He responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then,\" Beliamon said as she turned to Kouji with her hands on her hips, noticing in delight that he was snacking, \"We have a decision to make.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Kouji saw that they had reached the crossroads Beliamon had spoken of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we want to check out the Temple of Wood, we should take the left path. If we want to head over to the Temple of Water we need to keep on this path as it curves around to the other side of the island.\" Beliamon stated and gestured to both paths clearly. \"I don't really care which one we check out. Would you rather see one or the other, Kouji?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking it over for a moment, Kouji opened his mouth to say...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In Cherubimon\u2019s lair, just hours after the western rebellions, as well as thousands of lives, had been single-handedly silenced, the dejected culprit named Duskmon was morosely haunting the dark corner he had always resided in, yet at that very moment, he was even more lost within the obscurity of darkness itself than he had been ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all the chaos and screaming he had both conjured up and crushed down, none of it so much as pierced his blackened, calloused helmet of a skull, or went on to clang and echo against its cast iron edges and torment him so as did that solitary damned name that fidgety young witch had so casually infected him with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene replayed for the thousandth time in his mind, \u201cWell, it was nice talking to you\u2026 Kouichi!\u201d she exclaimed, the glint in her eyes growing like wildfire as she stared straight through him. Even though he was facing a stone wall the next moment, the moment had him frozen for minutes on end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKou\u2026ichi?\u201d he had uttered to himself in sheer bewilderment and confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a drip of water fall in the distance. No, that name she had called him, Kouichi, had resounded within him too much to simply be misplaced. The mere fact that something as trivial as a name chilled and inflicted this degree of distress on the most heartless of the Dark Warriors signified its sheer magnitude. It threatened to slowly tear apart the ruthless confidence and fortitude that what he once knew he had, bit by bit. But what did it mean? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould he truly be Kouichi?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr was this some kind of treacherous spell placed on him by that capricious Beliamon to render him insane? Could that be an attempt to impede him from resuming his watch over her upon his return? He had more than mere suspicions toward her loyalties anyway. At face value, she might just be identified as an evil Digimon\u2026 but maybe that\u2019s why Cherubimon chose her though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, he deeply desired to resume his vigil over her to ensure the source of his bewilderment wasn\u2019t trying to pull something while he was away on duty. He soon got his wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeeellllllooo?\u201d Kouji boomed down the tremendous chasm only to find no echo. Not satisfied, he took a deep breath and prepared to thunder as loud as he could. Beliamon covered his mouth from behind before he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, ah, ah,\u201d she chided, \u201cThat\u2019s enough. The enormous basin might look like a huge endless canyon, but it empties into the vast nothingness below. Yet, for some reason, your voice is sucked into the huge vacuum of the abyss before it can hit its own distant sides and bounce back to your ears.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji exhaled and blushed a little, \u201cYeah, I guess it\u2019s pointless to try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlthough,\u201d Beliamon continued, as if having omitted his last statement, \u201cif your body was hurdling down the void with what\u2019s left of the earth rushing past you, I bet your voice would bounce back, so the last thing you would ever hear in this world would be your dying screams as you vanished into nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji blinked and returned a bleak expression to her, \u201c\u2026 Wow, that was pretty morbid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon nodded delightfully before cracking up, \u201cI didn\u2019t scare you, did I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Kouji exclaimed, maybe a little too loudly for his own interests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNow don\u2019t you get any ideas, I can\u2019t have any prisoner of mine dying on me,\u201d she stated as Kouji turned pale, \u201cWell, on second thought,\u201d she reconsidered, placing a finger on her lip, \u201cCherubimon probably wouldn\u2019t mind one dead Digidestined. Oh! In fact, that might be exactly what he\u2019s trying to do!\u201d she exclaimed with a loud flourish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 gee, ya think?\u201d Kouji grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo if you feel compelled to suddenly end your misery, feel free to go ahead and take the plunge. Oh, but do remember to go in head first. That way you can hear your final cries in this world\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn awkward silence followed, only to be broken up by some modest chuckling. But any chortling from either party was soon dissipated by the awe elicited by the sheer presence of the magnificent gulf before them; the main basin was like an extremely wide and voluminous crater which extended into the distance and plunged down miles and miles, possibly down to the endlessness of the abyss itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon whistled, taking in the desolation\u2019s depth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji nodded, biting into yet another soft, perpetually warm cookie, much to Beliamon\u2019s delight. He had yet to catch onto the fact that these cookies had also been magicked up, just as the ones he had eaten last night were, she thought. No wonder he was eating them so early in the day- he wouldn\u2019t be satisfied at least until he had gobbled a quite a few, just to sate the effects, but that was a limit he had well crossed several times over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon sauntered up a steep hill, worn smooth by the course of time. At its summit, she parked herself and motioned for Kouji to join her, \u201cThere\u2019s a better view up here,\u201d she called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he did so, the blunette gazed down in marvel. The foot of the hill emptied directly into the chasm revealing nothing but vast, dull, sandy plains of the once lakebed that extended broadly from the dimensions below to the gray horizons above. Many parts of the bed lay far and deep in the distance and were soon obscured by the gray mists of the horizon, opening up into the very abyss itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji thought he could make out some tiny, worn, gray ruins upon the curved banks of the once glorious body of water. As his eyes meandered off to the side, he spotted a solitary, worn down, outlandish looking tower awkwardly wobbling on its last, malformed leg. He gasped after squinting for a better look. Remnants of various buildings, towers, and castles were scattered like dried bones across what surface area of the lake floor that Kouji could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all that remains of the Temple of Water,\u201d Beliamon said sorrowfully, \u201cIt really was a sight to see, especially on warm summer nights when the full moon sank down to shine off the calm waters of the lake,\u201d As she described, her eyes seemed to take in a glint of moonlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral wide peaks extended their way near the upper heights, their summits taking on a lighter gray tone than its once submerged underbelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey may look like lonely mountains right now,\u201d Beliamon shook her head, \u201cBut they had once existed as lush islands, and also as some favorite retreat locations for Ayzahn Ra students of all extractions and varieties. The whole reason why some even bothered studying seriously was so that they could get a dream cabin there and meet new people over vacation- I heard it was quite an experience.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you ever stay on one of those islands?\u201d Kouji inquired offhandedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Beliamon shook her head, \u201cI only hoped like everyone else. Plus, I never really got around to being a full time student, remember? But I can only imagine what those summer nights must have been like there\u2026 That\u2019s not to say it was boring to stay in the city; every day was vibrant, and there always were a lot of things going on, especially during the summer,\u201d Beliamon recollected, blinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you know- there\u2019s always the summer festival of course. Many places hold celebrations on the first week of summer, but in Ayzahn Ra, everything always seemed larger than life. Then, at the end of summer was the weeklong city festival, which concluded with the Marathon on the last day of summer. Many raced a course spanning in and around the city, yet I really only saw it once\u2026 the whole thing that is,\u201d Beliamon coughed, \u201cI, myself, er, knew someone who entered quite well-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm?\u201d went Kouji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes slid towards Kouji\u2019s, \u201cHis name was\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeliamon went quiet as her lips curled into a bitter smile. Suddenly, her chest panged. It was starting to act up again. Her energy drained and color fled from her eyes, becoming as gray and still as everything else in the dead city. She began to feel as light as driftwood, pushed by the waves and floating away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she doubled over and fell to the ground, her limp body steadily sliding down the hillside toward the neverending abyss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second thought, Kouji sprang to his feet and leapt after her, dashing to the edge before she got there, \u201cBeliamon!\u201d he yelped, hopefully prying her consciousness out of its current paralyzed state. Much to his chagrin, he couldn\u2019t speed his way down the hill as fast as he used to, but much to his relief, he still made it to the bottom in time- as soon as he had held her arm tight, her legs slid over and dangled before the great emptiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Beliamon!\u201d Kouji yelled, crying her name out repeatedly as he struggled to lift her out, pulling her lower half out of danger and onto firm ground. Soon he had moved her a few yards away from falling and placed her flat so she wouldn\u2019t start spinning toward the chasm again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, she\u2019s spaced out again,\u201d he cursed, remembering what had happened to her the night before... but that aside he didn\u2019t know much more. Kouji tried to take her pulse, if she even had one to begin with- and he didn\u2019t see anything to worry about. She seemed to be breathing fine\u2026 it had to be that his Digivice and Spirits imbedded within her were causing her pain. He couldn\u2019t remove them on his own. She definitely needed to lie down somewhere for a while, but just somewhere that wasn\u2019t dangerously close to a bottomless pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rested Beliamon\u2019s motionless arm on his shoulder and bended his knees, slowly trying to rise with her. Pushing up with his legs, he struggled but nonetheless lifted his captor and began climbing up the steep hillside, taking the utmost care not to make the slightest misstep. Every single one had to be taken with complete caution\u2026 every one calm, every one strong. His eyes looked above to the hilltop, his goal, where he could ascertain his goal and be filled with hope once understanding how close it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Kouji was not filled with hope at what he saw. He turned pale, eyes widening with despair, posture suddenly slackening to dangerous angles, feet starting to slip in due time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA single black figure starkly loomed over the peak amidst the pale grayness, waiting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuskmon.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not a sound is heard anywhere in the world at all, and a peaceful silence lays itself over the Earth like a warm blanket; offering its warmth and security. But, to you, it's too quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderneath this blanket, there are some nasty bed bugs. And you, Takuya, are the only one capable of removing every last one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are currently on a stake out mission. Nothing special, they told you back at HQ. Just walk about, scope things out, and report back. With a mission so simplistic, what's the point in providing you anything special?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey've taken everything but your gun, leaving you with your instincts and clothes to walk up and down a few lonely street blocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo need for fancy clothes. You're stuck in the standard spy trench coat, but underneath you're only wearing a pair of jeans and a shirt. What? Not like you're going to run into anyone who you'd want to take it off of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn it all... I'm better than this.\" You scoff, kicking at the curb of the street you're currently walking on. \"Danger! Excitement! Where are they? Where are the reasons I joined this organization?\" You sigh, clearly frustrated with the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, you stop on a dark street corner. Well, dark minus the street light you're standing under. The light has a yellowish color, adding a splash of liveliness to the sides of the low-class buildings within view. You snort disapprovingly, thinking that your time would be better spent at home sleeping than actually walking around on the curb. You feel useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle does your dream self know, that Cherubimon's magic is beginning its work on your dream...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and look around. Amused yet again by the tints of yellow on the dingy building walls. Suddenly, out of the darkness behind you, a hand reaches out and covers your mouth and nose. In panic, you inhale deeply, hands grasping the hand with both of your own trying desperately to pull it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fumes are intoxicating, and quickly your struggles fade into unconsciousness as the world around you blackness. The warm blanket has wrapped itself around you and strangled you, leaving you to fend for your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up later...</span></div></div>",

It was pretty dark in the room, and the only light was in the center of the room. It was so bright, Takuya had to squint when looking up to it- it illuminated even the dust in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, big, heavy footsteps sounded from a metal staircase landing... the feet thundered against the steel as it vibrated and reverberated around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya began to sweat as he knew someone was coming for him... Takuya, world class international spy wouldn't stand for this- he couldn't allow himself to be taken so easily by a scientist or whoever was there in the dark laboratory he was being held in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, he got out his laser pen, and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today's the day!\" screamed an overly excited voice accompanied by the pattering of small bare feet on wooden floors that woke Takuya up. Rustling around in his bedsheets, Takuya stirred, grumbled, and groaned as he was still groggy and had just been woken up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubbed his eyes, still in sleep mode before allowing the gears in his mind some time to catch up. Technically, he was still half-asleep, but he never really expected that he would get to sleep in today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...that was a weird dream,\" he mumbled to himself, \"but it ended towards the good part...\" Still growling to himself, a little upset and still tired, he rolled out of bed, still in his boxers and t-shirt and opened up the bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, there was his little brother, Shinya, parading all over the house, skipping and jumping for joy. Why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because today's my BIRTHDAY! Yippee!\" Takuya's hyped little brother yelped as he skipped around looking like he was about to do a cartwheel in his orange pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya peered around as quick as he could, observing to see if anyone else was home before Shinya could notice he was actually awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNope, not a soul. It's worse than he feared. His dad was off at work and his mom had already gotten up very early in the morning to do some last minute shopping for her oh-so-special birthday boy. Probably there would be a note or something left by his mom around the area of the refrigerator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya sighed as he rested his cheek in his hands. Why didn't he ever get the big birthday celebrations. Being nine isn't really all it's cracked up to be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was no way he could tell that to his blissful brother, who, at this moment, could be found scrambling over to his older brother as fast as he could, a wide and devious grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess what, Takuya?\" Shinya eagerly implored. Takuya could see where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" he whined unenthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my BIRTHDAY!\" Shinya yelled, leaping in the air, almost falling out of his pajamas, \"And yooou know what that means...\" he said with a sparkling grin on his face, his eyes sparkling with no good intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're another year older?\" Takuya yawned, scratching his belly sluggishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinya looked a little taken aback, \"Well, yeah, but that's not so important-\" Shinya recovered as he cried, \"Since it's my birthday, it means I get what I want!\" He then started giggling wildly with a wide, mischievious grin plastered all over his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo wonder he felt so happy. Shinya felt that because it was his birthday, he had acquired absolute power over everyone else for a single day. No wonder he felt so happy, and no wonder small children enjoy birthdays so much, if not for all the presents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that kinda beside the point?\" Takuya asked, slouching against the door to his bedroom, which he had closed at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Shinya yelled, \"Shut up! It's my birthday!\" he implied again, in the case that Takuya had forgotten the other seven hundred and thirty-six times he had been told this before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, alright,\" Takuya muttered as he started to walk down the hallway, his younger brother's feet scuttering behind his as he tried to overtake his pace and beat him to the kitchen. To be honest, Takuya loved Shinya as much as anyone else would love their younger brother, but he seriously felt that he could be such an arrogant brat most of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you don't know where Mom hid my presents?\" Shinya implored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the last time, NO, already!\" Takuya snapped, spinning around, giving him an angry look, almost raising his voice against his younger brother. He stopped himself, though- he was actually going to make an effort to get his brother to enjoy the day, even if it meant him losing half his sanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... she must be out buying them,\" Shinya contemplated, putting his hands on his waist, \"I'm gonna call her and tell her not to get me anything stupid. Like clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya tried not to respond to that, but he wouldn't let his little brother do such a thing. Luckily, both their attentions soon became fixed on a great spectacle to behold, sitting and taking up most of the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the biggest birthday cake I've ever seen in my life!\" Takuya exclaimed, pointing at the behemoth of a pastry. Shinya's mouth lay slack in pure surprise and his eyes sparkled with happiness as he brought both his hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be frank and brief, the cake could easily compare to or even overshadow a wedding cake. It was a beautiful chocolate masterpiece, standing firm about three to five layers tall. It didn't sway over to one side because it was of a stocky build and stood perfectly wide and tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire cake was covered evenly and perfectly smooth with a velvety chocolate ganache frosting. On the border of each layer was a white frosting ring, with flowers cast of icing sprouting out at random points. At the very top of the cake was a thick ring that looked like a green leaf crown with flowers all about. Its surface read, 'Happy 9th Birthday, Shinya! We love you!' in delicious looking yellow frosting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't parents supposed to love the older siblings best?\" Takuya asked, scratching his head in confusion. Shinya smacked him upon hearing that, but continued to gaze upon his marvelous cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't make sense at all. All Takuya got for HIS 9th birthday was a few cupcakes. Maybe it was because Shinya got better grades than him, but what serious grades can you get when you're nine? He still is pretty dumb, thought Takuya. Shinya sucked up a lot to Mom and Dad, though, even though he was horribly behaved around his older brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe Dad got a really big bonus...' thought Takuya. He noticed that there was a note his mom left desecreetly on the refrigerator, just as he expected. He skimmed over it while Shinya was still looking at his cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo sum it all up, it said that she was out getting Shinya presents. She hadn't bought them yet because she knew that if she bought them before directly giving them to him, Shinya would find them somehow. She said she had picked up the cake very early in the morning and she would be back with his dad, who was able to leave work early (maybe when his boss heard that Shinya was having a party, he decided to give his dad a bonus) to celebrate the party together. It also said to make Shinya happy, help him have fun on his special day, and that she loved them both (although Takuya could have sworn Shinya's name was written slightly larger than his).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya sighed as his brother was complaining again, \"When's breakfast?\" he whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whenever you feel like it, birthday boy,\" Takuya said sweetly, his teeth gritting together a little too hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, make me something good for breakfast,\" Shinya smirked, \"Let's try not to have another accident like the eggs and bacon cereal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're the one who came up with the idea, I merely cooked it,\" Takuya protested, \"But this time, I'll cook something I know how to. How about rice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinya looked like he had just whiffed a skunk, \"Rice? Are you kidding me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how about toast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Do you even know how to cook anything good, Takuya?\" Shinya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" Takuya snapped, getting a little frustrated, \"But as a final option, I can offer you waffles, but we're out of syrup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You don't know how sad I am on my birthday, and I haven't even been awake for an hour,\" Shinya sniffled, trying to win Takuya's sympathy. Instead of feeling sorry, Takuya felt about ready to wring his brother's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okaaay...\" he sighed, \"What do you want then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, good question,\" Shinya agreed, not even knowing what he wanted for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Toast it is!\" Takuya exclaimed, half-hoping he wouldn't fry himself in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeven minutes passed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA black pile of ashes was smoking on the plate Takuya placed in front of Shinya, \"Mmm! Doesn't that look delicious, Shinya?\" Takuya exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinya stared down nervously at the plate in front of him as if the neighbor's dog had leapt up onto the table and loudly gave him his first present of the day right on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you sooo lucky today's your birthday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinya sneered and glared evilly up at Takuya, \"Gimme cereal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I thought so,\" Takuya smirked as he took Shinya's plate and swept the pile of ashes into the garbage can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point, the pile of ashes that was once toast destined to be devoured was now doomed to a dark and cramped fate at the bottom of a garbage bag. Takuya contemplated that slightly depressing thought as he began to open the fridge for some milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe refrigerator light spilled out through the room- it was still a little dark out since it was very early, and there was limited light- they still could see the room pretty good, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you wish the refrigerator light wasn't on all the time,\" Shinya sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, where did that come from?\" Takuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Shinya explained, \"If I recall correctly, Mom and Dad caught you having a midnight snack last week all because the refrigerator light went on and blew your cover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you have a point there,\" Takuya admitted, \"But the refrigerator light isn't on all the time. It only turns on when you open the refrigerator door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinya's eyes widened as if the purpose of life had suddenly been revealed to him in an instant flash, \"What?!?\" His face took on a quality of blatant denial, \"No! You're wrong! It stays on forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll have you know it doesn't!\" Takuya said, closing the door, sealing any sign of light or absence of light away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh!\" Shinya yelled, \"You just can't see the light when you close the door like you just did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, actually you just can't see the light turn off when you close the door!\" Takuya retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But when you close the door, you close off the light, it doesn't shut off! You're so dumb, Takuya, what's going to shut the light off? There's no switch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shinya!\" Takuya called his brother's name, \"I'm telling you- How much do you wanna bet that this light turns off when I close the door?\" Takuya asked as he opened and closed the door again, grinning. He got into fights like this with his brother almost every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm! Uhm!\" Shinya hesistated with aggitation, \"Uhm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet'cha can't prove it!\" Takuya cried, \"I bet'cha can't even find something to bet on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I... I...\" Shinya stammered, nervously looking around the room for something and sweating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet'cha I can eat more cake than you!\" Shinya exclaimed loudly, jumping out of his seat and grinning with satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, thought Takuya, his eyes darts to the biggest target in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not sure about that, Shinya, Mom and Dad really want to celebrate your special day with you- I mean REALLY want to celebrate your birthday. Maybe we should wait until they-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're afraid, aren't you, HUH, Takuya?\" Shinya smirked, crossing his arms as he stood up, \"You won't do it 'cause you're chicken you'll lose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not afraid!\" Takuya cried, feeling the challenge and will to take it on building up in him. He would NOT be shown up by his little, bratty brother, Shinya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fists shook with rage as Shinya stuck his tongue out at him, \"Nyaaah!\" He was such a brat... Takuya HAD to prove that he could be better than his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya suddenly grabbed his plate and fork and handed Shinya a knife to make the first cut of the cake with, \"Make your wish, little bro! You're going down!\"</span></div></div>",

W-What do you think you're doing?!\" Takuya exclaimed, setting his own fork and plate aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinya paused for a moment and grinned up at his older brother, chocolate and frosting strewn all across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eating my birthday cake. It takes to long to use a fork.\" He replied simply while Takuya just blankly stared at him. \"I'd start eating to, if you want to win that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya was about to speak up that Shinya was being stupid, but then he saw Shinya's eyes, an unspoken challenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya gulped. And there was still no way he was letting his midget of a brother show him up when it came to eating, even if it was his special day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweating a little, Takuya pulled up a chair and began stuffing himself as well. He had to admit; his mother definitely knew how to pick out a cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya glanced up to see how his brother was faring and was disappointed to see that he was keeping up with his older brother quite nicely. If there was one thing about the Kanbara Brothers it was that they liked their food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, though Takuya was indeed a vacuum for food, he burned quite a bit of it off when he played soccer. Therefore, Takuya had remained quite thin all of his life. Though lately, he HAD been slacking off of practice, and he HAD been overeating perhaps just a bit...that's actually why his parents had been trying to limit his food intake as of lately, but Takuya had noticed any change in himself. HE hadn't gained any weight, and it wasn't like he was going to blow up to 700 pounds overnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya rolled his eyes at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoccer was also the one thing he had that Shinya didn't. While Shinya was most definitely the brainy one, he didn't have an athletic bone in his body, and preferred spending his free time indoors. Due to this, Shinya was a little bit thicker than Takuya, an had a few more curves, though with an appetite rivaling his own, Takuya wondered how Shinya had kept from inflating to the size of an elephant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Takuya thought about it, it could have been that, while both boys appetites were tremendous, Takuya ate more fatty foods, while Shinya had a more balanced diet, though he obviously had a sweet tooth from the way he was practically inhaling his birthday cake, like most small children did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya quickly glanced at the rest of the cake and growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had caught up with Shinya, the young boy having a head start when Takuya had been slightly startled by using his hands as utensils, but the boys were now neck and neck. Both had devoured about a third of the bottom layer of the cake and were still eating with no signs of slowing down soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the far recesses of his mind, Takuya cursed himself. He'd gotten himself into a real sticky situation. And there were still four layers of the cake to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just hoped that wherever his mom was that is was crowded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 hours, 2 gallons of milk, and 4 layers of cake later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya groaned as his tried to massage his belly and relieve it at least somewhat from the pain it was currently in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the kitchen, Shinya belched. The younger Kanbara brother was in no better shape compared to his older brother and was stretched out on the floor also rubbing his distended belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya, in a similar position, almost felt sorry for his younger brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had finished the cake, the giant, gargantuan, beast of a cake. It had taken two gallons of milk and all of Takuya's willpower, but he had done it; and he had won. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinya had conceded defeat halfway through the second to last layer, both had slowed down their pace considerably since the beginning of the contest, and Takuya had been left with the pleasure of devouring the last layer, though it was quite small- about the size of a normal pie and thinner than the other layers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well...maybe not pleasure...' Takuya thought and strained to get up as his stomach gurgle. He had known he had won once Shinya stopped eating, but had felt it necessary to eat the last bit of the cake to illustrate his victory to Shinya\u2026. looking back now, perhaps it hadn\u2019t been the best idea\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m never going to eat anything again\u2026\u201d Takuya moaned, finally managing to sit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya then gulped, after taking in the kitchen, Shinya, and himself.<br>\r\nThe kitchen was a disaster zone. There were pieces and crumbs of cake and frosting almost everywhere and Shinya had spilt a milk jug once leaving a rather large puddle of it trailing off of the table and into the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinya and himself didn\u2019t look any better. Both of their clothes were chocolate-stained and their faces were still covered with frosting and cake. Not to mention that their stomachs were stretched to capacity with cake and milk and had long since freed themselves from their constricting nightshirts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Takuya panicked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I cannot believe\u2026. that we ate the WHOLE cake\u2026Mom and Dad are gonna be sooo mad\u2026\u2019 He thought as he frantically tried to clean up the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronically, and much to Takuya\u2019s misfortune it was at that moment that his parents decided to come through the door, presents piled high in their arms and with a screech of \u201cHappy Birthday, Shinya!\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they saw the mess. The crumbs, the milk, the frosting, Shinya practically passed out on the floor, and Takuya smiling cheesily in the middle of it all and looking as if he had swallowed a watermelon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were calmed long enough to put Shinya\u2019s presents down before commencing into a howling fit of rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTakuya!\u201d His mother said sharply, her arms crossed. \u201cI want an explanation this instant!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to you?! What happened to Shinya!? And most importantly, what happened two Shinya\u2019s two hundred dollar birthday cake!?\u201d Takuya\u2019s father exclaimed, his face turning purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEheh\u2026hehe\u2026heh\u2026well, that\u2019s actually quite a funny story\u2026\u201d Takuya mumbled, scratching his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis parents continued to glare at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Takuya began, shuffling his feet. \u201cShinya said it was his birthday and that he got whatever he wanted, and well\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo on.\u201d His father said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe got into this argument about whether the light bulb in the refrigerator stays on or goes out when you close the door; Shinya said it always stayed on, but I knew better...and we argued some more and, um\u2026.he dared me to see who could eat most of his birthday cake\u2026and I won\u201d Takuya continued, once again trying to massage some of the pain away from his swollen gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Takuya and his parents shared a stony silence, with only the occasional moan from Shinya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen his father burst out laughing. His mother, however, gave him a stern look while she massaged her temples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTakuya, you know better than to lead your brother goad you like that- if he did. I\u2019m going to ask him when he...wakes up, I suppose. But either way, you\u2019re supposed to be a good example for your brother. Plus, you\u2019re starting to get lazier and lazier. You\u2019re up two pounds from two months ago! That\u2019s a pound a month! DO you want to end up like all those fat teenagers in America?\u201d Takuya\u2019s mom lectured, before turning and elbowing her husband. \u201cThis is no laughing matter. Shinya\u2019s already quite paunchy, do you want Takuya to end up like that as well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya rolled his eyes. His mother had a phobia of fat. He supposed it came from when she was a child; she herself had been overweight and had been teased for it. She had eventually lost the weight, but was terrified of her family packing on the pounds, thus the monthly weighing and her often references to how fat kids and teenagers in America were. Takuya had told her he\u2019d want to be a sumo wrestler once as a joke and she had actually fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya\u2019s father coughed to stifle his laughter, but an amused twinkle was still in his eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour mother\u2019s right, Takuya. IT was quite irresponsible of you and Shinya to eat his\u2026 two hundred dollar cake\u2026\u201d His father trailed off a moment, paling a bit. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t want to get fat do you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Dad.\u201d Takuya replied after another roll of his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. But we\u2019re punishing you. You\u2019re grounded for two weeks.\u201d His mother stated more calmly than she had been previously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what about Shinya!\u201d Takuya exclaimed and pointed to his brother, still in a sugar-induced coma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s his birthday.\u201d His mother replied simply, picking up said birthday boy and taking him into the bathroom to get cleaned up. \u201cI don\u2019t want to speak about this anymore Takuya.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya scowled and stormed off towards his room, leaving his father in the disaster area that was the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya growled as he just leaned against his closed door for a moment, thinking of how unfair his parents had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Shinya\u2019s the won who dared be! The brat..\u2019 Takuya thought to himself, but was suddenly interrupted when\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Takuya heard a synthesized ringing sound coming from his nightstand, on the upper right hand corner of his bed, catching him by surprise and making him sweat and jerk nervously a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he lunged towards the nightstand, his belly churned and remember that it was completely filled up with expanded cake that probably absorbed a good deal of the milk he had downed. With it sloshing around in his belly, it caused a good deal of nausea, and he had to be careful until his stomach settled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya's threw out his hand and grabbed the knob of the nightstand, pulling out the door, removing the cell phone, and opening it up, causing the ringing to cease. He hoped his parents hadn't heard it because it would be just another thing for them to take away during his grounding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA question came into Takuya's head as he sat down on his bed with cell phone in hand- who would really be calling him at this time? He was pretty sure that most of his friends were away on vacation or busy, and aside from them, no one else knew his cell phone number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya's eyes widened as he read an unfamiliar cell phone screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt displayed: 'You have recieved a new cell phone message. The following (1) message(s) is from *USER UNKNOWN*. Would you like to read this message?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was from an unknown sender... and it was a message, not a call. He had never recieved a message, not once, and he wasn't sure whether to open it or not. It might as well have been an ad, spam, or maybe even a virus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Takuya, being the bold, adventurous individual he was, gave the cell phone the OK to recieve the message. Besides, he was going to get bored very soon, he had nothing better to do now that he was grounded, and, well, he was just plain curious as to what the message was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Takuya Kanbara: It's time to decide your future. Your destiny is calling you. Take the 7:45 outbound train at the Shibuya Station. Further instructions shall await you there.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya read the message again before glancing up at the clock, also on his nightstand. It was around 2:30. Then, Takuya saved the message before snapping his cell phone shut. Clutching the cell phone tightly in his hands, he sighed deeply and fell back heavily onto his bedspread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was going on here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst of all, it was very interesting that he had recieved such a message. But what did it really mean? Sure, it told him to go to that certain train at that certain time... but what did the part about him deciding his future and his destiny calling him mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he had won some kind of contest... but he hadn't entered any that he knew of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps some secret admirer was going to meet him there... and that really got Takuya's hopes up about the whole prospect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt could be that the message was sent by some crazy hacker or killer... but that was just the kind of worried thinking that his mom usually did. His mom, the one who kept records of her sons' weights in a safe next to her tax records.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya sighed as he thought the whole thing through over again in simplistic terms. Perhaps it was some kind of greater calling... perhaps it was even aliens, or something had he just quite couldn't explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more he thought about it, the more he wanted to do it... and the more he thought about it, the more fantastic his dreams became about what would happen at the Shibuya Train Station, and the more he thought about it, the more he forgot that he was grounded. Suddenly, that nasty little thought breached his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about 3:45, and Takuya Kanbera grabbed his head and moaned as his belly gurgled. The house was, for the most part, empty as his parents had taken Shinya either out to lunch or shopping- Takuya didn't understand why because Shinya already had his presents and he probably had enough cake in him to last him a lifetime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven without the whole destiny mythos attached to the message, the pleasant thought of running away from home flourished in Takuya's mind. Even if that train went nowhere in particular, he bet he could still live a better life away from home for a week or two, or just until his grounding terms had expired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his cell phone again, and eagerly read the message. His destiny was waiting for him at 7:45, and probably, at that time, his parents and Shinya would be back... He could leave for the station now and make it! He could slip right out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCell phone in hand, Takuya twisted the doorknob of the door in front of his room and peered outwards when the door was open just a crack. The coast was clear. As he tiptoed rapidly down the hallway, he made his way right to the front door, opened it up, and his eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cool summer breeze blew straight towards Takuya. The winds reminded him that he was not ready at all to go to the train station. These divine winds also helped him realize a number of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. He really wasn't prepared for a trip to the station, never mind a trip to wherever the train was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Even if he made it right now, he would still have to wait at the station for the train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. His parents would notice that he was gone before the train left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. If he tried to run away, it wouldn't be much better than life at home because he was broke!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. He was still in his boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya then decided to withdraw to his room for the moment. He also became determined in his mind that he would take the train for sure...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would spend the remainder of the day preparing, packing his backpack with necessities, and getting ready for the journey ahead. Nobody would really bother him because he was grounded and Shinya was supposed to be in the spotlight of the world today, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya glanced up at the clock, \"5:58 PM,\" he noted as he read it. He had just about everything ready, but he was nervous and excited as ever! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth his parents and Shinya had returned from their destination: the cell phone shop to get Shinya the newest and most up-to-date cell phone as an extra birthday surprise. Takuya had the pleasure and torture of listening to Shinya try out billions of ring tones over... and over... and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, Shinya had burst into his room unexpectedly and frequently with his new cell phone or one of his new toys, showing off and smiling and bragging about how much more fun he was having. Takuya noted that Shinya's belly as well as his own wasn't as swollen and tight as before, as some digestion had gone on during all those hours. However, Takuya wouldn't have been so surprised if they put on some flab on their frames since then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, since Shinya was gloating so much, he didn't really see Takuya slip the backpack he was packing away into the shadows or a closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya simply nodded, agreed that Shinya was having a much better time than him, and made a critical evaluation of the current ring tone, making sure to include comparisons to previously displayed ring tones that Shinya had asked him about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep in a corner of his mind as Shinya left, Takuya smirked to himself. Surely he was going to have a much better time once he got to the train station. Something was going to happen there, something great- he could feel it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feelings of anticipation grew flying in him, pulsating vividly with life. It's a strange feeling of optimism one usually feels when looking forward to something with great anticipation. It's a feeling that almost pats your back, shakes your hand and tells you, \"It's gonna all get better for sure, the best of the day has yet to come, I can tell you that for sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Takuya knew for sure that the best of the day was yet to come at 7:45 tonight at the Shibuya Train Station. He smiled as he read through the message again. Either this was truly fate or he was making a big deal of it all because he was extremely bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n6:15 P.M.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toothbrush, check!\" Takuya said to himself as he put the afforementioned item into a plastic bag to go into his backpack and checked the corresponding checkbox on the supply list he had made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toothpaste, check,\" he noted as he put the tube of mint toothpaste he shared with his brother. He'd have to deal with it. Besides, he probably got some for his birthday anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Comb, check.\" Although it probably wouldn't do him much good, he put the black, plastic toothed comb in the large, refrigerator-sized plastic bag<br>\r\nhe managed to pilfer from underneath the sink when nobody was looking. It was messily labled 'Toiletries' in his own scrawly penmanship with a black permanent marker he had scrounged up from his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And... toilet paper,\" Takuya read off as he skimmed through the final section of the list, \"And that completes toiletries, which in turn is the last section of the list! I'm done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Takuya walked back into his bedroom, he closed the door behind him. At the center of his room was his backpack, looking just as stuffed as he had been that morning. He struggled to fit the plastic bag into the backpack, and after a bit of a fight, succeeded as he zipped it over and patted it, \"All set,\" he grinned as he hefted it over his body. It must have weighed about a ton, but he had packed everything he thought he'd need on a train ride, perhaps even to run away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was ready for sure, but his dad was still home at the living room, reading the newspaper. His mom, on the other hand, had gone out to the pharmacy because she suddenly discovered the family was almost out of cough syrup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya couldn't try to sneak past his dad, he'd notice him for sure, or Shinya would before him, even still. What he needed was an excuse, and a good one at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could always say that he had left his homework at home and needed to take a bus to the school and open up his locker- but that would never work. He'd always use that excuse when he wanted to get out at night, and especially now it was a well known fact in the Kanbera residence that Takuya's school was closed over the summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could... he could try and tell his dad that he still had to get Shinya a birthday present. It was true, he hadn't gotten him anything, and Shinya would be sure to complain about it- but then his dad would probably offer to take him out to get a present later or when he wasn't grounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat excuse was satisfactory and true, but still, he needed to get out and to the train station without his parents. He needed to get Shinya a present... something that required him leaving the house without Dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got an inkling of an idea... but no, it was a sacrifice on his part... still, it was the strongest possibility out there if he wanted to get to the train station on time... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n6:34 P.M<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he would do in this secondary plan is tell his dad that he had yet to give Shinya a present, just like before... except this time, he would say that he felt bad about spoiling Shinya's birthday and wanted to make it up to him by taking him fishing out on the pond a few blocks down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big con in this plan, the really big con was having to have Shinya tag along. Having to bring Shinya, the biggest pain in the rearend along with him on his mysterious destiny train ride seemed impossible... but he made it all possible. Was this truly his destiny?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only pro Takuya could see was that Shinya was probably loaded with birthday money. Money: the one thing on Takuya's list that he had yet to collect. Still, Shinya probably wouldn't let Takuya have any of the money, and he would probably tattle on him because he for sure carried and guarded his brand new cell phone. Takuya wondered if Shinya would get a message like he did if it was just a message that was sent to everyone's cell phones...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cons still overshadowed the single pro... yet there was still a chance, there was still that glimmer of hope that it just might work, that chance that Takuya would make it to the train on time, that Takuya would discover his fate and destiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, there were two options from here: Takuya could use the excuse about having to leave by himself to get Shinya a present... or he could use the excuse of taking Shinya out to fish to make it up to him on his birthday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what would Takuya say?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a brief flash of the stage lights, a loud crack emitted from the stage. Instantly, the stage floor burst into dim, blue and red clouds that drifted quietly outwards towards the audience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stage lights spun up and down, casting beams of light first at the ceiling, then slowly crossing each other, and descending down to the stage floor, where a shadowy figure rose up on a platform. A deep voiced narrator introduced the performer to the audience, \"You may have seen him in the movies or television, but never like this. Ladies and gentlemen, introducing J.P. Shibayama in his very special, first live performance.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the stage lights cast down upon the figure now standing in the middle of the dark stage and illuminated the figure, revealing a somewhat thin and muscular boy with auburn hair and warm, brown eyes. He was wearing a red bowtie, white vest, and black jacket and pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young adult known as J.P. began to sweat as he looked out to the hundreds of faces sitting in the theatre seats. It was worlds away from shooting movies or commercials, where he had made his name in fame. Not only was it his first time doing a live performance, but it was also his first time doing a magic show, something he had always dreamed about doing since he was a kid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, hi...\" J.P. smiled nervously, placing a hand behind his back as he broke out into a heavy sweat, his hundreds of lines memorized in the rehearsals suddenly vanishing in his memory bank, \"I guess you all want to know what my first trick is, right?\" he asked weakly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.P. mentally slapped himself. What about all the jokes and funny lines he had worked on to start the show with a bang to complement the special effects and voice-over announcer? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided he'd give the jokes a shot, trying to remember a good line to break the ice... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, I could never get a girl when I was younger so... no, wait, sorry... I could never go on a... Actually, I had it right the first time, I could never get a girl to like me when I was younger because...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.P. began to shiver as he got silence and a few coughs, \"...well, let's say there wasn't any reason...\" He forgot the second part of the joke... and he had just fallen flat on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a deep breath, wiped his face with a hankerchief, hoped the audience wouldn't see his shaking limbs, and prayed that all the tricks and magic would still work subconciously throughout his performance, regardless of his nervousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" J.P. smiled cheesily, rubbing his hands together, \"So, let's start on those tricks, then, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe recieved nothing more but cold silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.P. decided to cut to the chase and perform one of his more flashier tricks, leaving the less impressive, introductory card tricks for later: he'd start off his repetoire with a bang, hopefully erasing the little fumble he made towards the beginning of the act from the audience's memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... for my first magic trick, I will require two volunteers,\" J.P. stated, while mysterious, dark clothed stage hands quickly set up his materials, rolling out and assembling a collapsible table behind him for later, placing an oblong box on top of it after they were finished. J.P., of course, couldn't pay attention to any of this as he had to focus his efforts towards the audience and pick some volunteers, \"Let's see...\" he contemplated, \"You there, in the front row,\" he called, pointing to a brown haired boy in the front row. The stage lights soon revealed he was wearing a brightly colored red jacket over a yellow t-shirt and had a rather suprised and excited look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, uh...\" J.P. faltered as he saw who he had randomly picked in the audience before shrugging and continuing, \"You, in the far back row,\" he said, pointing to the farthest back, most dark, shady figure he could still discern from in the dark audience. The lights shone down and uncovered that his second victim looked rather indifferent to the fact that he had been chosen, and continued to glare with his dark eyes towards the stage with his arms crossed. He had dark hair styled in a ponytail, wore a bandana and blue clothing over a yellow t-shirt as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.P.'s eyes slightly widened, his mouth agape when he realized the identities of his two volunteers; Takuya and Kouji! He remembered them somehow... yes, he remembered now. They must have been his friends from before he started his life of fame, \"Come on up, Takuya and Kouji,\" he grinned, calling the two to the stage. Within minutes, the two boys had made their way to the stage. J.P. felt a little more enheartened now that somebody he actually knew was on stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I'm guessing both of you and the rest of the audience would like to know what exactly the first trick I will be performing is, right?\" J.P. asked, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, yeah,\" Takuya blinked, \"You know, it might reassure us if you let us know right away whether you're going to cut us open or not, J.P.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience waited for Kouji's response for a while, but he just remained standing cool and silent, arms crossed, his eyes still glaring, except this time at the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh,\" J.P. grinned, \"Ladies and gentlemen, for those who may not know, luck would have it that I selected two of my friends from the audience, and if there's one thing I can assure you of, it's that this was not planned or premeditated at all! How about that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat won a mild applause from the audience. It must have been a tough crowd that night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, for my first trick, I will make one of you guys disappear!\" J.P. cried, whipping out a slim, black wand from his pocket. It wasn't his speciality, and he knew for a fact he could have spent a bit more time practicing it, but he was firing up the audience's attention and enthusiasm, so he wanted to continue as strong as possible, even if it meant taking a risky chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, he pointed the wand at Kouji, who slightly raised an eyebrow in interest, not seeming to care on a whole at all, then J.P. pointed it at Takuya, who held up his hands in defense and squeemed a little under pressure, \"Who will it be? The audience will decide!\" J.P. cried to his audience, before pointing the wooden wand to Kouji, then Takuya, \"Kouji or Takuya? Who will it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess than a moment later, the audience all unanimously roared:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At first, a few members of the audience started to cry out the name of the boy they wanted to see have a spell cast upon and disappear. Soon, more and more people began shouting out and chanting one of the two names, however as the momentum for cheering names grew, one name emerged as the victor of the short-lived battle of cheers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kouji! Kouji! Kouji!\" the audience chanted, some throwing their fists into the air in beat with the chant. The dark haired boy raised his eyebrows, scowled, and rolled his eyes almost apathetically with his mouth slightly agape when he heard the audience's response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you've heard it, then, folks,\" JP smiled nervously, mindful that he hadn't been studying up on his stageshow magic tricks, the disappearing act being the worst of them, \"Kouji Minamoto is our lucky guy who will be the first volunteer of this show!\" The audience cheered in response. The boy in blue mumbled something to himself before sighing, putting his hands in his pockets, and closing his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Do I really have to go through with this?\" he asked through closed teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, there's nothing dangerous involved about it if that's what you're worrying about,\" JP assured his reluctant volunteer, amidst the audience's loud and overly enthusiastic cheers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji just turned his head down, smirked darkly, and sighed again, \"Whatever you say, JP... but why they'd want to see me disappear over that numbskull Takuya...\" before he chuckled, \"I can see you're quite the success with the audience, JP.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJP smirked in return before turning to face his audience, \"Let's just hope I can keep it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeads of sweat ran down the young magician's forehead, \"Uhm... ladies and gentlemen, for my first trick of the evening, I will make this boy, Kouji Minamoto disappear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the audience broke out into mild applause as he said this. Two spotlights poured down from the iron framework above the stage onto Kouji and JP as all other lights began to fade out; Takuya frowned when he sensed that he was starting to get left in the dark on stage and started to grin cheesily while tiptoing and edging off slowly, closer and closer to Kouji's own circle of light so he could be better seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJP was now breaking out into a fine stream of sweat dripping from his face, \"That's right, so, uh, let's begin!\" he continued, trying not to stall any longer, and struggling to remember what little he could from the illusion. Was it the procedure where he sent a signal out to the stage hands above by waving his wand to send smoke and lights over where Kouji was so they could swiftly drop a small, dark curtain over Kouji's body. The curtain could blend in with the background, making it appear that he had disappeared... but he began to shiver as he considered all the possibility for failure he had during those few steps, as he had barely practiced this disappearing act alone, even with an unknowing volunteer. Hopefully, Kouji wouldn't try to walk past the curtain... but even still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fear of failure started to consume JP's thoughts as he rigidly stood on stage, facing JP. Reluctantly, he grabbed his black magic wand from the dark box on the collapsible table, located conviently next to him. He could feel that not only his face was, at this point, cold and dripping with sweat as he clutched the wand stiffly in his right hand... he was going to mess up completely on this and the whole show would fall apart... his reputation as a famous actor would be ruined, and all because of some failed magic trick... why did he ever get himself involved in this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great,\" JP muttered to himself as he noticed that his shoelaces on one shoe were completely untied. He couldn't just bend over and retie them in front of an entire stadium full of people watching him. JP would have to make due.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like he was frozen with fright and had difficulty moving... as if he couldn't continue the show because JP knew all eyes were on him... scrutinizing and watching for any little slip-up he might make...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm...\" Kouji said, raising an eyebrow while he stood cooly with his hands hidden away into his pockets, \"Are you going to say any magic words or wave your wand, or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJP suddenly stood upright, \"Magic words...\" he gasped, taking a spare hankerchief out and wiping the sweat off his forehead, \"Ah, I suppose... I mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was stalling again! JP was sure he heard a few murmurs again throughout the crowd, and especially after he had gotten them all fired up... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only he could somehow leave this tricky scenario... all eyes were on him... he wanted to sit down, placing a hand against his face, breath deeply and relax, relieving him of this predicament...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, magic words?\" Takuya piped in, sticking his head into Kouji's spotlight, making only his head visible to the audience, \"Like 'Hocus Pocus!' \" he yelled, jumping into the middle of Kouji's ring of light on the stage, throwing his arms out with much gusto, and nearly bumping into Kouji. \"Or 'Alakazam!' he continued, waving his fingers in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys now shared the same spotlight, \"Yeah, sure, Takuya, whatever you say...\" Kouji snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, isn't somebody having a 'cooler-than-thou' attitude tonight, Kouji,\" Takuya cried, \"Maybe it's a good thing you'll be disappearing tonight, if not just for a little while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya glanced upwards and placed a finger on his chin after a while with thought, \"But you do have a good point. Those magic words are all generic ones, you know, stuff you hear in jokes and cartoons. Maybe JP has a real disappearing spell that he can work on you!\" This got a few cheers from the audience, but most of them were paying attention to the two boys more than the troubled JP, who shifted from side to side, not sure what to do, \"Well, what's the word, then?\" Takuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm!\" JP snapped to attention, trying to win the audience, walking toward the boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, JP fell flat on his face with a crash! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head spinning and seeing stars, JP slowly rose from the sleek, polished floor, bending a knee. Everyone was laughing at him, even Takuya, and some cheered. In fact, the only person who JP was sure wasn't laughing at him was Kouji, and even he was grinning! \"Uhm, oops?\" JP laughed nervously, pretending to smile and act like nothing had gone wrong at all. He felt horrible and extremely embarassed as his face began to turn a vivid shade of red. He got the audience's attention after all, didn't he? ... Truly, he wanted out. It was a mess-up; if only he could just rewind and start from the beginning again, if only he could redo the act!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a burst of smoke and flares exploded out of JP's wooden wand with a loud bang that cracked through the laughter, silencing everyone! The bunch of strangely forming smoke and sparkles shot out toward a wide-eyed Kouji and Takuya and soon engulfed them to the audience's awe; some gasped and others just watched intently to see what would happen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a matter of moments that stood on end and seemed to last hours, the strange clouds cleared and dissolved slowly into the air, revealing...</span></div></div>",

I find that seven minutes tends to do the trick for me,\" a golden haired girl of medium height wearing a purple cooking apron smiled warmly as she stirred a steaming pot with a wooden spoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you want to make sure that you're stirring every now and again so the pasta doesn't stick to the sides,\" Zoe explained, making a few last vigorous stirs before tapping the wooden spoon as dry as she could and placing it on the countertop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, when we return back from the commercial break, everything will be ready to eat. Then, you'll get to hear what our panelist say about how my cooking turned out, \"Now, with the remaining time we have before then, let's get to meet them,\" Zoe beamed radiantly with her brilliant blue eyes for her television audience as she walked over to a table covered in a red and white checkerboard-styled tablecloth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree boys sat next to each other at the judges table. Two of them looking nervously at the other as the large black camera's lens crossed path with their own eyes. However, the other boy, who sitted at the far right simply sighed and laced his fingers together and gaped at Zoe as she walked on screen to the far left of the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, tell me, who's our first judge, the dark looking guy sitting on the left?\" Zoe asked, being sure to smile at him. She knew him, but needed to ask so the audience would be familar with him as well. The dark blue clad boy shivered at saccharine overload he had just took in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... my name's Kouji,\" he murmured, just barely loud enough for the camera equipment to pick up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see,\" Zoe grinned, still a little unsure as to why Kouji would be on a cooking show, but she kept on nodding as she moved onto the next judge, \"And, you are-\" Zoe indicated to the next boy, who she recognized as being her friend. However her memories of him were clouded at best. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the boy in the middle wearing red and yellow, who Zoe knew as Takuya, grinned wider than she was and got a sudden burst of energy and courage to speak to the audience, \"Hi everyone out there!\" he cried, \"My name's Takuya! I was the Shibuya Junior Eating Contest Champion last summer! I can down just as much as you put in front of my plate.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he calmed down and said almost as soft as Kouji, \"It would be an honor to eat your pasta.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe cringed as she saw the next boy, who she vaguely recalled had more than a yen for her, but not much more than that. Already, she could tell he still had similar sentiments as hearts appeared in his eyes while his jaw hung slack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, and you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I ever tell you how beautiful you look with blush on? ...\" the brown haired boy known as JP gasped slowly before the total blush on Zoe's face magnified and multiplied to from it was seconds ago. She placed cool hands on her cheeks, covering her lower face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... moving on...\" Zoe glowered, her sheer embarassment turning to mild anger, \"So that will be after the break. Until then: Li vedr\u00f2 presto!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cameras rolled up and Zoe went off the set for a brief break before continuing filming. She didn't have to worry about the pasta. It was already steaming, prepared, and ready for her friends, the judges. The pasta that had been filmed and was already boiling would end up being her own lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe still couldn't believe that she persuaded the managers to allow her friends to guest judge on the show for the last episode of the season. However, she started to doubt and wonder her request after JP's certain... behavior on air... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBumbling through the crowds of cameramen and technicians came a short, stubby looking man wearing thick horn-rimmed glasses. He was sporting a thin mustache and was currently panting, his hands resting on his knees. He got up, clutching a thick packet of paper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?\" Zoe asked. She usually wasn't approached by the producer of the show during filming, especially when on air- but judging by the look on his face and the size of the packet he held in his hand, Zoe knew this could mean only one thing... the one thing she was dreading since she walked in on the set. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ratings have come in,\" he said with a grim look on his face as he quickly ran a finger through the tops of the pages, \"And I've got to say, I'm really shocked...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe twitched a little as she extended a hand to the packet nervously, \"Oh... let me see! Are they good?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! You have to film very soon- I wouldn't want you to...\" the producer's hoarse voice wheezed cautiously as he pointed to the electric 'on-air' sign that had currently been turned off. Zoe looked at the producer with a sad look on her face, and it appeared that he would reconsider, \"Alright... when does it come back on?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stage hand whispered into his ears as he nodded, his face relaxed, and he waved to Zoe that she was fine, \"I don't want you to be anticipating anything while on air, so I might as well tell you anyway. Although, it was my fault that I let you know in the middle of a show, but it is kind of important...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, come on...\" Zoe sighed tensely, \"How did the ratings turn out?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Superb, well above and beyond our estimates... and that's an understatement,\" the producer stated quickly, \"I have to say, Zoe, your cooking show has become a real success almost instantly. It's like we've struck instant T.V. gold- who would have thought that aiming a cooking show at a younger demographic would have been so... well, successful?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" Zoe closed her eyes smiled, rubbing the back of her head, \"Maybe teaching other kids how to make easy-to-cook stuff makes them a little bit more confident in their own abilities- I guess it just caught on.\" Zoe shrugged, \"But that's just my guess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, according to these reports, you're absolutely right,\" the producer exclaimed, \"You're already gathering a very large regular audience. If we were to tweak and add one or two more things and integrate some popular elements into your show, it's definitely going to be the next really big thing- I'm talking about next big popular show genre... people have had their fill of soap operas, game shows, sitcoms, and reality shows...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't understand. Cooking shows have been on for quite a while,\" Zoe said, a little confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but remember our different demographic aim to a younger audience... but with the few tweaks I mentioned before, the show should be a new T.V. cooking experience altogether.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" Zoe said, before the light on the 'on-air' sign flared back on and the theme music started playing to cue her entry, \"Oh- there I go,\" she grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Zoe said, noticing that the boys had already dug in, \"What do you guys think?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pretty good...\" Kouji muttered as he nibbled on the pasta on his fork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw man, this is the greatest...\" Takuya exclaimed as he shoveled mouthful after mouthful away, \"I've got to tell ya,\" he mumbled with his mouth full, \"You really know how to cook good food.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you...\" Zoe smiled slightly, \"And you, J-\" she was cut off when she saw that JP had barely touched his pasta and was resting his head on his hands and staring affectionately at Zoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pretty good. I like it,\" JP sighed, \"But you know what I like even more? -\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" Zoe blushed wildly again as she motioned to turn the cameras away. Her mouth and eyes twitched a little before she continued, \"Alright, so that's all for today...\" she said hastily, \"I, uhm... I'll see you next time? ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaand... fade out,\" sounded the voice of the director as Zoe ran offstage, her face still a little flushed and warm.</span></div></div>",

He then frowned slightly. Doing this would require great power, for even his power would wane. He would have to make use of his Dark Warriors...and perhaps even...Lucemon. \"We shall alter the very course of time.\" He then said causing some to gasp out in shock. \"My Lord...\" Mercurymon began, \"Begging your pardon, but not even thou hast that kind of power.\" Cherubimon surprised everyone by nodding. \"Which is why we shall ALL offer our power...to call upon Lucemon. Everyone gasped again. \"l-Lucemon?!\" Ranamon stammered. \"B-but he's sealed in the center of the Digital World!\" Cherubimon nodded again. \"And he was sealed there by the Ten Legendary Warriors, Five of which whose powers you posses. If you weaken the seal, and I offer some of my power, I'm sure that Lucemon would aid us.\" The Dark Warriors glanced around nervously. It was dangerous, but it could definately work. \"Sir...\" Duskmon startled everyone by speaking, something he rarely did. \"Will...our pasts be affected?\" Cherubimon looked at Duskmon, for what seemed like for a second, suspiscion, but quickly hid it. \"No. The humans will be taken back to the point of entering the Digital World at Shibuya Station. The spell will have caused their past to have altered, and while they will have faint memories of this time, we shall remember it clearly. Basically, its just a...repitition, only they're going to be fat.\" Cherubimon finished his explanation and the others nodded in understanding. \"Position yourselves around me and we shall call Lucemon.\" Cherubimon ordered, making sure everyone was positioned correctly, and began to chant. \"O, Supreme Dark Lord Lucemon! We call upon you in hopes of destroying those who follow the path of Good!\" A Dark Aura then gathered around the evil digimon. \"Aid your evil brethren by granting our wish with your Demonic Power!!\" Then the Dark Warriors began to glow. \"I offer my power unto you, as do the Warriors of Steel, Water, Ground, Wood, and Darkness!\" A white light then engulfs Cherubimon and flows out, over the Dark Warriors, over Cherubimon's Castle, over the Digital world, over the camp of a certain group of human children, blinding all..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShibuya Station....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene shifts to Shibuya Station where we see...  </span></div></div>",

It had a strange emblem on it currently,...but the image was fuzzy and becoming darker...was it a virus? 'No.' Takuya thought, pushing some buttons with his chubby fingers. He hadn't done anything for one to be activated. It was probably his mom. She had told him to take out the trash, but that was when a group of bullies, a few jocks from Takuya's School, began chasing him, and he ended up here. Takuya then ran a fat hand through his hair. It was his brother Shinya's birthday today, too. He then chuckled softly. His mom and cooked a huge dinner in honor of her \"big-eleven-year-old\" yesterday. Takuya subconsiously licked his lips and rubbed his stomach, which had began to growl. He had to laugh at that. He really liked his mom's cooking, or rather his stomach did. He then sighed and patted it. However, his mother's cooking also put him where he is today along with all those times going to fast food joints, secret snack stashes hidden in his room, and always going back for seconds in Lunch Period. Takuya blushed. I guess he first realized he was getting fat that one day....in about the 6th Grade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************<br>\r\n A chubby Takuya sighed as he leaned back in his chair,his belly poking out of his shirt, straining his jeans, and picking his teeth. It was his first day of 6th Grade and it was going pretty well. It was the first year he was eligible for soccer, and he had been hoping to join the team. \"Well,well,well.\" Takuya heard a snide voice say, and looked up to see a 7th Grader from the Soccer Team and gulped. \"Takuya Kanbara. I hear you're trying out for the team this afternoon.\" \"Yes.\" Takuya replied, sweating. The older kid was now circling him, as if inspecting him. Suddenly, something caught his eye and he smirked and stopped. Takuya gulped again. \"What do we have here?\" The boy asked, and reached down and poked the substantial layer of flab with his index finger. Unfortunately, that was a place Takuya was extremely ticklish, so he surprised the boy by laughing hard, his belly jiggling. Too bad his pnats couldn't take it. The extreme force of the laugh had caused the buttons of Takuya's pants to blow right off...hitting the boy in the head. Takuya gulped and stopped laughing. The whole classroom had eyes on them now. The boy looked ready to kill. \"You...you pig! Don't bother showing up today. You're to fat anyway. You'd just fall, fat boy.\" The words stung and Takuya winced at the leaving figure of the boy, who happened to be muscular for his age. Everyone was laughing now, but the boy was true. He laid a hand on his stomach. He was fat. He then slumped back into his seat, red-faced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, he didn't show up for tryouts. The name calling started the next day. Of course, Takuya had ALWAYS been chubby before that, but after that day...his depression on the revelation that he was too fat to play soccer, and his already glutonous eating habits caused him to baloon after that. He then sighed. He had even tried diet and exercise...but nothing worked, like it was almost magical. Takuya then shook his head, clearing it from the events of the past, and refocused his attention to the cellphone, which now asked if he wanted to come, and yes and no buttons. 'What the heck.' Takuya thought and pressed yes. He might have and aventure. He then decided to go talk to another kid, preferably a fat one, like himself.  <br>\r\nHe goes over to...</span></div></div>",

'Gee, this guy is too depresssed. I mean I'm fat as well, but c'mon! Takuya was determined to cheer Kouji up. A light bulb then appeared over Takuya's head. He reached over and lifted up Kouji's shirt, almost admiring Kouji's prominent stomach. \"Really, you don't look TOO fat..\" Takuya almost immeadiately had his hand slapped away by a rose-red Kouji. \"I-I didn't give you permission to touch me OR look at how freakishly fat I am!\" Takuya cringed, but quickly recovered, putting his hands up in peace. \"You can see my belly in return. \"Takuya then lifted up his own shirt, showing his own belly resting on his pants. Kouji almost fell off his seat. \"Who ever said I wanted to see it!?\" Kouji screamed. He then calmed down, however, and poked it, watching waves go through Takuya's thick layer of belly fat. Takuya squeeked and pulled his shirt back down. \"I didn't say you could poke it!\" he shouted, but calmed when Kouji gave him a grin. He finally got a smile out of Mr. Ice King. \"I couldn't resit! It just looked so round and soft and-\" Kouji was cut off by Takuya poking his belly and his own squeeking. \"You mean like yours?\" Takuya asked, with a cat-like grin plastered to his face. Kouji only smiled back. \"Yes I do.\" he stated, and began to poke Takuya again. <br>\r\nThe two then engages in a poke war for the next few minutes and were left panting, their shirts riding up and showing their chubby bellies, but them not caring at the moment. Takuya then spoke up. \"Hey, since your train isn't here why don't we go grab a bite at the cafe?\" He asked, jerking a thumb in the direction of the nearby restaurant. He then patted his stomach. \"These things don't feed themselves!\" Takuya said, while winking. Kouji could only smile, despite his earlier depression. \"True.\" He replied and waddled after Takuya.

Yes, I'll be there soon.  Yep.  Ok.  Bye!\" he spoke fast.  He clicked the phone off and smirked.  He pointed straight at Kouji's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I'll deal with you later, chubs.  I got a date.  Something you'll never be able to enjoy,\" Kento laughed.  He signaled his buddies to follow and the three trudged off down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Wow.

Don't worry, I like my men meaty.\" She had then proceeded to pull up his shirt and play with his belly. The names and the large clothing started the day after.

I am of the chunky variety.\" Takuya said, while patting his own mound of fat. Kouji was surprised. \"...You're not embarassed?\" he then asked. Takuya giggled. \"You should be proud of your extra belly rolls.\" Takuya stated, patting Kouji's stomach. \"I mean sure sometimes I get picked on, but if others have to use me to have fun, let them. They're pretty pathetic if they do, though. I was taught to always be proud of your body and who you are, and if Takuya Kanbara was destined to be fat, so be it.\" Kouji was amazed.

Its better than moping about it.\"Takuya then flashed Kouji another trademark grin. \"Besides, I can eat how much of what I want to whenever I want to!

We only managed to change the girl, &amp; the boys are back to normal. What's worse, she still has her spirits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you's is sayin' she could up &amp; go Kazemon or Zephyrmon on us?\" Timbermon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but the weight will transfer into them, making them weaker, &amp; the boys are starting over from square one.\" Cherubimon said. \"Despite this mishap, we still have a chance at victory, maybe we can even use them now...We shall leave them be &amp; let things run their new course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXxXxX<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Zoe was standing on the train fidgeting. For the first time a boy was talking to her, &amp; he was actually kinda cute. Sadly, her physique had kept most boys at bay, and she had developed a shy persona, but she was sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Come on Zoe! Think of something cool to say to him!' she thought as Takuya sat on a bench. To her surprise, he called her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zoe, wanna sit by me?\" He asked, patting a seat right by him. As far as Zoe could tell, it was a friendly question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure...\" the chubby girl said. She then sat her ample, pear shaped body by him, a bit of her flab touching him. However, he didn't move, he actually seemed to like the contact, but didn't press into her more than needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe continued to blush, when she felt her phone grow warm. She pulled it out and she and Takuya watched as it changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A D-Vice...\" Takuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what?\" Zoe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, D-Vice. The name came to me.\" he said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds cool.\" Zoe said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as cool as you.\" Takuya said quickly. For some reason he liked this girl. Although he never had a thing for big girls, this one seemed special, although he felt she'd be slightly annoying if she was thin.\"Hey Zoe, I know this is random, but do you wanna go out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe nodded happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's my brother's birthday today, but I can meet yo-\" The goggle head began, when the train stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he and Zoe looked out, they saw that they weren't at the train station anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The digital world?\" Zoe said to herself, getting a mild headache. She wobbled a bit and Takuya tried (very hard) to keep her stable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zoe!\" Takuya yelled, \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah. Just a bit confused.\" Zoe told him. \"Thanks for holding me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the two of them left the train and began to explore, finding no way home.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like we can't leave, but something tells me we should  go on that date now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay.\" Takuya said, \"I think I know this place.\" he then took her hand. \"Come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe blushed even more but inwardly was celebrating. 'My gosh, Takuya's holding my hand! This is so perfect!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the two arrived at Agunimon's cave.

But it's cool because I got to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the two of them finished, they stared into one anothers eyes, when Takuya's phone buzzed, he opened it and it became his D-vice, and he became Agunimon. </span></div></div>",

Please try to keep the story clean, as the story is rated 13 and up. Basically, Takuya is depressed because he thinks he has been eating to many meat apples lately, with not enough exercise. A certain giant bunny-eared digimon sees this through a crystal ball and begins to wonder how he can use this information to \"slow down\" the Keepers of The Spirits of The Ten Legendary warriors. In the beginning they also haven't discovered Kouichi yet, but he my be added down the line. Try to keep the weight gain rate equal for both males and females. (You can add characters.)</td>",
