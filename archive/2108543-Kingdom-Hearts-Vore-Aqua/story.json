The last thing she remembered was traveling the lanes between when suddenly a massive unversed appeared. Yes now she remembered, she had engaged the squid like monster in battle, but before she could make much progress one of its tentacles had hit her in the head and knocked her out cold. The next thing she knew she was waking up in this strange world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to catch that unversed!\" Aqua exclaimed now that she remebered. She quickly scrambled up to her feet and reached her arm up to the armor on her arms to activate her keyblade armor only to find it wasn't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?\" Aqua gasped as she looked herself over for the first time since waking up. It was only now that she realized that not only was her arm armor missing , but so were her boots and stockings leaving her barefoot. <i>A native of this world must have robbed me while I was out</i>, Aqua thought. She knew that if was going to catch up to that unversed she would have to risk the lanes  between without her armor despite how dangerous it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh Aqua closed her eyes and reached out her hand to summon her keyblade, but nothing happened. Her eyes snapped open as she gasped in surprise. Fear starting to fill her heart Aqua quickly began to try and cast all the spells she knew only to find that none of them worked. Whatever this world was it was preventing her from using her keyblade and any form of magic. Realizing, she had to find a way off this world Aqua finally examined her surroundings and discovered she was..</span></div></div>",

She was at some kind of suburban home, but that was not what worried her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOW DID I END UP SO SMALL?!\" Aqua cried out. Compared to her surroundings she seemed to be only one inch tall. Sure this wasn't the first time she had been shrunken, but that had only been a temporary thing. With how things were going for Aqua it seemed like she was going to stay this way. After hyperventilating for a moment the young keyblade master forced herself to calm down and see which part of the house she was in.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">When Aqua encounters a giant unversed in the lanes between she gets knocked during the battle. When she wakes up she finds herself trapped in a strange new world where she finds herself unable to summon her keyblade or use her magic. However, to make matters worse Aqua soon discovers that just about everything on this world is hungry and she is on the menu. Now helpless and surrounded by hungry predators she must find a way to survive and escape this world or end up in a hungry creature's belly. Can Aqua survive or will she just become a tasty meal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n1.) SOFT VORE ONLY!!!<br>\r\n2.) As this is a vore story most storylines must end with Aqua getting eaten. <br>\r\n3.) Aqua is NOT immune to the digestive process, so if she gets eaten that is the end for her.<br>\r\n4.) Enemies from the games are allowed to be preds as long as they are capable of eating Aqua.<br>\r\n5.) Be descriptive.<br>\r\n6.) Have fun.</td>",
