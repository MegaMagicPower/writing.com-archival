With sleep still clutching you, you roll out of bed, landing with a dull thud on the floor. You groggily get up, and smoke fills your lungs. You bend down and cough, expelling your lungs of the smoke. You crawl on the floor over to your door, which had been cracked open. You push it all the way open to find the hallway engulfed in flames. You can't hear your parents, and only assume the worst. What you do hear, however worries you far more than the whereabouts of your parents. You can hear the ceiling getting weaker by the minute, and you knew you needed to make your escape fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look forward, planning your route through the towering flames. You soon find it, and make a mad dash for the nearest exit. Halfway down the hallway, the ceiling gives, and collapses. You find yourself pinned under drywall, and wood. It is too heavy for you to move, and your position has your left arm extended in flames. You quickly draw back, and shake off any flames that lingered. You begin to desperately cry for help of any kind as the flames threatened to engulf you entirely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds you hear something in your mind. It was a voice. \"Do not fear, I am here to help\" was what it had said. You are a bit confused, but thankful that whoever heard you wanted to help. You can feel the debris being lifted off of you. Whatever it was that was helping you was picking up the burning debris and throwing it off to the side. You can see just how mangled your body was now, and you had started to go into shock. You look up at your savior to curiously find a 4 foot tall Lucario standing over you, covered in soot and shrouded by smoke. The Lucario bends down, and gently picks up your mangled body, and carries you to safety outside the house. Ambulances, firetrucks and police cars surround your home. Your parents are still nowhere to be found. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are taken from Lucario's arms and placed in an ambulance where you are rushed to the hospital. Lucario rides with you to make sure you are safe. You stare at the being that saved you the entire way, wondering why such a creature would waste its time with you. You feel fatigue start to set in, and soon you fall asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up in a hospital bed. You are in a clean room with white walls, and some pictures of flowers you can't identify on the walls. There is a window to your left with the shades closed. A T.V. sits on the wall in front of you. There is only one bed in the room, and two chairs, one occupied by the same Lucario that graciously saved your life. Lucario notices that you are awake, and speaks to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its good to see that you're awake. How do you feel?\" you hear inside your head. The voice you hear is...</span></div></div>",

You manage to gain the strength to say, \"Who... are... you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario answered with a monotone, in that same gruff emotionless voice, \"I am your guardian. You almost were killed along with your parents, and I couldn't let that happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went into hysterical denial. <i>No, parents couldn't have died. I saw them minutes ago. They said they'll be back. This can't be happening.</i> \"UGH!\" <i>Too... weak...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario could only understand your cry of pain. He stood up and walked next to you. \"You need your rest. Tomorrow we must get going though. We don't have much time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how crazy he sounded, he was right. You were still in pain. But why must he only along this day for R&amp;R? Nevertheless, you feel tired, and collapse back on the bed. Lucario stood by your side until you drifted into that peaceful state again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>THE NEXT DAY</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up well rested. Surprisingly you feel well-rested, maybe they prescribed a Chansey egg while you were asleep. You grab your stuff (Which Lucario also brought from the remains of the fire), put on some clothes, and look for Lucario. You don't see him in the waiting room, so you head outside. Sure enough, he was in the parking lot. However, instead of the 4 foot tall guardian you last saw him as he was...</span></div></div>",

He took him inside a deceptively small cave that expanded into a massive, beautiful open room. The ceiling of the cave reached nearly a thousand feet high, and it had a solid square mile of space to work with. He took you to a spot in the middle of the back area, and in there was a massive bed, probably 40 feet wide and 200 feet long. Once you were on there, he let you go, his now 12\u2019 tall frame guiding you to the center. \u201cThis is the softest part by far,\u201d he told you as he ran/crawled to the other side of the bed to grab a massive, fluffy blanket. He held you tight against his chest, his now watermelon sized biceps licking you in place against his equally big pecs and 8-pack abs. He threw the blanket over the two of you, and as he did so, you shuddered in pure bliss. The blanket was the softest thing you had ever felt, second to lucario himself. Both were warm, and the bear hug lucario was giving you combined with the blanket meant you struggled to stay awake for longer than a few seconds. He chuckled, this place was<i> truly</i> amazing. He dozed off after a few minutes as well, trying to stay awake as he slowly swelled bigger, watching his arms grow from watermelons to exercise balls before finally falling asleep.</span></div></div>",

It took nearly all your courage to stay put. Finally, you caught sight of his face. He was looking down at you with a very slight smile. Is this seriously the same guardian that saved you? It couldn't be. There's no way he grew this big overnight. Seeming to sense your thoughts, Lucario chuckled a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really can't believe its me, can you?\" He asked, almost playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"w-well... its n-not everyday s-someone grows 96 a-additional feet...\" You sputter looking away. Lucario simply chuckled once more. He seemed to be having fun with his new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now. There's no reason to be afraid of me.\" Lucario said as he placed a finger underneath your chin and directed your vision back up to him. His expression was much softer than usual, and he still had that same half-smile. \"I told you I was your guardian. I'm here to protect you; not harm you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor someone that seemed so cold and heartless, you had to admit, he at least acted very friendly. Lucario's half-smile faded. Now he just looked sort of sad. He silently placed a paw on the ground for you to climb on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on... We must go.\"</span></div></div>",

Could he seriously expect you to believe him? He's a freakish monster! No matter what he says he can't be trusted. Your mind began to focus on that Lucario and every ridiculous thing he said. Though you had to give him credit, he really did seem sincere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou totally lost your focus, and when you finally snapped back to reality, you realized you were no longer touching ground. You were alone in the middle of a deep lake, with a huge monster coming after you. It was right out of a nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>thump</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast was getting closer. Going back wasn't an option. It was either go forward, or stay here; and with Lucario's height, there's nothing stopping him from stepping in the lake, and then on you. You look over to the other side. It was quite a distance, and you weren't sure you could make it... but it was your only shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>thump</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that last thump,  you start making a mad dash towards the far bank. If you could just make it to where you could touch ground again, you'd be okay. You were never that great at swimming, but it was worth a shot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>thump</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to pick up your pace, but you can't go any faster. As a matter of fact, you were starting to get really tired at this point. You began to think this really was the end. You weren't going to make it. You took a look back to see Lucario emerging from the trees. You were right. He was hunting you...  or so you thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>thump</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push harder than you ever had in your life. It was now or never. You had to make it for your life. You wildly swim as fast as you can. You can hear Lucario's voice, but can't make out the words. You didn't care. You just wanted to be away from the freak. You continue to push yourself, and can feel your arms about to give out. You are gasping for air as you begin to slip underwater. You can hear Lucario splashing after you, and you just gave up. It was all over now. Either way, you were dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were underwater for all of four seconds when you were lifted out. Lucario held you in his paw, looking down on you rather frightened. You sputter and cough, while Lucario looked on helplessly. He pats your back to try and help. After a little bit, you can breathe right again, and speak. You look up at him, furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you just let me drown?! At least then I would have been happy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario looked at you shocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm your guardian. I'm never letting any harm come to you.\" Lucario said, desperately trying to convey the message that he really was good.  You were starting to get tired of this whole business. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I know you're not, so drop the stupid act.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no act. I am your protector and guardian. Granted, I didn't try to grow like this, but regardless, I'm still here to protect you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...WHY!?\" You gave up. He was just going to keep insisting that he was no matter what. You knew that now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some people are put on this earth for the sake of others. We may not know our purpose, but I strongly believe I am here to be a protector. I've always hated violence of any kind.  I've found myself protecting others. Not just pokemon, but humans as well. It's almost second nature to me. I do not wish to harm anyone. Least of all the person I feel bound to protect.\" Lucario said to you, hoping the finally got through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... why me?\" You ask, feeling like maybe he really was telling the truth.. In that case, you felt awfully bad about the way you've treated him so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario thought for a long time before he answered. He never really knew himself. He had lived near your home ever since he was a kid, and when your parents brought you home from the hospital for the first time. He was a tiny Riolu back then, and he caught sight of you. He even sneaked up to the window to steal a look at you. He didn't really know why, but he just had a feeling that he and you would be fantastic friends. He explained all this as a smile slowly crept across his face. He looked truly happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't quite sure whether or not to believe him, but he seemed sincere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do now?</span></div></div>",

Your body shakes, the chill of the water seeping into your bones. \"I'm all alone now.\" Your eyes slide closed, and you sneeze and shiver. \"My parents are gone. I don't know anybody out here. I can't... I can't live like this,\" You mutter, shaking within Lucario's paw. \"I just can't-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not alone.\" Lucario's 'voice' rumbles through the air, his paw curling to hold you. His free paw moves over you, a single section resting on your shoulders, as light as the massive creature can manage. \"For all it's worth, you have me.\" He nods as he beings to walk, his body trailing water as he steps out from the lake, moving you to the shore. \"And I promise, I'll be here for you. Whatever may come, I'll protect you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cough a couple of times, wiping away a bit of water. \"That's... That's not what I need now,\" Tears starting to drip down your already-soaked face. \"I don't want a protector, I want... I want my parents back... I... why didn't you protect them?\" Your arm pushes over your eyes, only soaking your face further. \"Why couldn't you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis finger slides down your back. \"I am... Sorry. If I could have, I...\" His eyes close as he places you down onto the dirt. \"I was not able to save them. It took everything I had to save you. I cannot change that. All I can do now is take care of you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I can't...\" You cough again, your body shaking. Lucario's eyes flick open at your cough, and he crouches down. His massive head approaches you, and you reel back at the sight. His eyes focus on your body and your dripping clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're soaked. At this rate, you will catch something. Let me dry you off, at least.\" His arms move close, his paw gripping you by the neck of your shirt. You push your hands back at him, but he tugs your dripping shirt off before he slides his paw against your sides, lifting you off the ground. You grumble, but you're too exhausted to argue or struggle. You keep still as Lucario lays against the ground, head tilted up by one of the larger rocks. He brings you against his body laying your against his abdomen. His fur presses in, but even as it catches the water dripping from your body, it remains softly and warm. You shift about, your body turning in as you sink against his form. But you twist and turn, unsteady as you shift around in the massive mounds of fur. Your hands move down, searching for some purchase to hold onto. They make contact with his body, and you grab on, holding as tight as you can to the flesh underneath. Lucario flinches for a moment, but he nods down at you. \"Are you comfortable now? Warmer now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes turn up from the fur to look back up at his eyes. Lucario takes a breath, your body rising and falling with the gasp of air. You manage a small nod, before your eyes slide closed again. \"Yeah. Th... Thanks,\" You mutter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lucario nods, his stern expression cracking as he looks down at you. \"I... understand that this is difficult for you. And I understand that you would... prefer to be with your parents. I cannot change that. But... I will protect you. I want to do whatever else I can for you, too.\" His massive paw lifts up from his side, and rests onto your back. \"I cannot replace your family. But... I care for you. And I will try to take care of you, if you'll let me. If you need more than a protector, then I can try to be... Your friend? Your family? I don't know what it is, but whatever you need...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sniffle, shifting in to warm up. You tilt your head up, eyes meeting Lucario's. Even through the concern and hesitation in his eyes, you see the twinkle in his eye. A faint memory stirs, and for a moment, you could swear you remember that same spark, held in the eyes of a little Rilou. You take a breath and push into his fur, hands pressed to his body. Underneath his cozy fur and his lithe frame, you could feel the warmth and strength that he possessed. He was dangerous, that much is certain. But when you see him break into an actual smile, your body fills with relief. You know that he'll protect you, come what may. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just hope you can trust him to be more than just your protector. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" You murmur, your voice muffled when you speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Are you sure?\" Lucario's smile widens. It's hard to picture it with his deep, rough voice and his looming size, but you can see that Rilou grinning at you again. You give a small nod, and a sudden flood of warmth and elation fills your very being. \"I... Thank you. I promise, I'll prove that I can protect... That I can take care of you. That you'll never be alone while I'm around.\" Lucario tilts up, one paw bracing you against his body. When he stands, you're settled against his paw, cradled between his fingers. \"I promise.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face cracks into a small smile, and you nod in return. \"And... And I'll try to trust you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario stands, both paws clasping around you. His head pushes in, and his nose bumps against your body for a moment, a nuzzle coming from the massive beast. But it only lasts a moment. His head tilts away, his smile fading as he looks around. That warmth around you starts to fade, Lucario's expression growing serious as his rumbling voice sounds out in your mind. \"I wish we had more time, but we need to get going, now. It isn't safe here. If you need to rest, you can do it. I'll carry you.\" His paws lift you up and clasp you close to his chest, holding you like he'd hold a precious, fragile jewel. The world around you blurs as he begins to move, his quick strides carrying you away from the lake in moments. \"We can speak again when it's safe.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod up at him, and sit within his paws, watching the scenery flash by while he runs. But your eyes can't stay open much more, and your body strains to stay steady. Somewhere along the way, everything turns into a haze, and you drift off to sleep within Lucario's grasp.</span></div></div>",

Listen do you want me to stay here while you sleep, or do you want me to wait outside?\"  You then for some reason said for him to wait outside even though you didn't want too.  \"Ok, when you're checked out, I'll be waitning in the parking lot ok.\"  You nod and went to sleep.  You dreamed of Lucario holding you, but not with his arms, but his paw.  He was 100 feet tall tall and you were in his palm.  He looked down with a smile and said.  \"No matter how big I am, I'll always protect you.\"  The dream then began to fade.  You woke up.  You put on your clothes (which is a purple sweater, long jeans, a red scarf, purple boots, and a hat).  You took your backpack that your father gave to you when you were 4.  You're now 8 years old and that memory seemed like a long time ago.  As you were checked out at the front desk, then went outside to the parking lot Lucario said he would meet.  You the.

Then lots of red eyes show up.  You were scared and tried to run away from the creatures that were watching you.  But the creatures give chase and try to catch you.  When you look back it's an army of Pokemon that are the size of a building.  You kept running but every time you feel like you'll get away they're always closer.  They finally catch up to you, you're surrounded by giant Pokemon.  Just when you thought this was the end,  somebody picked you up and held you closely to their chest.  It was Lucario.  You hugged him tightly hopping that he will be able to stop these Pokemon.  The Pokemon growl at him and then you hear voices not from Lucario, but from the Pokemon?!  \"Give here to us!\"  <br>\r\n\"She's tasty!\"  <br>\r\n\"She makes a great meal!\"  You were utterly horrified by what they were saying,  but Lucario then tells them.  \"What are you doing to this poor little child.

You then ask, \"Where are we.\"  As you look around to see light on top and darkness on the bottom, Lucario laying down which makes sense since it's a cave although it is big enough to keep Lucario's height but I guess he wanted to make it easier for you to sleep on his fur.  <br>\r\n\"This is my domain.\"  He says.<br>\r\n\"It looks kind of scary as you tightly press on Lucario's fur.  <br>\r\nLucario notices this and says, \"Don't be scared.

I suppose I should tell you before things really get out of hand. I am your guardian. I am here to protect you and look over you.\" Lucario said smiling. She seemed very caring and kind. You could most definitely see her being a guardian, but what did she mean by \"before things really get out of hand\"? And why you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Miss?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario looks over at you curiously. \"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why me? And what's going to get out of hand?\" You ask a little worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario merely smiles and says \"You'll soon find out. In the meantime you should rest.\" She then gently runs her paw over your head, almost as if you were her child. You feel very sleepy, and in a few minutes you do indeed fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou seem to awaken in an open field. You turn around to see a massive black paw in front of you. You look up to see Lucario's face happily smiling down at you. You notice that she had to be 400 feet tall, at least. Your first thought is to run, and at that thought, you see Lucario's face immediately sadden. She actually looked as if she was going to cry. She reached down, and gently scooped you up in her paw. She brought you close to her face, and gently nuzzled you. Your fear soon dissipated, and Lucario's face immediately lit up again. \"No matter how big I am, I'll always be here for you. I'll always protect you. No matter what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon find yourself back in your bed. It was merely a dream. You look around the dark room to find Lucario sleeping soundly in one of the chairs. You breath a slight sigh of relief. Even though she was still friendly, you didn't know how badly you wanted to see her that large. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking those lingering memories of the dream out of your mind, you fall asleep again. Your dream involved Lucario once more, however she was normal sized this time.The two of you spent the dream playing with one another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you awoke, the room bright. You seem to feel much better. You look around and notice Lucario is gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is your next move?</span></div></div>",

She checks to make sure everything has healed properly, working quickly, seeming to avoid any eye contact with you for long periods of time. You wondered about this, especially since it was the job of a nurse to take good care of a patient. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe checks you out with a good bill of health and sends you on your way with what little belongings  you had. You suppose Lucario brought them from the remains of the fire. Speaking of which, you hadn't seen Lucario for a good while now, and wonder where she went. You had hoped she wasn't just a dream... No, she couldn't be... Last night was all too real for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit confused, you walked out of the hospital, squinting at the bright morning sun. You looked around, but still no sign of your blue savior from the night before. Starting to get worried, you begin to search for her, heading towards the park nearby. As you make your way through the trees, you notice the very tip of a familiar blue tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucario?\" You ask, being cautious in your approach. The tip disappears as a small whimper is heard. You guess that either she was upset, or this wasn't the Lucario you were looking for. You begin to turn away, when a voice stopped you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes? I-its me...\" The voice confirmed that this was the being you had been searching for, but she sounded frightened. You found this strange as she had seemed so confident before, and now here she is hiding behind a tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucario, what's wrong? You seem... upset to say the least..\" you approached her hiding spot to which she protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't come any closer! I.. I don't want you to run away... or fear me like everyone else...\" her voice quivered a bit at that last word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly Lucario. Why would I run away from a gentle guardian like yourself?\" You were genuinely concerned for her. She paused for a minute before answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... remember that dream you had last night... Where I was huge?\" she seemed to sniffle a bit as the words came from her. The thought of you fearing her obviously very upsetting to her. You nod, saying you remembered and waited for her response, but one never came. Instead she stepped out from behind the tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat greeted you, you would have never expected. You expected Lucario, sure, but not like this. Before she was only four feet tall. You were taller than her by a whole head, but now she completely towered over you. The tips of her ears were brushing against the leaves of the trees high above the ground, even with her head directed downward at you. Her face seemed dim with sadness and concern, and slightly damp. Her massive form rose high above you, seeming to emanate pure power. Such a thing might be more intimidating if she didn't look so sad. Along with her height you notice her muscles were much more defined now and it looked as though she'd been bodybuilding for a couple years. Raw power seemed to be spilling out from all over her body as you looked up and down her 20 feet of height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a step back, slightly intimidated by Lucario's new size. This backwards movement caused a peep from Lucario who slowly lifted her thick, powerful arm, reaching after you as if to say \"don't go\". You looked up at her face and you could see the same gentle eyes and spirit of the guardian from you dream. You remembered how she reassured you she'd never harm anyone... that she was there to protect you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a few steps forward, you thrust yourself into Lucario's powerful abs, throwing your stick-like arms around her in a hug you could only describe as feeble compared to her strength. You felt Lucario's gargantuan arms gently surround you like two gentle pythons softly pressing you into the soft fur on top of the steel that was her abs. You smiled at the warmth and comfort she offered despite her monstrous size and near unwieldy power. Every last bit of it was completely under her control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hug ended and Lucario sat down in front of you, still towering over you despite being only one half of her actual height. She smiled and invited you to sit with her, opening her arms as she motioned towards her lap...</span></div></div>",

You took amazing care of me, and I longed to be with you. When you were in trouble I willed myself into existence, and your love gave me the power to do it. And that's the reason I can grow so large. I know you may not have wanted me as a giant, but your care and love for me made my power grow and grow and grow.\" She finished as she wrapped her warms around you, gently nuzzling your head with hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that last statement your stare at her.

Being here with you, it feels like I can't hold all that affection in...like it's building so much, my body...I just need to...\" she huffs and smiles wider, closing her eyes, as her body takes it from there, and swells up even bigger, 65 feet surging smoothly up towards 85...105...130! She towers well-over the trees now, the canopy snuggling her giant rump like a blanket or seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so incredible, how easily you get bigger,\" you peep, a little embarrassment returning, at the thought of something so monstrously powerful being so sweet and comforting. Even at such a massive size, she's softer and kinder than any human has ever been, and you just can't help nuzzling in on her thick fur, settling into her still-growing body like it was a huge quilt on a cold day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you!\" she giggles, now fully-smiling at last. It seems you've picked up her spirits, which only makes her tremble all over, as she lurches even larger, leaping up in a powerful spurt to 190 feet, sitting down. Her rear swells out over the green stretch of forestry below, little birds fluttering away, before returning to perch on her stubby tail; more and more join as it, and she, grows and grows on, rocketing higher and higher and higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n300 whopping feet of female Lucario looms over all, with only the tall mountains and clouds above her. She dips far down with her muzzle and begins to dryly, softly groom you over, moving her huge thumbs back just enough so that she can clean the back of your head and neck. She's so warm! Each lash is like snuggling velvet, her soft, pink tongue so smooth and gentle as it rolls in and out over you, again and again. Even the tongue gets larger and larger, more and more pink covering you as you feel her rumbling and swelling even more, getting bigger and warmer and softer, the larger she bulges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose who had run away in terror, feeling they were finally far enough away for comfort, turned around, and their collective jaws dropped. The once big Lucario was now utterly...massive! Sitting in place, same as she had been, she nonetheless loomed high at 600 feet! Even from afar, a soft aura began to spread everywhere, as her loving nature showed. In fact, as she hiccuped another 100 feet larger, in one huge burst of size, said aura just spread further out, an d all hostility or fear on their parts began melting away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep growing,\" you whisper, as she finishes grooming on you, her soft muzzletip swelling hugely against your little face and chest. You chuckle and rub atop it thankfully, as best you can, before she whimpers in joy, trembles, and doubles in size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haaaaah,\" she pants, gulping happily. \"T-thank you...for staying with me...and letting me be your protector. The bigger I grow, the safer you'll be, here in my arms...\" she purrs, as her eyes flutter cutely, and she lurches even taller, her form ballooning to nearly a mile in size! Her footpads tower over homes, trees, hills, you name it--and she's still shaking with growth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your one-fiftieth of the way there!\" you laugh, making her blush hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could be...even bigger than that...if you wished it!\" she rumbles, as the fur around you swells out, strands and fibers lengthening into a vast jungle against your tiny body, as she grows, and grows, and grows, and grows...</span></div></div>",

Tears begin to form in her eyes as she watches you tremble in complete terror. She closes her eyes once again as she slowly begins to sit down. As her butt makes contact with the ground, a tear falls from her eye and makes its way down her immense cheek. You could hear her softly sobbing, knowing she's scared you too badly to communicate at all now. Lucario continues sobbing as her hands near the ground. You slip off her hand and quietly try to slink away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario promptly noticed that you sneaked off her hand. Her sobbing only intensified as she knew you were trying to get away from her. In her eyes, she was no longer a guardian. She saw herself only as a monster now. She didn't look at you. She knew that any interaction with you now would only make the situation worse. All Lucario could do was sob as your fear kept you backing away from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were terrified, but as you looked up as the blue behemoth wept, you noticed your feelings weren't just fear. You felt somewhat guilty for making the gentle titan cry so hard. You weren't really all that great at identifying emotions, but you could clearly tell the poor girl was heartbroken. You took a few steps, attempting to go forward, but your fear had you going the opposite direction. Three more steps and you were completely running away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Please don't run away!! I would never ever hurt you, I swear....\" Lucario reached after you as you dashed into the woods. \"I'm sorry....\" she quietly added as you disappeared from her sight. You kept your back firmly against a tree, and peeked out at her. She looked so completely sad, sitting there on the ground crying. You then noticed a lump in your throat as you watched her. The one human who she felt bound to protect; The one person she felt comfortable around, and you've completely crushed her heart. But you couldn't help it! She was utterly titanic! But the more you watched her weep, the more you realized she... maybe wasn't so bad. She was crying over you after all... and she really never did hurt you... and the more you thought about it, she really was gentle when handling you. She was so mindful of you, and to her, you were everything. The fact that she was weeping over you along with the fact that she <i>did</i> save your life, and you finally saw her for what she really was. A truly gentle giant guardian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there with your back against the tree for a while longer, thinking about what to do.</span></div></div>",

She\u2019s worked up; it wouldn\u2019t be safe to just walk up to her right now. You decided that Lucari just needed some time alone, allow her let it out. It\u2019ll be good for the girl\u2026maybe. Or maybe it might not be; you can\u2019t tell. Either way, you just let her cry her out. She\u2019ll be better afterwards, right? Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down with your back to the trunk and listen to her sobbing for you. You feel terrible, all she wanted was to protect you and keep you safe.

She lay down and curled up facing the woods, all for the small hope that you would come back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hearing the lack of noise, you slowly exit the woods and walk up to her.  You see her eyes are red from crying so hard. You slowly walk up to her, trying to ignore the last twinges of fear trying to get you out of there. Compassion and a bit of guilt let you ignore it. \u201cLucari,\u201d you say as you gently place your hand on one of her massive fingers. \u201cLucari, I\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m back.\u201d She rolls over and has her back face you. \u201dGo away; I\u2019m a monster. Just run, leave me.\u201d \u201cLucario, I\u2019m sorry for running away. I just can\u2019t help it when you\u2019re so big. I just\u2026I want you to be happy. I won\u2019t run away this time, I promise.\u201d Sensing the sincerity in your voice Lucario rolls over to face you. Looking at you with sad eyes, Lucario slowly places one of her arms behind you, trying to embrace you without scaring you off. You walk up to her chest and gently pet her as she wraps one of her paws behind you. Slowly Lucario shrinks down, smaller and smaller. 100, 90, 80, 70\u2026 eventually she gets to 20ft tall and sits up and continues as you stop trying to comfort her. Once she\u2019s 10ft tall again, she embraces you saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d. You tell her it\u2019s all right, that there's no need to cry. You both talk and decide that Lucario should slowly grow, as so you could get used to her abilities. When it\u2019s all said and done, Lucario hugs you firmly and whispers with emotion, \u201cI love you, I love you.\u201d \u201cI love you too Lucario.\u201d Wiping the last few tears from her eyes, Lucario slowly starts growing again. Her growth is short, not wanting to overdo it. How big does she get? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You got out of bed, put on your clothes, put the Chansey egg in your backpack, and head to the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when you were going to the door you heard a tap, tap, on the glass window.  This scared you and you decided to go to the window.  You inspect the window and saw nothing.  But when you were about to turn your back, you saw Lucario's head smiling at you.  You were scared by this and had so many thoughts in your head.  While you in that scared state, Lucario tried to speak to you through the window.  You snapped out of your state and noticed Lucario trying to speak to you.  You could only hear muffles from the window.  You decided to open the window to hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you opened window you heard Lucario speaking to you.  \"Hello, are you alright?\"  In a soft gentle voice.  You were frightened by how she grew so big.  You tried to muster up your words to speak to her.  \"Ho-How di-di-did you get so-so-so big?\"  \"I'll explain it to you outside, okay?\"  In a soft voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then took out the window pane, and told you to climb out of the window.  \"Don't worry I have my paw out to catch you.\"  You then slowly climbed out the window, thinking to yourself how this was a bad idea, but you were going with it.  You landed on her paw, and then she hugged you softly as she can.  You felt warmth from her fur, and you were starting to calm down.  After she was done hugging you, she then walked over to a forest to sit down, making sure there weren't any creatures down below her.  She then hold her paw out in front of your face to talk to you.  \"Are you okay?  Did I frighten you?  Because I didn't mean to.\"  She said in a soft voice.  You then asked her the first question that came to mind, even though you had so many questions, but you chose the one the first one not to get her worried.  \"How did you get so big?\"  \"Ummm?  Can I explain it too you later? I know I should tell but, it's just that, I feel uncomfortable if I told you.\"  She said still in the soft voice.  You weren't afraid of her anymore, infact you were kind of calm by how she talk to you, and how she carefully handle you, despite her being a giant but, you felt that she was making you feel protected, almost as if you were cuddling a stuffed animal, or your mom.  When you thought of mom, you thought of her as being a mom, strange even though she's a Lucario and your a human.  But you felt that made it even more cuter.  You then walked up to her face and kissed her cheek.  She giggled at how you kissed her so softly.  You then.........</span></div></div>",

Lucario's care for you has not vanished because of a size change. You and Lucario have been friends for roughly a year now, and Lucario has found a way to make itself grow. Knowing your love for giants, it allows you to control its growth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome rules:<br>\r\n- Lucario must remain gentle/peaceful<br>\r\n- Nothing dirty, and no profanities. <br>\r\n- No paw stuff or vore. Sorry, but that's not welcome here.<br>\r\n- Destruction is alright so long as it is accidental, and nobody is killed unless they deserve it.<br>\r\n- Shrinking is allowed.<br>\r\n- Other macro Pokemon are allowed, but nothing larger than Lucario, and they must not take the focus off of Lucario.<br>\r\n- Proper spelling and grammar to the best of your ability. <br>\r\n- and no overly short chapters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason for this is there's not too many things on the internet with a gentle giant Lucario, so I thought I'd make something with it. Anyway, that's really all the rules. So, try to enjoy it i guess, and go ahead and add. ^^; (Still kinda new here, so go easy on me ok?)</td>",
