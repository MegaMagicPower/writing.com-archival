            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tWhen we last met Jim he was eating a feast with the Shilarians. He seems to be living comfortably now. I wonder how fat he's gotten? Lets find out. At a rural country mansion there was an elegant futuristic manner run by robots with a small, but rich Shilarian family, the father is a world famous chef &amp; the mother happens to be a diplomat with earth for exchange of goods, tourism, &amp; immigration. Unlike Earth, it was quite customary to force feed humans incredible amounts of Shilarian food &amp; adopt them into Shilarian oonkas (the Shilarian word for family). Of course they needed to get their shots first, their FA shots that is. The FA shots slowly changes the brains feelings about weight gain into positive if they aren't already there. Once they get their shots they go into a hyperspace transporter. It demolecularizes particles for dimensional travel into the Traveler's Realm, where they go for a few hours in cryogenic sleep. They go a short distance in the Traveler's Realm, which is a long distance in outer space in our dimension, thus \"teleporting\" humans &amp; organic matter to Shin within seconds of human consciousness &amp; their good time.<br>\r\n\tBy the year 2150, 20 years since Jim\u2019s arrival on Shin, most countries in the world, including China, England, France, Mexico, Canada, Japan, Korea (now united), &amp; of course America have learned how to bioprocess Shilarian food to make it safe for human consumption. \u201cSafe\u201d being a relative word as it still increased hunger levels &amp; now most of Earth is living off of Shilarian food &amp; plumping up quite nicely. The governments of the world are now sending humans who become ambassadors, tourists, or scientists on the Shin planet to be fattened up into guests who come home secretly.<br>\r\n\tBack to where I was about Jim, he was living lavishly with his new Shilarian wife named Enva (Shilarian for mistress of the pig). Humans on Shin are allowed to only have one wife, human, or Shilarian; but that wife can be one that is already married to another husband. He is now so fat that he would fill up an entire mansion (earthly mansion that is, Shilarian mansions are 100x bigger). He is constantly squeezed in between the walls of the rooms as he is now a blob of fat that is unable to do anything by himself. Most people would find this a boring existence, but Jim has come to love it, besides it has its perks according to him.<br>\r\n\tFor starters, he never has to worry about nutrition since Shilarian food contains all the nutrition he needs. Then there is his hygiene, the mansion\u2019s robots go in between his rolls &amp; folds of fat to massage &amp; clean it on a daily basis. His toilet business is no more since the Shilarian food completely gets used up, thus no waste. Though as for his waste producing organs, they have transformed to remove waste through harmless sweat constantly through every gland in the body except for the ones near his huge chins, neck, &amp; head. Finally there is the amazing sex he has with his wife. Shilarians are able to go in between the heavy &amp; liquid-like rolls of his fat &amp; reach his, Johnson to have sex in many fun ways, even while eating. He is completely stuck in the walls &amp; has the most intoxicating sex ever.<br>\r\nBut whose life do you wanna see here?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He hadn\u2019t seen it in 20 years so he wasn\u2019t familiar with any new cultures there. He was slightly dismayed at the thought of being so far away from home. You\u2019re probably wondering how he was able to read a magazine with fat covering his eyes, let alone reach &amp; hold one in the first place. Thanks to special optic sensors placed in his eyes that extend out to long lengths &amp; tentacles coming out from the ceiling through telepathic relay from a chip in his head, he can read a magazine as if he were holding it in his hands. Then his wife Enva came in with some slice up meat. \u201cHoney, I brought you some more food to fill out your body\u201d she spoke through her translator.<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah sure, bring it on here.\u201d Jim spoke in a dull tone.<br>\r\n\t\u201cSweety, is there something wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh nothing much, it\u2019s just that, well, I\u2019m feeling kind of homesick, that\u2019s all. It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve seen my home planet, I was hoping I would make a difference for Earth &amp; Shin.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh, but you have sweety. Your change has brought us Shilarians a new lifestyle &amp; now we flourish by spreading our culture to humans to share our people &amp; live in peace &amp; harmony.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell, I guess I never really thought of it that way before. I still want to see my home world though. There are also friends of mine I left behind. I want to see them again, talk to them, maybe show off my fabulous new body while I\u2019m at it.<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy of course I could take you back home. There may be a little problem taking such a beautiful fat man home, but no matter we\u2019ll find a way somehow.\u201d Then Enva dialed up a number on her wrist watch which acts as a phone to call a travel agency. \u201cHello, Ambassador Airlines are you there.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes, this is Ambassador Airlines speaking. How may we help you?\u201d the operator asked in a courteous voice.<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis is Enva Finn (that\u2019s my made up last name for Jim, keep it consistent) calling about a vacation to earth. My husband is ambassador Jim Finn, the first human ambassador to come to Shin &amp; we were wondering if we could arrange for a trip to earth as soon as possible in earth time. Uh huh. Uh huh. Oh!\u201d Enva heard some details over the phone &amp; that was the end of the conversation as Enva hung up &amp; told her husband the result. \u201cHoney here\u2019s the result\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I mean 20 years can do a lot to a guy. But this?\u201d He said as he grabbed a piece of his flab via tentacles to make his point.<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t worry sweety. In case you haven\u2019t read the news, fatness is now the new health trend on your planet. Everyone is fat now on your home world. They\u2019ll all be fat too,\u201d then she kissed you, \u201cjust not as much as you.\u201d She added with a sly whisper. Then they got all your food, equipment, &amp; entertainment ready for the vacation at Jim\u2019s hometown of Florida, including the hunger stop machine. This machine temporarily halts the hunger pains that most obese humans have for long trips across the planet or more importantly, the galaxy so they don\u2019t starve to death.<br>\r\n\tOn the way to the airport, the young couple got everything they needed for a big parade &amp; party when they get to Earth. Soon they were at the airport. He had the hunger stop machine placed within his belly-button; it would halt his hunger throughout the moving process. Jim was being loaded into the teleportation machine, via crane &amp; Shilarian hover-copters. They had a massive teleportation beam that would have made a giant iris &amp; pupil on Shin\u2019s surface. He was loaded on top of it along with a ship of dignitaries from Shin\u2019s equivalent of the U.N. The process was finally complete astonishingly after 20 min., then they activated the teleportation machine. It started with a low whirring &amp; humming, then came the crackling particles of the air &amp; the vibration of waves throughout his jello-like body, &amp; finally came the rush of traveling through the Traveler\u2019s  Realm. He felt a rush of energy that made him feel strong enough to stand on thin air, &amp; I mean stand as in the air became solid &amp; he could stand on it, not lay down. Then came the rush of gravity as they left the portal a few seconds later &amp; he plopped back down onto his bubble butt.<br>\r\n\tThe experience was too much to take for Jim, so he fainted from the rush of energy, the change in atmosphere, &amp; most importantly, the exhaustion of standing up. He woke up again hearing,<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What happened was that the Shilarians wanted to repay Steven for showing them their destiny in this universe.<br>\r\nIt all started one day when Steven was managing Earth\u2019s interstellar immigration &amp; vacations to planet Shin when two Shilarians came up to him &amp; spoke English asking him to test out this new medicinal plant they have discovered called Ibony &amp; Evory. They were similar in composition but had opposite though adverse effects on the human body. Ibony caused loss of weight getting so close to the asymptote of 0 while not changing in size which made it a poison. Evory caused incredibly fast &amp; powerful weight gain in humans, &amp; some Shilarians as well. They fed him some of his well made chicken, he didn\u2019t know however that this would be the last meal he\u2019d have that wouldn\u2019t be served through a tube. \u201cThank you for your help boys. I\u2019m really grateful you\u2019ve helped me with my work &amp; made my life a success. I wonder whatever happened to Jim, he\u2019s probably grown a lot. I wonder how he\u2019s doing now that he\u2019s worshipped as the first Fat One in their species.\u201d While Steven was speaking his chair turned around showing his body.<br>\r\nSteven was apparently a paraplegic with specially floating wheelchairs meant to carry him around. He had apparently gone bald &amp; gotten around to basically being skinny &amp; hairless. Most people would be appalled by this, but Steven liked his new look, he wasn\u2019t expecting it though to have improvement. As he turned around, Steven picked up some more pudding dessert from his dish. He didn\u2019t know however that he just fell into the same trap that he put through Jim, thinking that they wouldn\u2019t fatten him up because he brought them something sacred. Unbeknownst to Steven, there was a sedative &amp; a newly made FA shot in there (now made for oral entry). As Steven fell asleep he was already at the new \u201cchubby\u201d stage which was 500 lb., obese which was 1,000 lb., morbidly obese was 2,000 lb. or 1 ton , &amp; anything beyond 2 tons was extremely obese. How fat does Steven get by the time he wakes up?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He\u2019s too fat to lift his arms up now. \u201cHuh? What happened? Why is my voice like this?\u201d he tried to say as his fatty octave echoed throughout his jiggling amorphic mass. Now we could all get a good look at him.<br>\r\nSteven was definitely past the new standard of morbid obesity. He was approximately twice as fat as Jim was at the beginning of his weight gain, but most of his body was too fat, he couldn\u2019t even open his mouth. Steven was also so fat, that if he tried to open up his eyelids, they couldn\u2019t open from so much fat, not that there was much to see anyway considering the fat from his chins &amp; cheeks exploded so much that they also blocked his eyes. Then Steven felt something. It was a strange plastic tentacle that was going through the fat of his face &amp; eyelids. When Steven woke up, he saw his doctor looking at him with pride. \u201cWell, well Mr. Robertson (Steven\u2019s last name, keep it constant from this chapter forward), I see you\u2019ve finally caught up to this planet\u2019s standards of human health.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Steven tried again to ask, but his mouth just reverberated muffled up by his chubby cheeks.<br>\r\n\u201cOh my mistake Mr. Robertson. Larderfier, activate vocal linguistic audio headband &amp; versatile elastic headband. &amp; also activate the Audio Visual implants\u201d. Then Steven\u2019s head was pulled up from his chins &amp; body fat so he could just barely see a bit of light from squinting. Then Steven was speaking quite clearly &amp; could finally see.<br>\r\n\u201cHey what\u2019s going on here? Where am I? Why can\u2019t I move?\u201d Then the the mega-bed/chair he was on turns the ceiling tiles into mirrors so for him to see himself. \u201cWhoa!!!

I went on my bike without my helmet, (not my best choice) &amp; pedaled onward when I bumped into a new friend &amp; crashed my bike into him. \"Ooomph!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that.\" I responded, still groggy from the experience. Then I opened my eyes and I saw a Shilarian extending one hand out to me to pick me up, &amp; the other rubbing his throbbing forehead. As I was standing, I noticed my head hurt badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really my head hurts &amp; I need to get home soon.\" I replied. \"Owww!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on let me carry you, I'm quite strong.\" he flexed &amp; picked me up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'ts okay, it's not that bad you don't have to do that for me.\" I protested. \"Don't worry, &amp; besides you don't seem to be in any condition to move right now... So where do you live?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the intersection of Maple &amp; Elm\" I groaned, then he picked me up piggy-back style despite my protests &amp; carried me home. He knocked on the door &amp; there came my parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Aaron, how did this happen &amp; who's your friend here?\" she asked tentatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, he carried me here... head... hurting... bike... accident\" I promptly fell out cold. Then I was put down in the car where my new friend came with me and my mom to make i'm okay. Next thing I knew I was in a hospital bed with a very fat human doctor, with several lean &amp; trim Shilarian nurses over my bedside putting ice on my body &amp; using weird scanners on me. Basically after a few hours, they told me I had to stay the night &amp; I was left alone with my new friend of which I wouldn't be here without him. \"So what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh where are my manners? My name is Shencho &amp; I am visiting earth on a vacation with my family.\" Shencho responded. I put my hand out to ask a question when he said, \"Before you ask in human years I would be around 9-years-old\". Whoa, that's incredible, I knew there were other Shilarians out there, but I never knew they had kids my age here in town, let alone on earth in general.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When's your birthday?\" I asked.h<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow... say once you get out of here, would you like to meet my family &amp; friends. They're both human &amp; Shilarian, &amp; I'm certain that my family &amp; Shilarian freinds have never met a human your age before. So what do you say. Will you &amp; your family come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought about it, &amp; said \"Yes, I'll come Shencho.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, no need for a present yet, just you showing up will make my day.\" Boy he was polite &amp; nice. TIme skip forward...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I went with my mom &amp; dad to Shencho's house which was really a large white glass &amp; marble compound that seemed more wide than tall by a 5;3 ratio of feet, &amp; there was at least hundreds of square feet in this little compound. It was a hot day &amp; they had a private indoor pool with a barbecue next to it. Fortunately I brought my loosest swim trunks with my mom &amp; dad wearing a bikini &amp; a speedo (dad was buff). We brought some delicious hamburgers (i'm lactose intolerante, such a shame), &amp; we were in for a shock when we reached the buffet table they hired for us. All the food was at least three times bigger than our burgers, even the appetizers &amp; Shilarian food was huge, greasy, &amp; fattening. I knew from my parents that Shilarians had large appetites &amp; marathon fast metabolisms, but this was ridiculous, there was enough food to feet ten people 20 times over, &amp; that was just the humans, the shilarians had even MORE FOOD! \"Well it seems we came unprepared, We had no idea that Shilarian parties were so, well BIG...\" My dad stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean dad?\" I asked confused as I tilted my head to the left &amp; snapped out of my trance to realize that there were no humans coming. Though the Shilarians were all wearing new swim suits that were tightly fit over their lean &amp; sculpted bodyies, though that still left everything to the imagination. I filed in &amp; shook hands with them &amp; noticed that even their hands &amp; fingers were well sculpted, \u201cOh, that\u2019s what you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I notice d Shencho come in with two familiar-looking Shilarians that were taller &amp; more muscular than anybody I\u2019ve ever seen. \u201cHi Aaron, these are my older brothers Shintus and Shanue (pronounced Sha-new-eh). It is tradition to start a party with the newest friends &amp; their family enjoying some of our food.\u201d We began eating, &amp; soon ate more than five hamburgers. We then moved on to the chips &amp; other entrees, such as hot dogs, steaks, &amp; ribs from all kinds of farm animals, &amp; after a thorough stuffing that left a bulge in our flat stomachs, we chatted for a while. \u201cDid you enjoy the food?\u201d Shencho asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, though I\u2019ve never eaten so much before, it feels, good. Say mom, can we stay the night, they\u2019ve got plenty of room &amp; it is a weekend.\u201d I asked groggily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell sure Aaron, as long as it\u2019s okay with the parents\u2026\u201d mom winced then rubbed her belly to soothe he fullness. \u201cSpeaking of which, where are your parents, Shencho? We\u2019ve seen your aunts &amp; uncles, your big brothers, your Shilarian &amp; human friends, but where are your mom and dad. We\u2019d love to meet them.\u201d Mom queried with a hint of suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re busy tonight, but they\u2019ll be here for the cake &amp; presents\u201d Shencho answered. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve finished eating &amp; digesting, let\u2019s dive in the pool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d My parents &amp; I responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne, two, and THREE!\u201d Shencho counted, &amp; all the parents &amp; all the kids (Shilarian &amp; humans) dived into the enormously deep infinity pool. Shencho &amp; I splashed around for a while, &amp; after several hours, we got out &amp; I felt a nasty pang of swelling in my stomach, mom &amp; dad felt it too, though I didn\u2019t realize it was right after we finished digesting all that deliciously fattening food. Great now let\u2019s go in &amp; watch a movie everybody. We went in slowly &amp; realized we felt heavier &amp; more tired with every step as we started to blink out of it &amp; our newly found Shilarian friends carried us to the couch beds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUugghhh! What\u2019s happening???? Did we eat too much Shencho?\u201d I asked queasily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, of course not Aaron. You &amp; your family have much catching up to do\u201d Shencho replied with a sly smile, \u201cIn fact, the catching up should be happening now.\u201d Then Shencho pushed a button on his high-tech waterproof watch that I didn\u2019t notice had a digital meter reading our bodies. It showed our current bodies from before we ate, &amp; then it showed a strange sight, there were enormously super mega obese versions of ourselves that were beyond any size a human could be &amp; then I noticed something. My shorts felt snugger &amp; I couldn\u2019t see past my moobs, wait what moobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening daddy! I feel like I\u2019m going to explode!!!\u201d I shouted with a deep rumble in my normally squeaky prepubescent voice. Then my growth went straight to my arms &amp; legs as they turned into wide tubes of dough swallowing my dainty hands &amp; feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaron! Aaron!!!\u201d dad shouted. \u201cWhat the hell is going on Shencho, did you drug our food?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re just reacting naturally to our high calorie food from the planet Shin. Our food is measured in a different unit &amp; converts to a high number of human calories. One of our Shin calories is equal to about 3,000 human calories &amp; you\u2019ve just eaten enough food to immobilize you within half an hour. You\u2019ll be our first fat friends to live with us on Planet Shin. We\u2019ve been allowed to be your feeders &amp; caretakers for all time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWwwhaaat????\u201d my mother queried to this strange surprise. \u201cHow come we\u2019re still healthy? How will we go to the bathroom? How will our son engage with his other people if he\u2019s immobile?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe food is perfectly healthy, just high in human calories. You could live indefinitely without going to the bathroom since all the food converts into fat without ANY waste products. You\u2019ll have all the health &amp; monetary wellfare ever needed on our planet under our care. You\u2019ll never have to work again; physically or otherwise, maybe you can do what you want, as long as it doesn\u2019t involve you physically moving, but you\u2019ll still love your new lives. &amp; to answer your last question, all other non-physical needs will be supplied by us &amp; our servants once we get there but fore now enjoy the ride.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen to add insult to injury there came two more adult looking Shilarians, wearing nothing at all, &amp; they had two 4,000 lb cakes, each looking to be about our current body weight, around two tons each, &amp; I could only imagine the feeding nightmare that will ensue when they push it into our mouths. We tried to close our mouths, but with our growing bodies expanding by the second it was very clear we were losing our strength. \u201cAaah Aaron, Mary, Donovan\u201d came the female Shilarian, \u201cI\u2019m Shoran &amp; this is my husband Shiku... we\u2019re Shencho\u2019s parents &amp; we brought the cake for everybody, two for our human guests &amp; two for everybody else\u201d Our eyes must have bulged out because they chuckled &amp; then attached climbed our massive bodies, \u201cNow now, not yet, but first we\u2019ll get you all into good positions &amp; you\u2019ll be sleep fed. Now good night darlings.\u201d Then they attached these weird head braces which attached a virtual reality console to my head, breathing devices up my nose, &amp; a force-feeding chewing mechanism into my mouth. The moment they turned on the VR console, I saw a hypnotic swirly pattern reverberate all across my lines of sight &amp; I started to feel the full effects of my meal &amp; fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what happens next???<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Shencho's P.O.V. which will be translated into English)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that turned out even better than I thought. Aaron was going to be my new blubber buddy. I can't wait to introduce him to our planet &amp; the new lifestyles they'll be living in lipidy, lardy, laziness. So with Aaron &amp; his family asleep, their bodies fattening up even better than we hoped, &amp; their minds being converted to love their new lazy lard lifestyle, all would be great for our family. If you are wondering about the other humans at my birthday party, they were always that fat &amp; are being brought in as special guests on our family's galactic teleportation machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow everyone was attaching an anti-gravity Heavy Heft Harnesses to the outside of our human friends\u2019 bodies. This will make carrying them easier as they are now one hundredth of their current weight, plus their growing fat will stay in place due to the instant growth that was occuring to their bodies while becoming compact &amp; denser, thus easier to store. Then came the Massage Boxes, which was where they were meant to stay during their trip to Shin while feeling relaxed &amp; being placated with fat adoration enightenment dreams from their helmets. These boxes would massage them while also sending small electric shocks to their nerves &amp; stimulate passion, pleasure, &amp; in Aaron\u2019s case pudgy pubescent sensations. Finally respiratory, self-cleaning, elasticity-inducing Suspension Sleep Gel will be poured inside the Massage Boxes. This will allow them to survive the teleportation process with only a tiny bit of what could ony be described as jet lag, though more like rocket planet lag which will mean they will have a slight disruption in their reprogramming &amp; comfortable travel. The Suspension Sleep Gel cleans up their bodies while inside only needing replacements once every week; allows them to breath even when submerged under by collecting air bubbles from the surface &amp; aggregating them into a  breathing device near their mouth; &amp; makes their body more malleable for play &amp; future growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we loaded the last few drops of Suspension Sleep Gel inside of their massive Massage Boxes, we prepared ourselves for a return back to Shin where we would continue to play with our new human friends. I would particularly get Aaron. WE were loaded into the teleporation machine when my parents almost forgot something, they were supposed to leave evidence of the Peterson-Jones family &amp; our other party guests moving out of this country &amp; planet earth with our family to Shin. So off we went at last. After what felt like a few brief minutes in deep matter travel, we arrived at the Central Teleport Station in Jorvan, Wundoria, on planet Shin. We all took our Heavy Hangcrafts, our equivalent to what humans would call \u201cfloating cars\u201d &amp; loaded our humans into the trunks backseats &amp; zoomed our way home going our separate ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow my mother Shoran, &amp; my father Shiku prepared for Aaron, Mary, &amp; Donovan to wake up into their new world. How much will they know??? Will they know they are on planet Shin thanks to a successful Sensualysis Programming through the VRG-Helmets??? Or will they be confused &amp; angry at us due to their current weight &amp; helplessness, leading us to take more perpetuated &amp; slow methods to help them love their new bodies???? The choice is yours to make.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hi, my name is Tyler. I am a young adult in need in Illinois. I have been looking for a job for a while now, &amp; then I hear about some chemical testing at the local food plant with our new alien allies, the Shilarians. I am so excited to work there, maybe I'll get lucky and find a boyfriend. Putting it simply I\u2019m on the LGBT Spectrum. I really wish I could find a boyfriend, but the problem was that as a farm-grown country boy living in a growing metropolitan country, it\u2019s not easy to find someone whom I can relate to. Then add the fact that no one knows I\u2019m gay, not even my friends or folks, on account that the Midwest is known for more conservative trends on marriage &amp; love, even to this day in 2050. But I do digress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ve been fascinated with computers, even though with my strong physique, charmingly rugged body, &amp; farmland upbringing, I should be working the fields or doing something physical with my life. The simplicity and complexity of all that could be done with machines was incredibly intoxicating to me. Then there was the fact that machines were used in everyday life, even on the farm. If I could be successful, I\u2019d want to live a steady sedentary life with easy access to utilities like in the city. I guess you could say I was born in the country, but my heart belonged in the city. That puts me here to today, where I was testing out food products for human consumption after they have been harvested, along with life-support systems for humans involved with interstellar transit. That should give me enough money to move on out to the big city &amp; get my life started, maybe I\u2019ll make real friends with more liberal opinions, gay lovers, &amp; perhaps start a family. Who knows, maybe I\u2019ll get to meet one of those friendly aliens that I\u2019ve heard so many good things about, the Shilarians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was let in by a well-mannered, asexual, holographic receptionist (it\u2019s all the trends nowadays in high-tech facilities, even encroaching on the more rustic side of the country), &amp; after signing my waiver, my new job had begun. I was shown to a large guestroom the size of my old house, where I\u2019d be staying overnight for the duration of the testing. A male Shilarian scientist came in through the exceptionally wide-&amp;-tall doors &amp; introduced himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreetings Tyler, my name is Dr. Zanarex. As you can see I\u2019m a Shilarian. Let\u2019s get started on with a simple checkup\u2026 By the way, it says you still live with your parents. Are they aware of you taking this job?\u201d Dr. Zanarex asked courteously, but to the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell um here\u2019s the thing\u2026\u201d I stammered as I tried to come to terms with my deceptive plan &amp; how Dr. Zanarex was going to help. Surprisingly he was my age if my understanding of alien aging is correct. But he acted much more professional. Maybe he was a young genius on his planet. Maybe Shilarians start their careers earlier than humans do. Regardless I was a bit uncertain if I could trust him. \u201cI don\u2019t want my parents to know because well, I need this job to move somewhere far away from them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh. I knew humans haven\u2019t attained world peace, but why would you hide such a thing from your parents?\u201d Dr. Zanarex inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you know how some part of the world, heck some parts of the country aren\u2019t very tolerant of each other or different ideals, particularly involving sexuality.\u201d I muttered half-heartedly. Earlier I had been so gung-ho into getting this job so I can start my adult life right. Now if he got the police or some other government agency involved, I\u2019d be in big trouble. \u201cTo be blunt, I need this job so I can leave this little town, see the big city, &amp; understand where I am on the LGBT Spectrum, sexuality.\u201d It was incredibly tense and awkward after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s quite alright Tyler\u201d Dr. Zanarex responded with a warm and understanding smile. \u201cWhen you signed that waiver, not only are you guaranteeing your payment, but you are also receiving Doctor-Patient Confidentiality. I\u2019ll even help you with the move if it means so much to you, since well I\u2019m gay too, but I can\u2019t legally be your doctor after this because of ethical reasoning. But either way let\u2019s get started on the experiment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it started to get weird, I was first asked to undress myself &amp; leave my clothes where they are but keep my personal belongings as well. It was because I needed to be checked for diseases &amp; then dipped in this experimental gel-suit material that would be custom-made for my body &amp; its growth. I was covered like a red humanoid in a tight, yet loose spandex material all around my body, even covering my entire head. However, the gel-suit was strangely breathable &amp; sound went through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter set up, I was asked what foods I would like to test. I hadn\u2019t eaten all day in anticipation, and it was almost lunchtime. \u201cI want a brunch of sorts with lots of breakfast foods and assorted sausages if possible.\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood choice Tyler.\u201d Then Dr. Zanarex pushed a button &amp; right before my eyes pumping out these tubes into my mouth were the most deliciously fattening breakfast foods I\u2019d ever seen. &amp; I grew up on a farm, so I should know. It tasted like scrambled eggs by the dozen on at least a dozen or so plates; bacon &amp; sausages as thick as my arm on at least eight different plates; &amp; finally ending with toasted bread &amp; bagels with assorted fattening, sweet condiments. It was delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was eating so much food, &amp; it was going in so fast. Now I\u2019m a big guy, with a lot of muscle. But the food was not the healthiest option, or the least bit calorie-dense, so it was extremely fattening. I was surprised to have finished it all, when I felt an electric pulse course through my body. As I was entering what could only be described as a fugue state, I was walked out of the room by Dr. Zanarex. I was laid down to sleep on the largest, fluffiest, and most comfortable airbed I\u2019d ever seen. Granted it was the first air bed I\u2019d ever seen. As I was dozing off, Dr. Zanarex spoke up, \u201cNow Tyler, you signed the waiver, and have completed the preliminary steps of the experiment. The next step will begin as soon as you wake up again, &amp; then it\u2019s going to get\u2026 interesting to say the least\u201d. The doctor noted with a sly grin that I could barely make out in the feeding-induced haze. As I was laid down I felt a subharmonic sound wave pulse through my gel suit &amp; I fell into a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long was I out for?</span></div></div>",

Then as I was awakening, I felt the suspended slime suit I was wearing safely dissolve into water molecules. Then as I felt suction of air from vacuums &amp; several light, soft, cleaning brushes scrub me down, I noticed I couldn\u2019t move. It was almost as if I was wearing a the gel suit, but it was my skin &amp; body. I was also panting really deeply. Then as I finally opened my eyelids enough to see what was happening. I was laying down on my back like Leonardo Da Vinci\u2019s Vitruvian Man facing a mirrored ceiling, &amp; boy was I in for a shock at my bodies well, massive size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had officially become a naked, fat, immobile blob of corpulence. I was huge as my newfound man boobs were drooping, pushed to the sides by my monster truck tire-sized chins. My belly was a beanbag chair filled with jello, &amp; don\u2019t even get me started on my limbs. My limbs were spread wide &amp; parallel to each other as thick as building columns, with indents for my fingers, assorted nails, &amp; knuckle joints. Finally, my face was immensely bloated so much that it looked like I was stung by a swarm of killer bees, &amp; all of them queen bees. I was so shocked &amp; breathing so deeply, that I barely noticed I was beginning to hyperventilate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Zanarex came in as my life signs started flaring up. \u201cEasy there Tyler. I know you\u2019re confused right now. But there is a simple explanation for everything. Please calm down.\u201d I don\u2019t know what was going on but I needed to get out of here. That\u2019s <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat ^huff^ happened ^puff^ to me Dr. Zanarex?\u201d I asked, constantly losing my breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCall me Eeak (pronounced \u201ce-yak\u201d). &amp; I assure you this is part of the procedure.\u201d Eeak assuaged me by rubbing my belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUugh. Wait you mean I\u2019m supposed to become fat, &amp; immobile, &amp;, well-naked?\u201d I responded exasperated &amp; well, a little embarrassed at my involuntary nudity in front of my doctor<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. &amp; may I say you look wonderful, especially in your gut, boobs, &amp; penis regions.\u201d Eeak answered with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait. My penis is visible, even underneath my huge gut?\u201d I asked, even more embarrassed than before as I attempted to examine my penis only to be held back by the weight of my body, as my boobs and chins jiggled with straining effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, it looks well huge\u2026 But we can cover it if you want us to\u201d Eeak answered. \u201cBy the way I know what you must be feeling right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow could you possibly know how I feel?!?!?! You\u2019re still skinny &amp; mobile. Me, I\u2019m a blob for goodness sake. How am I supposed to go out or live like THIS?!?!?!\u201d I screamed almost wheezing with rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know this seems rushed but their will be an explanation, just enjoy the ride. &amp; don\u2019t worry about being accepted or not enjoying life as you are now. Soon, you will be heading to the planet Shin to live out your life in paradise. I will ensure that. Whether you want it with me or not, is purely up to you. But for now you must be starving, and bored, so here, enjoy the first of many meals into beautiful immobility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay but if my mouth is being fed, &amp; my fingers are WAY too big for keyboards, how will I communicate with you?\u201d I questioned curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry about that, we have a solution\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I was born of a small farmer's family on the planet Shin, we didn't delve much into the city except for market days, despite the advanced technology of our planet, we still lived a simple enough life in a 1-story house with three bedrooms &amp; a barn for the animals, plus all the high-tech farming equipment. My father was always a farmer, while my mother began her life as a grocery store clerk who needed to find love in a simple town, she eventually found it in my father. I was born &amp; then five years later, my little brother Tun-Tor (pronounced Tune-Tor) was born. I yearned for true love of romantic kinds, but in such a small town in a backwater part of the planet, most of my choices were already dating girls, &amp; by the way, I'm gay. Then came the day I discovered what my love would look like, FAT &amp; IMMOBILE!!!!! This occurred two years ago when Steven Finn came as an ambassador to Shin from the planet Earth to discuss politics, he was quickly fattened &amp; given a place of importance as the first human to taste our succulent, sweet meats &amp; treats. I along with every other Shilarian on the planet discoverd I was as humans call it, an FA (fat admirer) &amp; feeder as well as a gay Shilarian, i knew I wanted to care for one, but we didn't have enough money to afford the feeding costs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a message to all of Shin was posted on all global telecommunications (including our equivalent of Earth's Internet, the Rapid Ring) two hours after the successful fattening of Steven Finn. \"Dear all Shilarians, we are sending a message for all of the newly discovered feeders on our planet who yearn to feed &amp; partake in caring for 'Steven the Stupendous' Finn, but he won't be the only human who will be made into glorious gluttony &amp; girth. Now we have a plan called, '<b>Operation Obestiy</b>' to bring about a better world for humans &amp; Shilarians, the government &amp; independent exploration organizations will travel to earth to bring humans to us, that's Step 1; Step 2 is we need to up the payment &amp; economy of agriculturalists &amp; neuro-electric engineers to give them their fat future. Farmers will feed &amp; clean them, while the neuro-electric engineers will give them duties of the future to manage all of our information &amp; commanding the advanced machines we cannot control, for one human can pilot multiple machines that would take 20 Shilarians to do a single job. Step 3, is that we offer government benefits to our loyal farmers &amp; scientists to raise these humans properly from a young age. Now is the time to act, for Pleasure, for Peace, &amp; for Prosperity!!!!!\" The message ended &amp; call us lucky, but our family got to be the VERY first ones farming family in the entire western hemisphere, to gain a supply of WILLING humans to grow into our future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few weeks, we found our humans, they were thin to start off with, but not for long. Many of them looked depraved &amp; malnourished, even going so far as to have their ribcages poke out &amp; their femurs showing in their legs with little mass to support it. We had 10 humans to start with, &amp; I fell in love quite easily with the one on the farthest right. He had tossled golden locks, &amp; beautiful, bashful baby blue eyes, he seemed restless, &amp; waved with a smile at me, despite his fatigue. I knew he would be my first love, but first he needed some physical improvement. \u201cAlright humans address yourselves by first name, then last name, &amp; as you address yourselves, you\u2019ll undress yourselves as well\u201d my father retorted, I almost chuckled at the thought of seeing this blissfully bashful boys naked. \u201cThen you will be strapped down &amp; hand fed every delicacy on this farm, don\u2019t worry about it tasting bad, everything\u2019s been treated &amp; now comes your growth. Make yourselves comfortable on the soil, for that\u2019s where you\u2019ll be staying during the day for the first part of your training. Now ready!!!!\u201d my father shouted. Then all the boys quickly &amp; effortlessly undressed themselves,  I picked up their meaningless garments &amp; groped my blonde love in the process, he smiled at me while addressing his name, Jonathan Jr. Johanssen. Then we used the clamps on the feeding devices on the ground while they were left to be fed semi-standing, semi-leaning on these large metal contraptions that were used to hold livestock. My brother &amp; the farm hands took turns setting everyone up &amp; then hand-feeding them, I asked for the job of soley feeding my love &amp; it began. I fed him meats &amp; vegetables, starches, &amp; sweets, &amp; after several wonderful hours, they started to bloat &amp; bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOOOooooohhhhhhh!!!! It\u2019s happening!!! It\u2019s finally happening!!!!\u201d Johnny (my nickname for him) moaned in ecstasy, a feeling of which I could barely contain right now. He started growing in his gut which turned into a belly, then a ball, &amp; finally balloon of blimped out bigness. His belly fat eventually spread towards his pectorals, which would now become beautifully sagging boobs. His hips were as wide was a water tower &amp; pooched outwards like dough or batter. Then it went to his arms &amp; legs, finally tipping off at his extremities which looked like massive meat mittens with indentations for the nails,  knuckles, wrists, ankles, &amp; other joints while the arms &amp; legs were consumed by his ever-growing torso. His final transformation was his rounding tree trunk neck which was covered by so many chins which were like folds of whipped cream while his face was framed by beachball-sized cheeks &amp; a marble like slab jutting out where his forehead lay. All in all, he was a gorgeous girthly guy. This all finished off by sundown &amp; it was time for me &amp; my family to eat our food. We dined in front of our newly grown charges &amp; I set up a tent on top of his boobs where I slept for the night, for the first time in my life, truly satisfied. What happens next? </span></div></div>",

I have also made friends with the other humans who are now living on our farm. I wondered what their purpose to the farm would be since they could not move. So I went to ask my father, Uurn about this, 'So father, I have a question.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes Aino'' my father stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I was wondering how our new human employees will be helping out the farm if they are now immobile?' I inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's quite simple son' Though they don't give off any solid or liquid waste matter, their gaseous waste, known as eructation (burping) &amp; flatulence (farting) give off natural gases used for fuel.' This was an incredible discovery, their weakening bowels would give us all the energy we would ever need, &amp; our humans wouldn't be harmed, plus they get benefits with our planet. 'Now then Aino, it's time to clean them &amp; set up the vacuum tubes to their buttery blubber butts' He said with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course father' I went off &amp; prepared to clean our employees with help from my little brother Tun-Tor, my mother, &amp; some of the farm hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was assigned a new human today. 'Hello, my name is Aino, I hope you've been comfortable since you've been brought here.' I conversed in a slow, but steady pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I've been comfortable. Ohhh yeah, this is the life. nothing but eating, bathing, milking, &amp; cuddling. Oh &amp; maybe we could get some sex every now &amp; then.' rumbled my charge. He looked so peacefull, just like my Johnny did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So what's your name?' I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'My name is Doug. So tell me Aino, how will we be cleaned everywhere???' Doug asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We use these hoses to spray you, then our bodies to caress &amp; sponge you off,  then another soak session from our hoses. Now then, let's begin.' I started to spray Doug's girthly boobs &amp; belly, while I put on my sponge suit, the outside was made of clean &amp; soft sponges that could be used to massage, lather, &amp; scrub the rounding rolls of flab underneath Doug's belly. I was having so much fun cleaning him up &amp; hearing him moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy brother &amp; the farm hands attached a special mask to their heads which would feed them, allow them to breathe, &amp; collect their eructation through an oral tube while an anal tube went up their asses to collect their flatulence. I squeezed a roll &amp; felt the bloated but flexible liquids flow on through, causing Doug to burp &amp; fart stronger than before each time. This went on for several hours, &amp; finally Doug was relatively cleaner than he was before. I went over to my love Johnny after he was done eating, I kissed him. 'Oooh, hey Aino!!! Why'd you do that?' Johnny rumbled in a dizzy yet cognitive fashion from his head all the way to his buried, nub-like pinky toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Quite simple Johnny, I love you!!!' I responded jovialy. 'You are all I could have ever wanted in a boyfriend. So can we start dating???' I asked almost lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, I don't know what to say' But I do love country boys like yourself, especially farmers. I've dated a lot of guys, but never an alien before, or anyone so special. So yes, kiss me Aino!!!' Johnny commanded his 'runt' boyfriend &amp; so he did, though he struggled to get to the top of Johnny's boob without hurting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, Aino was always sort of small but strong, ironic features from a farmer's family. This lead to quite a contradiction of sizes between two species; the jumbo, jiggling human Johnny; &amp; the lithe but powerfully small Shilarian Aino. They made out for almost an hour before coming back up to catch some air. 'Aino, boys, farm hands, dinnertime!!!!' Aino's mother shouted to her children &amp; farm hands, 'Thanks for the help Rondan' He's the head farm hand. Then Aino knew he had to tell his family about his experience with his boyfriend Johnny' What happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m Iren &amp; you\u2019re the newest pledge, so what\u2019s your name?!?!?!?!\u201d Iren the head of initiations at Wyde Fat Gordo, asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name\u2019s Rowlen (pronounced like the name \u201cRaoul-en\u201d).\u201d I stuttered. By the way, my name is Rowlen, I\u2019m a Shilarian initiate &amp; I know what I want in this fraternity. This Gordon University has been opened up as a party school &amp; I\u2019m joining one of its best fraternities. My dad &amp; I were personally there when Jim was tricked into eating our food &amp; we discovered our feeding passion with a vengeance. My dad is one of his top caretakers &amp; chefs. I wanna be like him &amp; fatten up humans. God they are gorgeous creatures. especially the bigger ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Rowlen, meet our newest albeit slightly dazed humanoid students who are being coerced into our ways. Just so you know, they\u2019re all boys &amp; we\u2019re all gay. Your job as the Shilarians is to feed them till they\u2019re in a stupor, then have them guzzle down their newfound girthly figure alcohol into a high fugue state. In other words stuff them with food, then when they\u2019re done gaining, both of you must drink the human\u2019s weight in our alcohol.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Iren, but what alcohol should we try???\u201d I asked quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUse a Blob Bliss, you know our mildest alcohol, since they are new. Also don\u2019t worry about the humans too much, most of the time they can eat way more food their bodyweight or initial appetite allows them. However, for safety\u2019s sake, if they look sick after too much alcohol, stop there &amp; then. Do you get it freshie?\u201d quipped with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course Iren. So when do we begin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn a second, just got to set up our unknowing feedees to be stuck here\u201d Iren looked onward in the general direction of the crowd of humans on the other side of the wall, with a warm smile as if someone was watching. Then he turned around to me with a coy, but sneaky smirk. We went on outwards towards the frat hall, where I joined the Shilarian crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, dudes!!! We\u2019re here to welcome our newest additions to Wyde Fat Gordo Fraternity. So are we ready for the first few days of the best Initiation any of you can imagine!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYyyyeaaaahhhhh!!!!\u201d the frat boys responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are about 60 of you to be formed in about 20 groups of three each. The ratio for each group will be two humans per Shilarian for three people groups, or three Shilarians per human. Now the initiation is to goad as much out of this world (&amp; I mean out of this world for you humans) food from our homeworld, then drink your body weight in alcohol. We\u2019ll take care of the hangover later. Now begin!!!\u201d Iren shouted. Then everyone was choosing groups, the doors &amp; windows were all locked by the headmaster, and no human was leaving until they were at least 5,000 lb. of Shilarian grown and gang-fucked in an orgy their own flab by us. I couldn\u2019t wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo which group should I join? One where I get two humans to myself, I\u2019ll have to do a lot of work to keep these two well fed coaxed &amp; sexually stimulated, as well as fucking both of them. On the other hand, I could join a group sex session with one human getting all of our dicks in his orifices; bellybutton, butt, and mouth hole, &amp; maybe get to suck on that human\u2019s newly engorged &amp; extremely delicious dick. Which shall it be?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I joined a group of two other Shilarians, Kewr &amp; Stebeck, &amp; a college-aged human named Eddy. Eddy was pretty short for a college-aged human, only reaching about five feet at the age of 18-years-old; his build only had a slight bit of abdominal &amp; pec definition, with his limbs &amp; extremities being very tapered &amp; svelte, while his head was very angular. We started off by hand feeding him everything we could reach at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also realized at the moment how large &amp; open-schemed the interior of human establishments like schools &amp; embassies were. You could fit at least seven full-sized cathedrals, or other large religious structures, &amp; still have room for food, utilities, &amp; furniture. Eddy ate like a starved animal, he was gulping &amp; chewing everything in sight as if we had added addictive chemicals to the food (we\u2019ll have to check that out later), &amp; soon he was feeling physical exhaustion from feeding himself right as we were done with the APPETIZERS, that\u2019s right, the appetizers. This meant that it was our time to goad &amp; force feed our human frat brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe gently sat them down on the floor as it was customary to do once humans began to feel exhaustion from our food. We had at least 500,000 entrees to serve, plus hundreds of thousands of pounds of deserts &amp; at least 50,000 XXXL kegs of Blob Bliss alcohol. &amp; we had already finished feeding the appetizers within 30 minutes, in part due to the newly discovered addictive properties of our food on certain humans. We then finally began to see the fruits of our labor, &amp; we began to undress ourselves &amp; our human friends, who were already dizzy &amp; exhausted from feeding themselves so much so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhuh? What\u2019s happening? Why are we all in the buff?\u201d Eddy asked dizzily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Eddy.\u201d I responded calmly while yanking his shoes, socks, &amp; then underwear off. \u201cWe are now preparing for the next stage of your new life as part of the human Shilarian interspecies-integration program here at Gordon University. For each Shilarian calorie, known as a chilen, you gain one pound. &amp; with all the rich, buttery, creamy, velvety, &amp; fattening food you\u2019ve eaten today, you\u2019ll never leave even if you want to, which you won\u2019t since you\u2019ve eaten at least 7,500 chilen\u201d I smiled lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddy\u2019s eyes must have bugged out &amp; his brain must have almost fried itself trying to comprehend how, and more importantly why this college would do this. \u201cWait?!?! What???!!!! Please I got a family waiting back home for me on earth I can\u2019t stay here. Besides I ummphph\u2026\u201d Eddy shouted only to be muffled by our pasta like entrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Eddy, it will all make sense soon, but first we have to get you comfortable &amp; lying down because we are going to bloat you on our newest form of lardy liquor, Blob Bliss, it tastes similar to the alcohol humans call beer. &amp; you\u2019re gonna enjoy the high. Now Kewr, help our forced feeder into a sleeping position; Stebeck, weigh him &amp; determine our best estimated weight our cocktail will have to be. I\u2019ll get the Blob Bliss ingredients &amp; mix up our massive margarita for him then us.\u201d Rowlen ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got it dude.\u201d Kewr &amp; Stebeck responded obediently. Then they did their jobs as Eddy began to spasm &amp; gurgle with his glorious, gluttonous, girth, pardon GROWTH. I was wheeling in the Blob Bliss, when Stebeck determined he would be able to tolerate more than three quarters of his body weight in Blob Bliss. I was mixing up our margaritas to force feed him &amp; preparing ourselves to cuddle &amp; fondle our corpulent &amp; fat human friend &amp; fuck him while he was in ____ &amp; then while we were eating I placed an ____ cock sleeve sex stimulator around his plump penis before it was swallowed by his FUPA. I didn\u2019t need to worry about about it causing too much of a mess as we were fucking him. There were breathing tubes available for us to use on him &amp; us along with the Blob Bliss kegs so we could breathe while under him. We finally began to have sex of the most beautiful, blubbery kind for over an hour before we cleaned ourselves up &amp; licked up his cum from his FUPA. So what happens next\u2026?</span></div></div>",

This can happen to any microorganism, whether they be plant; animal; or higher functioning-sapient beings. Once enough Calorians are inside of a vessel, they allow certain levels of powers like telekinesis to the vessels &amp; body manipulation (without using external muscles.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there is the Harvesting, from the planet Mythorne Erotica, they look like mythical creatures who fatten up species with nature-based powers by luring them in with temptation &amp; inter dimensional magic (only belongs to the most evolved of the Harvesting members who almost represent humans in appearance). They fatten up humans to sustain their home world\u2019s ecosystem with their milk (can come from a male) &amp; cum (males onlyle).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final choice is Blubberbots, &amp; the Glucosian Adiposions, a joint-civilization forming Supreme Universal Genetic Alien Reformatting Empire, or the S.U.G.A.R.

They are A.I.\u2019s  with living, macro-cellular fused, high calories n\u2019 lipids, technopathic hive mind that controls the artificial intelligence that exist within the Glucosian\u2019s body.

How about a race of energy-based aliens called the <b>Calorian Expandions</b>, or <b>Calorians</b> for short, who have evolved into their current form as body manipulators. They don\u2019t sleep or eat physical sustenance, but they sustain themselves by expanding their host vessels whether it be plant; animal; or a sapient, higher-functioning life-form, then feeding off of the positive energy caused by their brains during the expansion of their vessels. All forms work, but particularly weight gain is prominent as they eventually live as caloric energy inside of the expanded bodies. Thousands of these aliens of these begins can exist at once in a morbidly obese. They also change the anatomy so that the more Calorians there are inside of a single vessel, the more happy &amp; healthy are, more food can be eaten without allergic reactions, &amp; better sex life even though the vessels are immobile, &amp; they produce a self-sustaining metabolisms so that no waste is produced if you eat your current amount of body weight in food (though belching &amp; flatulence exist without E. Coli or other harmful waste byproducts even on a molecular level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow about a race of all male &amp; female anthropomorphic, mythical, nature spirit aliens called <b>the Harvesting</b>. They have many subspecies of creatures on their home world Mythorne Erotica, resembling mermaids, sea witches, nagas, harpies, angels, fauns, &amp; dryads/hamadryads, elves, dwarves, fairies, leprechauns, &amp; assorted other folklore creatures. The most evolved ones are \u201cTrue Magic Users\u201d humanoid beings who channel other dimensional magic to cast spells on even aliens so long as they use it for benevolent erotica. The Harvesting are assorted creatures from folklore with hypnotic eyes or pheromone manipulation to lure them in, organic tissue manipulation of animals &amp; plants on a genetic level to transform their victims, &amp; basic physiology traits such as tails, wings, heads, etc. They cultivate humans by using their sexual fluids, meaning lactation from boobs (females or males altered), or cum (males only) at their peaks of lustful size &amp; mindless happiness to water their environments &amp; create food products for their families.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat about instead of a new macroscopic alien species, the fattening is done by a collection of ancient robots called <b>Blubberbots</b>. They are a friendly race of robotic beings that can exist as computer coding symbiotlcally alongside inside of their mechanical bodies, powered by their organic brethren, the Glucosian Adiposions. They <b>Glucosians</b> are made from the degraded bodies of a forgotten race\u2019s decomposed, molecular, physical essence &amp; appear as microorganisms controlled by a hive-mind like resembling the Blob, but less malignant. They act as both the brain &amp; advanced eco-friendly energy sources for the Blubberbots bodies while directing them to search for a new race of organisms to inhabit &amp; a planet system to terraform. They form the <b>Supreme Universal Genetic Alien Reformatting Empire</b> or <b>S.U.G.A.R.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hi, my name is Peter, Peter Porter. I'm a little boy about 10-years old right now &amp; I'm attending a big, fancy, smartypants school in Queens known as Q.ueens, U.niversal, A.cademy of, R.elevant, N.atural, S.ciences. My parents are important teachers there who usually attend to the upperclassmen. I'm no genius but I'm pretty good with science &amp; English with a B- G.P.A. so I'm able to attend my parent's special seminars. Recently Earth has been through a remarkable change. We've discovered we're not alone in the universe. There are really aliens out there. When I first found out it was so cool, it was made even cooler when they landed at the U.N. international headquarters where my parent's took me for take-your-child-to-work-day. We were astounded to meet them, even though they were not even close to what we were expecting. They were like these huge cyborg like aliens with flabby organic parts like jello or cookie dough, mostly at the center of the machinery that was moving them around; hte fatty &amp; smart aliens were called the Glucosians. This is because their real name cannot be pronounced with their current translators: even though they have been monitoring us to learn our language; &amp; it turns out that their molecular composition was an extremely dense &amp; lipidy composition of carbon-based molecues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robotic aspect of these aliens were called the Blubberbots &amp; over the millenia, they have developed sentience, making sentient A.I. programs a possibility for earthborn technology. They Blubberbots metallic frames were extremly durable, but lightweight: had forcefield technology, plus non-lethal weaponry/deterrents for defending against sentient dangerous beings; the forcefields also protected them from the elements while allowing slow but sure exposure to Earth's atmosphere, gravity, solar radiation through the ozone layer; easy to manage (but expensive in terms of any earthly currency) ecosystem stabilizers &amp; feeding units to sustain the Glucosian's needs; &amp; so much more, they were lightyears ahead of our time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite all their upgrades, the Blubberbots lived in symbiosis with their organic counterparts, the Glucosians because their uniquely crafted &amp; extremely efficient, but self-sustaining power chambers charged itself with the bio-electricity of the Glucosian's body mass to work. In turn the Glucosians use their intelligence to build bigger &amp; more powerful bodies for their allies the Blubberbots to make themselves stronger, while the glucosians got fatter &amp; fatter until they were physically immobile &amp; powerless without their mecha-suit friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo back to the topic of why they were here; it was because after several millennia of industrial &amp; biological advancements, they were bored, &amp; wanted to explore the universe, colonizing other planets &amp; sharing their powers &amp; sciences with other likeminded beings. That's when they discovered our earth's internet several decades ago, at least according to their story. They knew from watching earth movies &amp; seeing observing the early stages of the internet that they would have to be delicate if they wished to incorporate themselves into our civilization. They decided to start by releasing random assessment probes over major cities. The probes had sexual hormonal readouts to determine if a prepubescent human was \u201cblue-balled\u201d or \u201chorny\u201d enough to accept the Glucosian\u2019s deal &amp; bond with them willingly for powers. They choose the children of scientists in the area &amp; I, Peter Porter, was a part of that initial release of Glucosians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI first found the Glucosian\u2019s sample DNA being taken away by medical authorities when the meteor crashed into my school\u2019s swimming pool, &amp; I swore I heard a sound coming from it. I touched it with a ruler &amp; then it climbed out of the pool &amp; attempted to multiply/expand its form to smother me. The Glucosian then calmed me down by reaching into my swimsuit (I was about to join the swim team), &amp; started to vibrate &amp; release skin absorbing pheromones of some sort into my body as I writhed &amp; gurgled for help through my muffled face. Unfortunately, no one was there to here me scream or see me in erotic pain, as the authorities already closed down the school for the day due to the probe\u2019s crash. This meant I was the only person there, &amp; then it happened\u2026</span></div></div>",

Yep I was a gay man. I could only hope that this planet was more tolerant of sexual relationships than earth was. But no matter, we'll still have fun together. Back to where I was. We went into the academy gates &amp; saw them close slowly but surely as if something ominous was about to happen. Then as we went in, I noticed that a lot of the students coming in were Shilarians; now I've done my research on them, &amp; I heard they were tall &amp; leanly muscled, yet strong &amp; mighty at the same time. Now I noticed a lot of buff Shilarians, both male &amp; female, but no human students yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, excuse me, but um can you help me?\" I spoke through the translator to the nearest Shilarian who seemed to be a jock, at least judging by the sci-fi uniform with medals on them, or maybe he was a potential soldier, which meant this might be a military academy. God forbids that be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" she said, then i noticed a groin, &amp; I realized it was a boy, or rather a pretty boy face with at least 400 lb. of well distributed &amp; easily carried muscle that bulged against his shorts &amp; tightened his uniform shirt. \"How may I help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Steven Simmons &amp; this is my lover Toni Terrence &amp; my little brother Charlie Simmons. we are the new students, &amp; we're kinda wondering where are all the human students?...\" I asked precociously, \"I know there have been at least two generations of humans living here since Jim Jones negotiated a peace treaty &amp; an alliance with Shilarians, but that would mean that there should be some human students here too right?\" I asked confused &amp; worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assure you,\" he said with a calming voice that was both sweet &amp; masculine, \"there are human students here, they just don't begin the school year at the same time as us Shilarians. But they will be here in two days from now.\" he responded soothing my nerves yet also striking up some suspicion. \"Oh where are my manners? My name is Aaawruin (pronounced Awww-ruin), &amp; i am your Student AID for the year, so let's head on over to the banquet hall.\" Aaawruin introduced &amp; scurried us along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I didn't know we'd get a Student AID for our first year here &amp; uhh...\" I ummed, \"let's get going, I said with a strange sort of nervous zeal. I went in &amp; noticed that we were getting a lot of weird attention from the students &amp; faculty. They were looking at us with open arms &amp; humble faces with warm eyes, that seemed to hide a hint of lustful body language, frustrated expressions, &amp; hungry eyes, like they were going to eat us, but that's not possible. Humans are on good terms with the Shilarians, though i've heard of rumors that humans who go to this planet for any reason, never return to earth. I pushed that though aside &amp; remembered there was an opening banquet, &amp; boy was I hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Hyperion City's finest banquet hall.\" Aaawruin pointed out as he entered with us in tow. We were awestruck at the illustrious enormity of its size, the stupendous simplickity of their science, &amp; of course decadence of both its interior, plus its amazingly delicious smelling food. \"So what do you think? &amp; are you ready to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOWWW!\" Tony, Charlie, &amp; I responded, \"Wait we mean YESSS! \"We sat at the seat of honor in front of the headmaster &amp; the teachers in weird chairs that looked like breakthrough in  art rather than mechanical engineering. We were seated &amp; it seemed that everyone was quiety &amp; politely enjoying their food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile WE dug in with such gusto that I'm surprised we weren't kicked out. Though before we began, we were told something very important. \"One more thing Steven, Tony, &amp; Charlie; as per custom of the Shilarian culture, we give to other races more than we take, in both survival resources &amp; necessary commodities. So to represent that fact, as per manners of this world, whatever I eat, you must eat 3x as much, ALWAYS. Understood?\" Whoa. This was strange, &amp; I'm not sure even Tony, my hot, yet slightly pudgy Italian boyfriend could handle so much food at once, &amp; that was just the salad on his plate which barely took up a quarter of it, but a quarter of our plates was worth about 1 1/2 servings each quarter, thus six servings in total, times three=18 SERVINGS for this feast alone! But I wanted to make a good impression, so I dug through my plate as did Charlie, even though he wanted to be buff like Aaawruin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feast lasted an hour, &amp; in that hour I barely felt my clothes rip or tear, AFter the welcoming feast, it was time for our first class, Biology. We learned the importance of simple animal physiology &amp; botany. As i scratched at my special jewellery given to me by the government to monitor my health, translate Shilarian language, &amp; breath the air, I noticed a tiny itching sensation, I couldn't take it off yet though until the medical checkup at the end of the day. Soon it was lunch time &amp; for one hour, we ate even more, than before &amp; started to feel a little nauseous &amp; dizzy, though this didn't hinder Aaawruin from helping us get to class, I even started to think he had a crush on us, particularly Charlie as he carried him to class on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe made it to Painting where, according to our rules, we were to strip ourselves naked (minus the jewellery &amp; stay in our underwear) as we were modeled for artistic work that we never saw. I was a little jealous that all the girls were flocking towards Tony, but I knew he had that kind of face. Despite that, as we were measured, a new sensation came into our bodies,a sort of tugging &amp; squeezing sensation, though I was told it was probably the measuring tape getting too tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally was the hardest class of all for us, especially Tony, &amp; to a lesser extent me. It was time for Gym Class, by then the effects of our sick stomachs made it almost impossible to move yet here we were still able to do it. We were told to do sit ups &amp; a lot of streching exercises that I think could be useful for sex, though I highly doubt that would be the case. Once again I felt a sort of magnetic sensation pushing me away from my abs as I tried to do sit ups &amp; it happened again as I did my stretches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again another meal, dinner time &amp; this one was twice as big as lunch. I know this sounds silly, but when we asked how we could eat all this food when we are so full, everyone looked for a moment at us in shock. Then Aaawruin decided hand fed us our food like he was making love to us, without the moaning. We were so dazed we barely cared, but the tugging &amp; magnetic sensation was increasing as we ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen as my lover was about to open his mouth, the Headmaster spoke into his microphone. \"Attention Human Students!\" He shouted with such intensity &amp; charisma, that it scared us, but I knew he wasn't mad. \"It is time for...\"</span></div></div>",

For now you will learn the truth about what happened to Jimmy Jones when he came as an ambassador to Shin. We discovered our truest nature as feeders &amp; caretakers after the feast &amp; dance. Now you will live here, with delights &amp; pleasure &amp; bliss for as long as you live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What???!!!!\" my little brother or should I say little blubber was trying to say though it seems that everyone came to feed &amp; massage our tender, supple, &amp; tingling bodies. The teachers pushed buttons underneath their tables &amp; our eyes were cleared as I realized the collar, rings, bracelets, anklets &amp; belts were really used to contain our bodies &amp; once the lights came back up, we saw ourselves through the cameras around the room. We were there all night &amp; for the past two days we were growing into enormous obese blobs of batter &amp; dough filled with yeast. Then I remembered why the gates closed at the entrance, so we wouldn't escape; our classes were so simple (even Gym Class was simple, practically no work); the jewelry we were wearing which acted as health monitors were really keeping us dazed, sedated, &amp; pacified so we wouldn't notice our gains; &amp; finally the feasts &amp; weird sensations were our bodies trying to tell us something is wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe even saw our progress over time as we noticed through the cameras these weird gel straps placed on our bodies corresponding to mountain climbing or zip-lining for the extremely obese with support for our groins as we were now officially butt naked &amp; turning as red as a tomato. Then each of our bodies was forced into laying down positions &amp; Aaawruin came up with some of his Shilarian friends &amp; they began to put these restraints in our mouths to keep us from resisting, all while trying to calm us down.\"Let go of me you sickos. I'm taken already by Steven.\" my lover Tony protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush my little big friends\" Aaawruin whispered into our ears.\"I know this is a lot to take in, but think of it this way, you'll have simple leisurely lard-filled lives with endless bliss, food, cuddling, &amp; sex (for more adult activities). &amp; you'll never have to worry about hygiene or exercise again. Your bodies will be able to take on all sorts of activities that most immobile fatties on earth can't handle all thanks to our food. It quickly (compared to earth food anyways) becomes pure fat &amp; dozens of other nutrients the body needs so no waste, &amp; hygiene is taken care of by chemical lotion baths we give to all humans. Plus there are all sorts of activities &amp; games &amp; fun to be had at this size, like watersports, with you as the flotation/ball device, feeding games, &amp;  massages for you constantly to live in ecstasy. How does that sound.\" Aaawruin finished with glee &amp; anticipation in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen comes a weirder part, as I was thinking about whether this wouldn't be such a bad thing, words matching that description appeared on the screen we were looking while headphones in my ears responded with a deep baritone version of Tony's voice. \"Well I do like to eat, but immobility is a weird thing to take in forever. What if we want to see the world, how will get around to see it, will we be carried by hand or machines?\" Tony's voice came out of the speakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Tony!\" I heard my baritone voice &amp; recoiled in shock, &amp; realized these machines were reading our minds so we don't even have to open our mouths to speak. \"I think I can hear your thoughts on these translators now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Okay, this is weird so can me &amp; my boyfriend you know, have sex together, right now, if we're allowed to?\" Tony asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Tony, we will set you up for it. But you must allow a third male ____student to be apart of this. Being gay means sharing your lover &amp; I assure you we will deliver sex to you two like you've never had before. Now which way do you want it to be with him? Missionary Position or Doggy Style?\" Aaawruin asked inquisitively &amp; lustfully.</span></div></div>",

I felt throbbing ecstasy &amp; increasing horniness as my dick kept getting longer &amp; longer, as well as thicker &amp; thicker. I was so horny, that it felt like I was in an erotic trance. I felt every sensation of rubbing, caressing, &amp; molding, &amp; thrusting into my ass, especially the thrusting into my ass as my dick was exploding with cum. I could only imagine how Tony &amp; Charlie were reacting to this &amp; after being allowed to rest I soon realized I was still humongous &amp; this wasn't some sort of freaky nightmare, we were really, immobile, &amp; helpless to stop our new Shilarian classmates from gang raping us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I looked around I realized by looking in a mirorr that I was somehow connected through an eye in the sky which allowed us to see our enormous bodies. We coud only be described as king-sized mattresses for swollen livestock. We were bigger than any human on the planet; our bellies were like balls of dough bloated outwards till they were five times the size of a beach ball with cavernous innie navels that could probably fit a linebacker comfortably &amp; snugly inside, even a Shilarian of magnitude such as Aaawruin. Our boobs were cozily jutted outward like a muffin top on a giant, &amp; the nipples were taking up most of the surface area on the boobs beign as round as an atlas statue globe. Our legs &amp; arms, at least what could be seen were swallowed up mostly by our growing torso &amp; each extremity was the size of a hippopotamus with it's mouth open where the toes should be with deeply indented toe &amp; finger nails on snake like fingers that were as thick as pythonsI FInally I saw a low angled pimple that was my neck, chins &amp; head. My four chins were about as thick as  &amp; about the size of mattresses consistency of molasses if it were transmuted into human flesh. My head &amp; face were like looking at a boulder that had fallen into a volcano &amp; only came out halfway melted near the top which slanted to the sides with oozing flesh &amp; my cheeks were globes of girth that were beach ball sized while my other features were scrunched up by three tubes going in and out of my face. I should have felt violated, but instead I felt content, \"Ooh, by the way Steven, these probes around you can be controlled with your thoughts &amp; act as your eyes, ears, &amp; voices outside of your body while the tubes are for feeding &amp; breathing.\" That explained the tubes &amp; how I was seeing anything at all \"So ready to meet your boyfriend &amp; 'little brother' Steven?\" Aaawruin snickered &amp; then he pointed to the side where I saw my brother &amp; boy friend were in similar situations, though Tony was slightly higher up where his head should be &amp; Charlie was all around wider but more down to the ground with his head. The only way I could have identified them was by their hair color. Charlie &amp; I were brunettes &amp; Tony was a cute, but greased up dirty blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is quite an experience big bro\" Charlie spoke from his probe. He probably already knew how to use it thanks to Aaawruin's size<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed Charlie\" Tony responded, \"So question, what do we do now???\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell our human student are coming in any minute now. Why dont\u2019 we introduce you to \u2018the Big Man on Campus\u2019 &amp; his \u2018Pudge Posse\u2019.\u201d came another presumably Shilarian voice, \u201cI followed the voice &amp; picked him up, he was a short freshman with the most wonderful blue eyes that seemed to glisten in the light. \u201cMy name is Arrrrwune (pronounced Arrr-Wune), &amp; I\u2019m going to be your BFF, best friend forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u201d my litlte brother responded, he almost seemed flustered like he was getting nervous about this guy. If it weren\u2019t for our immobility, he probably would have stumlbed backwards already onto his blubbery butt, which was now even more blubbery, not that it mattered anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the doors opened up &amp; in squeezed \u2018the Big Man on Campus\u2019 on monumentally strange hover mattresses that were either anti-gravitational or electromagnetic. He was stupendously monumental with a colossal posse. the Big Man was about the size of a small iceburg &amp; his posse were like walruses lounging about on the ice. \u201cLooks like you guys did a pretty good job of fattening up our new freshman. I\u2019m Justin, &amp; welcome little guys! Ready to get pampered in your next class?\u201d he asked with a coy smile that could barely bee seen unless you zoom in with the probe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!!!\u201d We all responded, \u201cWhat\u2019s our next class?\u201d Tony asked...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mikey was floating onward into his first day of public school at Hyperion Academy for Expansion, Ecstasy, and Enlightenment with his brand new Transit Chair (similar tot he ones humans use in WALL-E) along with his little brothers Shiuto &amp; Maximus (I know, you\u2019d think that Maximus would be the oldest, but I digress). He and his two little brothers Shiuto, and Maximus were the first Human/Shilarian hybrids to join their school. Mikey &amp; Maximus takes on many traits of their father in appearance and are immobile like most humans who have come to Planet Shin. They\u2019d never gone to school before &amp; there had never been any human children born on Shin since all the humans brought there are indoctrinated &amp; immobilized when they are at least young adults. Mikey was happy but nervous since he knew 80% of the students are Shilarians; Shiuto was relieved he would get to spend some time with his own kind (being more in touch with his mother\u2019s side) while also getting help tending to his brothers; &amp; Maximus was giddy to meet his new \u201cpwaymates\u201d at school. In order, Mikey was 8-years-old, Shiuto was 6-years-old, &amp; Maximus was 4-years-old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day was sunny, the sky was blue, the air was fresh at Hyperion Academy, &amp; all the Shilarian faculty were preparing a smorgasbord of a feast for their diplomat\u2019s immobile children. While this was happening, the Shilarian students of all age groups were getting toys &amp; books ready for their new Human-Shilarian hybrid students. \u201cOh boy!!! Dis is gonna be fun!!!\u201d Maximus shouted inhumanly high-pitched through his Transit Chairs vocalization speakers while his Transit Chair moved his head to view the school with his own two eyes that weren\u2019t squinted shut. It was the only way an immobile human could learn to communicate with others  &amp; view their surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I\u2019m glad we\u2019re all going to school together brothers. I know you\u2019ll be well off &amp; I can socialize for a change.\u201d Shiuto responded  sarcastically with his own vocal chords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay little bro, I just can\u2019t wait for the welcome feast. I\u2019m still so hungry.\u201d Mikey quipped with a gurgling sound that jiggled his whole body from his facial cheeks, down to his FUPA, &amp; what once were his humanoid toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow down to the goods, Mikey &amp; Maximus\u2019s builds were inhumanely blobbish, a parody of humanoid flesh surging outward beyond ordinary sizes &amp; girth, while also keeping relatively spherical shape without having their heads sucked into their chest, or their cheeks &amp; eyelids obscuring their sight. They were laying down on their backs while the chairs enveloped them in a protective, but breathable force field that kept their bodies inside the Transit Chairs, while also keeping outside influences such as water, bugs, or other organic elements from making contact with their skin. Mikey was a mammoth-sized mini mountain, while his brother being a massive mound of lard; the only way you could see their faces was with their Transit Chairs face screens or when they recline upward into a sitting position. Neither had many rolls, chins, or even stretch marks to mar their precious young bodies. This was all due to daily rubs &amp; abundant use of moisturizers that made their skins as soft, supple, &amp; a lot more simplistic in shape than other fatties on earth would. It also helps that they\u2019ve grown rather quickly over the years, each one weighing more than 1,500 lb. in their baby bellies; with a quarter of that weight going into their boy boobs &amp; penis; &amp; at least two &amp; 1/2 times the weight of their bellies going into their buttery booty cheeks. All this weight they\u2019ve grown over the years has never harmed them, &amp; thanks to never having eaten anything but Shilarian foods, they are healthier than any human on Earth. Plus no waste of any kind in any form is produced, so they\u2019ve never learned to move on their own; take care of themselves; show appetite restraint at all during the day; wear clothes for that matter since they are so big; or even undergo toilet training since they don\u2019t go to the bathroom. This leaves their bodies &amp; skin spotless, clean, &amp; as pale as the day they were born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Shiuto was built like a lanky humanoid, the standard body shape &amp; size for Shilarians. Shiuto was glad he could get the chance to make new friends both Human, &amp; Shilarian alike. Mikey &amp; Maximus were going to enjoy learning about their newfound role in society involving their immensely ever-expanding bodies. They strolled down the road (don\u2019t worry, there is no crime on this planet &amp; the school\u2019s right next door to their lavish open-plan mansion) with Shiuto guiding them towards Hyperion Academy. AT the entrance they see the principal of the school with a group of six students to act as their tour group. After greetings &amp; introductions were done, the Shilarian headmaster guided them towards the cafeteria where they had a breakfast feast prepared for their new students. So whose perspective shall we enter, Mikey's, or Maximus's?</span></div></div>",

Hope you enjoy. This is what\u2019s happening, it\u2019s been 2 decades since we last left our hero Jim who was tricked into eating Shilarian food to be fattened up by his vengeful co-worker Steve. The public never officially knew of this event &amp; were told he was going to live there forever.<br>\r\nA few rules:<br>\r\n1. No tube feeding, at least not until they are immobile, I want to see force feeding or tricking the character to eat shilarian food in large amounts until their first few gorging sessions are over.<br>\r\n2. Sex is okay, as is any sexual orientation except transvestites, so be a little bit descriptive, but keep it in context of their future \"expansion/inflation\".<br>\r\n3. Try making up an interesting feeder lifestyle for the Shilarians in every chapter.<br>\r\n4. The humans can return to earth &amp; go back, visit other planets, or even stay on Shilarian planets &amp; colonies<br>\r\n5. While on Shin they will always eat Shilarian food (to prevent consumption of the planet humans aren't really immortal by eating shilarian food, though they do live longer &amp; something has to be done with their body when they die, no vore).</td>",
