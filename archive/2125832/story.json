Your parents warned you that many Pok\u00e9mon get gobbled up if they aren't careful. Though, they didn't tell you everything that happened to someone predators catch. They constantly held you close to them, keeping you in the top of this tree, trying to make sure you don't wander off into the tall grass or the water. Point is, they would never leave you alone. Which is why this day is especially weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, you woke up, alone. Your parents would've gathered berries while you were asleep, but they'd usually be back by now. You waited a little longer, and your parents still haven't come back. You began to worry. You'd like to go and find them, but the Pok\u00e9mon out there terrified you. Then again, you couldn't just leave them alone. You looked down from the tree, and began to consider how to get down, hopefully without attracting any predators to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore we continue, what Pok\u00e9mon are you?</span></div></div>",

You were a fighting type, though you weren't too experienced with battle. Your parents were two Lucarios. You started to climb down the tree, and looked around the soil for signs of your parents. You then began to sniff the soil around the tree, trying to find your parents' scent. After enough sniffing, you started to smell something familiar. That had to be your parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stuck low, and sniffed the trail as you crawled on the ground. You followed the scent as closely as you possibly could. Unfortunately, you followed the scent so closely, you began to crawl into the tall grass. You were so focused on the scent, you forgot your parents' warning about the grass. Pok\u00e9mon loved to hide in here, lying in wait for some Pok\u00e9mon to pounce on. Your parents warned you about these Pok\u00e9mon eating up some unfortunate folks, and others kidnapping folks to drag them somewhere else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, even if you did remember, you likely wouldn't have taken your parents' warning to heart as you tracked them down. You couldn't just leave them alone. They could be in danger! You kept close to the trail, sniffing up a storm as you crawled. Eventually, you began to pick up an unfamiliar scent. You weren't sure what it was, considering you didn't interact with other Pok\u00e9mon often, if ever. You took your nose off the path and looked ahead, nose wrinkled in confusion.

She had light brown fur, cream-colored fur around her feet, wrists, and at the ends of her extremely long ears. She also had breasts bigger than your head, thick thighs, and a plump rear. Not that you were looking at them... at first. The Lopunny wore a grin that made your heart beat faster in your chest.

Each stride got her closer and closer to you than you could crawl back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-just tell me if you saw some Lucarios pass by here, can you?\" You began to get up to your feet yourself. The Lopunny was silent, which just terrified you. She kept approaching you, wearing that grin.</span></div></div>",

You turned heel and ran, hoping to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, the Lopunny was not only significantly larger than you, she was also much faster! As she saw you turn to run, she laughed and bounded ahead of you, cutting off your escape route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCouldn't get away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft with no other choice, you prepare yourself for battle. As young and inexperienced as you were,you didn't pack much power. But your parents had been helping you with a new move - Force Palm! It was the most powerful attack you knew, and you prayed it would work. At the very least, you hoped to get lucky and paralyze the curvaceous creature. That should slow her enough to allow you to make your escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou focused your energy into your hand just as your parents had taught you. You felt your a warmth radiate down your arm, into your wrist, and finally into your hand. You slowly made your way to the Lopunny, who looked at you curiously. Without a word, you raised your hand to her large body and pressed your palm against her soft flesh. You closed your eyes and released your stored energy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the Lopunny giggle. You opened your eyes to see that your attack was largely ineffective. However, your hand was still pressed against her body. More specifically, her large, round chest. You were essentially groping her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a mix of shock, disgust, and disappointment, you try to pull away, but the Lopunny doesn't allow you to escape. She grabs your wrist with her large hand and shoots you a seductive wink. Immediately, your mind gets foggy and you feel yourself starting to get dizzy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no! Attract! Must...get....away....you thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you can take action, those thoughts melt into feelings of desire for the curvaceous Lopunny. Why would you ever want to leave her? Your place was by her side, in a warm, soft, comforting embrace. You didn't even remember the reason you ventured out from your home in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lopunny smiles with the knowledge that her plan worked. With a laugh, she leapt high into the air. She jumped so high your eyes were unable to track her. You didn't know it at the time, but she had used the move Bounce. You felt your heart sink as the sexy pokemon disappeared into the air. Feeling dejected and rejected, you started to slip into despair. Suddenly, a battle cry from above woke you from your misery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up and saw Lopunny's massive, round ass free falling from the sky. She was heading straight toward you! Deep down, you knew you had to get away. But you were so relieved to see your love return, your feet were rooted to the spot where you stood. You were frozen in place as you watched Lopunny's backside draw closer with every milisecond. She seemed to be falling in slow motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact she made, though, was at a very high speed. She landed with an earth rocking WHOMPH! Your small body collapsed immediately beneath her. The pain from her attack woke you from your Attract-inspired daze, but you were in no position to fight back. And Lopunny was in no hurry to move. She shimmied and shifted in place above you, her thick ass smothering you and crushing you flatter by the moment. She laughed heartily as she enjoyed the feeling of your feeble struggles beneath her. </span></div></div>",

But, alas, your face was buried by bunny butt. You kicked your legs wildly as she rubbed side to side on your face. You wanted to try and push her off, but that'd mean touching her rear. That thought terrified you and made you burn up more, not that the heat coming from her body helped that out at all. \"Ahhhhh... nah, too easy,\" she said before getting up onto her feet, and you quickly sucked in a lungful of fresh air. \"Getting myself a toy isn't nearly as rewarding if I don't play with them to their limits~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, you turned towards her, only to be greeted by her back to you. Before you could so much as back away, the Loppuny's ears suddenly slapped together around your midsection. You were suddenly lifted up into the air and whipped in front of her face. The way she grabbed you, you were forced upside down in front of her grinning face. \"You look even cuter up close~\" she said, tickling your chin.

From your upside down position, you found it difficult to gain your bearings enough to push yourself free with your hands. The difficulty didn't stop you from trying though. Unfortunately, that too failed as you simply slapped at the top of her boobs harmlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lopunny laughed, sending her chest bouncing and jiggling across your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me <i>Confide</i> in you with a secret,\" the enormous Lopunny whispered with a giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen you out with your parents before, and you're the reason I stay here. I've had my eye on you for a while,\" she whispered, lowering your body so that her chest was hugging your entire body. Only your ankles and feet were exposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been waiting to see you on your own,\" she said, still in a whisper. The Lopunny started to shift her breasts up and down, giving you a full body massage with her tits. The sensation of her soft breasts rubbing you up and down made you gasp. You felt yourself start to get excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now that I have you, I'm never. Letting.

You put up your hand in an attempt to defend yourself, but her foot barreled right through it before you could release your aura filled attack. The sole of her large foot collided with your face, sending you flying back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill conscious, but dazed, you tried to push yourself up off your back, but the Lopunny was too quick.

She stomped and pounded your small body with her large feet until you were buried in the turf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Lopunny stepped off of your battered body and admired the fruits of her labor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you I wasn't letting go my little Riolu.

You would have enjoyed that much more,\" she said with a smile. \"Unless,\" Lopunny paused for a moment, \"Unless you prefer being beneath my feet?

All you could do was try to enjoy the sensation of her soft breasts as they bounced your body between them.</span></div></div>",

You began to cry, you lost your parents and now this weird Pok\u00e9mon was taking you away to do who knows what. You were too weak to lift a finger, much less escape her grasp. All the while, the Lopunny seemed to giggle from time to time, thinking about stuff she could do to you, skipping all the way. Soon, she approached a cave, carpeted by cotton dyed red. She went in, and pulled over a grass curtain to cover up the entrance. Then, you felt the breasts around you spread, and you suddenly fell down to her feet, and onto the cotton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got up and immediately ran one way, only to realize there was just cave wall in front of you. You turned around to try and escape, but the Lopunny was already in your way. She was smirking down at you, and easily moved her legs to block your every attempt at slipping past her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me out!\" you cried out, trying desperately to push yourself past one of her legs. But she was steadfast. She pushed you up against the wall, keeping you pinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now why do you want to leave?\" she asked, wearing the same tone she had when you first met her. \"I could make you feel <i>really</i> good. Just look into my eyes.\" You knew what she had in mind. You remembered when she tried something like this with you before, and you kept looking down, away from her eyes. However, she put a hand under your chin, and gently pointed your face at her's. Then, you began feeling that same feeling from before as you looked into her eyes. With a wink, you felt the attacks tugging at you hard.</span></div></div>",

Your fear of what this lunatic Lopunny would do to you was now broken down into eagerness for what ever this beautiful creature desired. Your worries of never seeing your parents again had been swept aside and replaced with fantasies of living the rest of your life with this dazzling Lopunny and all your resentment against your captor had now turned into overwhelming lust for her. Despite your emotions being forcefully rewritten, a tiny particle of yourself remained as a small voice in the back of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lopunny saw your complexion completely change indicating her attract worked, however she sensed that hint of rebellion within you and was determined to break that last little bit resistance. \"Do you still want to leave me?\" the Lopunny asked you while taking her arm off you. You try to reply in your drunken state, \"N-n-no.\" The Lopunny raised an eyebrow, \"But you told me to let you out? I guess I should just let you go.\" Your eyes widened as you felt shock from her words. \"Wait! I didn't mean it!\" you yelled out to her. The bunny turned her back to you and slowly walked away from you, \"No, you were pretty serious about it. I guess you'll never see me again.\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You'll never see me again.\" These words hit you like a freight train and in your mind you felt yourself trapped and alone within a black void. In the distance you saw a light emitting from a doorway with a silhouette of a very promiscuous Lopunny like figure in the entrance facing you. \"Lopunny!\" you shout and you run towards the light, but the figure turns away from you and walks through the doorway. \"You'll never see me again.\" you heard her say. These words began echoing within the void. With a sudden burst of energy you go into a sprint, to try and catch up with your love. \"Lopunny wait don't go!\" you yell out to her to no reply. You closed in on the doorway, as the Lopunny silhouette began to fade away within it. You had to catch up to her, you couldn't imagine never being able to see your love ever again and the very thought of it brought tears to your eyes. The Lopunny figure was nearly gone at this point, but with another burst of energy you dove for the doorway arms outstretched as you were encompassed by the light. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lopunny!\" you yelled out, snapping back into reality. You ran across the cave to your love and grabbed onto her leg before dropping down to your knees and begin to sob. \"I don't want to leave you Lopunny!\" The Lopunny turned her head slightly, arms crossed and looked down at you from the corner of her eye. \"I'm sorry I said those bad things to you, I didn't mean them, all I want is to be with you!\" You tightened your grip around her leg and kept sobbing as your mind was still distraught about the threat of leaving the her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a tender hand begin to rub your head making you look up to see the elegant Lopunny staring down at you. The Lopunny smiled endearingly at you, knowing she had completely broken you. \"There there my little Riolu. It's okay.\" she spoke gently. You wipe your eyes of your tears. and speak up \"D-do you forgive me Lopunny?\" you ask her. She kneels down before telling you,</span></div></div>",

She leaned forward and brought you into a hug, pressing you right up against those hefty bosoms of hers. \"It's like I told you before, i'm never letting go of my little Riolu.\" you hear her say. You nuzzle up against her breasts much like a newborn Pidgey would nestle up in its nest with its mother.  Despite the warm embrace from the Lopunny, the shock from earlier still lingered. Just he mere thought of your beloved dumping you out of her life like some piece of trash was excruciating. You embrace your lover tighter in order to reassure yourself she was still there for you and she would not leave you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLopunny looked down at you at the feeling of your tightened grasp, realizing that you were relapsing and spoke up. \"Aww, is my little darling still shaken up?\" she questioned. You looked up at her with a worried look on your face and simply nodded your head in reply. With a warm smile the Lopunny stood up with you wrapped in her arms. \"Well I know what will make you feel all better.\" she says to you while walking to the side of her bed. She gently lays you down on your back on top of the cherry red velvet covers. You were surprised at how soft they were, it was like you were laying down on a cloud.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Comfy enough for you?\" she asks you. \"Yes ma'am.\" you reply to her. She gets on the bed on all fours and leans over you, \"Good, because i've been wanting to do this far too long.\" she affirms. Her head slowly lowers down towards you, \"So you just lay there and let Ashika have her way with you.\" Her lips pucker together as she drew near you. Your heart began to pound in a rapid pace as you eagerly await Ashika's lush lips to meet yours. Her lips finally press up against your own, bringing you into a deep passionate kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes roll upwards in ecstasy as her lips met yours. You feel her soft hands slide over yours and spread your arms apart before holding both your hands. You couldn't be any happier than you were at this very moment. Ashika parted her lips from yours for a split second in order to catch her breath before quickly pressing them firmly against your own lips once again with a loud moan. Her enchanting moans sent tingles down your body, slowly making your member erect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lopunny's lips open slightly as her tongue quickly invades your mouth and starts to swish around. Following her lead, you swish your tongue around with hers and start to wrestle with her, emitting a loud moan from your love. This moan sent your cock straight up and poking Ashika's stomach. She pulls her head away from yours with a string of saliva hanging from her tongue. She stared down at you with bedroom eyes. \"Damn, that was incredible.\" Ashika states. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as your love sits up and wraps a hand around your prick. \"And I can see you had as much fun as I did.\" she teases, making you blush. Ashika takes her hand off your member and brings it over to her already dripping pussy. \"Just let me prepare myself and we can continue our fun.\" </span></div></div>",

Does this feel enjoyable?\" Her hand felt like it was rubbing your inner thigh, though your fear kept you from looking. You whined. With the Lopunny practically draping all over you, you felt indescribably small. You never felt this scared before. \"Just tell me what to do so I can make this enjoyable for you. Or else I'll keep guessing~\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shivered even more as you felt her body close more and more around you. You felt her breasts pressing against the back of your head, and now her hands were on both of your inner thighs. \"Do you like... this~?\" You shuddered once you felt a chilly gust blow behind your ear. It felt extraordinarily funny, and you felt your heart beat faster. \"How about.. this~?\" You then felt something thick and slimy drag itself across your neck. She just licked you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were squirming like mad, but she kept her grip on you. Mid struggle, she lightly suckled on your ear, which shook your very core. Then, you felt a funny feeling forming between your legs. You hadn't unsheathed yet, but you're on the edge. You heard the Lopunny chuckle. \"Am I gettin' close~?\" she teased. She continued to play with your ears, while still rubbing your thighs. You didn't want to think about what she'd do if you unsheathed. You needed to escape, fast!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the Lopunny women continued to play with and suck your sensitive ears, the funny feeling in between your legs grew and grew. You were shaking and shivering in shameful delight as your sweet spot was continuously stroked and played with the buxom Lopunny. Your member was on the verge of unsheathing, and you couldn't stop it. You tried to escape from her grasp, feeling small and afraid as the larger Pokemon dominated you, but your small frame was too wracked with pleasure to put up a decent fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the inevitable happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lopunny made a satisfied coo as she felt your erect member brush up against her bare breasts that were bigger then your own head. You shut your eyes hard and tried to hold back tears as your shameful erection was exposed to the promiscuous bunny. This had to be the most embarrassing moment of your life. The Lopunny, meanwhile, was immensely satisfied with the small, blue jackals suffering. She hugged your body into her oh-so soft boobs, delighting in the sensation of your member rubbed against the inside of cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, shhhh...\" She slowly whispered into your ears, still slightly wet from her tongue play. \"It's okay, lil' guy. I promise, you'll love what's gonna come next~.\" You felt her lips collide with your forehead, and you made an adorable whine as she planted a kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the Lopunny decided to get into a better position for what she had in mind. You felt your world shift as she knelt down and dropped her upper body onto the ground with her big butt up, smothering you under her curvy chest. In a desperate attempt to escape one last time, you gently pawed at the brown furred titflesh with all your strength, only amounting to a pleased smile from your impromptu jailer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naww! Do you like em', sweetie?\" The Lopunny giggled as you merely swatted at her boobfat, giving her the impression that you were enjoying what was happened to you, being engulfed by bunny flesh and having your ears played with. \"Don't worry, I'll give you a  lot of time to get better acquainted with em'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lopunny suddenly grabbed both sides of her impressive cleavage and began to rub her hands in slow circles. You felt your erect member get massaged from the slow movements of the Lopunny's breasts giggling around you. It felt good. It felt, really, really, good. As much as you were ashamed of yourself for allowing the Lopunny to unsheathe your member, and as scared as you were being away from your parents and assaulted by a curvy stranger that was currently dominating you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could not help but smile just a little bit as your sensitive organ was stroked and petted by the soft flesh smothering your frail body. And that smile was not kept hidden from the Lopuny's sight. \"See? I told ya' you would like it~.\" She softly cooed as she continued to rub her breasts around your phallic pillar, slowly increasing speed as time went on. \"Now...do you still think I'm dangerous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in no position to answer that question. You made an attempt at it spite of the waves of pleasure racking your bod, but the moment you opened your mouth, the Bunny Pokemon's titflesh cascades into it, leaving only your cute, elongated nose to breath through. Apparently, this was an answer enough to the dominating Pokemon as she shivered from you sucking her boobs. \"Haaaa...I think I'll take that as a yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after that, you started to leak precum from your member, coating the inside of the bunny's cleavage with a glossy sheen. Taking advantage if the situation, you opened your eyes wide as you felt the Lopunny's mouth wrap around your sensitive member. She was sucking on your dick! Your mind became jello and you simply lied back on the ground in shameful bliss. If your moth wasn't full of soft breast flab, you would have let out the most content sigh in your whole life. You completely submitted yourself to the promiscuous Lopunny, and simply just allowed her to do whatever she wanted with your body. You couldn't get out from her boob's vice grip on you. There was no form of escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a muffled scream of as you finally met your climax in the Lopunny's mouth. The big bunny happily guzzled up your hot load as you spurted out streams of milky white essence. All in all, it was a pretty good morning for the Lopunny. She let out a happy sigh as she released your dick from her mouth and back into he embrace of her cleavage. \"Mmmmm...tired, little guy?\" She asked, giving you an utterly content smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply nodded up and down through the waves of breast. You felt yourself losing consciousness as the last of your energy left your body. The Lopunny smiled and wrapped her arms back around you in a hug. She stood back up and began to walk you lifeless body to some place you didn't know about. The last thing you heard before you fell asleep in the bunny's arms was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, my little cutie pie. We're going to have so much fun when you wake up~\".<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You fluttered your eyes open after your shame ridden sleep to notice that your body was cast in the shadow of something. You looked up to find the source of the light obstruction, only to find that it was not something, but rather someone. Looming over you was a tall, dominating Greninja women who stared at your now awake body with an emotionless expression, hopefully in your case because she was skilled at hiding her emotions, and not because she was apathetic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Frog Pokemon was, like the Lopunny from before, incredibly voluptuous. However, while the rabbit Pokemon had an hourglass shape that seemed to be slightly more top heavy, the Greninja before you clearly had a pear shaped form. While her heaving bosom was nothing to sneeze at, it pales in comparison of the immensity of each of the water type pokemon\u2019s rear end. While the Lopunny\u2019s breasts were bigger than your head, this greninja\u2019s asscheeks were bigger than your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving to be in the presence of yet another imposing female Pokemon, especially after what had transpired before you fell asleep, you instinctively tried to escape your situation. You were in a cave with a narrow entrance. It looked lived in, with the pieces of furniture here and there. This could have been the Lopunny\u2019s home. Or the Greninja\u2019s. Or maybe they lived together. You didn't particularly care, like how you didn\u2019t care for what had happened to your previous jailer. All that mattered to you was getting out of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut looking over your surroundings, your hopes were all bat dashed as you realized that the still ooming Greninja was blocking the only entrance and exit of the cave. If you made a run for it, you would most assuredly get impeded in your tracks just by the greninja shifting the stance of her thick, padded legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, you were trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing this, the next instinctual course of action that came into your mind was to cry. You wanted to cry your eyes out until your tear ducts would try and hot liquid would stain your cheeks and make a puddle at your feet. But you couldn't do that either. The imposing Greninja\u2019s gaze was to piercing, too powerful to show such an amount of emotion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTherefore, you opted to promptly curl your body into a fetal position and instead just quietly sob at the hopelessness of your situation. You missed your parents. You wanted to go home. You wanted everything to be okay again like it was yesterday. You wished you never left the tree. You should have waited for your parents to come back. They were probably back home, wondering where you could have gone. It was just too much for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou than felt the Greninja\u2019s hot breath roll over your body as she knelt down to your level. You did not dare open your eyes, less you be subjected to the same embarrassing torture that the Lopunny put you through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOpen your eyes.\u201d The voice of the Greninja commanded you. Her voice was as smooth as silk and soft jazz, but deep and gravitas like a low bass cello being continuously stroked by a bow. It was powerful, but not cold. Authoritative, but not without some level of sympathy. After a few moments and a few more tears, you obeyed. You uncured from your ball-like position and open your eyes, though not wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know why you are here?\u201d The Greninja with a voice as smooth as dark honey asked you. You gave no verbal response, but you did shake your head from side to side to signify that you did not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Greninja gave a sigh, her warm breath once again washing over your small body. \u201cYou are here,\u201d the Water Type Frog began, \u201cTo be our slave. You have already met Lopunny, my mate, and your other new master. From now on, you will be our servant, and our toy. You will do whatever we command of you, whether it be menial, sexual, or otherwise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Greninja paused for a moment for you to once again collect your breath, having been shaken by her explanation so far. Once you had settled, she went on. \u201cIf you try to escape, or if you do your tasks poorly, we will hunt you down and consume you, so that you can be of some use to us. You are not going to see your family and friends ever again. From this point onwards, me and my mate are your entire world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, the hopelessness of everything thus far came crumbling down on you like the weight of the world fell off of Atlas Shoulders and onto your back. Once again, you began to cry, this time louder, yet still somewhat subdued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Greninja went quiet as she observed you cry your eyes out. Without noise, she move her webbed paw forward to your face to wipe the stream of tears off of your cheek. Her cold, reptilian skin felt nice on your hot fur. \u201cShhhh\u2026\u201dShe commanded you to be quiet in a ton enot unlike your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you obeyed the Greninja, something you realized you will be doing a whole lot more of in the future. \u201cHowever,\u201d The Greninja spoke, shifting her body from kneeling down in front of you to sitting with her legs crossed in front of you, \u201cIf you perform your duties without question, and to their fullest extent, the two of us can be very, very kind and gentle guardians for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother tear rolled off your cheek onto the ground near your paws, which prompted the Greninja to scoot her dominating body closer towards you, her webbed paw moving behind you to rub your back in a soothing motion. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to cry. It\u2019s okay, you\u2019re okay.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quivered your lip as you looked up at the half closed eyes of your new master, her dull, red irises piercing into your soul. \u201cI-I wanna g-g-g-go home\u201d You stuttered in between sniffles, saying the first words to the Greninja since you met her moments ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Greninja pulled you closer with her push of her paw on your back, making contact with her cool leg skin. \u201cI know\u201d, she responded, \u201cBut i\u2019m sorry to say that you cannot. This is your home now. And if you ever try to leave it, to leave me and my mate, we will kill you.\u201d She said matter of factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stifled another sob as she said these words. They attacked your sensitive ears like a load of bricks on your head. \u201cB-butt...b-b-b-utt\u2026\u201d You tried to say more, but the words refused to come out. Only echoes of want you wanted to say sputtered in between your lips in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Greninja moved her other webbed paw towards you, and you found yourself gripped at both sides by the frog women. She lifted you up into the air, before setting you down on her lap, comforted by the warn paunch of her chubby midsection. She than move both paws back towards you back and pressed them tight against you, in turn pressing your body deeper into her own belly fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know this is scary for you, my little Riolu. But trust me when I say this, being my servant, my toy, my...child will not be as terrible as you think.\u201d The Greninja hesitated at her last defininton of your role as her slave. \u201cYou will be well taken care of. We\u2019ll feed you, \u2018play\u2019 with you, sleep with you...and perhaps even love you\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Love me?\u2019 you thought to yourself. \u2018She\u2019s openly stating how she\u2019ll hurt me if I try to leave...and she\u2019s saying she might love me?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDear little Riolu,\u201d The Greninja looked down at your frail, diminutive form pressed into the chub of her stomach, chub that she has gained from eating countless other Pokemon the size and age as you. \u201cAlthough you have no choice in the matter anyways...do you me as your new master?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a question that you thought long and hard on. Do you accept the reality of you situation and devote yourself to this dominating, yet perhaps gentle and kind, frog? Or do you deny it and actively try to leave this cave and her at any and every opportune moment?</span></div></div>",

Her face was still unreadable, but you could tell that she wanted an answer to her question. After a long time of thinking, you open you mouth to finally respond\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPANDORAAAAA~!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you were quickly brought to silence as an incredibly familiar voice screamed in a sing song tone, the sound waves reverberating off the cave walls and bounced onto your ears like a heavy drum. You turn your head to the face of the cave, the left side of your face partially obscured by the Frog\u2019s belly chub, to see that the Lopunny from before had walked onto the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Greninja women, who you could now assume was named Pandora, gave out an annoyed sigh. \u201cYes, Faith, my mate?\u201d She lazily turned her head to meet her lover, to which the busty Lopunny only grinned wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m home!\u201d The bouncy rabbit Pokemon, who was named Faith, skipped merrily towards the frog in question, not even bothering to acknowledge your presence, pressed up against her soft belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Faith, I can see that.\u201d Pandora remarked dryly. \u201cIs there any particular reason as to why this is such a cause for jubilation?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPandora! How could you?!\u201d Faith tease, mockingly aghast at her lover\u2019s unconcern for her returning to their cave. \u201cIt\u2019s a Pokemon eat Pokemon world out there, ya\u2019 know? I could go out to get some berries one day, and BAM!\u201d She clapped her furry mits to emphasize her point. \u201cA Pokemon comes out of nowhere and gobbles poor little me up! Today, I came home without a scratch on me, AND I captured ourselves a slave to boot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lopunny named Faith acknowledge you for the first time, and you fell under her lustful gaze as she shifted her head to face your scared face. \u201cI think I\u2019m entitled to shouting my lover\u2019s name at the top of my lungs when I come home~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the Greninja give out an amused chuckle. You couldn't move your head to see, but Pandora was smirking. Without warning, her pink tongue that wrapper around her neck and head like a scarf unwinded a tad and sprung towards Faith\u2019s torso. The tongue wrapped around the Lopunny\u2019s voluptuous form, and, with a disheveled eep, effortlessly brought her down to the floor and inches away from Pandora\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Faith, my silly little bunny\u2026\u201d Pandora cooed and kissed Faith through her tongue. The Lopunny relaxed and eased into the kiss, instantly moving her arms towards her lover\u2019s ample ass to give it a squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you were caught up in the middle of all this, forced to look on the two curvy, domineering Pokemon make out. It was incredibly unnerving and embarrassing, but you just couldn't look away. You felt yourself get hotter in the face and began to squirm a little bit to make yourself as comfortable as possible in Pandora\u2019s grasp. Out of the corner of her eye, Faith noticed your struggles and broke off the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well would you look at that!\u201d She smiled a devious smile that shooked you to your core. Finally up and at em,\u2019 and your ready to go again, huh?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now Faith.\u201d Pandora rubbed your back soothingly. \u201cYou had your fun already, now it;s my turn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww, but Pandora!\u201d The Lopunny whined. Faith gave her best pouty face; her head tilted, a quivered lip as her eyes grew to saucer like proportions, which in turn began to glaze over. \u201cHe\u2019s such an easy fuuuuuck!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo means no, Faith.\u201d Pandora gently slapped her lover\u2019s face with her powerful tongue. \u201cHe\u2019s ours, which means we will share him. You got to \u2018play\u2019 with first, and it\u2019s only fair that he get\u2019s to play with me...or maybe you\u2019ve grown tired of \u2018playing\u2019 with me~\u201d She teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, Pandora, don\u2019t even kid about stuff like that.\u201d Faith wen\u2019t semi-serious for a moment, before her elated expression came back in full force. \u201cI know! Why don\u2019t we let him decide?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHhmm?\u201d Pandora looked down at your body, still tightly pressed against her lap. \u201c...now that you mention it, I think that would be an excellent idea. I\u2019m curious to see which one of us he deems more \u2018fun\u2019.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped audibly as you once again found yourself in a crossroads, only this time there was no convenient way of weaseling out of the question. The Lopunny tapped her foot on the cavern floor, getting impatient.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You couldn't move too much, so you opted to signal your decision by burying your little head into the frog\u2019s belly chub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201d Pandora murred as she stroked the back of your head. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you will just have to be patient, my Faith. Our little plaything has chosen...wisely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith rolled her eyes back and gave an overly exaggerated sign. \u201cFine, he\u2019ll stay with you for now. \u2018Can\u2019t say I don\u2019t see why he chose you, though.\u201d She smirked and playfully smacked her fat ass, letting it jiggle and quiver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPandora, in response, smiled and rolled her eyes as well. \u201cSilly bunny, go put the berries in kitchen. You know how this always works up an appetite for me.\u201d She giggled, which kinda put you on edge. What would happen if she had a lapse of control and...no. That would be just crazy!...right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith obeyed her mate and traveled deeper into the cave, where you assumed there was more living space for the two of them. Pandora finally let you go of her vice grip on you, and you fell down her lap with a muted thud. She looked down on you with a mix of excitement, sympathy, and a little impatiens. It must have been awhile since she \u2018relieved\u2019 herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for choosing me, little one.

Pandora may be just as, if not more, open about what his nw life was going to entail, at the very least she had standards, and seemed to like you for more than just being an easy sex toy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow\u201d, the promiscuous frog instructed. \u201cLie down on your belly on the floor and close your eyes. I don\u2019t want you to see what is to come...yet.\u201d The Greninja called Pandora lifted you off of her fleshy, meaty lap and set you down on the cold cavern floor. Gulping, you do as you are told and lie on the ground with your back exposed to Greninja above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPandora had to keep herself from salivating at the sight of your defenceless, small body lying in the open, awaiting your fate. She promised to stay in control, and that was what she was going to do. With a grin nonetheless, she than proceeded to start her little \u2018playtime\u2019. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The weight, however, felt wet, and squishy like a frog's skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can open up now,\" the greninja said. At her order, you opened your eyes, and tried to lift up to get a view of the scene. However, the weight above you kept you pinned. Curious and worried, you lifted a hand and ran it over the surface above you. It felt smooth, slick with water, and, save for a crack dividing the surface in half, it was as smooth as a balloon, and as plush as a pillow. You blushed upon realizing where you were. Pandora was sitting upon you, her whole butt covering up your tiny form!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon realizing this, you pressed your hands against the floor, and tried to push yourself up, hoping to remove her. However, if her mere rump was so much bigger than you, then you had no chance of escaping her. \"Now, don't fight it, please,\" Pandora said. \"This is supposed to be fun. I can't have a whole lot of fun if you keep trying to get away.\" She then wriggled her rump side to side, grinding into you, and making it a little less comfortable for you to resist. Forced to stop by her rubbing, you flopped down, your arms stretched out against the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now, just lie there, and take it. If you don't, you're going to get more than a grinding for your resistance.\" She sat still upon you, before using her legs to help her lean back, putting even more weight on your body. Were her rear not plush, this'd hurt a lot more. It still hurt, only less than it would. You groaned, upset that you wound up in this position. You thought she'd be nice, yet here she was, sitting upon you like a chair or a pillow. It was utterly humiliating.</span></div></div>",

You thought about putting yourself out from underneath the Greninja\u2019s plush ass and make a B-Line out of her cave into the wide-open world. But the more you thought about it, the more unrealistic that sounded in your head. Even if you did manage to escape from this little game, Pandora would be fast enough to catch you running. And she outlined in detail what will happen when she does. And even if you could outrun the voluptuous frog\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere would you go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides your supposed new masters, you were utterly alone in this voracious world. Your parents were gone, maybe even dead, stewing away in the gut of some cruel and vindictive predator. You didn\u2019t know the outside like they did. You don\u2019t know how to do ANYTHING without your parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pandora continued to press her slick, taut rear end onto your back, you slowly came to the realization that staying with her and the Lopunny and trying to get on their good side was your best possible chance of survival in this world. The two of them were lust driven and play WAY too rough, but maybe it won\u2019t be all bad, being a...a slave. It was utterly humiliating to be used as a chair for this woman, but all things considered, she was still being gentle. If her entire weight was not being pressed down, you might\u2019ve enjoyed being under something so soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a reluctant sigh with the limited amount of air you had, you continued to obey your new master and just \u2018grin and bear it\u2019 as she said. You kept your paws and arms by your side, helped by the immense weight pinning them down. The situation was not ideal\u2026but you would be lying if you said you weren\u2019t getting a little bit excited. The Greninja above you noticed your acceptance of her \u2018playtime\u2019, and smiled through her tongue scarf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm...see? It\u2019s not so bad, is it?\u201d Pandora patted her ample ass affectionately, waves of jiggles massaging up and down your body. The Greninja leaned herself forwards, alleviating some of the weight as a reward for your cooperation. \u201cNow...this next part may feel strange, but I think you\u2019ll understand why it\u2019s my favorite pastime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were confused by what she meant with her wording, until you felt the powerful muscles of the frog\u2019s ass clench around your diminutive body. You grunted as you were assaulted on all sides save for your front by the powerful vice grip. Just grin and bear it, just grin and bear it\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you found yourself being lifted up into the air as Pandora raised herself up with you in between her cheeks. You blushed at the utter embarrassment of it all, but was too overwhelmed to complain. Just when the grip around you started to relax, a webbed finger pushed you deep into her crack to prevent escape. You were completely hidden from the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout the pressure of her weight on your body, you could now fully appreciate how plush and soft the Greninja\u2019s backside was. Her son was rubbery and coating in a thin slick of water, yet your small paws sank into the warn, fat flesh like pillow in your old bedroom, only softer. You blushed as you couldn\u2019t help yourself from rubbing your captor\u2019s fat ass, much to her pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm. I knew you would know how to appreciate a women\u2019s curves, lil\u2019 one.\u201d Pandora croaked, giving the frog equivalent of a cat\u2019s purr.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I actually a little impressed. Most Pokemon his size tucker themselves out and take a rest after so long\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, your luscious ass isn't good enough to sleep in?\u201d. The Lopunny was mock offended how you mistreated her lover, and spanked you (or at least, her lover\u2019s ass) hard. \u201cBut maybe we'll get him some food at this place. I don\u2019t think the thing has eaten all day\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that would be a good Idea. He should get to eat something soon, sure, but not outside. Pinton isn't really the place for little prey like him.\u201d Pandora mused as the dirt path the two were travelling on slowly became more and more paved. \u201cI mean, what would you do If you saw such a helpless tyke all alone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI probably would do exactly what I did when I first saw him, except If I had better things to do.\u201d The Lopunny rolled her eyes. \u201cCome to think of it...what do we even call him anyway? I mean, we can't just keep saying \u2018little guy\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201d Pandora put a webbed paw to her tongue scarf and scratched it, as the paved dirt road underneath her feet gave way to a cobblestone street. \u201cHe looked like he was a feral, meaning he was raised in the forest. Most families don't tend to give their kids names, something about how most of them die to predators like us. We could give him a name, but It would have to be something that asserts our dominance over him so he doesn't get any \u2018bright\u2019 ideas\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooooh, this Is all so exciting!\u201d The Lopunny giggled slash cheered. \u201cI\u2019m already bursting with Ideas. What about...bug?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot bad, but too obvious. Let\u2019s not worry about that now though, we're almost in town.\u201d Pandora noted as the two voluptuous Pokemon made their way towards civilization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinton was the predator based populated town where Pandora and Faith were born and raised. They move outside the town limits to get better access to feral prey in the forest, and had even converted their cave with all the creature comforts of home. Growing up in a town that allowed people to eat other on the street without consequences gave them a pretty short childhood. They grew up quick and mean to survive in a town prone to rampant death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet Faith and Pandora love their little pred paradise out and out. Perhaps they were looking at it through rose tinted glasses, but it housed several amenities that they couldn't live without; It had a nice park to stroll in, a police force to deal with crime, even a school! But the main reason why the two were strolling through their hometown today was the food. Eating prey from the forest and living off of berries is nice, but now and than the two lovers have a hankering for some good ol\u2019 comfort food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did they go to eat?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It is said in Pinton that of you ever wanted to find Buttered Up Hearts Pastry Store all you had to do was follow your nose. This saying wrung true as they approached the small store the delicious aroma of baked goods and cinnamon got stronger. It was hard enough to hold back the urge to salivate as they stepped into the shop proper and a familiar miltank greeted them from behind the counter. The shop itself had a huge variety of confectionery delights. From cakes to donuts you name it she had it but the crown jewel of them all was the famous Goodra Roll. A large cinnamon roll with a generous layers of sticky icing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillie smiled from behind the counter. \"Well if it isn't my two favorite customers. How yah been? Yah didn't forget about little old me did yah?\" She said jokingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith gives her a pat on the head. \"Who could ever forget about you we only be friends since forever\". Back in the day she worked in the store helping to bake goods where she would sometimes sneak them free food from time to time. Her kind heart did make growing up in Pinton a little easier and they became friends. Later on she would grow up to take over the shop herself where is is known as the best baker around along with having a bit of a temper when provoked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMille laughed a little. \"Alright what can I get yah, the usual?\" Pandora nodded \" Yes three Goodra Rolls please\". Mille paused for a second \"Three Goodra Rolls, well okay. I will just add them to yah tab.\" Faith went wide with shock. \"Wait, What?!\" Mille was bawling with laughter. \"I'm just kidding girl they are on me this time, you should see the look on your face right now\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith regained her composure. \"Alright you got me good, thanks Millie.\" Millie puts the three rolls into a basket and sends them on their way. \"Yah come back anytime\". As they left the store the lovers said in unison \"Don't worry we will.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked back home Faith kept brainstorming ideas. \"How about Runt?\" Pandora replied \"That name is definitely better than bug, I will think about it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile you were having troubles that were becoming harder to just grin and bear it.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">You realized that you were looking up at a huge, anthropomorphic nidoqueen, just a few meters away from you. You instantly duck into the tall grass, hiding from sight. Luckily, the nidoqueen was turned away from you, so she didn\u2019t seem to have noticed you yet. She was the largest Pokemon you\u2019ve ever seen, almost four times your size, and you blushed slightly seeing her huge, curvy body, able to get a good look at the unbelievably huge, featureless breasts of the unaware Pokemon. She seemed to be just minding her own business, picking berries from a bush while humming happily to herself. You thought wild Pokemon were supposed to be scary, but she just seemed so nice. You desperately wanted to ask her for help, but\u2026 you weren\u2019t supposed to talk to strangers\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were pondering this, you only barely noticed the rustling in the tall grass around you. Apparently, you had been so distracted by the nidoqueen that you hadn\u2019t even noticed another threat creeping up behind you. Your heart seized as you heard that tell-tale slithering noise, and the hissing of a serpent rearing back to strike. Before you could even react, the serpent's tail had already wrapped around your torso, restricting your arms to your sides like a straitjacket. You whimpered as the tail wrapped around your whole body until only your head was visible, as you looked up into the eyes of your captor -- an Ekans! <span class=\"cplum\"><b>\u201cHello there, little jackal...\u201d</b></span> the sadistic Ekans taunted, delighted by the sight of you crying in fear. <span class=\"cplum\"><b>\u201cDon\u2019t you know it\u2019s dangerous in the tall grass?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sobbing now. You were sure that this was it; that you were about to be killed by the huge snake. But just as the Ekans reared back to finish you off, a huge blue hand suddenly grabs her by the neck. The hand pulled the serperior away from you, freeing you from the snake\u2019s coils and letting you fall to the ground. You realize that the nidoqueen had noticed what was going on, and had grabbed the Ekans just in the nick of time. You look up to see the nidoqueen easily holding the Ekans, as she struggled to get away. <span class=\"cplum\"><b>\u201cHey! Let go of me, lady!\u201d</b></span> the Ekans yelled in anger, not wanting to let her prey escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cYou were about to devour this innocent riolu, were you not?\u201d</b></span> the nidoqueen demanded, angrily. The Ekans froze for a moment in terror, realizing how much trouble she was in. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cDisgraceful, targeting Pokemon too small and weak to fight back. Let\u2019s see how you like it!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched in awe as the nidoqueen slipped the snake\u2019s head into her throat. The Ekans began writhing with renewed vigor, trying desperately to get away before she was devoured. But it was too late; the nidoqueen had a solid grip on the snake, and started to easily funnel the Ekans' long body down her throat. At the widest part of the serpent\u2019s body, the nidoqueen had to funnel her body in bit by bit with a series of loud gulps, as the end of her tail waves around in a futile bid to escape. But as the serpent\u2019s tail thins out by the end, the nidoqueen was able to finish her off by slipping up her tail like a noodle. The massive, long bulge in the nidoqueen throat disappeared behind her breasts, as the writhing serpent finally settled in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nidoqueen\u2019s blue, perfectly round belly bulged out to an incredible size, much bigger than your entire body. You stared at it as it jiggled and undulated while the serpent struggles desperately inside. The nidoqueen stretches her back, rubbing her now full stomach contentedly, enjoy the movement of the sadistic predator inside. She gets a little preoccupied with this for a few minutes, until she finally remembered that you were there. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cWell aren\u2019t you just the sweetest little thing?\u201d</b></span> the nidoqueen smiled, kneeling down in front of you as you backed away nervously, staring at her huge stomach. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, little one. I\u2019m not going to hurt you. I just had to take care of that cruel, vile little snake.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she displayed her stomach to you, she let you curiously place a paw against her soft belly, feeling the distended skin and the writhing of the serpent inside. She giggled as you enjoyed rubbing her stomach, causing her belly to wriggle in your hand. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cSee? I\u2019m not so scary,\u201d</b></span> the massive nidoqueen said, sitting down beside you. You\u2019ve never talked to strange Pokemon before, but the kind, soothing way the nidoqueen talked reminded you of your mother, which calmed you somewhat. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cNow, just what are you doing out in the wilderness all by yourself, little guy? Where are your parents?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed your arm sadly, reminded of how alone you were.<b> \u201cI-I just woke up this morning, and\u2026 they were gone!\u201d</b></font></span> you said tearfully. <b>\u201cT-they never leave without telling me! I don\u2019t know what happened!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cOh, you poor thing. I\u2019m sure your parents are just fine,\u201d</b></span> the nidoqueen reassured you, hugging you against her warm side, making you feel a little better. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cWhere did you see them last?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re not supposed to tell anyone where you live\u2026 but the nidoqueen seems nice enough. You point backwards out of the tall grass, back to the tree you\u2019ve spent your whole life hiding in. <b>\u201cOver there, by that tree,\u201d</b> you frowned. <b>\u201cThat\u2019s where we live...\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cWell, we can go wait for them together. How does that sound?\u201d</b></span> the nidoqueen offered, standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cNo!\u201d</b> you insisted, sniffing around for their scent again. <b>\u201cWe can\u2019t just wait around! I have to go find them!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure they just went out to collect berries. What if they come home and find you missing? Think about how scared they\u2019d be,\u201d</b></span> she said, and seeing her logic, you calm down. You can\u2019t imagine how scared your parents would be if they came home and you weren\u2019t in your tree. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cWe should wait for them for at least a little while. I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be back any minute.\u201d</b></span> Reluctantly agreeing, you let her pick you up in her arms and cradle you gently against her soft chest as she carried you back to your home. While being in the wilderness for the first time was scary, for some reason, being in the nidoqueen\u2019s embrace was the calmest you\u2019ve been in a long time. Your parents were always paranoid, and freaking out over everything\u2026 but the nidoqueen was always calm, and trying to convince you that everything was okay. It was refreshing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy that evening, the two of you had set up a bonfire underneath the old tree, with the smoke hopefully serving as a signal for your parents to return home. The nidoqueen entertained you with her beautiful singing, and regaled you with stories of her adventures across the wilderness. In one day, she had taught you more about the outside world than you had ever learned in your life. By sunset, you were sitting down on her huge, bulging stomach, the two of you chomping down on delicious payapa berries as you sat by the fire. The serperior within her belly had stopped struggling a few hours ago, but you still enjoyed cuddling the nidoqueen\u2019s soft belly as the serpent gurgled away. But as the hours past, you grew increasingly worried about your parents\u2019 fates, despite nidoqueen\u2019s attempts to calm you. <b>\u201cShould\u2026 should we go look for them?\u201d</b> you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowns. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cIt\u2019s getting late. The most dangerous Pokemon hunt at night,\u201d</b></span> she said, quietly. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cWe\u2019ll look for them in the morning. Okay?\u201d</b></span> You nodded sadly. \u201cThen you should get a good rest tonight. Tomorrow will be a big day.\u201d She let you use her soft belly as a makeshift bed for the night; which, after years of sleeping on tree branches, was the most comfortable bed you\u2019ve ever rested on. This was your first time sleeping in the outside world, and you couldn\u2019t help but feel a little worried\u2026 but knowing the nidoqueen would keep you safe kept you feeling snug and secure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile, you slowly drifted off to sleep\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, you were following your parent\u2019s scent once again, with the nidoqueen following behind. You were much more confident now. You would find them in no time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the trail leads you to...</div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">You kept low to the ground as you sniffed up your parents' scent. Meanwhile, you kept an ear out for the niidoqueen from earlier. You felt a lot more confident as long as she was nearby. After sniffing for a while, the scenery began to change. Ahead of you, you saw the mouth of a cave. The inside was really dark, and you were worried about what was in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>\"Why would they go in here for some berries?\"</b></span> the nidoqueen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"I don't know, but I definitely smell them down there,\"</b> you said. You ushered the nidoqueen forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>\"There are lots of dangerous Pok\u00e9mon in there, do you really want to go in?\"</b></span> the nidoqueen said. You paused to think. You looked forward, and couldn't even imagine what would be in there. Part of that was your lack of knowledge on the outside world, and part of that was the darkness. Any sort of monster could be hunting down there. However, deep down you knew you needed to find your parents. They could be in danger, or fighting some Pok\u00e9mon, or who knows what. All you know is, the only way to find them I through here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"I'm sure,\"</b> you said, nodding your head. The nidoqueen said nothing, but picked you up. She held you against her chest, and walked forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>\"Just tell me where to go,\"</b></span> the nidoqueen said. You kept sniffing the air, and pointed in the direction you smelled their scent. The nidoqueen followed your instructions. The cave was awfully dark, but your vision was slowly adjusting. Past the darkness, you saw that the walls were simple stone. You heard the sound of water dripping echoing throughout the cavern. In addition, you heard the occasional scamper of some unseen Pok\u00e9mon echoing along the cave walls. You could swear some of the scampering sounded like stone clashing against stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept sniffing out your parents' scent, and kept directing the nidoqueen down the cave, rounding particular corners. As she walked, two thoughts crossed your mind. Were your parents safe when they came this way, or were they forced down here? Why would they go down here, and what could possibly be taking them this way? Your second thought was about how neither of you encountered a single Pok\u00e9mon yet. You definitely heard them, were they just that scared of the nidoqueen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of you were sure how long you were traveling the cave, nor were you sure about how long the cave was. The silence worried you. You know there was something in the darkness, but you had no idea what. Could they be more powerful than the nidoqueen? Surely not, she was so big after all. But what if someone was bigger? How much bigger could this cave house? Who's to say it doesn't get bigger the further along your parents' trail you got? Did they even leave the cave?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your fear increased, you snuggled deeper into the nidoqueen's chest, who seemed to hold you closer to her. She may've been your sole saving grace here. You'd probably be paralyzed with fear in the tall grass without her. You nuzzled against her arm in response, trying to calm down. You didn't even realize your breathing increased until you began to calm down. You hugged the nidoqueen's arm tighter, sighing contently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept sniffing, but eventually, you heard the ground under the nidoqueen creak. With each step, the floor creaked more. Then, in a split second, you felt like all the supports under her gave away as you were suddenly thrust in a free fall. In that split second, the nidoqueen tossed you forward, away from the pit. You turned back, and looked on in horror as she disappeared into a newly formed pit under her. You ran to the edge and looked down. All you could see was sheer darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Ma'am!\"</b> you cried into the pit. You waited for any word from her down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>\"I'm ok!\"</b></span> you heard from down there. You sighed in relief, a few tears dripping from your eyes. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\"I'm gonna try to find some way out of here. Just, please stay put!\"</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"I will!\"</b> you shouted back. You then decided to sit down. You couldn't even tell where the nidoqueen was, much less if she did find a way out of there. However, there wasn't much you could do. As you wondered about her progress, you heard something near you. It sounded like something walking around the cave. They sounded too close for your liking. You tried to turn to the source of it, but it was still too dark. Eventually, the movement got close. You turned to the source, and you could begin to see the outline of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...</font></span></div></div>",

Goodness!\u201d</b></span> the nidoqueen frowned. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cAre you sure they went that way, sweetheart? I can\u2019t imagine what business they\u2019d have in a place like that\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sniffed around for confirmation, and surely enough, you could clearly smell their scent leading down into the bog. <b>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m pretty sure\u2026\u201d</b> you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe considers her course of action for a second. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cWell\u2026 alright\u2026\u201d</b></span> she relents, offering you a hand. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cHop on my back, little one. I\u2019ll have to wade through.\u201d</b></span> You felt a little guilty having her do all this for you, but you don\u2019t think you could find your parents by yourself. You certainly don\u2019t want to go for a swim in the swamp waters. You let the nidoqueen gently take you in her hands, and place you on her shoulders. The nidoqueen wades into the disgusting swamp water, the brown much coming all the way up to her chest, even at her size. The canopy over the swamp shrouded it in darkness, and through the tangled mess of vines and trees, you quickly lost all sense of direction. You would occasionally flinch at the sound of something splashing in the water nearby, but you never spot anything more than an errant magikarp. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cSmell them anywhere?\u201d</b></span> the nidoqueen asked, obviously not enjoying her impromptu swim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sniff at the air, but the natural smell of the swamp overpowers everything else. <b>\u201cI can\u2019t smell anything in this swamp!\u201d</b> you report, your heart sinking. How are you ever going to find them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to check around on the other side,\u201d</b></span> the nidoqueen sighed, not particularly fond of this neck of the woods. Seeing your fear, she tries to calm you with some light conversation as she travels. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cSo, tell me\u2026 these Pokemon we're searching for. What are they like?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about her question for a long time. Your parents are all you know, so you\u2019ve never really analyzed them. You suppose you\u2019ve taken them for granted. <b>\u201cThey\u2019re\u2026 really nice. Sort of like you. But\u2026\u201d</b> you shrug. <b>\u201cThey\u2019re always worried about something. Always telling me things are just too dangerous. I guess that\u2019s why I\u2019m such a wimp\u2026\u201d</b> You chuckled a bit to yourself, but the nidoqueen only frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cI think you\u2019re braver than you think you are, little one,\u201d</b></span> the nidoqueen said. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cYou know, I was your size once, too. And back then, I never would\u2019ve gone off on my own like you did.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cReally?\u201d</b> Your ears perked up, a little surprised by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing your expression, the nidoqueen giggled. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cCertainly!\u201d</b></span> she smiled, warmly. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cI used to be a tiny little thing; but that never really mattered. Once I learned to venture out of my comfort zone, I grew the confidence I needed to make it on my own. I think you will, too.\u201d</b></span> You think about her words for a while. You, striking out on your own? You couldn\u2019t even imagine it! But the way things are turning out\u2026 you may have to. After about a half hour, you were startled by the sounds of splashing. You looked around, only to realize that dozens of aquatic Pokemon were swimming through the water around you, as if fleeing from something. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cOoh! Don\u2019t be scared, little critters!\u201d</b></span> the nidoqueen giggles. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cI\u2019m not here to hurt you!\u201d</b></span> She lets her guard down, but you don\u2019t for a second. For some reason, you could sense there was something\u2026 sinister about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you hear something loud down the path the Pokemon were fleeing from, as if something huge was slinking through the water. Your heart seizes in your chest as you realize you were being watched, and you poked the nidoqueen in the shoulder. <b>\u201cI\u2026 I d-don\u2019t think you\u2019re the Pokemon they\u2019re running from\u2026\u201d</b> you whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, a humongous figure leaped from the water, lightning fast. A feraligatr! She had to be at least the size of the nidoqueen, if not larger, and just as voluptuous to match. Worse, she looked pissed -- feral, in fact. The two of you had absolutely no time to react before the feraligatr tackled the nidoqueen, sending you flying. You land in the murky, cold swamp water, which blighted out all light, further disorienting you. By the time you manage to surface, the two huge women are in fierce battle, with the feraligatr trying to dunk the nidoqueen\u2019s head beneath the water. Managing to resurface, the nidoqueen looks you in the eyes, and shouts <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cRun!\u201d</b></span> before she\u2019s dunked under once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRun? You couldn\u2019t just leave her! You remembered that conversation you had just a half hour earlier. You just had to be brave\u2026 confident. You had to be strong, like the nidoqueen was. But just as you were about to come up with a plan, the feraligatr glanced at you. It was just a glance, but her expression was more fierce, more powerful, than anything you\u2019d ever witnessed in your life. In that moment, you realized that you were hopelessly out of your league.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho are you kidding? You\u2019re a wimp. A coward. You can\u2019t save anybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swam away as fast as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swam until your lungs burned for fresh air, and your arms screamed for relief. Finally, just as your body was about to give way, you reached the edge of the swamp. You dragged yourself, coughing, onto the shore, pulling yourself up by the vines. Once safely on land, you laid on your back and sobbed. You sobbed for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you were too exhausted to even cry any longer, and you had to put yourself together and think about what you\u2019d gotten yourself into. Already, you were alone again, and it was all your fault. You felt like you had just lost your parents all over again. The nidoqueen\u2026 could she be okay? You felt lost without her, like you couldn\u2019t possibly decide what to do next. Such a big, dangerous world out there, and you knew nothing about it\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you sat down on the shore to cry for a while, a new, sylphlike figure rises slowly from the water...</font></span></div></div>",

Being fully evolved, she was much more \u201cdeveloped\u201d than the ekans you saw yesterday, with a voluptuous humanoid upper body distracting from her long, serpentine tail. You quickly duck into the bushes before the Arbok can spot you, but she smirks just the same. <span class=\"cmagenta\"><b>\u201cI know you\u2019re here, little Riolu\u2026\u201d</b></span> she taunted, as she glanced around the overgrowth. <span class=\"cmagenta\"><b>\u201cI can smell your fear.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n She cackles sadistically, her wet tail gliding along the dirt ground as she prowls around the forest. You shiver as you look into her glowing yellow, serpentine eyes, and see her fangs twisted up in a snarl. <span class=\"cmagenta\"><b>\u201cYou tread on my mistress\u2019s hunting grounds\u2026 and that made her very angry\u2026\u201d</b></span> the arbok woman hissed. You were confused for a moment, before you realized; this arbok must be working with the feraligatr! Great\u2026 this day is going from bad to worse. <span class=\"cmagenta\"><b>\u201cIf you surrender quietly, I promise I won\u2019t hurt you. I mean\u2026 she might, but I won\u2019t\u2026\u201d</b></span> Despite not moving a muscle or making a sound, the arbok is able to sniff out your position with terrifying ease. <span class=\"cmagenta\"><b>\u201cHaha! Come here!\u201d</b></span> she laughs, discovering your hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart pumping in your chest, you try desperately to flee. You don\u2019t even make it a single step, though, before her long tail wrapped around your legs seemingly instantly. You freeze up in fear, not even fighting back as her tail coils around the rest of your body. Your arms are pressed against your side by her tail, and soon only your head is exposed, with the rest of your body being completely immobile, her tail almost crushing your ribs. Crying and squealing in terror, you look up at the massive arbok lady\u2019s gleeful eyes. She knew you were completely powerless compared to her, and she loved it. She opened her terrifying jaws, and ran her tongue playfully up your face, covering your head with slobber as she licked you. Your snout was pressed between her breasts as she held you close, savoring your flavor. <span class=\"cmagenta\"><b>\u201cSuch a tasty treat! My mistress is going to be so proud of me for capturing you\u2026\u201d</b></span> she smiled, beaming with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look up at her, you are reminded of the Ekans from yesterday. How scared you were\u2026 but how brave and angry the Nidoqueen was. This arbok was just as sadistic, dominating smaller Pokemon for her own enjoyment. Maybe this was your opportunity to get your own form of justice. <b>\u201cYou\u2026 don\u2019t happen to know any Ekan in the area\u2026 right?\u201d</b> you ask, sounding innocent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arbok snapped out of her excitement, looking at you with confusion. <span class=\"cmagenta\"><b>\u201cWhat? An Ekans?\u201d</b></span> she said, sounding incredulous. She hesitated, before continuing, <span class=\"cmagenta\"><b>\u201cMy\u2026 sister. How do you know her? What does she have to do with this?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cShe\u2019s\u2026 she\u2019s dead!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at you, jaw hanging open, as if not fully comprehending what you were saying. <span class=\"cmagenta\"><b>\u201c... what?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cNidoqueen\u2026 she ate her! And she\u2019ll eat you too!\u201d</b> you yelled, filled with righteous fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reels back and shakes her head, closing her eyes in shock. <span class=\"cmagenta\"><b>\u201cNo\u2026 y-you\u2019re lying\u2026 that\u2019s not\u2026 that\u2026 bitch!\u201d</b></span> the arbok whips around, back towards the swamp she emerged from, baring her teeth with a snarl. <span class=\"cmagenta\"><b>\u201cI\u2019ll kill her!\u201d</b></span> In her anger, she seemed to forget about you for a moment, which was all you needed. You managed to wriggle an arm free from her coils as she moved, and mustering all your bravery and strength, sunk your claws into the arbok\u2019s back. <span class=\"cmagenta\"><b>\u201cAgh!\u201d</b></span> She screamed, and while she was shocked, you managed to wriggle free from her tail just seconds before the coils clamped down tightly. She whipped around once again, all her surprise and anger now directed towards you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour instincts were screaming at you to flee, but you knew you couldn\u2019t outrun her. Instead, something inside you stirred you to fight. All the sadness, fear, and anger inside you seemed to be created some kind of\u2026 energy. This was your one shot, and like the nidoqueen said, you had to be brave...</font></span></div></div>",

Your parents had trained you pretty extensively on how to use your various attacks, but you\u2019d never actually used them on another Pokemon before. You channeled all the powerlessness you\u2019ve been feeling -- the fear, the guilt, the frustration -- and channel it into a single ball of power. Just as her jaws flew open, ready to devour you, you sent the ball directly into her mouth. <b><span class=\"cmagenta\"><b>\u201cMmf!\u201d</b></span></b> She yelped as the energy exploded right in her face, wounding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she nursed her wounds, you rushed out into the swamp, dashing through the water as fast as you could. <b>\u201cNidoqueen!

She had to be okay; she just had to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cGet back here!\u201d</span></b> You hear the arbok scream in fury, giving chase through the tree canopy. You sprint through leaves and water as fast as you can, trying to prevent the arbok from ever knowing exactly where you are. Even through the deepest parts of the swamp, the adrenaline rushes pushes you faster than you ever thought possible. Eventually, following nidoqueen\u2019s scent, you find her being held in the feraligatr\u2019s arms. You were confused for a second, until you realize that the nidoqueen had been knocked out, and the feraligatr was preparing to devour her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cOh, Arceus...\u201d</b> You gasp, hiding in the bushes just before the gator woman can you spot you. You watch, horrified, as she cradles the unconscious nidoqueen while slowly unhinging her jaw, preparing to swallow her whole. You had to do something! The feraligatr had defeated the nidoqueen was ease, however\u2026 she would probably destroy you in an instant. But you had to at least try! Just as you were about to leap from the bushes, the arbok emerged from the tree canopy, bursting with rage. She seemed to be searching for you, but stopped when she spotted the next best thing; the nidoqueen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\"><b>\u201cHer!\u201d</b></span> The arbok pointed at the unconscious nidoqueen, lunging forward. She didn\u2019t think about the consequences as she tried to grab the feraligatr\u2019s would-be meal -- she could only think that about her dear sister\u2019s fate at the hand of the nidoqueen\u2019s belly. <span class=\"cmagenta\"><b>\u201cGive her to me!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\"><b>\u201cLet go of her, arbok!\u201d</b></span> the feraligatr demanded, trying to prevent the snake from grabbing the nidoqueen away. <span class=\"cteal\"><b>\u201cThis is my meal!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\"><b>\u201cShe killed my sister,\u201d</b></span> the arbok snarled. <span class=\"cmagenta\"><b>\u201cShe\u2019s mine!\u201d</b></span> Due to the slippery swamp water, the snake was able to pry the nidoqueen from the feraligatr\u2019s grasp. She seemed ecstatic at the opportunity to get her revenge, coiling around the nidoqueen; until the feraligatr grabbed her by the throat, pulling her away. The nidoqueen floated limply in the murky swamp water, still unmoving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\"><b>\u201cYou dare disobey me?\u201d</b></span> the feraligatr roared, and smashed the arbok up against the tree, causing her to yelp in pain. The arbok was knocked out of her stupor, and suddenly, a look of terror dawned on her face. You almost felt bad for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cY-you don\u2019t understand\u2026\u201d</span></b> the arbok tried to explain. <b><span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cShe ate my-!\u201d</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feraligatr interrupted the arbok by tightening her grip around her throat. <span class=\"cteal\"><b>\u201cYou care more about your useless sister than you care about your own mistress?\u201d</b></span> the feraligatr growled, with a calm, deliberate sort of anger in her voice. <span class=\"cteal\"><b>\u201cShe\u2019s made you weak. Your weakness has led you to fail to capture a simple Riolu\u2026 and worse, it has led you to disobey me.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\"><b>\u201cM-m-mistress\u2026\u201d</b></span> the arbok managed to squeak, tears forming as she realized just how pissed off her \u2018mistress\u2019 was. <span class=\"cmagenta\"><b>\u201cI\u2019m so sor-MPH!\u201d</b></span> You had to stifle a gasp as the feraligatr interrupted her once again, stuffing the arbok\u2019s face into her mouth. The serpent woman struggled futilely against her as the feraligatr slowly funneled more and more of her body down her throat, swallowing the arbok while she was still conscious and moving. The feraligatr\u2019s jaws spread to terrifying proportions, her long tongue licking over the arbok\u2019s breasts as she worked her way down her torso, feeling her body one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn away in disgust as the arbok is swallowed bit by bit, leaving a huge bulge in the feraligatr\u2019s throat. You sneak silently over the unconscious nidoqueen, trying not to get spotted. <b>\u201cNidoqueen. Nidoqueen, you have wake up\u2026\u201d</b> you whisper, trying to shake her awake as quickly as you could. To your delight, she shifts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201c... riolu?\u201d</b></span> she groans, still-half conscious. At least now you knew she\u2019s alive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWe have to get out of here as fast as we can,\u201d</b> you whisper to her, trying to get her to escape with you before the feraligatr finished with her meal. The nidoqueen still looks drowsy and confused, but there\u2019s a faint glimmer of understanding in her eyes, and she slowly rises to her feet. As you wait for her to get the nidoqueen to get her bearings, you turn back to look at the feraligatr. All of the arbok woman\u2019s upper body was now trapped inside the feraligatr\u2019s huge, bulging stomach, which clearly showed the imprints of the arbok\u2019s handprints as she tried to break free. The only thing left was the arbok\u2019s tail, being slowly slurped into the feraligatr\u2019s jaws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shuddered at the sight, trying to forget what you\u2019ve seen as the nidoqueen takes you in her arms and runs away\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u2500\u2500\u2500</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"clblue\">\u201cYou were very brave back there.\u201d</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stunned. After telling her the whole story, all the horrific things that happened in the swamp, and that was all she had to say. She didn\u2019t seem to know quite what to made of if it herself. She was hugging you closely, leaning against a tree, going over the events again and again in her head. That was the first time she had been defeated in years. That feraligatr was more powerful than anyone she had ever encountered. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 sorry you had to go through all that, little one,\u201d</b></span> she finally continues, after she composed herself. You just hugged the nidoqueen tightly. The adrenaline was wearing off, but you were still shaking and crying uncontrollably. Dazed and disturbed, the two of you comforted each other, both lucky to be alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, she speaks again. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cYou should just\u2026 live with me for a while,\u201d</b></span> she said. You realize you had just lost your only lead on your parent\u2019s location. Now how were you supposed to find them? Has the nidoqueen just given up? <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cI have a den north of here. You\u2019ll be safe there. I will care for you...\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider it. You did want to relax somewhere safe again, but\u2026 for every moment you wait, the less likely you are to ever find your parents again. Even though it seemed too exhausting, you had to keep searching for your parents diligently! You tried to pull yourself away, and stand up\u2026 but you realized you were just too tired to even walk. You can\u2019t keep searching anymore. Maybe it\u2019s time for a break...</font></span></div></div>",

They were patient, kind, almost never got mad at you even when you weren't on your best behavior. Your best memories were of the three of you just lazing around your humble but cozy abode. Always thought of what was best for you in every decision they made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite your unwavering bond between your parents, you were simply too tired, too exhausted, to shaken up to continue to look for them. The fear and adrenaline from before had drained from your small body, leaving you with little to no energy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou loved your parents...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but they will have to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, you were very, very thankful that you had someone to take care of you. You looked up past the curvature of the Nidoqueen's featureless breasts and, hesitantly, relented. \"I don't...I don't want to be a burden. One day...two days, tops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhhhh...\" she gently silenced with you by tightening her hold on you, squishing your head up against her soft, meaty chest. \"Nonsense. You stay as long as you need to. We'll look for your parents again, i promise.\" She planted a tiny kiss on your forehead, making you blush hard. She was so much like your mother. The tone of voice, the way she talks, she even feels like your mom shiny fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, my home's not that far from here.\" And with that, she started the relatively short trek to her den, with you pressed up against her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----Later----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of us feel that we have options for our activities throughout the day, in big ways and in small ways. We have alternative courses of actions available to us, and it\u2019s ultimately up to us which one we take. We are not like monorail trains running along the iron track of fixed destiny that is already laid out for us. We are more like off-road vehicles, capable of making our own paths in life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould you have countined to look for your parents? True, you could, but even a prisoner in a jail cell has this metaphysical form of freedom. He can decide what to think about and how to feel. He can typically move his body as he wants, within the confines of his imprisonment. Your imprisonment is your own body. As the hefty but gentle Nidoqueen carries you to her den, you can't help but feel so...dependent. You had never realized how shelters your life really was until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself dosing off in the warm, soft flesh of the Nidoqueen two gelatinous orbs. His body almost downright refused to move, and her embrace had not lessened one bit. You almost fell asleep when the Nidoqueen abruptly stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here little guy.\" She said sweetly she pulled you away from her breasts and you managed to excert the tiniest bit of energy to face her home. It was a hole in the wall of a cliff face, a cave. But what was interesting about her particular cave was how spacious it was. If the Nidoqueen was just four times your heights, her home was eight time your height. Most caves were just small little punches into the rock. But the Nidoqueen should have one that fits her size, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked in, and your eyes needed to adjust to the sudden loss of light. No loose rocks, no staligmites or stalactites, it was almost if not more cozy then your home. \"Here we are. Home sweet home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point you were on the brink of shut eye. Your eyelids were heavy and you wanted nothing more in the world to sleep. Noticing this, the Nidoqueen smiled maternally and walked silently towards her bed. It was large for you, but almost too small for her, heap of grass piled in the far left corner of the room. She laid down onto it, almost engulfing it's entirely with her generous rear end and back, and leaned on her side as you were sent tumbling (thigh not for a long time) onto the soft grass next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to thank her. Wanted to thank her for rescuing you when you were about to be d course by that Ekans. For agreeing to help look for you parents. For letting you stay with her in her home. You wanted to express your gratitude for so many things. But all you could muster with your depleted voice was:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank...you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nidoqueen smiled, with a glint in her eyes that almost told him that she knew it was for everything you wanted it to be. \"Goodnight, my little angel\". That was the last thing you heard before you fainted of usher exhaustion, in the loving care of the big Nidoqueen.</span></div></div>",

They were dark grey, and distinctly salamander shaped, except they seemed to be twice your height. Her underside boasted a purple pattern that seemed to wrap above her sizable breasts, and go all the way down to her inner thighs. They also bore bright, fiery designs over their breasts and around their leg joints. On either side of their tail, you saw two thin flaps flowing like ribbons around their tail. You have encountered a Salazzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Salazzle looks down on you, bearing a grin that appeared mischievous due to the curvy pattern on her maw. Her eyes also carried a dangerous air around her. Her whole stature and face made you unsure whether you could trust her, or whether you should avoid her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\"><b>\"I don't see your kind around here often,\"</b></span> she said. Now, you decided to step away. However, the Salazzle suddenly scurried forward. To your horror, she seemed to move at speeds you never saw before. In the blink of an eye, she crawled around you, and right behind you. You pivoted, and stumbled back again. You wanted to get away, but the only thing behind you was the swamp. You weren't sure what else was in there, and you don't know if they could possibly be as dangerous as the Pok\u00e9mon in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\"><b>\"Why're you runnin' like that? I'm not gonna hurt you,\"</b></span> she continued. She approached, and you were hesitant to back up. Not because you trusted her or anything, but because you didn't want to go into the bog. The Salazzle wrapped her tail around your back, pulling you up close to her.<span class=\"cpink\"><b>\"Just tell me what you're doing here.\"</b></span> You looked around yourself, terrified. You were too scared to say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some silence, the Salazzle leaned her face down towards you. You heard her suck in some air, and then she exhaled, maw aimed right at your face. You could see a cloud of pink poison coming straight towards you before it enveloped your nose. Upon a single whiff, you started coughing. It smelled fruity, yet felt as thick as smoke. You felt like you were being smothered. You coughed and wheezed, and you swear the miasma was lingering. The more you smelled it, the thinner and thinner it began to feel. After your coughing fit, the miasma began to smell pleasant. You swear you felt sleepier the more you smelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\"><b>\"C'mon l'il guy, I'm just here to help you. Don't you trust me? Tap my nose if you do,\"</b></span> she said. Before you could consider why she'd want you to tap her nose, you felt your body move. Without any input from you, you tapped her nose. <span class=\"cpink\"><b>\"Atta boy. Now, tell me what's wrong.\"</b></span>. You felt dreary. In your sleep state, you began to explain your situation. Everything from the moment your parents didn't come home, to the Feraligatr, to you leaving the nidoqueen behind, to now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\"><b>\"Oh dear! You poor thing!\"</b></span>. In your dreary state, you weren't able to tell what tone of voice she's putting on. You couldn't tell if she was being sincere or not. <span class=\"cpink\"><b>\"You know, now that I think of it, I might've seen a couple of Lucarios around here somewhere. A swamp like this is no place for a little guy like you, not alone. Just hold onto me close, and I'll bring you to them.\"</b></span>. She sort of sounded sincere, but you couldn't tell. You just felt so sleepy. You couldn't even think about what she might do if you go with her. You could barely think about anything that happened to you before. All you know is, this Salazzle said she knows where your parents are, and she's offering you to bring you to them.</font></span></div></div>",

The black appendages in front of your ears rose, sensing a powerful presence. An aura of dread made you feel the smallest you\u2019ve ever been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was a ripple in the brown water beside you. That was all you saw before your nightmare emerged. Surging from the murky depths, the Feraligatr crashed upon the shore. On all fours, she still towered above you. Her head was overhead; her arms were to your sides -- escape was impossible. She looked down at you and opened her mouth...to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cindigo\">\u201cAre you\u2026,\u201d</span> her voice was slow, heavy, and rumbling.

Her yellow eyes bored into you, expecting an answer. They seemed calmer, not as feral; they still maintained a dangerous glint. Her jaws caught your eye. She had rows of teeth. Crooked and sharp, like dozens upon dozens of crooked arrowheads. And yet, her maw was big enough to swallow you whole. A frightening thought, and more than enough motivation for you to try and answer her. But you found your words were too scared to leave your throat. All that arose was a small whimper. You wondered if her prey died of fright before even reaching her jaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Feraligatr snapped her jaws with a fearsome crack, inches from your face. Her patience had thinned. <span class=\"cindigo\">\u201cAnswer me. Or I\u2019ll rip the words from your throat for you.\u201d</span> Countless old scars lined her snout, but a fresh one caught your eye. A crimson line stretched from her lower lip toward her right eye. Curiosity gave you the courage to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDid Nidoqueen give you that scar?\u201d you blurted out. You regretted your words the instant they came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cindigo\">\u201cYes, she did.\u201d</span> Feraligatr said, her voice a rumbling whisper that shook your very bones. <span class=\"cindigo\">\u201cShe gave me this one,\u201d</span> Feraligatr pointed towards the fresh scar with a sharp claw,<span class=\"cindigo\"> \u201cand this one.\u201d</span> She pointed a claw to her heart. <span class=\"cindigo\">\u201cHeartache,\u201d</span> she said. <span class=\"cindigo\">\u201cShe deserves to know what it feels to be hurt there.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were confused. Nidoqueen caring, motherly, and maybe even sacrificed herself for you. Again, curiosity prompted you to ask, \u201cwhy\u201d?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cindigo\">\u201cShe despises predators. Like we have a choice of what we can eat. She thinks we\u2019re lesser, undeserving of sympathy.\u201d</span> Her warm breath enveloped your face and you could feel the bitter resentment that it carried.<span class=\"cindigo\"> \u201cI had a friend. He was a Murkrow,\u201d</span> she said, almost wistfully, <span class=\"cindigo\">\u201che ate Caterpie to live and she thought he was monster for doing so. She ate him, not because she needed to, but because she could.\u201d</span> A deep growl emanated from deep within her throat. <span class=\"cindigo\">\u201cI was young and I couldn\u2019t help him. But now\u2026 Now I am big and she is weak.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You felt a question blaze within you.

Your arms were pinned to your sides. Even with half your body hanging outside of her jaws, your face was pressed to the back of Nidoqueen\u2019s throat. Hot air rushed past you as the walls rumbled and writhed as Nidoqueen protested. You opened your eyes and stared down dark, wriggling tunnel of flesh that was her throat. It desperately tried to expel you, but only succeeded into coating your face with a fresh layer of mucus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cindigo\">\u201cYou will eat him,\u201d</span> Feraligatr\u2019s voice boomed from outside,<span class=\"cindigo\"> \u201cyour friend will join mine.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cteal\">\u201cMmmph!\u201d</span> Nidoqueen protested. She could feel your round head in the back of her throat. She fought every urge to swallow. Inside, you felt Nidoqueen\u2019s tongue stir below you. It moved slightly, rising a bit \u2014 pushing you against the roof of her mouth and ran across your belly, leaving it slick with slime. Nidoqueen\u2019s heart fluttered and a horrid realization came upon her: you tasted good. Really, really good. Better than most anything she had ever tasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You shouted down her esophagus. \u201cHelp! Nidoqueen, don\u2019t swallow!\u201d Feraligatr moved a hand to Nidoqueen\u2019s throat. She ran her hand along her throat, coaxing her to swallow \u2014 and she did but she quickly caught herself. Yet, you were pushed forward. Your body was now entirely within her maw and your whole torso was inside her throat. The walls of her gullet began to lurch, trying to either expel or swallow you. The sticky walls came together, you were in the middle. There was no escape from their crushing embrace. Nidoqueen was most ashamed of the misery it certainly brought you. But not more than the thoughts in her head. You were food, her body was telling her. He tasted like food, he was in her throat \u2014 and so he must be food. And you were good food and she wanted you. With a whimper, she heeded her body\u2019s command to swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The great slab of meat that was her tongue lifted. It pushed the remainder of your body into the fleshed tunnel. You screamed. Nidoqueen felt the most guilty she had ever been. She felt your slow descent through the passage that lead to her belly. Quickly, she gripped her throat, trying in vain to stop your fall. Inside, you did halt. Muscled, powerful walls mashed around your form. You felt the flesh quiver, unable to carry you further. But Nidoqueen found herself unable to breathe with you in her gullet. With a tight chest, you heard Nidoqueen wheeze these words, <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d</span> she said. She released her hold and swallowed for the last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Down, you went. Past her neck, past her collarbone, past her armored chest, and into her stomach. You plopped unceremoniously into a thick yellow soup. You were enclosed within wrinkled walls that lazily churned the stew it housed. You rose to the surface and took a breath. You found, to your relief, that you could breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNidoqueen!\u201d You shouted, but received no answer. It seemed that she couldn\u2019t hear you. Your small voice was absorbed by the fleshy walls \u2014 and drowned by the bodily noises of her inner workings. You backed against a taut pink wall. You look at the mixture within her belly and you wonder if that was the fate of the Ekans from before. And maybe even the Murkrow that was Feraligatr\u2019s friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your world lurched and lurched again. You were battered with stomach juices.

You nodded in understanding, and the two of you held hands as you walked forward. The Patrat kept scanning for any bad guys, and you got more and more concerned as you began to see less and less of the Patrat. However, you were more surprised when the cave started to light up. Perplexed, you look around, and began to see torch-light. The Patrat seemed equally confused. The cave was lined by braziers lit aflame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you began to move further, the cavern floor began to get replaced by wooden floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone isn't living here, are they?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would they? There's a village just a short walk away,\" the Patrat said. You tried to sniff out for any other Pok\u00e9mon, but you were met with a surprising stench. It didn't smell like the scent you followed, but it really stunk. You covered your nose, your face expressing your disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone else's been here,\" you responded, trying to ignore the smell. \"And my nose isn't gonna help us anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?

A few feet forward, you two found yourself at a makeshift door. Wearily, the two of you opened, and saw what appeared to be a living room. There was a couch made from leaves, a knee-high table in front of it, and the floor had some marking on it. It looked like a blocky fist. You two exchanged confused glances before continuing forward. However, a groaning from deeper within reached your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad?\" the Patrat asked. He let go of your hand, and ran deeper inward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" you shouted as you chased after him. \"It's gotta be a trap!\" You ran deeper, and almost tripped down a sudden set of stairs. You ran down as quickly as you could, and found yourself in a brighter room. The ceiling had a large hole in it, letting the sunlight pour in. You could see loads of wooden beams positioned around it, some beams jutting upwards and some connecting two beams. At the floor, you saw wooden dummies, and that blocky fist emblem again, now painted in black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the very far wall, you saw the Patrat running up to two Watchogs, who're chained up to the wall. You ran over to join him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeremy...?\" the male Watchog said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here mom! I'm here dad!\" the Patrat, who you guessed was named Jeremy, shouted as he approached. He hugged up to each of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you get here?\" the female Watchog asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was this guy!\" he said, pointing to you. \"He helped me find you guys!\" You nervously waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who kidnapped you guys?\" you asked as you readied to chop one of the chains. With a quick chop downwards, you snapped one of the chains. The Patrat was still hugging both of them, crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't see them,\" the female said. You got ready to snap another chain, when suddenly- \"Above you!\" You looked up, and saw a figure coming in from above. For the brief moment, all you knew was that they were coming down on top of you. You and the Patrat leapt back, just in time to avoid the strike. Now that you narrowly avoided the surprise attack, you were able to see who the attacker was. They appeared to be...</span></div></div>",

She stood twice as tall as you, had purple and white fur, the purple fur wrapping around her legs, midsection, the tip of her tail, above her eyes, and the top of her head. Stranger of all were the long, sleeve-like appendages growing above her claws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Mienshao!\" the Patrat shouted out. You've never seen any Mienshaos, so you had to take the Pok\u00e9mon's word. You held out your hands threateningly towards the Pok\u00e9mon. Now, you were able to notice her wide hips, thick thighs, and C-cup breasts. The Patrat looked at you, and tried to copy your stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How nice of you to come to me,\" she said while looking upon the Patrat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Why is that so good?\" you asked, still trying to look tough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't just offer up a couple of parents to our goddess,\" the Mienshao said, slinking towards the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Offer up?\" the Patrat repeated confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, did you not know?\" the Mienshao said in a patronizing tone. \"Our great goddess grows hungry. And if she isn't satiated, she'll once again sweep through the land and devour anyone she's in the mood for eating. It just so happens that she's in the mood for a family of Patrats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...you're lying!\" the Patrat shouted out. \"You just want to take me and my parents for yourself!\" After that, the Mienshao simply shrugged. Then, in the blink of an eye, she zipped around the two, suddenly appearing in front of the staircase the duo walked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n:\"Well, true or not, you can't do anything about it, can you?\" she said. \"Not now that you're in the middle of my territory.\" She then turned towards you. \"And as for you, you don't need to be here. Just put down your fists, and head on out of here. And I promise you won't get hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" you shouted out. You weren't going to let this gal get away with this. Besides, she was probably plotting some sort of attack for if you ran off. The Mienshao clicked her tongue disapprovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'No'? Ah well, I guess I'm feeding three different Pok\u00e9mon to our goddess,\" the Mienshao sighed out. \"Look, just lie down and let me wail on you. I don't really feel like giving my A-game right now.\" You scowled at her and got ready to attack, but the Mienshao zipped away. like a blur, just above the two of you. She was about to slam her foot down on you both, but you each sidestepped just in time. In the spit second she touched down, you both ran towards her, you poised to punch and the Patrat poised to bite. You both came close, but, unfortunately, that'd be to the Mienshao's benefit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the sound of a raspberry, she was surrounded by a thick cloud of gas just before you each struck. Instead of striking the Pok\u00e9mon, your fist and the Patrat's jaws struck thin air. She had disappeared! But that wasn't what you worried about here. A quick whiff suddenly set your nostrils aflame. It smelled like the stench you smelled back in the cave, only much closer and much thicker. You coughed, covered your nose, and fanned the air away, the Patrat following suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BLEH!\" the Patrat whined. \"Who'd use a move like that!?\" Both of your eyes were watering from the horrid stench, and you seen each ran away from the source of the stench, ready to breath up any fresh air. However, a familiar raspberry noise got your attention. You turned towards the source, and saw a cloud of that gas spreading away from the Mienshao, who was ready to strike...</span></div></div>",

You turned your head upwards, peeking through her cleavage and upon her face. However, while you were confused, the Mienshao brought her arms down, her protrusions, wrapping around your abdomen. You yelped out as you were whipped around, then brought to her backside, which came down on you. Next thing you knew, your face was stuck between her cheeks, and your shoulders were holding her up like you were some sort of chair. You felt your legs shake as you struggled to stand, having a hard time keeping the Pok\u00e9mon from completely squashing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to regret coming here,\" she said. Then, next thing you knew, your ears were filled with the sound of a raspberry as an egg-y blast swamped over you. You coughed and felt your strength wane, disgust filling you as it dawned on you what she just did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get away from him!\" you heard the Patrat say. However, the Mienshao didn't seem to care. She brought up a leg and crossed it over her knee, putting more weight on your weakening body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Care about him that much, eh?\" she said, crossing her arms. \"Well, here's the thing: I need to be quick here. I need a family of Pokemon for our goddess, so I could either take this riolu here, find his family, and then sacrifice them for the good of the world. Or... if you wish to protect him, you should surrender. Lie down, let me take you and your parents away, and I'll let this riolu go.\" For emphasis, she rubbed side to side on your face. You felt sweat pour down your face like waterfalls, but you couldn't tell which was the primary cause: the strain you're being put through, the heat between her cheeks, or the nervousness of the decision. You just met this guy, would you have left enough of an impact for him to want to save you? And even if he did save you, she's just going to take him and his family!

Nor could you see him nervously glance between the Mienshao sitting on you and his trapped family. Nor could you see his head drop down in despair as he made his choice. You could hear him turn and walk, taking soft steps forwards. Then, you heard those other two Pok\u00e9mon get freed, and heard them quickly pick up that Patrat and run. As they carried him away, none of them could see the despair on your face as you realized you were alone with this smelly Mienshao.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A shame,\" she said. \"A shame you had to learn this lesson today, but you need to learn to not be so dependent, boy. Maybe you'll realize that sooner in the next life...\" She spread her cheeks a little more, wiggling side and side to pull your saddened face deeper into her rump, you now too pathetic to fight back against her. She had you deep in, and you heard a familiar grumble overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the first blast of gas farted forth into you, and the horrid smell was already too much for you. Almost instantly, your vision became hazy. And almost immediately after that, your world went black...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, you woke up, and were greeted with a foul smell. As your vision returned to you, you came to realize there was nobody on top of you, despite the smell. You stood up, covering your nose, and looked around. You seemed to be in some wooden room with blue padding around, like wrestling mats. You could also see a bed in the corner of the room. At one end is a giant wall of wooden bars, crafted like prison bars, with a single door on the far right side of that wall. Opposite that is a sheer wall with a single window. Looking through it, you saw down below were some cement streets, a few Pok\u00e9mon walking around with some cloth covering their mouths and noses. Likely a result of the thick, purple, fog-like miasma around what looked like an entire town. It seemed like a usual Pok\u00e9mon town, wooden/stone houses, some being 3 stories high (like the one you're in), only there were very few Pok\u00e9mon out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only was the drop treacherous, but a few more wooden bars in the window ensured you couldn't pass through. You looked down sadly, feeling trapped. You still felt the horrible smell outside leak into your room. You had no idea what was going on out here. But you figured this was that Mienshao's doing. You needed to get out, fast-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could try and flee, though, the Mienshao appeared on the other side of that barred wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You smell that?\" she asked. \"That horrid stench? If untreated, it'll grow worse than the likes of me. Our village's plagued by a Pokemon thought to only exist in legends, a being that's cursed this town to suffer smells that carry death itself into our many villagers. As it grows more and more, we all are threatened to be snuffed out by it. To dissipate it, however, the Pokemon of Legend requires a meal, a family of Pokemon. Unfortunately, the land around our village has been growing more and more scarce, which is why we had to seek out the likes of that Patrat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, you got involved, and now we have even less time to stop this curse.\" The Mienshao glared down at you, as if accusing you of sentencing her kind to an early grave. \"So, if we're going to save this place, I need you to help me. Where are your parents?\" You still didn't know the answer to that! But, you figured telling her that wouldn't help you right now. Maybe if you lied you might get a chance to get away from here? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You had\u2026 never seen this much water in one place before. At once point, long ago, your parents brought you to a small little pond a few miles from the tree, and even that blew your mind. But this\u2026 this was beyond anything you thought possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet\u2019s put this into perspective. You\u2019ve lived in a forest your entirely life. With all trees and thick plant growth, especially with you being so close to the ground, the average visibility was, like, what? A couple dozen meters? You had never even seen the horizon before. But now, standing on a hill overlooking the sea, the big, beautiful, bright expanse of blue stretched out as far as the eye could see. The horizon blended with the sky so you couldn\u2019t tell where one ended and the other began; from your perspective, the ocean seemed to stretch on forever and ever. You were struck by an incredible feeling of smallness, just looking at something so infinitesimally large. As you were standing there in awe, the patrat immediately rushed towards the water. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cOh, cool!\u201d</b></span> He smiled, his problems apparently leaving him for a moment. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cI didn\u2019t know we had a beach here!\u201d</b></span> You realized he was referring to the long stretch of sand beneath his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhoa! Wait!\u201d</b> You yell as you reached a hand out, seeing him approach the terrifying expanse of sea. <b>\u201cI-I don\u2019t think we should go near that!\u201d</b> Before you could even finish what you were saying, the patrat leaped headfirst into the warm, salty waters. You stared in suspense for a moment, before his head peeked out of the water with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cPffft! Don\u2019t be such a baby! The water\u2019s fine!\u201d</b></span> He said, splashing around. With an anxious sigh, you trotted down the beach, feeling the soft sand beneath your feet. You could\u2019ve sworn that his parents had been somewhere around here, but the smell of the ocean was so overpowering, you had completely lost your scent. You had to come up with another plan. You glanced up and down the beach, looking for pawprints in the sand, wondering if they might\u2019ve travelled along the coast for some reason. A few minutes into your investigation, you hear the patrat scream. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cAaahhh!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour blood runs cold immediately. <b>\u201cW-what? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</b> You say, turning back to the Patrat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed to be okay, but frightened, splashing around in fear while he tries to spot something below him. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cS-something just brushed by my foot!\u201d</b></span> He yelled, nervously. Indeed, you could see disturbances in the ocean all around him, like something was swimming just below.

It all happened too fast -- the figure burst at incredible speeds from the murky blue water, its thick, curvy form towering over the much smaller Pokemon. You had trouble making out exactly what you were seeing at first; you had never seen anything quite like it! It seemed to be a mammal of some sort, covered in slick orange fur, but with strange aquatic features like the fin-like ridge atop its head and along its arms. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cBoo!!\u201d</b></span> It yells in distinctly feminine voice, waving her arms around as she jumped up to startle the patrat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cEee!\u201d</b></span> The patrat squeals loudly in surprise, freezing up as the stranger loomed over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cKehehaha! Oh, Arceus! The look on your face!\u201d</b></span> The strange Pokemon laughs, pointing at the humiliated patrat. She teases him with a good, up-close view of her maw. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cBetter be careful out in the ocean next time, lil\u2019 cutie, or some big old monster might gobble you up!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea what was she was\u2026 but your parents had warned you about predators that have to subsist off other Pokemon. You can\u2019t just stand by and let the patrat get eaten! You had barely any training, but still, you were able to harness all the rage and fear inside to generate rays of energy in your hand, reading your Hidden Power. <b>\u201cHey! Leave him alone!\u201d</b> You yelled, running towards the water, ready to unleash your attack at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn\u2019t noticed you before, apparently, and on seeing you she immediately backed away from the patrat, raising her hands in the air. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cHey! Hey! Whoa! Calm down!\u201d</b></span> She immediately insisted, not wanting to get into a fight. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cI\u2019m just messin\u2019 around!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were both confused and mildly enraged when she insisted she was doing nothing wrong. You saw it with your own eyes; she had been planning on eating that patrat! <b>\u201cY-you\u2019re lying!\u201d</b> You say, feeling a tear involuntarily drip down your cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cPlenty of landlubbers like you come down to the beach every day to hang out, and they have a great time! Ask anyone! I wouldn\u2019t harm a fly!\u201d</b></span> She frowns. You couldn\u2019t control all this energy much longer; you either had to unleash it, or just let it fizzle out. You weren\u2019t sure whether or not you could trust the Floatzel, but she seemed to be genuine enough, so you decide to just let your Hidden Power fade away. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cThere you go. See? There\u2019s no need for violence, here.\u201d</b></span> She nods approvingly, as she gently leads the patrat back to the beach, slowly emerging from the water as she walked up the shore. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I scared you too much.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were awed by her body as she stepped, bit by bit, out of the concealing waters of the ocean. She was about a head taller than even your parents were, and much more plump, too. Her fur was short and slicked down against her skin by the water, showing off her curves in all their glory. The weasel-like Pokemon\u2019s thighs were hypnotizingly thick, and her belly was similarly rounded, obviously big enough that she would be able to fit the both of you inside with ease, if she so chose. <b>\u201cWhat\u2026 what are you?\u201d</b> You ask, both impressed and intimidated by her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cHm? You haven\u2019t seen a floatzel before?\u201d</b></span> She chuckled, doing a little twirl, showing off every inch of her curvaceous body. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cNo big deal. After all, floatzels are only one of the finest Pokemon to ever grace the sea!\u201d</b></span> She laughed as she finally stepped up onto the sand, stunning both of you with her sheer size. She smiled, crossing her arms as the two of you stood in her shadow, gazing up at her. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cSo. What brings you boys to my little beach? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen you around before.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were about to respond, you were stunned by the sight of a tiny bulge appearing in the Floatzel\u2019s round belly for just a moment. It was so brief, you hardly even noticed it; but staring at her stomach with closer detail, you could tell there was definitely something alive in there, beneath all that thick fur. <b>\u201cWhat\u2019s\u2026 in there\u2026?\u201d</b> You breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cOh? In here? Just a few magikarp I had a while ago. Nothin\u2019 to worry about,\u201d</b></span> she smiled, patting her big, furry belly with a contented smile, only to frown when she saw the look on your faces. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cSeriously. I\u2019m not going to hurt you two. These are just some dumb fish.\u201d</b></span> She tried to reach a hand out reassuringly, but you flinch away, shaking as you stared at the floatzel\u2019s bulging stomach. If she could fit swallow all those magikarp with ease, who's to say you couldn\u2019t be next? Hell, who\u2019s to say those are really magikarp in there? Maybe she just swallowed the previous Pokemon that came visiting this beach. She sighed, seeing the look on your face. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cOkay, little dudes. If you\u2019re so nervous around me, you can just leave, whenever you want. I won\u2019t stop you.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were just about to take her up on her offer and flee, but before you can, the patrat finally says something. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cActually\u2026 we need some help,\u201d</b></span> he says, and you shiver as he bravely approaches the huge stranger. Apparently, his desire to find his family overcame his sense of self-preservation. Curious, the floatzel leans over to face him eye-to-eye. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cI\u2019m trying to find my parents, and-\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cTwo watchogs, I\u2019m assuming?\u201d</b></span> The floatzel smiles. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cYeah, they come visit the beach all the time.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe patrat\u2019s eye lit up at the information. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cReally? When\u2019s the last time you saw them?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cVery, very early this morning. Said today was their anniversary or something,\u201d</b></span> she said, looking off into the distance down the beach. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cThey hung around for awhile, then walked off down the beach. It was sort of weird. Want me to show you where they went?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cSure!\u201d</b></span> The patrat was almost jumping with joy as he blithely followed the floatzel down the beach. You stood there, wondering if he was some kind of an idiot, until he finally looked over his shoulder and waved at you, a big smile on his face. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cC\u2019mon, riolu!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned. You knew you couldn\u2019t just let him wander off and get eaten, so you pretended to follow along with him. <b>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</b> You whispered to him as you walked. <b>\u201cWe can\u2019t trust her!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cWell, nobody else in my village was any help at all,\u201d</b></span> he shrugs. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cWhat else are we supposed to do?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cShe\u2019s a stranger!

She smirks over her shoulder, tapping the side of her head where her ears must be. Apparently, the floatzel was more observant than she seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cPardon my pal here. He\u2019s a little paranoid,\u201d</b></span> the patrat chuckled, patting you on the shoulder. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cSo, my parents.

What do they come down to the beach for, then?\u201d</b></span> Patrat tilted his head curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floatzel seemed a little uncomfortable with this line of questioning. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cWell, uh\u2026 sometimes, they just want to... <i>relax</i> together, somewhere\u2026 <i>private</i>,\u201d</b></span> she said, obviously trying to obfuscate her meaning, though you notice her involuntarily glancing at her belly for a moment. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cAnd I give them a cozy place to snuggle in for an hour or two.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cCool!\u201d</b></span> The patrat nodded, obviously not understanding anything the floatzel had said at all. You weren\u2019t entirely sure you understood it, either. While you pondered her response, the three of you finally came upon something of interest.</span></div></div>",

After all you heard about stranger Pok\u00e9mon, you had no idea what could've crept up on you. The figure seemed to almost blend into the water, but you could make out its shape. It had a definite hourglass figure, with hips and shoulder span that outstretched your whole body width, and a rack that'd probably TKO you in under a minute. You couldn't see from this angle, but the Pok\u00e9mon definitely had a bubble butt that could probably bury over half of you. Beyond that, she had a dolphin-like tail, fins around its face, and a white ruff around its neck. You encountered a Vaporeon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"Hey there, little guys,\"</span> she said. The tone of her voice even terrified you, she sounded like she her voice was trying to pull you closer to her. You were tempted to cover your eyes out of embarrassment, but you knew keeping your eyes off of her could spell disaster for you. She rose up higher, and you felt really small again. Her belly was poking out of the water, and she was still a head above you. You couldn't even imagine how big the rest of her was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"What brings you here? Feel like swimming? Catchin' some sun? Lookin' for <i>someone?</i>\"</span> You audibly gulped as she spoke. As she spoke, she got closer, getting higher and higher out of the water. Soon, she began to stand at over twice your height. On top of that, the sun seemed to sparkle off of the water sticking to her skin. <span class=\"clblue\">\"Depending on what you're after, I could help you~</span>\" You and the patrat were terrified. You both knew you may be unable to find his parents at this rate, but this Vaporeon didn't seem like she'd really help.</span></div></div>",

This vaporeon is up to no good. <b>\"Patrat! Run!\"</b> You yelled, feeling helpless from the shore. Hearing how frantic your voice was, the patrat starts swimming towards the peach with all his might, the vaporeon just standing there knee-deep in the water, watching him go. But as he was swimming, the water seemed to start moving in very\u2026 strange ways. Just as he was about to make it, the water started to stream and bubble, as if it was pulling away from the shore all in a line. He was caught in a riptide!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cI\u2026 can\u2019t!\u201d</b></span> He said, sputtering and coughing as he tried to keep himself afloat, the riptide pushing him into deeper and deeper waters. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cThe tide\u2026 it\u2019s pushing me away!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the vaporeon frowns, crossing her arms while she watches the pathetic display. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\"You're trying to just... run away? Well, that really just hurts my feelings,\"</b></span> she says in a slightly mocking voice, feigning sadness. In a moment, she put on hand up against her head, as if she was about to faint. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\"In fact, I think I can almost feel myself... fading away...\"</b></span> Your eyes had trouble comprehending what happened next. Within moments, the vaporeon\u2019s solid form seemed to just\u2026 fade away as her body turned to water, as if she was simply melting into the ocean. Just as this process had begun, a wave crashed into her, obscuring her form beneath the grinding sea\u2026 and just like that, she had disappeared, just as quickly as she had came. You were awe-struck. Had the vaporeon really just melted into water? Or had she just\u2026 transformed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cWhere did she go!?\u201d</b></span> The patrat said, too busy splashing around in the riptide to notice what had happened. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cIs\u2026 is she gone?\u201d</b></span> You were just about to tell him that the coast was clear, when a blob of water started rising up around him, as if it was alive. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cAaahhh!\u201d</b></span> was all he able to scream out as the water covered him, as if he was sealed in a bubble. You watch in horror as the vaporeon transforms back into her solid form all around him, obscuring his form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>\"Mmm... that's better!\"</b></span> She said, standing up and stretching with a smile. She was facing the other way, so you couldn\u2019t see the patrat\u2019s fate, but you feared the worse. Had he been crushed? Erased from existence? Turned into water himself? It was only when the woman finally turned to face you that you realized what she had done. Her belly, already significantly round compared to her sylphlike figure, was now about the size of a beach ball, and was distended to the point that the patrat\u2019s paws made bulges against the furry surface. You watched in disgust and horror as she rubbed contentedly all over her belly with both hands, licking her chops with a satisfied smile. Eventually, she looks up at you. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\"What\u2019s wrong, sweetums? Didn\u2019t you say you were going to run?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact that you were shaking uncontrollably, you tried to analyze the situation as best you could. It seems the vaporeon could transform into liquid, and position herself in such a way that the patrat would be trapped in her stomach when she reverted back to her solid form. Your parents always told you wild Pokemon like to eat smaller Pokemon, but being an anthro, her mouth didn\u2019t seem like it would stretchy enough to just swallow you outright. This must be her only way of devouring her \u2018prey\u2019. Thus, if you weren\u2019t in the water, she probably couldn\u2019t eat you. <b>\u201cN-not until you let him out!\u201d</b> You yell, trying to hide your fear. You were ready to bolt at any second, in case your theory proved one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>\"Sorry, kid, but your friend\u2019s a little busy right now,\u201d</b></span> she giggled. Believing that you\u2019re safe, you stand your ground as she draws closer to you, until she can show off her huge belly right in your face. You shuddered as you saw the patrat\u2019s outline through her furry belly as he struggles futiley inside. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard? Whenever a cute, tiny Pokemon strays onto my territory, they never leave...\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYou can\u2019t just eat Pokemon!\u201d</b> You insist. <b>\u201cI-it\u2019s not right!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>\"My, you\u2019re sheltered, aren\u2019t you? This is just natural selection, sweetheart,\u201d</b></span> she cackles, licking her lips and crossing her arms again, pushing up her impressive bust. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cDespite not being the best swimmer, he dwelled alone into the ocean -- on a predator\u2019s turf, no less!\u201d</b></span> You look bravely up at her as she towers over you. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cAt least, when he becomes part of my big, powerful body, he\u2019ll be helping a more capable Pokemon survive\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cJ-just\u2026 let him out\u2026\u201d</b> You beg desperately, running out of ideas. <b>\u201cEat something else\u2026\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>\"Like what? I\u2019m a predator. It\u2019s not pretty, but this is what I have to do,\u201d</b></span> she shrugs. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cIf I let him out, I\u2019ll go hungry for\u2026 who knows how long.

At this point, you were holding down tears. <b>\u201cI can find some way to make it up to you.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cOnly way a little shrimp like you could help me is by jumping right down here,\u201d</b></span> she laughed, leaning forward and showing off her dark, cave-like throat. Her maw drooled a few drops of saliva onto your face, and you were struck by the smell of her meaty breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your composure breaking down as you stared down her throat. You couldn\u2019t think up another argument no matter how hard you tried. Really, she was right. <b>\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t\u2026 I just\u2026\u201d</b> You say, feeling sad and helpless\u2026 and just like that, you were starting to cry. Before you knew it, you were sobbing openly, mourning the fate of the poor patrat even though you hardly knew him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowns, standing up. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cAw, jeez, kid. Don\u2019t cry. Ugh\u2026 you\u2019re pulling on my heart strings, here\u2026\u201d</b></span> She looks around uncomfortably. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cAlright, tell you what. I\u2019ll give you a deal. I can see you really care about your friend, so I\u2019m willing to negotiate.\u201d </b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reassured you with a hand on your shoulder, giving you some time to calm down and compose yourself. As you wiped away the tears, she continued. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cIf you agree to be my temporary servant, and do EVERYTHING I say until sunset, I swear I\u2019ll let both of you walk away unharmed.\u201d</b></span> She recites her offer. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cBut if you fail to live up to my expectations, you have to promise you\u2019ll crawl right down my throat yourself, and let my belly churn both of you down.\u201d</b></span> She drew her attention to her big, furry belly once again. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cThat\u2019s my best offer. Deal?\u201d</b></span> This seemed like your only chance to save the poor patrat, but\u2026 were you really willing to put your life on the table for a stranger? You shudder as you watch her belly bulge and jiggle as it churned wildly on her \u2018meal\u2019. You couldn\u2019t imagine how dark, tight, and scary it must be inside. Then again\u2026 this seemed like the right thing to do. What would your parents think if you just left him to become vaporeon fat? You agonized over your decision...</span></div></div>",

The vaporeon seemed take aback at your statement as her eyes suddenly widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>\"Are you sure?\"</b></span> she asked. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\"I mean, you do know what'll happen if you don't follow my instructions to the letter, right?

You nodded with determination, but the vaporeon still seemed cautious. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\"Well, if you really accept...\"</b></span> She then held out a hand, holding it in front of you. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\"...then why don't you kiss my hand.\"</b></span> Already, you felt sick. You didn't want to, but you knew what'd happen if you denied you. You came close, and, with little pause, pecked her hand. You tasted the remnants of the saltwater on her skin, but you didn't react that much. With that, the vaporeon's expression switched from shock to glee, as the corners of her mouth lifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>\"Oh you're serious!\"</b></span> she cooed out. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\"Now, get in the water...\"</b></span> You sighed. You hoped she wasn't setting you up to eat you, and knew if you disobeyed her, then you'd get eaten anyway. You leapt into the water, and the vaporeon seemed to melt again. She dove into the water, and came up underneath you. You suddenly felt yourself riding on her slippery back, and you struggled to stay on when she suddenly swam forward. Even if you despised her, you had to admire the speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, you found yourself heading into a cave in the side of the mountain. The ocean spilled into it, and seamed to be steaming. When the vaporeon swam in, you felt like you were in a soothing sauna. Beyond the initially steaming pool, you saw caverns leading deeper in. You could hear some noises beyond them. You wished you were able to actually enjoy this place instead of worry about what the vaporeon had in store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>\"Like it?

Obediently, you trot over to one of the subterranean rivers, staring down into the clear green water. It was actually a lot deeper than you expected, and the wishiwashi all seemed to be about 15 feet down. <b>\u201cHow am I supposed to, y\u2019know, catch them? I can\u2019t breathe underwater, you know.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cI dunno. Be creative,\u201d</b></span> she waved a hand in the air, dismissively. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cJust figure it out within the next half hour or so, or else I might get hungry.\u201d</b></span> You nervously dipped your toe in the water. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cWell? Get moving.\u201d</b></span> You growl in frustration, but still begrudgingly dive headfirst into the underwater lake. The waters were a lot warmer than you expected -- it was actually sort of pleasant. Your ears pop painfully as you descend down to near the bottom, holding your eyes open as you look through the clear water for wishiwashi. They were all over the place, but unfortunately, you were out of your element, and they were able to swim away much faster than you were able to catch them. Eventually, you were forced to come up, gasping for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou repeated this process for about fifteen minutes straight, diving down again and again, only for your targets to slip right out of your hands. By your twentieth dive, your lungs were burning from all the oxygen deprivation, and you had a severe headache from the pressure. With a start, you noticed that over half of your time had run out. You definitely had to come up with a new tactic. <b>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t happen to have anything I could use as bait, would you?\u201d</b> You called over to the lazy vaporeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned, her nap interrupted, but responded anyway. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cThere are some berries growing over there, if you really need them,\u201d</b></span> she points further deeper into the cave, and surely enough, there were some custap berries just growing naturally there on a bit of soil. You pluck one eagerly, and rush back towards the lake. With your claws, you quickly tear the berry to tiny pieces, using the berry juice to attract the wishiwashi to the surface of the water. You waited for a moment, watching a school of the fish swim up to feast on the berry fragments\u2026 before suddenly reaching it, grabbing as many as you could!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumbled back to the vaporeon, completely soaked, dripping water onto the cavern\u2019s floor as you struggle to carry a dozen of the squirming fish back to the vaporeon. She smirks when she sees you coming. <b>\u201cAlright, here you go,\u201d</b> you said, holding the wriggling fish out for her. You shiver in the cold as you wait for her to take them, but she doesn\u2019t seem to want to move a muscle. <b>\u201c... are you going to take them? I caught these for you.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave you a sly smile. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cWell, you\u2019re my servant, aren\u2019t you? Shouldn\u2019t you be feeding them to me?\u201d</b></span> She teases, and you have to resist the urge to roll your eyes. Lacking the energy to argue, you just drop the fish in a pile on the floor, and climb up onto the stone bed beside the vaporeon. You sit on your knees beside her, resisting the temptation to even glance at her sizeable bust, as she closes her eyes and slides open her mouth. You reluctantly hold the fish over her waiting maw, before letting it drop. You watch as she toys with the squirming fish with her tongue, before finally closing her maw and swallowing, a sizeable bulge moving down her throat before disappearing. She smiles, patting her belly, only to see you still sitting there, staring wide-eyed. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cWhat are you waiting for? Next!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue feeding her the rest of the fish in much the same fashion, watching in awe as they all disappear down her throat, one by one. She quickly noticed you staring, and started to make a point of giving you a good view of her mouth as they disappeared down her throat. Before you knew it, you were down to the last fish, and when you brought it over her mouth, you hesitated for some reason. Apparently, the woman decides you\u2019re taking too long, and leans up. You shudder as she wraps her lips around your fingers, and seeing the look on your face, she teased you by licking over the fish in her maw for a while, sending her tongue over your fingers. Eventually, you can feel the vaporeon\u2019s throat grasping the fish and pulling it from your grasp, as it too descends down her throat. A strand of saliva follows your fingers when you finally withdraw them from her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cMm! That really hit the spot!\u201d</b></span> She says, rubbing her stomach with her hands. You look over to her belly, noticing it was almost twice as big now; larger than you were tall! You watch with fascination as she rubs her hands all over the furry orb, feeling the bulges as the fish wriggle around inside along with the patrat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now had <b>five and a half hours</b> before your side of the deal was through. You wonder what she\u2019d decide to have you do next...</span></div></div>",

She tried to lounge out, but she felt an incredible soreness between her shoulder blades. With that pain, he then decided that a simple feeding wasn't enough for her after a day in the water. She rolled over onto her belly, resting her head on the backs of her hands. She sighed out as she got into position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>\"A day of swimming and feeding does horrible things to my back,\"</b></span> she said, gently rocking her back to and fro. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>\"Since you've chosen to do my every will, could you, perhaps, tend to that soreness?</b></span> She sounded like she was taunting him, especially when she said \"chosen.\" You wanted to hit her for that, and even protest touching her, but the bulging of her belly reminded you what you were doing this for. You sighed out, and tried to straddle her back. You didn't know why, but getting so close to her made you feel funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>\"I won't accept anything less than 15 minutes.

You rubbed back and forth, gently kneading her shoulders, her sighing out in content. <br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>\"Don't forget the rest of the back.\"</b></span> With that, you lowered your hands to her shoulder blades, and began rubbing and stroking. She moaned out as you did so, which made you feel even weirder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went lower, and began to knead her latissimus dorsi. You couldn't help but notice how powerful her muscles felt as you kneaded into them. Her moans continued to make you feel weird. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\"Get those sides, too.\"</b></span> Under her orders, you spread your arms out and began to rub along her ribs. As your fingers rubbed up against her bulging belly, and you felt the squirming underneath her flesh. That sensation was singularly horrifying and fascinating. It was just a reminder of what your doing this for, right? It can't be fascinating, it's horrible, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vaporeon's grin seemed to widen, though you weren't sure whether this was from your massaging or if she realized something was going on with your head. She began to think, swimmers like her used their legs more often when swimming, right?</span></div></div>",

You realize she expected you to just pleasure yourself with her body. You knew it was wrong, but your body seemed to be moving of its own accord, and you can\u2019t resist slowly sliding your shaft up and down that warm, comfy passage between her cheeks. Despite all your shame and humiliation, you couldn\u2019t help but admit that this was the best thing you\u2019d ever felt. You had to keep reminding yourself to breathe as you squeezed her cheeks around your shaft, thrusting your hips back and forth with increasing vigor. You could hear the vaporeon giggling intermittently, but she mostly remained still, letting you have your fun undisturbed. Your entire body felt warm and tingly, and your hands were shaking so hard, it was difficult to keep your grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll your inhibitions slowly melted away as your mind was dulled by pleasure. Your humiliation faded away to a dull voice in the back of your mind, as you practically fell in love with the vaporeon\u2019s huge, soft rear. You couldn\u2019t think about anything else. You never wanted this feeling to go away. You start squeaking and whimpering at the sensation as you start pumping faster and faster, your member paling in size compared to the two huge, soft cheeks pressed around it. You were starting to smear her fur with your pre, making the passage even easier to hump at. Eventually, after only five minutes, you were finally thrusting away at maximum speed, your balls smacking against her taint as you pump your shaft up and down her crack with as much speed as you can muster. You could barely breathe at this point; it felt like your heart had stopped in your chest. All you could think about was release\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moaned loudly as ecstasy finally reached you. You tensed up for a moment, squeezing her cheeks around your shaft as they soaked up the prodigious streams of cum you were shooting, but eventually you fell limp, collapsing onto her back like a bad as your climax sapped you of all your energy. Your manhood still laid comfortably between her cheeks, still dripping a few more drops. It didn\u2019t take long for the vaporeon to realize what had happened. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cOh, come on! I said tell me when you\u2019re about to finish,\u201d</b></span> she said, and you squealed when she practically kicked you off the table. She stood up herself, spreading her cheeks with her hands, looking over her shoulder as she roughly assessed the damage. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cUgh, you really made a mess\u2026 did I not tell you what would happen if you displeased me?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay there on the other side of the room, still recovering from your mind-numbing orgasm, only to be surprised when the vaporeon takes you up in her arms. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cI really should just gobble you up on the spot,\u201d</b></span> she said, licking her lips while she held you out in front of her. You shivered with fear and embarrassment, as your shaft was still poking fully from your sheathe. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cThen again, I wouldn\u2019t want to give up my servant so quickly\u2026\u201d</b></span> She rubs her chin contemplatively, before snapping her fingers as an idea strikes her. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cMaybe you can make it up to me?\u201d</b></span> She carries you around the cave, nuzzling you against her breasts as she walks. At this point, you can\u2019t even bring yourself to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, that \u2018massage\u2019 took about half an hour. You had about <b>five hours</b> before you were free.

A gentle light shone in from a crack up above, gently lighting the glistening walls. The waterfall poured down a divot in the floor, which led to a crack leading outside the wall.

Soon, she stood under the waterfall, her fur instantly getting slicked down by the stream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down, and patted the ground next to her, which held a bar of soap.

It'd be like if she didn't have fur and wore skin-tight latex. You had to wash that eagerness away! Keep cleaning... keep cleaning... You felt your body shake as you reached up to her chest.

With that, the secret parts of her were all exposed to you. You felt your cheeks burn brighter as you revealed her tailhole, and her netherlips, along with the prodigious amount of cum you were responsible for. As you looked down at it, you felt yourself unsheathe again, your red rocket on display, nobody looking at you thankfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, the more you looked at it, the more aware of your arousal you became. For the longest time, you felt like looking at it, your breathing becoming thick and labored as you kept watching her rump... though you shook your head and took the soap. You... you... you carefully reached between her cheeks and rubbed, carefully scrubbing out the gunk you left inside. As you did, you felt a chill run up your spine when your fingers brushed her tailhole and her pussy, each eliciting either a giggle or a yelp from her.

What they sold their items for, you had no idea, but they had some items out front like some sort of display. There also appeared to be just as few Pok\u00e9mon in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked, following the smell, another smell entered your nostrils. It smelled like a strong perfume, which smelled so sweet, it was almost sickening. Whatever that smell was, you'd never be able to track down your parents like this! You followed the smell for a little bit, and noticed the source. It was a pink, bird-like Pok\u00e9mon with a collection of feathers around her hips like a great big dress. A single, magenta-colored leg peeked through the \"dress,\" it fitted into a high heel shoe. It looked to be an aromatisse. She seemed to have a sack of stuff from which the perfume smell emanated from. She must've rubbed that perfume smell all over the stuff in the bag!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd never be able to proceed as long as she hung around!

She was fairly pudgy, wielding hips wider than your shoulder span, and a cleavage that could almost completely swallow you up!

As soon as it's gone, you'll definitely be able to smell your parents again, and will definitely be able to progress! Though, first you had to... speak to that lady. As you approached, you couldn't help but notice a few things about her. First, that the \"dress\" clung tightly around her hips, which were revealed to be about as wide as your shoulder span. You could even notice the \"dress\" riding up, showing off an outline of her butt crack. You felt yourself blush at this, feeling like you were approaching territory you shouldn't get involved in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second thing you noticed? The closer you got to her, the more you smelled something else accompanying that perfume-y smell. It smelled sort of musty, and felt sour against your nostrils. It sort of smelled like a stronger version of the smell of sweat, just with a layer of perfume over it. Now, on top of the sharp sting of the perfume, you were combo-ed with the sour-y punch of musk. You shook your head, psyching yourself up. You just had to get her to move away, and then you could smell fresh air again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you stood by her hip, and realized you were level with her chest. You felt yourself wanting to take in a deep breath to clear your mind, but you knew you'd end up smelling that horrid smell again. You, instead, coughed into your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hello, ma'am,\" you said innocently. Upon hearing you, the aromatisse looked down at you, confused. Though, upon realizing the cute l'il guy talking to her, she seemed to warm up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there, dear!\" she said. She leaned down, placing her hands on her hips and getting closer to you. \"You look awfully small to be on your own her, bud. What brings you here?\" You felt yourself back up as she leaned forwards, wishing to stay in her view. Instead of resisting this time, you decided to take in a deep breath to calm down. Unfortunately, you were hit with that smell again. Though, weirdly enough, on top of being painful, you felt... drawn. Nah, you were talking crazy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, that's just what I wanted to talk to you about,\" you said, trying to hold back another cough. \"My parents went missing, and I caught their scent. Now, I was wondering if you'd be willing to move? Your, ahem, smell is making it harder to track them down. So, I was wondering if you could, please, move somewhere else for a little bit?\" At that, the aromatisse leaned back, placing a hand on her chin while looking down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, don't like my smell?\" she said. \"Well, I'd hate to burst your bubble, bud, but I've been told my natural odor could be smelled for miles. If I left now, it'd take me hours to get far enough for my musk to not waft through the village.\" An unfortuante idea, but you didn't have much choice. You sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that'll have to do, I'm afraid,\" you said. However, she didn't seem to take kindly to that. She glared down at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's rude,\" she said. \"I'd certainly hate to walk that far, after spending so much time walking on my own two feet all the way over here. My feet are still sore!\" You began to feel guilty and nervously rubbed your shoulder. But, you tried to keep up your gaze, silently asking her to move. She huffed. \"Alright, I can move again.\" She then leaned back and sat on a bench behind her, extending her legs as if she were lounging them on a stool. She brought one foot out of one of her heels, revealing one of her magenta feet, and letting a puff of more of that perfumy smell waft out and assault you again. She then used her free foot to hook the back of her other heel, and peel it off to allow her other foot freedom, and allow more smelly perfume-y stink to waft up to you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, my feet are killing me,\" she reiterated. \"You smell all of that around me? That's the sweat I worked up getting over here.\" Suddenly, you winced in disgust, realizing what kind of musk you'd allowed yourself to be surrounded in. And worse yet, somehow you feel more and more tempted to laud that stink in. \"I'd love ever so much for some dear cutie to just rub that soreness out of my feet. Very few have dared to wander within a few feet of me. But, since you want soooo dearly to see me out of this village and to find mommy and daddy...\" Not good. You couldn't refuse her now. You had to get her to move!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt this odd allure, watching her feet exposed to you, her toes invitingly wiggling, as if beckoning you over. At the same time, you remembered just what you'd have to deal with while rubbing... So, you brought up your hands, held them inches away from one of her feet, and brought them closer and closer. You shut your eyes, and wrapped them around her foot. It felt kinda big for your hands, it could've probably covered half of your face if she wanted to... So, you began kneading, trying to ignore that alluring smell, and the temptation of looking at those feet again...</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately though, the Gloom has other plans. You see her flower twitch, and a stream of her vile pollen engulfs your head. The smell is so nasty, it's beyond words! Your entire body tenses up, and your face adopts a look of sheer disgust...only for everything to go dark mere seconds later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up, you find yourself bound and caged in a wooden cage.

Your lower lip trembles in fear. The lizard is stone-still. You risk another step. Your eyes are trained on the Salandit, not risking to look away for a second. He lowers his face to the ground, rump in the air: a pouncing stance. You turn to sprint but he is too quick. With a leap he is upon you -- knocking you to the forest floor and pinning you down. Your fall is partially cushioned by wild grasses, but you still feel round pebbles dig into your spine as he rests his entire weight upon you. Your stubby arms are splayed beside you, each of his paws holding you down by the shoulders. His maniacal face is far too close. So close, he practically breathes his stinking, sulphurous breath directly into your nostrils. Clearly excited, thick black smoke billows from his nostrils. Glowing embers dance in front of your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"clred\">\u201cNo run, now. I will bring you to the Queen.\u201d</span> His violet eyes burn with madness as his jaw begins to unhinge. Terrified, you futility kick your legs, mumbling half-formed burbling pleadings. Your teary black eyes stare into his cherry red gullet. Wisps of smoke dance and twist from the depths of his maw. Strings of murky saliva hang from the fleshed cavern like stalactites. Humid air encompeses you as the Salandit exhales, before he begins to devour you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His tongue lifts and slides across his inner cheek before moving onto your own. Its slickness rubs against your right cheek, wetting your fur. Macably, you remember your mother bear doing the same, saying you were \u201csweet enough to eat.\u201d Unlike hers, his tongue is not gentle and presses hard into your fur. With a flick, his tongue returns to its lair -- flinging spittle into your eye. With a single movement, the Salandit moves a hand to the back of your head and pushes you into his gullet. His jaws close and it is dark. You cough as you breathe in a stinking cloud of smoke. Your ears are pressed against your skull; for there is no room for them in the confines of the lizards jaws. You watch in horror as the lizards tongue awakens once more. The slick organ tastes you, slipping and sliding across your face as it explores every nook and cranny until you are left sopping. The Salandit breathes in, sucking you-flavored saliva and sending it tumbling down his gullet with a mighty swallow. A resounding hum echoes around you. He likes you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A smooth hand cradles your back, lifting it from the ground. A hand still firmly placed behind your head, the Salandit cranes his head back so that his snout points toward the sky. His jaws repeatedly snap open and close, tossing you upwards and dragging you further into his gullet. You protest, opening your mouth to cry but are silenced by a mouthful of saliva. Then your nose touches the muscles in the back of his throat which undulate in response. His tongue tickles your neck as your head begins its descent into his esophagus. Powerful muscles, uncaring and unyielding, crush against you. Now you feel the Salandit\u2019s hand push against your rump, aiding your descent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Outside, a sizeable bulge is seen stretched across the Salandit\u2019s upper throat. That, is your head. Inside, you see his throat muscles lurch and compress as you\u2019re squeezed into the tight, fleshy tunnel \u2014 officially swallowed. Wet muscle mashes against you as you breathe in fetid air; tainted with the scents of the contents of the Salandit\u2019s belly. Mucus soils your fur as you slip deeper. Your surroundings lurch forward repeatedly as the Salandit\u2019s head bobs like a bird\u2019s as he tries to cram the remainder of you down his throat. You feel his tongue slip between your legs, tasting your inner thigh right before you are pressed into the lower esophageal sphincter: the entrance to his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You breach the tight ring of muscle and are punched with the foul environment of the Salandit\u2019s stomach. Acrid air tingles your nose as the lizards yellowed stomach juices slosh and tumble as its environment heaves. Remainders of past meals float about in the soup -- fortunately none of which looked to have once been alive.<br>\r\nMore of you enters the muscular sack. Your paws touch the revolting liquid and to your relief you find that it does not burn. Outside, the Salandit raises a paw to its neck, feeling the indent your lower body makes as it descends down his throat. Soon, you are entirely inside the lizard\u2019s belly, which he celebrates with an illustrious sigh. His belly is nearly thrice its original size. Subtle imprints of a struggling Teddiursa can be seen from the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"clred\">\u201cYou taste very good!

You had never seen another Pok\u00e9mon before, only ever interacting with your mom and dad, and you were understandably afraid. The flapping cake to halt with a heavy thump that shook the ground slightly. Cautiously, you peeled your head out from around the bush to see what Pok\u00e9mon was making all of the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a Dragonite that landed not even ten meters away from where you were sleeping. You stated in awe at the big creature. The first thing you immediately noticed aboutt her was her strong, wide hips, large buttocks and long, thick tail. The dragon's body was rather tall and bulky with the sunlight bouncing off her bright orange scales. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was picking berries off of a bush you failed to see earlier and gobbling them up. You subconsciously licked your little lips in hunger as the gnawing hunger in your stomach had returned. Maybe...if your careful you could sneak up behind her and take some berries before it\u2019s too late. At least he rare she\u2019s going there might not be enough for you afterwards. You moved around a tree next to the bush and my bed into the Dragonite\u2019s blind spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crawled on your belly predator style ready to make off with a couple of berries before the Dragonite realizes you are ever there. When you were close enough you pounded onto the bush, Right before the Dragonite shifted herself and positioned her left thigh right where you were going to land, sinking your teeth into her leathery hide. The Dragonite gulped down another series of berries when she noticed a faint tickling on her hip. She turned around and saw you latched onto her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smacked you off of her and turned to face your body on the ground. You fell right on your left hip, shaking off the attack when you noticed a large shadow looking over your form. You looked up to see one of the Dragonite's soles hovering above you. A few specs of dirt fell off the foot and onto your nose. Before you could even get a shout of terror in, the sole pressed itself against your body, compressing it into the ground with constant pressure until it completely covered your whole body and he was out of sight with a series of cracking and squishing noises. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dragonite smirked as the you pitifully struggled under her sole. You desperately yelped for someone nearby to help you as more weight pressed on the foot, crushing you further into the ground. She began rubbing her foot on your squashed body, causing you to groan in pain. The Dragonite then settled her foot on top of you for several seconds before lifting her foot up. She became puzzled when she saw that you were not in the large indent in the ground. She checked under her foot and saw you pressed into her mushy sole causing her to chuckle rather deviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down and peeled the your trampled frame off her foot and dropped you lazily in front of her. The trample caused you to become disoriented and you struggled to stand up. The Dragonite then slammed both her feet against your poor flattened torso, squishing you between both her soles. She started grinding her feet together to cause even further damage, just for fun and out of spite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dragonite soon separated her feet and the yoh dropped to the ground half-conscious, half-asleep. You then tried to stand  up and gave a low sob at the sight of the Dragonite trudging towards you. The dragonite picked you up and pressed you against her belly. Clueless to her intentions, you began to quietly cry at the dragon. The pain was absolutely unbearable. You never should have left the tree. You should have waited for your parents to come back. All of this could have been so easily avoided if you bare the worried so much. The large dragonite fell forward and dropped her bulk on top of her captive with a loud scrunch. She grounded her belly on you for a couple times before standing up and fixing her eyes on her victim. You lost consciousness, too exhausted to say awake as the dragonite began laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally came to...</span></div></div>",

She looked behind herself and scooted her rear up until it covered the entirety of your body and pressed down all her weight. You yelped in pain as your world became enveloped under her massive rugged rear. The Dragonite started wiggling her rump on your form, enjoying the feel of your struggles. With all other options cast aside, you sink your teeth made for eating berries into the dragon type Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s cheeks. She stood up in slight pain leaving you  in a large butt shaped crater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dragonite picked you up and brought you up to her face glaring at you angrily. She licked her lips and brought you up to her opening maw. You panicked and used all of your fleeting strength to try to escape the dragonite\u2019s grasp to no avail. She sat you on her moist tongue and closed her maw, ensnaring you in her mouth. The Dragonite shifted her tongue all over your small body covering you in warm saliva and swishing you all over her mouth. You clashed with the tongue aspiring to escape its grasp, until, To your absolute horror, you began sliding towards the Dragonite's throat. She lifted her head at an angle, forcing the you without a say in the matter to slide into the back of her throat. You grabbed desperately at her tongue as she gulped you down her slimy esophagus with great effort.  A bulge formed in the dragon's throat, traveling down with her morsel. You slipped from your own grasp and fell into the dragonite stomach, a new bulge expanding onto her frame in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dragonite exhaled with great pleasure as you wriggled around in her belly. She rubbed her hefty belly as you fought to break out of your prison. It was hot, and tight, and you couldn\u2019t see anything. You are so scared. All you wanted in the world right now was for your parents to be here right with you to calm you down. They always knew what to say, even in the worst situations. The Dragonite let out a drawn out yawn and laid down on her belly and fell asleep as you compressed inside of the dragon's warm slimy belly and continued to struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whimper as a few tears wash down your face, but maybe ithey are stray droplets of saliva, believing this is your prison, your new cage, entrapped forever inside a Pokemon until you were digested into mush...</span></div></div>",

Having a full belly before I doze off makes me sleep like a baby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared mouth agape at the giant female dragon before you, too startled by her appearance to even try and run away. She noticed your confused expression and giggled, shaking her...well, everything. \u201cI bet your wondering why your not pudge on my belly right now, right?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only nod dumbly in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled again, clearly entertained by your expressions alone. \u201cWell, you were about to, but right before my tummy started the whole digesting process, I realized something. Do you know what that something was, little guy?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were shaking in fear of this Draginite, what was she intending to do with you? She spared you, but at what cost? You gulped and cautiously responded back. \u201cB-because...you realized that...t-that I\u2019m just a kid?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this the Dragonite started to burst out laughing, gripping both sides of her fat, plush belly, hypnotizing you with how it bounced up and down like waves on water. Without any notice, she leaned forward, still guffawing, failing towards you at an increasing speed. You didn\u2019t even have time to react before you were once again buried under a mountain of heavy blubber. Only this time, you were given some room to breath, your head relatively unsmooshed by the great gut, but was instead pressed up against the Draginite\u2019s wobbling breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinnaly, after a good solid minute, she stopped laughing, and the Dragonite looked down in between her cleavage with a big smile on her face. \u201cOh no sweetie, it wasn't that at all. I\u2019ve eaten tons of kids, and you\u2019re no different then the Buneary who went to my big ol\u2019 but of mine, or that munchlax that became blubber in my thighs.\u201d She was entirely blaze about the entire eating kids thing, to such an extent that it made you both terrified and...it also made you get a weird fealing in between your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe reason I let you go little guy, is that, well...\u201d she leaned in close and whispers into your ear, \u201c...I\u2019ve always wanted a slave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-slave?!\u201d You asked incredibly alarmed. The Dragonite chuckles in affirmation. \u201cYour the perfect size, you know that? Those little paws of yours could rub me in all the right places. And your just the perfectly size to be my lityle butt cushion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB...b-but...\u201d you were on the verge of tears, your voice breaking up. \u201cBut I-*hic* don\u2019t wanna be a sla- *sniff* ave.\u201d You have speak, half choke. \u201cI-I want my mum, and me daddy. I don\u2019t want- I wanna go home...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN\u2019aaaw, lil\u2019 sweetie~\u201d the Dragonite coos, lifting herself back up with your still tied to her body like a bandage. Before you could peel yourself off, the Dragonite\u2019s thick, heavy arms, hugging by you close to her soft form. She nuzzled you with her fat laden snout and stroked your back with her thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m your new mommy now,\u201d she said in a motherly tone. \u201cYour gonna be my slave forever and ever and ever. I\u2019m gonna squish you, squash you, eat you and belittle you, and theres not a single thing you can ever do about it.\u201d She planted a soft kiss on your forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour gonna help me get more Pok\u00e9mon to eat, so I can get bigger and fatter, and heavier and softer. Your gonna rub my paws and belly and butt as inslupr down more food to churn. And your gonna do evrethibg I say, no matter what, or else. Does that sound good, little guy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO!\u201d You yell as you grip both sides of her breasts in a desperate attempt to hurt her, but her skin as too leathery and her fat gave too much furfhase for you to get a good grasp. You begin to bawl my eyes out and collapse into the Dragonite\u2019s boobs, tears running down there sides as you sob. And to think, all of this could have been avoided, if you just. Stayed. In. The. Tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, there. That\u2019s all right, let it all out.\u201d The Dragonite rubber your back in a soothing manner. You felt so lost, so hopeless, you just wanted to cry and cry until you cry yourself to sleep and wake up and realize this is all just one bad dream. But it wasent a dream. This was real life. And it was a total nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, your eyes stopped producing water as you calmed down. You were left emotionally drained and red faced, though that face was obscured by supple breast meat. \u201cFeel any better?\u201d The Dragonite asked. You slowly nodded in afirmation and the Dragonite softly smiled. \u201cGood...now that you know what\u2019s gonna happen, I know just how you can start being my wittle slave...\u201d</span></div></div>",

Silently, she laid her back up against a nearby tree, and slowly move you down her body until you face to face with her belly. Unexpectedly, the hug ended, but as much was you wanted to run away all you could do was sit up. The beige, creamy surface under you swallowed up your legs as you sat criss-crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dragonite notices your glum disposition and, for the first time since you\u2019ve known her, albeit short, actually frowned and looked sympathetic. \u201cWhy so down, little guy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...you couldn\u2019t tell whether or not she was mocking you or being serious and that scared you. You simply avoided her gaze and tried to think of something else. You decided to focus on your aching stomach. It still wasn't fed, and was now shouting at you in anger to fill it up. You could see the berry bush to your left, but it was entirely picked clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is it because you don\u2019t wanna be my slave?\u201d She asked innocently. Not innocently sounding, innocently. It unnerved you so much how she could be so much like your mom, and at the same time be so...mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...why do you do that?\u201d You ask above a whisper. \u201cWhy do you treat me nice for a little bit, a-and than make me feel bad later? I-it\u2019s really confusing and I don\u2019t like it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d The dragonite purred. She lifted her heavy arm and scratched the area around your ears. \u201cBeing a slave isn\u2019t so bad lil\u2019 guy. I\u2019ll keep you fed, play with you, tell you stories and make you feel better when you're sad. I\u2019m still gonna squish and tease \u2018ya, but not because i like seeing you sad, because it\u2019s fun! Besides\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned in close towards your face for this last part. \u201c...are you sure there wasn't anything you didn't like about before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed and tried to look away, but you move your head away from the Dragonite's sparking blue eyes. It did feel...kinda nice in a way. It felt good to have your body be under pressure like that, and you would be lying if you said the Dragonite's body wasn't soft. But you were too busy being in pain to truly enjoy the Dragonite\u2019s definition of \u2018fun\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see that blush~\u201d The dragonite cooed. \u201cAnd just for being honest, your first slave task is gonna be one your gonna like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou seriously doubted how you were gonna enjoy being a slave for this Dragonite, but you didn't really have a choice in the matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst,\u201d The dragonite took both of your paws and slid them onto her belly\u2019s surface, \u201cMove your hands in slow circles.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reluctantly obeyed your new master, wiggling your paws in slow, circular movements through the beige flab. The flesh bubbled up in between your small digits, eager to engulf your body in it\u2019s plush material. At first, you didn't feel anything, but as time went on...you started to actually realize how soft the Dragonite was. It felt running your hands across the world\u2019s softest bed, screaming at you to lay down on it and fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSecond\u201d, the Dragonite commanded, \u201cstart kneading it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKneading?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink of my belly as an unbaked pie, sweetie\u201d she encouraged, \u201cit needs to be fluffed up before it can go in the oven.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing you began to grope the soft, leathery skin, earning pleased purrs from the dragonite. It felt great, no other answer but great, to have the belly fat swallow up your arms in a soft embrace as you kneaded it. Soon, you began to knead with your footpaws also, the small digits wriggling around behind you. It felt like swimming in a sea of flab, no easy task, but well worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you kinda just stopped and collapsed head first onto the soft surface. You could hear her stomach gurgling and heartbeat thumping, like an internal symphony. The Dragonite opened her eyes, waking up out of her massage induced daze, and tilted her head forward to see why the rubbing stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled as she saw your tuckered out form sprawled out across her tummy. You had a long day, and she figured this was a proper reward for your effort. However, both of you were interrupted when an intense, violent rumble came from...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You started to become sleepy, whether it was from the workout of massaging the dragonite or the beat down you received but you were tired. You yawned and dragonite seemed to notice. The dragonite nuzzled your head \"Ahh, is the little runt all tuckered out. Looks like it's way past your bed time but don't you worry, imma take REALLY good care of you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed that she walking away from the tree you called home. \"Wait, where are going? You've have had your fun now please let me go home\". The dragonite hold you to its shoulder \"Don't you realize runt we are going home, my home\".  The dragonite takes flight with you in tow. As watch as the tree you called home fall further and further into the distance it finally dawned on you. This could be the last time that you ever see your home or possibly your parents ever again. You started to cry and whispered a small \" I am sorry mommy and daddy\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to keep track of where you where going in the hopes of one day finding your way back home but this proved to be too hard a task for you to pull off and you lose the way home. Finally you arrived at the dragonite home a cave in the mountains. \"Welcome to your new home and we are going to have so much fun together\". The dragonite grabs the boulder by entrance and seals you both in. You bang against the dragonite's leg \"I wanna go home\"!!!. She just grabbed and hugged you softly \"It is alright little one don't cry, you will see everything will be okay\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt her stroking your back and rocking you trying to comfort you. As much as you wanted to stay angry but you couldn't, you were far to tired to maintain your rage anymore and just collapsed on her belly. You had no more tears to shed, just a feeling hopeless as you came to terms with your situation. \"It's okay let it all out, I know things may not be ideal right now but it it gets better I promise you\". You perked up \"You... you really mean that\"? \"Sure do runt now lets hit the hey it's been a long day\". The dragonite little rhyme put you at ease  and made you feel better. You muttered softly \"Thank you so much\" before finally drifting off to sleep on dragonite's belly.</span></div></div>",

You came to believe that life was dictated by fate; whatever happens, happens. If you were fated to die out here, so be it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you was the Tree of Life.

Your mother told you all about Xerneas, in her fairy tales. Once, she was the proud matron of the Tree of Life; but it has since grown too powerful for even her to control.

You were starting to feel bad for tricking her like this\u2026 but she would\u2019ve eaten you otherwise. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 so sorry. I failed you. The Tree of Life\u2026 I couldn\u2019t control it\u2026\u201d</b></span> You walked tentatively up to the once-legendary Pokemon as tears dripped down her cheeks, and you placed a comforting paw on her snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\"><b>\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Xerneas. Nobody could,\u201d</b></span> you said, in as soothing a voice you can muster. Luckily, it\u2019s been so long that the Xerneas must\u2019ve forgotten what Lucario\u2019s voice sounded like. She was crying openly now, and you take another step forward, hugging her around her huge neck. She wrapped her head around your back, and the two of you hugged for a long time while she quietly sobbed. <span class=\"cgrey\"><b>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay. There was nothing anybody could\u2019ve done,\u201d</b></span> you whisper, trying to reassure her. The Tree of Life has caused millions of deaths, and plunged her kingdom into savagery, so you understood why she would be so upset. Eventually, she composes herself, and you sit down by her side, leaning against her soft belly while she laid there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 so glad that you\u2019re okay,\u201d</b></span> she said, quietly. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to have someone to talk to\u2026 after all these years.\u201d</b></span> You wanted to just ask her where the Explorers are and leave, but you felt really bad for the Xerneas, so you decide to stick around for a while. This was probably the safest place to be tonight, after all, so you decide to stay with Xerneas until morning. You quietly cuddled with the deer while she vented all of the frustrations, the guilt, the loneliness, the terror she\u2019s been feeling over the past few decades. You found that you could relate to her, in a weird way. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cI\u2026 guess it\u2019s time to get some sleep, then,\u201d</b></span> She said, after the two of you had talked for a couple of hours straight. At first, you felt guilty for posing as the Lucario; but it seems to have made her happy, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\"><b>\u201cAlright. Good night,\u201d</b></span> you say, turning over. You go to sleep using the Xerneas\u2019 huge, soft belly as a sort of pillow, bringing you a welcome feeling of closeness. The legendary Pokemon wasn\u2019t nearly as scary as you thought she would be\u2026 in fact, you almost never felt safer. In the morning, Xerneas prepares a delicious breakfast, and the two of you have a much more jovial conversation over cheri berry galette and salad. She certainly seemed happier than she did when you first met. After the two of you quietly watch the sun rise over the forest, you feel the need to pop the question. You wished you could stay with Xerneas forever, but with every moment that passes, your chances of finding your mother decrease. <span class=\"cgrey\"><b>\u201cXerneas?\u201d</b></span> you said. <span class=\"cgrey\"><b>\u201cI am sorry, but I will have to take my leave. I have\u2026 important business.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nXerneas seemed saddened, but understanding. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cI\u2026 understand. I am really glad we were able to see eachother again,\u201d</b></span> she sighed. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cIs there any way I can help you on your journeys?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\"><b>\u201cActually, there is,\u201d</b></span> you reply. <span class=\"cgrey\"><b>\u201cI need to find other members of the Society. Think you could assist me with that?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cOf course. I think I\u2019m... still connected to them. Hold on...\u201d</b></span> she said, and closed her eyes, as if concentrating on something. You sat in silence for a while, until she had an epiphany. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cYes\u2026 yes, I see them. There are some in the salt flats, to the east,\u201d</b></span> she revealed, without even opening her eyes. You frowned. The salt plains? Your mother always said that she hated that place. Regardless, you were grateful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\"><b>\u201cThank you, Xerneas. That is a great help,\u201d</b></span> you say as you stand up, looking out over the tranquil forest. <span class=\"cgrey\"><b>\u201cIt was nice talking to you.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cYou too...\u201d</b></span> she said sadly, as you walked away. Once you were out of sight, you transformed back into a zorua, and continued your journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe salt plains were barren and miserable. The ground resembled snow, but was burning hot beneath your paws. Every once in awhile, the wind would blow sand in your eyes, just to add insult to injury. You couldn\u2019t imagine why any Explorers would want to be here; this place seemed empty. But you had to trust the Xerneas, as she was your only lead. As you walked, you eventually realized the salt was shifting strangely beneath you, as if it was alive. You were confused for a moment, only for another Pokemon to emerge from beneath the sands! It was a hippowdon! You leap out of the way just seconds before it can close its jaws around you, before turning to face your opponent. The hippowdon looked typical for a savage Pokemon, with scars littering its body, salt filling its shells, and glowing red eyes devoid of feeling or higher consciousness. Before you could let out an attack, it leaped forward, closing its jaws around you once again. <span class=\"cgrey\"><b>\u201cHelp!\u201d</b></span> you scream as you\u2019re rolled around on its tongue, just narrowly missing the hippowdon\u2019s sharp teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment, some powerful force struck the hippowdon in the side. It spit you out by reflex, and you collapsed onto the ground, covered in saliva. You could only watch as a Lucario emerged from the salt flats, and blasted the hippowdon with a powerful aura sphere, destroying the creature\u2019s protective shell. The hippowdon turned to fight its aggressor, only to be attacked from behind by a burst of fire, as a braixen emerged from the sands as well. The hippowdon yelped as the flames struck its unprotected skin, and burrowed its way back into the thick salt. The battle was over almost before you could even register what had happened. With that finished, the lucario leaned over, offering you a helping paw. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cAre you alright, little guy?\u201d</b></span> he asked, and you nodded silently as you stand and get your bearings together. You were stunned as you got a closer look at your saviors; a braixen and a lucario, both with red bandanas around their necks. You recognized them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\"><b>\u201cY-you\u2019re the Pokemon that saved the Tree of Life!\u201d</b></span> you gasped. You had heard of these two Pokemon all the time in fairy tales, but you never knew they were actually still alive! Just a couple decades ago, they defeated the anti matter, and prevented all the life from being drained from the world. The two of them had defeated legendary Pokemon with ease, and travelled the world during their epic quests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe braixen looked flattered. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cWell\u2026 that happened a long, long time ago,\u201d</b></span> she said, humble. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cBut yeah, that\u2019s us, I guess.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\"><b>\u201cMy mother told me all about you! Is it true you really battled with legendaries?\u201d</b></span> you asked, excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cUh, let\u2019s save the questions for when we\u2019re not in the salt plains,\u201d</b></span> the braixen dismissed your query. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cWe have a safe place nearby, little guy. Do you want to come along?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\"><b>\u201cOf course!\u201d</b></span> you smiled, skipping with excitement as you followed after them. This was perfect! This duo could do anything\u2026 they could definitely find your mother! All the fear and anxiety you\u2019ve been experiencing melted away. The duo led you far from the salt plains, deep into the most secret areas of the forest. Eventually, you came across their hideout; <a onclick=\"$('#dropNote1').toggle (200);\" style=\"cursor:pointer;color:#0000ff;\" title=\"\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">a palace built into the old trees of the forest</span> <span style=\"font-size:8pt;opacity:.75;text-decoration:none;\">\u25bc</span></a><div id=\"dropNote1\" style=\"padding:0px;display:none;\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/12/c0/c5/12c0c5538f7b4a4295aa70a3b4720f64.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/ori...</a></div> . It was the most beautiful thing you\u2019d ever seen! The palace was littered with other friendly pokemon, all seemingly working on expanding the place. You had never seen this many Pokemon in one place before! <span class=\"cgrey\"><b>\u201cWhoa...\u201d</b></span> you gasped, hardly able to believe your eyes. <span class=\"cgrey\"><b>\u201cWhat is this place?\"</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cWell\u2026 we call it \u2018Paradise\u2019,\u201d</b></span> the braixen said, sounding a little embarrassed. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cI mean, it may not necessarily be a paradise yet, but that\u2019s the end goal.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to build a community here. Somewhere safe,\u201d</b></span> the lucario explained in more detail. You wandered around, saying hello to all the friendly Pokemon. Compared to living alone in the savage forest, this place really did seem like a paradise. <span class=\"clblue\"><b>\u201cWe have important business to take care of, so you should just get settled in, little guy. If you need anything, you should talk to Kangaskhan.\u201d</b></span> You wander around, still awed by your surroundings. You had never seen anything like it before. There was so much to be done! \u2026 where to start?</font></span></div></div>",

They're head, neck, and torso appeared pearl-white, they had a short snout dotted by a pink bump, sparkling eyes, and wavy blue hair. They also bore D cup breasts, hidden behind a thick frill. You were approached by a Primarina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't seen you around here,\" the Primarina said. She didn't sound dangerous. In fact, she bore the kind of voice you'd expect to hear lulling you to sleep at night. \"Are you lost?\" Her voice made you want to answer her, but you remembered hearing how dangerous strangers were.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The big Primarina seemed to be a nice sort of Pok\u00e9mon. You remembered what your parents said about strangers, that they were dangerous and manipulative, but you had no idea of how true their words were, having never ventured past your home. You decided to give this stranger the benefit of the doubt, genuinely concerned about you. \"I...I can't find my parents.\" You relent with a small quiver in your voice. \"They never came home last night, a-and I'm trying to find them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a very brave little boy for going out all on your own.\" The Primarina cooed in a soothing voice as you shared with her your situation. You let out a small gasp as you felt the Pok\u00e9mon's tail slowly wrap around your sides in the water, not an uncomfortable vice grip, but strong enough for you to not escape. \"I...I wish I could wish you good luck on your quest to find them, but I'm afraid I already know where they are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You was my parents!?\" You raised your voice as Hope began to swell up inside of you. You knew you shouldn't have gotten your hopes up, but you couldn't help it! The big, nice Primarina lady was going to lead you back to your mom and dad, back to their loving embrace. \"Where are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you poor little thing.\" The Primarina leaned in to give you a sad nuzzle on your forehead, making you blush and squirm. She swam gently to a nearby rock and heaved herself onto it out from the water, giving you a clear view of her form. The Siren Pokemon was heavily rotund with a big, fat stomach jutting a couple of feet from her midriff, a thick tail smothered in blubber jutting from it in place of her legs. \"Too young to understand how the world works. I'm afraid they're right here, little Oshy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pudgy Primarina patted her very well fed tummy at the end of her sentence, making the white flab Bob up and down and side to side. At first, you didn't understand what the bigger Pok\u00e9mon was saying, but all too suddenly the realization struck you like a ton of bricks on your head. \"Y-y-you...you ate them?\" You looked up to the massive mermaid's year and watched it nod in affirmation. \"B-But...no! No, I want my parents back! Give me back my mom and dad!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to whimper and cry as the Primarina gently released you from her tail onto her soft tummy, soft with the pudge made from your mom and dad's bodies. You tried to be calm and rational, knowing that you were in the presence of the same Pok\u00e9mon that turned your parents into fat, but you were overcome with emotion. They were everything you had, and now...they were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nothing personal, little Oshy.\" The Primarina softly stroked your head, comforting you in your state of emotional turmoil. \"Your parents seemed to be very nice folk, and they talked a great deal about you before I churned them up. But I'm afraid they forgot to teach you an important lesson about the world before they left it. Out here, the bigger Pok\u00e9mon eats the little Pok\u00e9mon, and as you can see, I'm a very big Pok\u00e9mon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...why?\" You asked in between sniffles, looking up to the Primarina for any sort of support, any kind of comfort that she could give despite her being the reason you were now an orphan. \"Why did you have to eat...them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I was hungry.\" The Primarina shrugged her shoulders, not understanding why what she did was causing such an emotional reaction in you. She figured that you must have been very, very sheared and was coming out into the world for the first time. \"That's just how I am, and how a lot of other Pok\u00e9mon are. What do you want me to do, starve myself on berries and kelp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...no.\" You curled up on top of the Primarina's tummy into a protective ball, exhausted from the emotions inside of you and scared of how alone you were in such a big, dangerous world. \"I want my mom and dad back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, little oshy. I know you do, but I'm afraid they're gone for good.\" She hugged your body into her own, her comfy and malleable form making you sink into her fatty flesh. \"But if it really does bother you that much, the least I could do is help you join them.\" Suddenly, you felt yourself being lifted up into the air by the Pokemon's flippers. You open your eyes from your protective shell to see the mermaid's maw opened wide with a tongue lazily rolled over it. This was it, you were about to get eaten! By the same Pok\u00e9mon that date your parents, no less!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to squirm and panic, but your feeble strength was no match for the Primarina's. Before you entered past the point of no return, you suddenly got into your mind the last ditch idea to save yourself. \"Wait, I'm too small to be food, not even a snack!\" You wail, stopping the Pok\u00e9mon from dropping you onto her tongue at the last second. \"Isn't there any use for me that doesn't involve me...turning into fat?</span></div></div>",

So, she shrugged her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could use myself a little butler,\" she said. At that, you nodded your head. Though, honestly you didn't seem to care what the alternative was. You needed to make sure you weren't eaten! At that, she brought you down, instead tucking you under her arm. She then dove down, dragging you along while holding you close... close to that extended belly... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you saw she brought you down to the sea floor, towards an undersea cave. She swam through it, and soon brought you up onto a submerged cliff, laying you down before she brought herself up, lying on the cliff as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been awfully lonely down here, not that I particularly mind. Though it doesn't hurt to have a little guy pamper me,\" she cooed out. You stood up nervously, looking over her form and fearing your fate. It seemed you might have to serve her for a while.

She was smiling ear to ear warmly, the kind of smile you would give to a new favorite toy. She clasped her pale white flipper-hands together happily as an idea for what to do with you popped into her mind. She bent down, indirectly squishing her slick, breasts together in front of you. You blushed and squirmed from the show, they were like wet water balloons\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I should tell you my name, since you\u2019re my pet now.\u201d The Primarina grasped one of your shoulders as she slithered her way around you, dragging her thick with blubber mermaid tail along the ground. Where the tail and the waist met they're was a pair of wide hips and a soft bottom that giggled like mad. \u201cMy name is Donna, but you may call me...mistress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-okay\u2026\u201d You stutter a little with fear as Donna sensually circled your form, eyeing you up like a delicious pice of meat. You would have to do your best to please your new captor, otherwise you\u2019ll fall in the same situation your parents faced...digesting in her soft tummy and adding to her plush frame. \u201cWhat wo-would you like me to do for you, m-mistress?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, my little Oshy, it\u2019s actually quite simple.\u201d Donna cooed as she essentially tackled you from the behind, her breasts squishing against either side of your face. Your head was practically consumed by the massive, warn bosom, and you panicked and struggled for air. Smirking, your captor refused to release you from her slippery mammaries. \u201c You\u2019re gonna be my squish toy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour...your squish toy?\u201d You struggled to ask as the fat boobs plugged up any flow of air, forcing you to push your stubby hands into the tit flesh to speak. They were warn and giggly like gelatin and soft enough to engulf your hands. You looked up past the canyon of her cleavage to see the Primarina silently smirking at your predicament, humming a happy tune. \u201cThat do-sen\u2019t sound too fun\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, but your so wrong!\u201d Donna taunted as she forceably removed you from her clevage, only to spin around with suden grace and flexability to pin you under her jiggling rump, shaking and grinding it into the ground to get you to squirm. \u201cWe\u2019ve only just startred, and I\u2019m having loads of fun! And don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re not getting a little enjoyment out of this~\u201d She teased as she lifted herself up and down, grinding your body into the cliff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't want to admit it...but it was just a little fun. The pressure that Donna\u2019s body gave out was heavy and crushing, but the plush softness and warmth of her padding got you a little excited. Rubbery and slick but heavy as a ton of bricks, you didn't fully understand why you were enjoying it, bt couldn't deny that you were at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see that blush~\u201d Donna purred as she peered over her shoulders to get a good look at you. You tried to cover your cheeks, but your arms were pinned underneath fat mermaid tail flesh. \u201cYou know...before your parents became the fat you\u2019re getting teased over, they talked a great deal about you. They really did love you, and were very sad to not see you again\u2026\u201d She announced, getting off from your form one last time before scooping you up with her tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy little Oshy, I\u2019ve eaten a lot of Pokemon in my lifetime, but your mommy and daddy...they were different. They weren't sad they were about to go, they were sad to leave you behind.\u201d Donna cooed and patted your body, trying to calm you down. \u201cIf you ever want to join them, all you have to do is ask, but...I think you prefer to have me squish them on top of you~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna planted a little lick-kiss on your forehead, and you almost whined when the tongue was gone. She was trying to manipulate you, your mind reasoned. She\u2019s trying to turn you into the perfect pet. But even if that was the case, she was the closest thing you had to living family. Maybe your parents are still alive in some way, watching over you as fat on her body...it sounded outlandish, but you were willing to put trust in anything if it brought you at least a small bit of comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take good care of you, Oshy\u2026\u201d Donna yawned as she leaned forward, smothering you underneath her large tummy as she began to take a nap on the sea cliff. You had a narrow passage of air to breath through her doughy boobs. It was as if you were wrapped in a mushy, warn cocoon of soft flesh. In a weird way...it was comforting. \u201cSweet dreams, Oshy. The real fun begins when you wake up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of this, you found a comfortable position in the fat to recline under. The squishy tummy gurgled and groaned, rocking you to sleep like a lullaby...</span></div></div>",

She repeated the process two more times, and got off of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think you learned your lesson?\" she said. \"Or do I need to pound you some more?\" You propped yourself up on your hands, and panted heavily in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe you,\" she said.

It's size dwarfs you, and with some effort, she could fit your entire body in it, cheekwise or down the 'chute'. It feels chillingly cold where you would heat. She shifts a bit, impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up, if you plan on apologizing.\" Gorgeist demands, thrusting slightly toward you. Your situation still fresh in your mind, you accept that this is risky, but the only chance you may have. This Gorgeist may have it out for you and isn't to be trusted, but disobeying her is just going to rain more pain down on you. You do your best to look as submissive and sorry as possible, and bury your face mouth-first as far as it can go inside her horrifyingly phat ass. You can feel something draining your strength, like being pulled into high tide but slightly. If this was a taste of a Grass-type's power, you don't believe you could do a thing against her. But if this was some Ghost-type thing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really hope she didn't just suck part of your soul out to feed her monster booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nothing, you hair-ruiner, you! You call that an apology? Put some back into it, I barely feel you!\" Gorgeist demands, sliding her hips across your face in a humiliating Tail Whip gesture. You roll your eyes up and see her glaring down on you with a satisfied smile. She's got you right where she wants you, damn it. In for a penny, in for a pound. Maybe if you work hard enough, you can get a chance to get away from this crazy-ass ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing yourself not to cringe against the pounds of pumpkin rump battering your face, you grab hold of one of her cheeks, unable to stretch your small arms around all of her hips and go to town on it, rubbing your nose, cheeks, and mouth against it and making out with the fleshy fruity gourd like it could just well save your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGorgeist makes no comment at your sincerest effort, pausing only to lightly tap her hair against you whenever you slow down. Out of nowhere she shifts a bit, throws her hair over you, and blankets you against her ass. You begin to wonder if this is some weird attempt to make up for what you've gone through with a butt bed until you feel a rumbling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'No...'</i> You think. <i>'She couldn't have...digested my shell already!? That's gotta be something else...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let this be a warning of what happens to ruffians who mess with my hair. Here's a taste of the last person who tried to get rough with me!\" haughtily shouts Gorgeist as she pushes you inbetween her cheeks and clenches down like a vicegrip. You feel blinded by the lances of pain running through your head, coming around long enough to notice what could be...her anus twitching...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to thrash and struggle as hard as you possibly can as the rumbling gets stronger. If she isn't lying, she could be ready to fart a Pokemon sized meal turned Sweet Scent or something worse right all over you. You don't even feel as though you've moved an inch between her ghost glutes as her anus puckers, expands, and contracts, giving you visions of a blindingly orange furnace of a rectum where one would expect darkness, marred by an orange fleshy corridor that looks as though it's widening open to swallow you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea what to expect but if you think she might kill you this could be your last chance to escape!</span></div></div>",

The next thing to hit you after you felt your face get some reprieve was sheer stink. You were assailed with a rancid blast, stinking of rotted meat and sulfur, blasting right into your face. You felt your poor nostrils and mouth swallow up the stinking gas, while your ears were treated to a deafening raspberry. Worse still, a bit of the fire within her was blown at you, cooking your face, though it wasn't really effective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her assault, her hair spread, and you were allowed to flop backwards, landing on your back, the world a strange haze in your eyes. You smelt the lingering stench on your face, and any onlooker would see soot staining you. The Gourgeist stood over you, a wicked grin on both of her faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You smell that?\" she asked. \"That's what the end smells like. Any Pok\u00e9mon I don't like, that's what they ultimately end up as. If I see you again, you're gonna be my next stench.\" With that, she began to walk away, before fading like a ghost, though you could see the bushes lightly sway as if some invisible force was going through them. With a heavy groan, you got to your feet, upset at what transpired. You sadly wiped your face, and noticed the soot you collected on your hand, an unfortunate reminder of that humiliating spectacle. As if getting farted on wasn't bad enough, the Gourgeist was walking away with your weapon, a gift from your parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could try to get it back from her, but you'd risk getting messed with again. You could probably look for a shell you could use somewhere else. Or, you could make up for lost time and seek out your parents.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Croagunk fell, landed on your head and jumped off it after a second and drop kicked the boulder speeding it up and trapping the Gourgiest rolling far away. \"And as a little bonus\" Croagunk said as he threw something very far ahead of the gourgiest. \"What was that?\" You asked as you and the Croagunk walked away \"Oh it's just a bomb we better hurry in case the blast has Gourgiest come this way.\" Croagunk said casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let me guess your parents went missing and you're trying to find the,?\" The Croagunk asked and looked at him shocked. \"Happened to me also, actually I've done some traveling and it's been happening all over.

And she doesn't appear interested in relinquishing her seat on top of you any time soon. All you hear is haunting, muffled laughter from high above as she grinds her backside over your small body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, with a final shake and a bounce the pressure, and the Gourgeist, are gone! It's as if she's vanished. Maybe she got bored with you or maybe she figured you had learned your lesson. Hell, maybe she was late to an appointment. You didn't care what the reason was and you weren't going to wait around to ask questions. As soon as your body allowed you to, you took off running in the direction of the water!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew the ocean was dangerous, but at least there you'd be able to move quicker and hide better if that disturbing ghost type returned. As you ran, branches and brushes slapped against your arms and face. The jungle seemed to get more and more dense as you ran. You pulled out your shell blade and cut through the vegetation to clear a path for yourself, but the more you cut away the more that kept coming! It was as if the forest itself was chasing you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt several points, you managed to get your legs tangled up in the brush. You nearly fell on multiple occasions, but managed to continue moving forward. You thought you heard a light sound of a familiar laughter from somewhere nearby, but it was so soft you ignored it. Chalking it up, instead, to your nervous mind playing tricks on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you reached the water's edge. You paused for a few moments to catch your breath as you prepared to dive in. Your form was perfect and you closed your eyes ready to escape into the peaceful, you hoped, waters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRASH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hit the ocean floor face first. You opened your eyes in confusion, but what you saw didn't provide many answers. You looked up in awe as you were surrounded by a wall of water that looked as if it were being held back by some unseen force. The ocean stood high above you and seemed to be normal everywhere, except for the spot you crash landed. You thought back and you were certain this odd hole in the water wasn't there when you jumped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could wrap your mind around this, your body was flattened by an unseen force. You felt yourself pressed and pinned by something large, fleshy, and round, but whatever it was you were able to see right through it. As you heard the muffled laughter return, you realized what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGourgeist! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had never actually let you go, she had just vanished and was following you this whole time. The branches and brush in the forest, the sudden hole in the ocean, that all had to be her! This was <i>definitely</i> her seated on top of you once again. Your realization was confirmed when you heard her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's this for rough little Oshawott?\" she cooed, grinding your body deep into the rough sand of the dry spot you previously occupied. Well, still occupied beneath her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as suddenly as before, the weight is gone. Your eyes shoot open as you see the walls of water cascade over you, no longer being held back. In your flattened, battered state, you're in no position to swim and the wild waves of the sea toss your body in all directions. By the time you gathered your wits and your strength, you were far deeper than you had ever gone, even with your parents!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about swimming to the surface, but realize that Gourgeist is likely still tracking you somewhere. Instead, you swim deeper underwater, praying that you don't come across a hungry Gyrados. You swim, but have no idea what to do next. What does fate decide for you?</span></div></div>",

No, not huge, more like titanic. Standing at a staggering 8\u20191 feet tall, a height very uncommon among her kind, each footfall made by the mammoth sized Pok\u00e9mon made your entire world vibrate and shake lightly with each giant step her staggering 1,500 pounds of blubbery bulk took. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile many Snorlaxs were known for their huge bellies and huge appetites, it was clear to you that her weight settled in other areas. Gigantic N-cup sized breasts exploded out of her upper chest, with a massive ass that jutted out of her form like two yoga balls covered in blue fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a sweet little thing like yourself doing out here all alone?~\" The Snorlax calls to you, with an alarmingly seductive tone to her voice. Your first instinct was too run away from her as soon as she spotted you, but you found your feet glued to the ground as the Snorlax kept closing the gap between the two of you. Now that you and the Snorlax were essentially face to face, you barely registered the immense size difference between the two of you. Just to look eye to eye, the Snorlax had to bend over while also at the same time giving you a very personal view of her cleavage, the two large orbs gently smooshing against the grassy ground and nearly brushing up against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that you also remembered that she was talking to you, and probably wanted a response. There were so many questions in your head, who was she, why was she here?  Despite all this, the only thing you managed to utter was, \"uh...H-Hi?\" You also managed to wave your arm about, as to accentuate your greeting. The Snorlax let out a giggle, which if you were honest with yourself, was pretty cute It also caused her...well everything to jiggle as well, there was no denying it, this woman was huge both in height and weight. You thank your lucky stars that she appeared to be friendly, her hips alone were so wide that if she were to sit on you, no one would even see you. You shudder thinking about what else this behemoth of a woman could do to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if she were sensing your thoughts, The Pokemon tried to soothe your mind. \"Don't worry hun, I wouldn't hurt a cutie like you.\" The Snorlax cooed, \"say, what's your name sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeet still frozen in place, you try your best to respond to the massive Pokemon \"I..um\" You blushed. \"I don't really have...a name. My parents always just called me son...i guess my name is just Eevee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No name?\" The Snorlax tilted her head. \"Well, that's not right. A lovely man like yourself should have a lovely name to go with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but blush at her complement, so far things were going great between the two of you...hey...maybe you could ask her wear your Parents are! You wondered if she was really being honest with you, for all the smiling and giggling, she could be hiding an ulterior motive. But she wouldn't do that! She's too nice for that, or so you hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you...have you seen a Leafeon and Espeon around here?\" You ask, finally working up the courage to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...can't say I have sweetie.~\" The snorlax replies almost cheerfully. \"Why, do you know 'em?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...the thing is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--Time Passes--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou Parents never came home?!\u201d went the gigantic Snorlax in a shocked tone, after you delivered the news to her. \u201cThere, there sweetie\u2026it\u2019s alright\u201d she said genuinely sympathetically. That poor little baby! How could they just abandon their child? She was so precious! The Snorlax stroked you on the head lovingly and soothingly. \"You'll find them soon. Don\u2019t feel bad, now. I'll help you look for them.\" she said sweetly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw dropped in shock as the Snorlax uttered that last sentence. \"Y-y-your gonna help me?\" You asked. \"Why? W-we only just met, were strangers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, i don't believe in strangers, just friends and family that i haven't met yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe corner of your mouth turned up in a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although...\" The hyper fat, voluptuous Snorlax stood back up at full height, reminding you of how small you were compared to her. \"Before i do...\" she turned her gaze towards the berry bush in the middle of the small clearing the two of you were occupying. \"...well, can't work on an empty stomach!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, the berry bush, as well as four other fruit bearing trees around the area, was picked clean by the massive Snorlax, leaves and all. You heard the stories that your father would tell of how Snorlaxs would eaten anything even remotely edible, but you never thought he was telling the truth until today. You were perched on top of the Snorlax's belly as she laid down on her back to digest, stroking the now even more massive gut of your  very big, very satisfied temporary guardian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!\u201d went the Snorlax letting out a massive belch, her gigantic breasts resting heavily atop her bloated belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled down at you, your head resting against one of her enormous boobs, stroking her fat belly the same way your mother stroked your fur before you went to bed. \"Feeling full, Ms. Snorlax?\" You asked eagerly, ready to start the search for your parents. Although you did not deny you were pretty comfy where you were right then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little bit\u201d grinned the Snorlax, looking past her overflowing cleavage and humongous stomach at the four emptied, bare trees around her. \"But I could go for seconds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, you began to laugh. Good Arceus does this women have an appetite! If she kept eating like this, she\u2019d be even bigger then she is now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe later.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the past, the forest was savage and untamed. Predators ruled the wilderness, and everybody fought for themselves. Only the strongest survived. All of that changed when the village of Lake Church was established. Lake Church was originally thought of as a watering hole, where predators and prey, friends and enemies, could all come to be in harmony, and help each other through the toughest winters. Eventually, a sense of community bloomed from the plaza, and spread through the entire forest. Now, everybody knows everybody else, and everybody tries to help one another and live in peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had never been here. Your parents told you about, but they never let you lave the tree. They always said that the world was always looking for ways to take advantage of you, even if it was disguised with civilized behavior and niceness. You felt so out of place here, like a visitor from a different world. You were a wild Eevee raised in a tree, this was a town!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the place, Ms. Snorlax?\" You asked the behemoth women. She was carrying you atop her left shoulder as she strolled into the town. To your surprise, none of the locals seemed to be surprised by the sight of her. Sure, there were some sideways glances and the occasional reaction to the ground shaking, but other then that, everyone seemed to ignore the big Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the village of Lake Church, little sweetie.\" The Snorlax answered, although you could tell a little less cheerily then before. The plaza was built up from an empty field by the forest\u2019s largest lake. The buildings were mostly big wooden structures, painted to resemble various Pokemon. \"If i'm being honest handsome, I kinda hate it here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All these Pokemon of all kinds with big smiles on their faces, content with their boring, peaceful lives\u2026I don't understand them at all. Every time I pass through this place, I always see Pokemon dancing, singing, and being merry, as if every day they lived was cause for celebration\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were taken back in surprise. This response was so out of character for the seemingly nice Snorlax. You were beginning to wonder weather or not this was the same Snorlax that agreed to help you find your parents. \"What's wrong with Pokemon being happy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there's nothing wrong with it at all.~\" The Snorlax licked her lips stealthily over some of the pedestrians walking around. \"It's just so...unnatural. Friends and helping people is nice and all, but when it comes down to the itty bitty bits, were all just wild Pokemon on the inside. And the golden rule for the wild is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...It's eat or be eaten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a shiver go down your spine as she said that. So the Snorlax DID have a darkside. Although...at least she was well in control of it. Against, your better judgement, you still felt safe around her. She still caries an aura of warmth and kindness, even if she wasn't above eating people. A particular smell caught your attention, however. Looking through the street, you see a curiously Kangaskhan shaped building with big red letters that spelled \"CAFE\" on a white square sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-maybe we could go to the Cafe to ask some questions over there.\" You politely suggested. To your surprise, you found that the Snorlax was already walking over towards the building. \"Oh, of course handsome.\" She kicked your face with her fat, pink tongue. You blushed involuntarily as you wiped some saliva off your fur. \"Right after a little snack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stifled a sigh as she said the lats part. You were going to have to get used to the Snorlax's appetite. It was expected of her, yes, but it was still kind off annoying that you were going to have all these breaks in between your search for your parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Hey, honey,\u201d the kangaskhan smiled as the Snorlax sat down an especially wide chair that seemed to be made just for her. It creaked under her weight, but by some force of Arceus or black magic, it stayed up. \"Oh, and who's this little cutie?\" She said as she eyed you sitting on her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-h-hi...\" you introduced yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Eevee. I found the poor little thing all alone in the forest. He got separated from his parents and we're here in town to to find some leads about where they might be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you poor thing!\" The Kangaskhan gasped, looking aghast. You didn't understand why your parent awareness you about other Pokemon. So far everyone was acting awfully nice to you. \"How have you been holding up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s been\u2026 hard,\u201d you frown.  \u201cBut I\u2019ve been staying together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, good. Well, I bet a belly full of mama\u2019s delicious home cooking would really cheer you up,\u201d the kangaskhan smiled. \u201cAnd for you?\" She gestured to the Snorlax \"Everything\u2019s on the house. Eat all you want!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN'awwww! Thanks, kangaskhan,\u201d The Snorlax grinned. She had been preparing to just pay for it, but this all-you-can eat arrangement serves her just fine. \"You do know I'm gonna eat evreything, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course.\" The kangaskhan nodded. \"But, I can afford one bad day. Besides, I owe you for saving my baby last month. If it wasn't for you, he would've been pudge on that Charizard right about now.\" The kindly chef brings out a small plate of food fro you to chow down on. You realize that you have;t had any breakfast yet. You would have had some of those berries earlier, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hop down from the Snorlax's shoulder gracefully and began to chow down eagerly on the food, uttering a rushed thank you between gulps. She smiles as you chow down on the delicious food. The Snorlax began to devour on berry salads and apricorn stews, the food practically flying down her throat. Every bite she took only seemed to make her hungrier, bu the patrons were actually pretty blaze about the whole thing as she swallowed multiple full meals in seconds. Her throat could stretch wide with ease, her powerful stomach able to easily handle the feast she was loading it with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the Snorlax could run through the Cafe's entire daily stock...</span></div></div>",

You tapped into your psychic powers, and felt a strong familial presence on it. Your parents must've been close to this recently. The area around the bush seemed safe, so the next place you figured they could've been taken to was up the trail. And thus, the hike began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you traveled up it, you began to feel a little cold. The top of the mountain was covered in snow. You shivered and felt the gown-like extension of your fur dragging on the snow. You tried to sense them, but there was some presence messing with your abilities. It's like there are too many ghosts nearby, interfering with your sensing powers. You had to do this manually. As you traveled, you began to hear a soft singing on a snowy trail shooting off of your current trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded nice, almost like your mother. However, you had no way of knowing if it was safe or not. You've heard your parents mention about something called a Froslass, a ghostly Pok\u00e9mon hanging out in the snow that likes to lure their victims, freeze them, and then take them home to do whatever they wanted to them. You feared that the singing belonged to one of those, but it might be one of your only leads for a while.

More importantly, it began to sound less mysterious, and more like your mom. Maybe your fear made you mistake the singing for someone you didn't recognize. It's probably your only chance of finding your parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trekked through the snow, your arms wrapped round yourself to try and keep warm. As you kept walking, the sound of your mother's song sounded like it was surrounding you, yet you could tell which way it was coming from. It almost felt like her song was trying to hug you. It felt nice and, sorta warm. Maybe you were wrong to think they were in trouble. Maybe they found some better food higher up the mountain. Eventually, you began to see a faint outline of someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were hard to see, being all white against the snow, but you could definitely see something floating before you. In fact, they seemed to be approaching you. They looked sorta like a skull with a long, ghostly tail and two thin arms. Around the tail, you saw what looked like a red ribbon. Under the skull-like head, you saw purple flesh and cyan eyes with yellow sclera. You now realized you've been tricked as the strange Pok\u00e9mon stops signing. She must've been a Froslass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe floated towards you, her tai and flaps on her arms flowing elegantly as she moved. You also noticed that she moved frighteningly fast. You held up your arms in front of you, fearful, to try and block whatever attack was incoming. However, instead she flew around you and right behind you in the blink of an eye. Her speed whipped up specks of snow with her speed, creating a thin fog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't seen your kind around here,\" she said. \"What brings you up hear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm just looking for my parents,\" you said while leaping away from her. \"I must've made a wrong move, so I'll just head out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's so cold up here, you won't survive,\" she said. \"I've set up a shelter nearby, I can keep you there. Then I'll find your parents, and bring them back to you.\" As she spoke, she floated towards you more, and you backed away. Unfortunately, you were being moved away from the mountain trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'll be fine. I just need to get back to the trail, so if you could just move aside-\" you started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense! I just want to help you out,\" she said. She then held out a hand, and beckoned for you to grab it. \"Just take my hand, and I'll bring you to my shelter.\"</span></div></div>",

She was probably about four times your size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\"><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>\u201cI heard something over here! Weren\u2019t you known as the most silent Pokemon in this forest? You\u2019ve really lost your touch, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</b></font></span> The scolipede cackled, in a booming, deep voice, taunting the hiding ninetales. You don\u2019t even blink as the scolipede walks by, the sounds of her heavy steps ringing in your ears. The ninetales on top of you had gone completely still, like a statue. You were pretty sure she wasn\u2019t even breathing. <font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><span class=\"cmagenta\"><b>\u201cYou\u2019re getting old, little fox. Can\u2019t hide like you used to. You\u2019ll slip up eventually...\u201d</b></span></font> Figuring the ninetales would never stay in one place for too long, the scolipede continued through the wilderness, disappearing back into the overgrowth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ninetales stays hidden with you, remaining completely still, able to easily judge the scolipede\u2019s distance with her acute sense of hearing. You find it slightly awkward to be pressed up so close against her for so long, but still, you try to keep quiet. Eventually, she seems certain that the scolipede had left, and sits up. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cHmph,\u201d</b></span> she says, in a low, frustrated tone as she climbs off you. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cWord of advice, kid. Out in the wild, there\u2019s no reason to ever be so damn <i>loud</i>.\u201d</b></span> Just like that, she pads away, as if nothing had ever happened\u2026 leaving you there, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stand on wobbly legs, it occurs to you that the ninetales had probably just saved your life. You wished she would stick around to explain, but it seemed she had places to be. You sighed, returning to your task of tracking down your parents\u2026 only to realize that their scent led you in exactly the same direction the ninetales was walking. You investigated, only to find a small dirt path winding through the woods. Your parent\u2019s pawprints were still evident in the mud. They\u2019d been through here recently. Seems like you and the ninetales were heading the same way after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk down the path, trekking behind the ninetales, sniffing the air and keeping an eye out for pawprints, trying to make it obvious you\u2019re not just following her. Unfortunately, you fail. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cWhy are you following me?\u201d</b></span> She asks, not even bothering to look over her shoulder at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUh\u2026 w-we\u2019re actually heading in the same direction...\u201d</b>You stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201c... sure,\u201d</b></span> she replied, her tone unreadable. The two of you walk in silence for a while, with you growing increasingly embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYeeaah\u2026\u201d</b> You say uncomfortably, staring at the ground. You were still bursting with adrenaline after the brush with the scolipede, and desperately wanted to talk about it with someone. You had never been so close to a hostile  predator, after all. Unfortunately, you had no friends, and your parents were nowhere to be found, so this random ninetales was the only Pokemon you could discuss it with. <b>\u201cSo, uh, heh, that whole thing was pretty intense, right? What was that all about?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cWhy are you asking?\u201d</b></span> She asks, still hardly acknowledging your presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cJust\u2026 m-making conversation,\u201d</b> you say, a little taken back by the question. It seems she wasn\u2019t a big fan of talking, but you were still feeling desperate to save face. <b>\u201cI mean, heh, I haven\u2019t really talked to many Pokemon before. Besides my folks.\u201d</b> You chuckle awkwardly, your face flushed. <b>\u201cWho I\u2019m\u2026 sort of looking for. You haven\u2019t happened to see a Zoroark around here, have you?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cNo,\u201d</b></span> she replied, simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cAh,\u201d</b> you nodded, and the two of you walked silently for a few minutes more. The ninetales was kind of attractive, you noticed, in a rugged, creepy sort of way. It didn\u2019t help that she was so tall you were about eye-level with her shapely ass, which swayed in front of your face as she walked, beneath her gorgeous tails. You tried not to stare. <b>\u201cSo\u2026 is that a blindfold you\u2019re wearing?\u201d</b> You ask, trying to divert your attention to something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cYes,\u201d</b></span> she said, giving brief, one-word answers, as if she doesn\u2019t want to spare the energy to even speak with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cHow do you see?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201c... I don\u2019t,\u201d</b></span> she replied. It was kind of a dumb question, you suppose, but it was apparently dumb enough for the ninetales to stop in her tracks completely. She turned to face you, and you realize you\u2019ve probably just been pissing her off this entire time. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cYou\u2019re not very bright, are you?\u201d</b></span> She growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUh... I guess not,\u201d</b> you reply, backing away as she loomed over you. <b>\u201cI mean\u2026 this is kind of my first day out here, so I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m doing\u2026\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands there for a few moments. You\u2019d almost think she was staring at you, if it wasn\u2019t for the blindfold. Eventually, she sighed, letting her anger and frustration melt away. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cListen, kid. I\u2019ve pissed off some seriously bad Pokemon, so forgive me if I\u2019m a little paranoid,\u201d</b></span> she said, trying her best to act rational. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cBut if you\u2019re telling the truth, your parents are probably in the next town, just a few miles up. Once we get there, I want you to buzz off, okay? I don\u2019t want to see you around me again.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cT-there\u2019s a\u2026?\u201d</b> You had no idea there was a town nearby. Your father told you there was only empty wilderness for miles and miles around here. Then again, he wasn\u2019t a very reliable source. Deciding not to question her further, you nod. <b>\u201cOkay.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cAlright. You walk in front,\u201d</b></span> she says, standing there, leaving you to reluctantly walk ahead. You couldn\u2019t hear her, though, so after a while you were afraid she might\u2019ve just ditched you -- but when you eventually  glanced over your shoulder, sure enough, she was there. Her footsteps simply didn\u2019t make a sound. Her movements were almost eerily quiet, the ninetales practically gliding along the ground with an almost robotic rhythm. She definitely lived up to her reputation. You tried to pretend she wasn\u2019t even there, opting to just stare at the ground and contemplate the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the two of you came upon a...</span></div></div>",

You stood over the town in awe, inspired by the skilled architecture, and the sight of dozens of strange Pokemon going about their daily lives. As you walked, you passed by a sign welcoming you to Norberry Village. <b>\u201cWhoa\u2026\u201d</b> You breathe as the two of you stop for a moment on the edge of town. <b>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen so many Pokemon in one place before.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201c... how long have you lived around here, again?\u201d</b></span> She asked, in a deadpan tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUh\u2026 well, my entire life, I guess,\u201d</b> you shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cOh? And yet you weren\u2019t aware there was an entire village just down the road?\u201d</b></span> She asked. Judging by her tone, it was obvious she thought she had caught you in a lie. You stutter breathlessly, trying to explain yourself, but you just can\u2019t find the words. She sits there in haunting silence for a while, before sighing.  <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cWhatever. Go ahead and take a hike, kid. You better hope we don\u2019t see eachother around.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cO-okay,\u201d</b> you stutter as she stands and begins to stalk away. <b>\u201cIt was nice to meet you!\u201d</b> You watched the beautiful fox disappear into the crowd waiting until you were sure she was gone before hurriedly wandering in the opposite direction. You were used to living alone in the wilderness, so the sights and sounds of the small village were incredible to you. You try excitedly to ask the various strange Pokemon walking the streets about your parents, but they all seemed to be in a hurry for some reason. A few, however, point you towards the office of the village chief, so you decide to head there first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step inside the giant, cozy tent, which was lit up with an array of beautiful candles and lanterns. Your nostrils were immediately filled with the scent of burning incense. Sitting on a tarp on the other side of the tent was a massive goodra, almost the size of the scolipede you ran into earlier. You assumed this was the village chief. She smiled brightly when she saw you walk in. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you just the cutest little thing!\u201d</b></span> She says, using her long neck to bring her head down to eye-level. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cWhat\u2019s got you so excited, little guy?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cThis town\u2026 it\u2019s amazing!\u201d</b> You smile, impressed by both the beauty of the tent and the sheer size of the village chief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cHeh! I\u2019m glad you\u2019re settling in well,\u201d</b></span> the goodra giggles. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cWe don\u2019t get many absols around here. You know, when I saw you coming, I mistook you for someone else. Does the name \u2018Lydia\u2019 ring any bells?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cY-yes! Lydia is my mother!\u201d</b> You perk up immediately. <b>\u201cHave you seen her?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cOh, really? They never mentioned you,\u201d</b></span> she said, rubbing her chin. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cWell, the two of them passed through here just this morning. Said they were heading to Shipton City.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cShipton City?\u201d</b> You tilted your head. <b>\u201cWhere\u2019s that?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cDue east from here. Just look for the eastward route,\u201d</b></span> she explained. In your excitement, you were just about to hop to your feet and sprint off, but she interrupted you. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cBut you can\u2019t go wandering around after dark, even if you are Gunnar\u2019s son. You should stay in our inn for the night, just to be safe.\u201d</b></span> She gives you directions to the local inn, as well as instructions on how to book a place to stay for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cT-thank you so much!\u201d</b> You said graciously as you rushed out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u2504\u2504\u2504</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk into the main lobby of the inn, only to freeze in place when you hear the ninetale\u2019s voice. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious!\u201d</b></span> Sure enough, there she was; that same unmistakable ninetales, yelling angrily at the Pokemon at the front desk. You were about to leave before she saw you, until you noticed her plight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cSorry, ma\u2019am, but our inn is for locals only. We don\u2019t need any wild Pokemon scaring the other patrons,\u201d</b></span> the grumpig that ran the inn said. <span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cYou know, Shipton city is just down the road\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cThat\u2019s miles away!\u201d</b></span> She yelled, her voice alternating between anger and desperation. She looked tense as she loomed over the grumpig, baring her teeth. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cI can\u2019t be out in the wilderness at night. I\u2026 <i>need</i> somewhere to stay.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cYou\u2019re not planning on making this violent, are you?\u201d</b></span> The grumpig calmly raised a brow, noticing that the ninetales was on the edge of attacking. A few other Pokemon from around town were standing around the lobby, looking ready to pounce on her if she tried anything. Seeing this, the defeated ninetales forced herself to calm down, backing away from the grumpig. <span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cListen. Unless you\u2019re friends with any locals, I recommend you just turn tail and--\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201c<i>I\u2019m</i> a local!\u201d</b> You announce excitedly, walking up to the front desk. The ninetales shivered in surprise when she heard your voice once again, but remained motionless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cOh? Are you?\u201d</b></span> He looked at you incredulously. <span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve seen you around town\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cW-well, maybe you\u2019ve seen my parents,\u201d</b> you insist, nervously. <b>\u201cA zoroark and an absol?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cOh? You\u2019re the son of Gunnar?\u201d</b></span> He raised a brow, surprised. <span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cWell, then! We would be happy to have such an esteemed guest.\u201d</b></span> He raised a hand, gesturing to the motionless woman. <span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cThis, uh\u2026 Ninetales. Is she a friend of yours?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUh\u2026 yep. She sure is,\u201d</b> you nod immediately, seizing the opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cWell, why didn\u2019t you just say so?\u201d</b></span> The grumpig teased the ninetales, who remained completely still, seemingly meditating to relieve her anger. You and the grumpig discuss the inn while she meditates, going over your accommodations for the night. Apparently, the \u2018inn\u2019 allows locals to just sleep here for free, presumably to keep the village\u2019s population from being picked off by wild predators in the night.  <span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cYou two are in the hut with the red roof. Try not to make too much noise!\u201d</b></span> Once that was all settled, the ninetales stands up as if springing back to life. She makes a move for the door, and you nervously follow after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cCan\u2019t believe this shit\u2026\u201d</b></span> She muttered quietly to herself as she padded silently out the door. You couch awkwardly as the two of you walked towards the huts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cSo, hey, uh\u2026 I know you said you didn\u2019t want me around,\u201d</b> you explain. <b>\u201cBut you looked like you needed help, y\u2019know?\u201d</b> You hoped she would forgive you, but instead, she remained just as silent as ever. Eventually, the two of you come across a big adobe hut, reinforced with wooden beams, with a big red thatched roof. <b>\u201cWelp\u2026 this is it, I guess.\u201d</b> You said, unlocking the big, wooden door and taking a step inside. The interior of the hut was fairly plain; a nest on one end, a barrel bathtub on the other, and little to no furniture inbetween. There were no windows whatsoever, further emphasizing that the purpose of the hut was simple protection against the elements. The ninetales pads silently over to the nest when you walked in, seemingly ignoring you completely. Her silence unnerves you. Had you pissed off one of the first Pokemon you\u2019ve ever met? <b>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 sorry for bothering you. I wasn\u2019t following you, honest! I just\u2026 sort of ended up at the inn\u2026\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the genuine remorse in your voice, the ninetales sighs loudly. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cThat whole thing wasn\u2019t your fault\u2026\u201d</b></span> She says over her shoulder. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cThanks for helping out. Don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done if you hadn\u2019t shown up.\u201d</b></span> You perked up when she thanked you. Perhaps the two of you could be friends after all. The ninetales curiously prodded the soft nest with a paw. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cSo, tell me. Do we really only have one bed in here?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were confused by her question for a moment, until you remembered that, of course, she was blind. <b>\u201cUh, yep,\u201d</b> you answered, awkwardly. <b>\u201cI\u2026 could just sleep on the floor, if you want.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cHeh.

She lifted one paw over your shoulder as she got down to brass tacks. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cLike I said, I\u2019ve got some pretty bad Pokemon after me, so I can\u2019t really trust anyone.\u201d</b></span> She muttered bitterly. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cI know you probably have good intentions and all, but the problem is, how can I be sure you\u2019re not working for \u2018em?

You were baffled, but ultimately, curious what this \u2018trust exercise\u2019 could be. <b>\u201cLike what?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cHear me out. I can\u2019t just sleep while you\u2019re out here in the open. I\u2019d be vulnerable,\u201d</b></span> she explained, slowly, as if she was picking her every word very carefully. This had the side effect of making her explanation sound\u2026 unnatural, like she wasn\u2019t being genuine. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cSo I would appreciate it, as a gesture of goodwill, if you would spend the night\u2026 locked away some place safe.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought your attention down to her  stomach, and you remember something. You had heard plenty of tales of savage predators swallowing down their helpless prey\u2026 but you\u2019d also heard of Pokemon temporarily storing the ones they love inside them, just to keep them safe. <b>\u201c... you don\u2019t mean\u2026?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cYes. Not for very long; just until tomorrow morning,\u201d</b></span> she said, patting her belly comfortably, <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cand I\u2019ve done this plenty of times. I can guarantee you\u2019d be completely unharmed,\u201d</b></span> she points to the door of the hut, <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cbut if you don\u2019t trust me, you can just leave. I won\u2019t stop you.\u201d</b></span> You noticed something while briefly glancing at the door; it was locked. The Ninetales had no intention of actually letting you walk out of here. She was testing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cCan I\u2026 take a moment to think about this?\u201d</b> You ask, feeling lightheaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cTake as long as you need,\u201d</b></span> she nods, letting you lean up against her furry belly like a soft pillow as you contemplated the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you tried to just walk out, would she assume you were some kind of spy, heading out to inform the others of her location? Leaving was a dangerous option, but letting the fox do whatever she pleases was dangerous, too. She was a wild Pokemon, after all. You never knew if this was all some sort of trick to get a midnight snack. You at least attempted to talk your way out of this. <b>\u201cI mean\u2026 I-I\u2019m not here to hurt you or a-anything\u2026\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cI know. I just want you to prove it to me,\u201d</b></span> she says reassuringly, licking over your head a few times while you contemplating, covering your forehead with saliva. Maybe she was planning on eating and digesting you no matter what you did. Or maybe\u2026 she really was telling the truth. I mean, if she was just going to digest you, she would\u2019ve pounced on you the moment the two of you were alone. Then again, if she was telling the truth, why did she lock the door when you weren\u2019t looking? As you thought up all the possibilities, you determined that the best response was to just\u2026 obey the fox, and hope she has mercy on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cO-okay\u2026 if it doesn\u2019t hurt,\u201d</b> you nod, finally managing to force the words out of your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cThank you, absol.

Before you could even process what was happening, your entire head was pressed into her gaping maw, your cheek resting on her tongue as you stared, wide-eyed, down her cavernous throat. She seemed to struggling to position your horn in a way that would fit it down her throat, giving you some time to think. You ultimately just froze up, due to the same instincts that cause a cub to freeze up when they\u2019re lifted by the scruff; you know you\u2019d hurt yourself if you tried to escape now, so all you could do was subject yourself to the ninetales\u2019 will. Eventually, your horn was squeezed into her throat at an odd angle, rendering its sharp point harmless. The hard part was over. All that was left was working you down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she said she had done this before, she definitely wasn\u2019t kidding. She seemed to work with almost robotic efficiency, falling into a pattern of repeatedly repositioning, taking a big gulp, and then repositioning again. Each swallow took a few inches of your body into her throat. It wasn\u2019t long before your head had created a sizeable bulge in her neck, and the muscles of her throat squeezed down and undulated around it. Her throat felt like there was a conveyer belt wrapped tightly around your head, relentlessly pulling you in one direction -- down towards the vixen\u2019s belly. She couldn\u2019t breathe while your body was blocking her throat, so she had to act fast. It didn\u2019t take an especially long time for your entire upper body to be reduced to an immense bulge in her neck, your head having already disappeared between her muscular shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were bombarded by so many sensations as you were squeezed down her throat, it was almost surreal. You were even beginning to feel a little excited. Your felt your shaft poking out of your sheathe, though luckily, she doesn\u2019t seem to notice as it glides over her tongue, or at least she acts like she doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s not like you were a fan of the idea of getting eaten or anything. It was just the sensation of being literally inside of someone, especially someone as exotic and beautiful as the ninetales. You admired her body on the outside, but on the inside, you were given a new perspective entirely -- you could feel the athletic vixen\u2019s powerful muscles squeezing around you, you could hear her calm breathing and the gentle, rhythmic beating of her heart. You had simply never felt this level of understand and connection with another Pokemon before. It felt like the ultimate display of intimacy; like she was being completely honest about her body, by trusting you to enter it completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she closed her mouth around your hind paws. Every single inch of your body was now shrouded in darkness, and surrounded by sweltering moisture and incredible heat. You were completely inside her, now, your entire life at the mercy of the vixen\u2019s gorgeous, powerful body. At the same moment, your head was pressed into a large sac that you assumed was her stomach. It was identical, in many ways, to her throat; the only difference being that it was much roomier, and the walls and bottom were soaked with a myriad of strange liquids. With one final gulp, you\u2019re pulled inside her stomach completely, stretching it to its limits. Now that the obstruction in her throat had finally cleared, the ninetales was finally able to speak. After gasping for air for a few moments, she gasped as she felt you immediately start wriggling around inside her. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cOh! Oh! Settle down in there, absol\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moaned loudly, feeling you squirm within her sensitive belly before she was prepared. Thinking you were hurting here, you stopped your wriggling for a moment, simply curling up inside of her. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cThere you go. That\u2019s it. See? It\u2019s not so bad,\u201d</b></span> she reassures you in an almost motherly sort of tone. She rubs her belly contentedly, and you\u2019re delighted by the realization that you can feel her paws from the inside. You try to call out to her, but your voice doesn\u2019t seem to escape the thick walls. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cAre you trying to say something? I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not going to be able to hear you until I let you out in the morning.\u201d</b></span> You were a little startled by this knowledge. What if something went wrong? If she couldn\u2019t hear you shouting, would she even notice before it was too late? <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cJust try to get comfortable in there. Get some rest. I\u2019ll be seeing you tomorrow.\u201d</b></span> You sighed. She was right. No point in worrying about it now. You were past the point of no return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComforted by the weight in her gut, the ninetales went into a deep feed coma within minutes\u2026 but even after a half hour passed, you definitely couldn\u2019t fall asleep. Your manhood had grown painfully hard, and it didn\u2019t seem like it would be calming down anytime soon. Would it\u2026 really be right to just paw yourself off while you\u2019re inside the vixen\u2019s body? She was asleep, so it\u2019s not like she\u2019s consenting to such a thing\u2026 but on the other hand, if she ate you, she couldn\u2019t really care what you do while you\u2019re inside her belly, right? Eventually unable to resist temptation any longer, you bring your forepaws down around your shaft on both sides, and gently slide them up and down the pink flesh painfully slowly, trying not to rouse the fox for her slumber. You just wanted to get this over with, so you could get some sleep. At least, that\u2019s what you tell yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time passed, the ninetale\u2019s stomach slowly began to contract around her \u2018prisoner\u2019, the walls squeezing in tighter and tighter around you. You weren\u2019t even concerned by this, too distracted by your own pleasure. Just feeling your shaft brush up against the walls of the ninetale\u2019s stomach for a moment sent shivers down your spine. You can\u2019t help but change things up a bit; using your forepaws to press your shaft against the soft, malleable walls of her stomach, before grinding in earnest. The feeling was extraordinary, much better than anything you could do with your own paws. Your gasps and squeaks were drowned out by the churning and gurgling of the ninetale\u2019s stomach as it squeezed even tighter around you. On the outside, your shaft created a prominent bulge in the side of the vixen\u2019s distended belly as you eagerly humped the interior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take very long for the soft, wet walls to push you over the edge. Your body tensed up as you were hit by the greatest climax you\u2019ve experienced in your life, your load fading away among the assortment of other gastric juices already bearing down on you. You lean back in her stomach, panting as your satisfied manhood retreats back into your sheathe. Now that you\u2019re finally thinking straight, you begin to feel a little concerned. Was it\u2026 supposed to be this tight in here? It used to be downright roomy, but by now you could hardly move a muscle, and her belly was only contracting around you more and more with no sign of stopping. On the outside, her big, round belly had contracted into a very clear imprint of your body, the furry flesh moving and undulated as your squirmed around with what little wriggle room you had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a puddle of gastric acid in a pool at the bottom of her stomach, you noticed. It was about half an inch deep, and barely even tingled; still, it was a concerning sight. Being digested never seemed like an especially pleasant fate. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t like there was anything you could do about it now. You could only drift off to sleep, and trust that the ninetales was going to keep her promise\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you survive the night?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That night, you dreamt you were curled up in a giant bubble of air, floating aimlessly through an endless, clear, beautiful blue ocean. You dreamt you were back in the womb, tucked away far away from the horrors and violence of the outside world. You dreamt that you and the ninetales were adrift in an endless field of flowers, and the two of you made love. You dreamt all sorts of wonderful things, and for the first night in years, you were truly at peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dreams evoked such joy that you were genuinely disappointed when a jostling roused you from your slumber. You were confused, for a moment, when you first woke up and found yourself in a dark, tight chamber, but then you remembered the events of the previous night. It was almost surreal to actually wake up again, when a part of you was certain that you were doomed. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cSorry to interrupt, sleepyhead. I would gladly let you lounge around in there all day, but it\u2019s a little dangerous to stay in there for too long,\u201d</b></span> you heard her beautiful voice emanate through the soft walls, <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cso I\u2019m going to cough you up now, okay? So\u2026 get ready.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take some time to get your bearings, as you return from one of the deepest, most refreshing rests you\u2019ve ever had. You must\u2019ve been sleeping for over a dozen hours, and you\u2019re still tingling with joy over all the dreams you had. In fact, looking down, it seems you may have enjoyed them a little too much. Your manhood was unsheathed and at attention once again, even though you had just woken up seconds ago. You were amused by this at first, for a moment, until you remembered that the ninetales was just about to cough you up! You try to hold yourself in place, but it\u2019s futile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dry heaves, and you feel like your tiny little prison within her is turned inside out all at once. Suddenly, the unrelenting muscles of her throat were squeezed around your body again, this time pulling you up instead of down. She hacked and coughed as you proceeded up her neck. You gasped out when you realized the soft walls of her throat were pressed so incredibly tight against your shaft, too, further exacerbating your little problem. It takes a bit of your willpower to resist just cumming right then and there, while you were a simple bulge in the vixen\u2019s throat. Eventually, your snout enters her maw, and you were finally able to look at the outside world once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe view from the back of her throat was incredible, but unfortunately, it didn\u2019t last long. With a final, nauseating lurch, the rest of your body is forced from the ninetail\u2019s throat all in one movement. You were quite literally ejected onto the cold, hard wooden floor, in a big puddle of saliva and sizzling gastric acid. You were soaked to the bone with various juices of all imaginable stenches and viscosities, but you were more concerned with your morning wood, until you remembered\u2026 her blindfold! Of course she wasn\u2019t going to notice your little situation. You didn\u2019t even bother to try hiding it as you pulled yourself to your feet, shaking off the liquids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ninetails was coughing and sputtering, her throat severely sore from the agonizing process of spitting you out. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cUgh! Hurts a lot more comin\u2019 up than going down\u2026\u201d</b></span> She eventually said, composing herself. She flinches when you shake yourself dry. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cHm. You smell like you could probably use a good shower.\u201d</b></span> Compared to how filthy she was yesterday, he fur was pristine today, so she must\u2019ve taken a shower while you were inside her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cA\u2026 shower?\u201d</b> You said, only to cringe when a bit of pre dripped onto the floor. <b>\u201cY-yes! A shower! Okay!\u201d</b> You hurried to turn on the primitive showerhead -- a faucet suspended above a grate, distributing the water evenly over those below -- and sat beneath it, shivering in the cold. You simply rinse for a while, watching the ninetails as she gets ready for the coming day, and, once you were convinced she wasn\u2019t listening, you gently wrap your paws around both sides of your shaft once again. You just wanted to get this out of your system as quickly as possible -- which was difficult, since you had to stroke your paws up and down unbearably slowly to avoid alerting the vixen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComfortable in the knowledge that she couldn\u2019t see you, you squeeze your eyes shut, trying to pretend that the vixen wasn\u2019t just a few feet away while you were pawing yourself off. Unfortunately, she didn\u2019t make it very easy for you. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cWell, now I know I can trust you, at least,\u201d</b></span> she said over her shoulder, making you tense up at the sound of her voice. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cYou\u2019re definitely not one of Marden\u2019s goons. They definitely would not have the balls to agree to that little \u2018trust exercise\u2019.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYeah,\u201d</b> is the only thing you said aloud. <i>Please stop talking, please stop talking, please stop talking,</i> was what you were actually thinking in your head. You didn\u2019t understand anything she was saying, but you decide not to question it till after you\u2019re finished with your \u2018shower\u2019. You peek one of your eyes open to keep tabs on what the ninetales is doing, only to realize she was facing the other way, bent over as she reorganizes the nest. Your heart leaps in your chest as you suddenly get an extraordinary view of her firm but still quite rounded ass, and while you turn away as fast as you could, the image was seared into your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike it or not, the ninetales was one of the most attractive Pokemon you\u2019ve ever met. It didn\u2019t hurt that she was one of the only Pokemon you\u2019ve ever really befriended, after eighteen years of utter isolation in the wilderness had left you starved for companionship. Her scars may be disturbing to most Pokemon, but in your eyes, they only made you admire her more. Of course, you couldn\u2019t fantasize about <i>her</i>. You knew her! What kind of disrespect would that be? You try to imagine a random lopunny or liepard instead, but still, your thoughts always drifted back to the ninetales. Especially to that one dream you had the night before. You couldn\u2019t remember all the details of that dream, but you remembered that her blindfold was taken off to reveal her beautiful, perfect blue eyes, and you definitely remembered the look of love and joy in those eyes as you mounted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took quite a while, but even at this pace, you were so horny that you were finally able to bring yourself to climax all along the floor of the makeshift shower, just a couple yards away from the oblivious vixen. Your load blended in with the water and filtered down the drain as you sat there, holding your breath, trying not to make a sound even as your body was overloaded with the sensation. Eventually, you were resting your eyes while leaning against the back wall of the shower, all of your energy and enthusiasm gone, with only your shame remaining. You snicker as your manhood slips slowly back into your sheathe. You thought to yourself that <i>that\u2019s</i> all this was -- taking care of a basic, biological necessity. Nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, you\u2019d been in the shower for so long, the water alone had rinsed you clean completely. With all that out of the way, you were ready to start your morning for real. You and the ninetales silently sat around for a breakfast of tanga berries, and by the time it was finished, you were right back to your old self. <b>\u201cSooo, uh\u2026\u201d</b> You ask awkwardly, interrupting her meditation. <b>\u201cI forgot to ask, but\u2026 who\u2019s Marden?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs at the question. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cSome asshole kommo-o,\u201d</b></span> she growled, pointing at her blindfold. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cAll you need to know is that he did <i>this</i> to me. And now he wants me dead.\u201d</b></span> You were now more curious than ever to see what was under that blindfold. Did she have some kind of disfiguring injury? You figure it would be rude to ask, though, so you try not be nosy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cHm\u2026\u201d</b> You said, unable to come up with an appropriate response. You decide to just change the subject. <b>\u201cSo, where are you heading to, next?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cI have some <i>business</i> to attend to in Shipton city.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cReally?\u201d</b> Your ears perk up, and you smile. <b>\u201cI\u2019m heading there too! My parents are probably there. Maybe we could travel together\u2026 y\u2019know, keep each other company? Now that you trust me an' all...\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked in your general direction for a while, her expression unreadable, before smiling a big, toothy grin. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cAlright,\u201d</b></span> she says, <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cbut if you want to travel with me, I\u2019m going to need to teach you a thing or two about combat\u2026\u201d</b></span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two of you capped off your visit to Norberry with a trip to the local tavern. Compared to the grumpig you two met earlier, the rest of the citizens of the village seemed surprisingly friendly, and seemed eager to entertain their guests. You and the ninetales enjoyed some delicious berry juice as an elderly unfezant regaled you with fascinating tales of her past adventures, and while a hilarious sandslash fellow showed off his juggling skills with some berries, and while the slowbro at the counter demonstrated the process behind some of his delicious recipes. In just a couple of hours of hanging out at the tavern, you were surrounded by more friendly Pokemon than you\u2019ve ever met before today. Even the goodra was there, taking a break from her duties to chat with her village\u2019s citizens. You noticed something, though; at one point, the ninetales seemed to be whispering something in the goodra\u2019s ear. The goodra looked outraged, and nodded dutifully, before immediately trudging out of the tavern towards the inn. You didn\u2019t know what that was all about, but you couldn\u2019t be bothered to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was fun, but eventually, it was time for you both to leave. You had to get to Shipton by sundown, after all. The two of you stumbled out of the gates of the tavern with smiles on your faces, still amused by the antics of the locals. You were still just winding down while you made your way over to the eastward route. <b>\u201cSo, what are you heading to Shipton city for?\u201d</b> You ask, realizing you haven\u2019t had much of a chance to talk with the ninetales one-on-one yet today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cMarden\u2019s goons practically runs the streets there. I figure I should take the fight straight to them.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cSounds like\u2026 a pretty dangerous plan,\u201d</b> you comment. You don\u2019t want to be judgemental or anything, but if they have the whole city under their control, there must be a small army of them. <b>\u201cI mean, can you really take them all on by yourself?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cNo, but I can definitely pick \u2018em off one by one. In a big city like that, there are plenty of places to hide,\u201d</b></span> she said, but seemed to want to change the subject. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cHow about you? Tryin\u2019 to reunite with your parents, right?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cReunite? Nah. I just want to figure out what the hell they were thinking when they ditched me,\u201d</b> you laugh, awkwardly, feeling kind of pathetic when you heard the words from your own mouth. <b>\u201cBastards ain\u2019t gettin\u2019 rid of me that easy!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cOooh! I like your spunk!\u201d</b></span> She laughed along, bumping you in the side. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cTravellin\u2019 for miles and miles just to flip off your folks. I like it.\u201d</b></span> She stopped suddenly when you walked by the inn. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cWell, before we head out, there\u2019s one last thing I wanna check out.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cAlright, lead the way,\u201d</b> you nodded, following the ninetales back up the hill to the inn. When you got there, the inn lobby was\u2026 exactly the same. The only thing of interest was that goodra was there, seemingly chatting with the grumpig at the front desk. <b>\u201c... huh. Is this what you wanted to see?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cQuiet!\u201d</b></span> She whispered, urgently. You went silent for a while, straining your ears, only to realize that the goodra and the grumpig were arguing passionately over something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cI\u2019ve told you to <i>cut</i> the \u2018locals only\u2019 policy,\u201d</b></span> the chieftain was saying calmly, looming tall over the defiant grumpig. There was anger in her voice, but it was\u2026 restrained, as if she was simply disappointed. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cOur village is supposed to be open to <i>all</i> Pokemon!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cThe citizens of Norberry deserve to feel <i>safe</i>!\u201d</b></span> The grumpig, on the other hand, was shouting angrily at the top of his lungs for everyone in the village to hear. <span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cBut how could they, when there are <i>savages</i> running around town in the night?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cWe\u2019ve had no 'incidents' with wild Pokemon.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cSure, we\u2019ve gotten lucky. But how long is that going to last? We let it in just one wrong Pokemon, and villagers will die. Your weakness is going to get us all killed one day!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cPrisco, I advise you have some <i>respect</i> for your chieftain.\u201d</b></span> The normally light-hearted goodra was talking with the calmest tone she could muster, trying to defuse the situation. You could tell, though, that as the grumpig complained louder and louder, the goodra\u2019s patience was rapidly running thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cYou may have inherited that title, but you\u2019ve done nothing to make us respect it,\u201d</b></span> he growled. <span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cThese savages are a danger to every single one of us, and I won\u2019t listen to a damn word you say until- ah!\u201d</b></span> His furious rant was interrupted when the goodra easily lifted him up with a hand. She seemed to hug the grumpig against her body, confusing you for a moment\u2026 until you noticed that he seemed to be being consumed by the purple goo of the dragon\u2019s belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cSounds like the only danger here is you,\u201d</b></span> she said, looking down at the helpless grumpig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cW-whoa! What\u2026 what the hell are you doing?\u201d</b></span> He says, trying to push against the goo, only for his arms to be submerged. <span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cLet me go!\u201d</b></span> The goodra pressed him against her with greater and greater force, until his face was submerged in the viscous goo, muffling his furious cries. You watch in awe as the goodra\u2019s body just seemed to slide around him, surrounding him on all sides. Eventually, he was submerged completely, the goo of her belly jiggling as it slid back into place, sealing the grumpig inside her. Her belly was slightly transparent, too, so you could see the outline of the grumpig as he wriggled around inside. You watched with fascination as the goodra rubbed contentedly over her enlarged belly, almost excited by the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cSorry, ol\u2019 pal. You\u2019re stayin\u2019 in there until you learn some respect,\u201d</b></span> the goodra says, licking her \u2018lips\u2019. Her belly seemed to become less and less transparent as the goo solidified, until eventually it was completely opaque, sealing the grumpig from the outside world.  <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cA few weeks, maybe. Don\u2019t worry; I can take care the inn while you\u2019re away...\u201d</b></span> Satisfied, the chieftain walked away, the citizens of her village staring in awe as one of them squirmed around inside her distended belly. They certainly wouldn\u2019t be disrespecting the chieftain any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cDid you see it? What happened?\u201d</b></span> The ninetales asked, sounding excited. You realized that the ninetales had probably engineered this whole thing, apparently as a sort of vengeance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cShe just\u2026 sort of sucked him into her belly, I guess,\u201d</b> you shrug, still shaken by what you had witnessed. <b>\u201cSounds like he\u2019s going to be in there for a while.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cHah! Awesome!\u201d</b></span> She smiled that same toothy grin, apparently taking a sort of sadistic glee in the grumpig\u2019s misery. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cIf it were me, I woulda just churned \u2018em up into fat. But I guess this is good enough.\u201d</b></span> Apparently, the ninetales doesn\u2019t like being judged for being a \u2018wild Pokemon\u2019.

The ninetales was\u2026 probably the coolest Pokemon you\u2019ve ever met. Part of you desperately wanted to her approval. <b>\u201cI\u2019ve just\u2026 always preferred hiding, you know?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused, silent for a while, before turning towards you again. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cAlright, then,\u201d</b></span> she said, her tone unreadable. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cLet me see you hide.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cW-what?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cGo hide somewhere.

Let me see what you can do.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUh, okay!\u201d</b> You were surprised by a sudden time limit, but you were desperate to prove yourself in something at least. You rushed away into the overgrowth, disoriented, and quickly decide to imitate the same technique the ninetales used when you were hiding from the scolipede. You try to silently dig your way beneath a particularly overgrown path of weeds and shrubbery. By the time you were completely covered, you were feeling pretty confident about your hiding space. Not even an inch of your body was exposed from any angle, and there was no evidence of what you had done. Satisfied, you settled in as you waited for your time to run out, holding your breath, trying not to make a sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cTime\u2019s up,\u201d</b></span> she announced, before leaning her head back, loudly sniffing the air. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201c... is that the best you can do?\u201d</b></span> Your heart skipped a beat when she immediately turned and walked directly to your hiding spot. Of course! She can smell you! You looked up at her from your spot in the dirt, feeling pathetic. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cWhat did you even do, exactly? Hide under a bush? Why? I\u2019m blind.\u201d</b></span> You cringed at your own stupidity. You had just copied what the ninetales had done. You hadn\u2019t even considered that different predators might require a different technique. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cMeanwhile, you hid downwind of me. I can smell you from here.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour curiosity distracted you from your wounded pride. <b>\u201cDownwind? W-what does that mean?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands there in disbelief, before sighing, covering her face with a paw. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cThis is going to take longer than I thought\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next hour or two, ninetales described and demonstrated all the basics of hiding, showing you how to disappear into the background of the forest, how to move silently over uneasy ground, and how to stay upwind of your predator. Despite her apparent exasperation earlier, in practice, she was a patient and effective teacher. Of course, she couldn't teach you everything in just this span. You still couldn't move nearly as quietly as she did, not did you have any idea how to hide from, say, a flying-type Pokemon, or a ghost-type. Still, you got the basics down. Eventually, she\u2019s taught you all you need to know for many encounters, and the two of you were chilling out in the wilderness, winding down. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cAlright, alright, you\u2019ve made some progress,\u201d</b></span> she admits with a smile. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to wrap this up soon, so let\u2019s cap this off with a little exam.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cExam?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands up, suddenly looming over you. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cI\u2019ll pretend to be some hostile predator for, say, five minutes. I\u2019ll give my best effort to catch you, you\u2019ll give your best effort to hide,\u201d</b></span> she explains. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cIf you\u2019re not inside my belly by the time the five minutes are over, you passed.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cInside\u2026 your\u2026?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cYep! Oh, by the way, this exam\u2019s happening whether you like it or not, pal,\u201d</b></span> she smirks, licking her lips teasingly. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cSo, uh\u2026 might want to take advantage of that head start.\u201d</b></span> You groan. <i>Here we go again,</i> you think as you stand up and dart into the forest once more. This time, even though she promised she\u2019d be giving it her all, you were still pretty confident. How hard could it be to hide from her? As long as you stay upwind and don\u2019t make a sound, it\u2019s just not possible for her to detect you, even when you\u2019re walking out in the open. As you contemplate the rules of your little \u2018test\u2019, a part of you wanted to just sit back and let her catch you. Her warm belly would be a great place to spend the rest of your trip. It would sure beat the hell out of walking. On the other hand, though, you really wanted to impress the ninetales, and this might be a prime opportunity. Plus, if she swallows you, there was always the chance, however slim, that she might end up digesting you, intentionally or otherwise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, you decide to just give this whole thing your best shot. You disappear into the white noise of the wilderness, and hear the ninetales howling in the distance, signifying that the \u2018test\u2019 had begun. Even now, she was sprinting silently through the wilderness, tracking your scent and straining her ears for snapping twigs or brushing leaves. You were going to have to think fast to make it through this one...</span></div></div>",

The ninetales scoured the forest relentlessly, forcing you to constantly keep moving; plus, she was completely silent as she sprinted through the wilderness, making her extremely hard to keep track of. It was only by an incredible measure of luck that you managed to evade her for even just a few seconds; actually making it for five minutes seemed like it would take a miracle. Still, as you hid, you learned her patterns, and her weaknesses. For example, she definitely couldn\u2019t see you -- not even in some weird sonar sense -- so you could just walk out into the open without any risk of being spotted. You didn\u2019t keep any track of the time that had passed, so when the five minutes were up, it took you completely by surprise. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cAbsol! Absol!\u201d</b></span> The ninetales called out while you were busy hiding beneath a fallen tree log. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cCome out, buddy. You passed.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you thought she was just trying to trick you. Once you thought about it, though, you had actually been hiding out here for quite a long time, so five minutes wasn\u2019t an unreasonable estimate. <b>\u201cReally?\u201d</b> You called out to her, excitedly. Had you really made it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cYep. Good hustle out there,\u201d</b></span> she patted you on the shoulder when you returned to her side. Honestly, though, she sounded a little disappointed.

You figure, though, that if she gets a bellyful of absol if you lost, you should at least get some sort of prize for winning. <b>\u201cDo I get anything for winning?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cWhat? What the hell do I even have to giveI-\u201d</b></span> She says, before stopping herself. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cActually, nevermind. Your reward is the warm, fuzzy feeling you get whenever I, in my <i>infinite</i> mercy, <i>don\u2019t</i> swallow you up and churn you up into fat. Is that satisfactory?\u201d</b></span> She answered sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYep!\u201d</b> You smile, skipping back towards the path. When you made it back to the route, you noticed that it seemed pretty late in the afternoon. <b>\u201cUh\u2026 isn\u2019t it getting a little late?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cYeah, I was just about to mention that,\u201d</b></span> she sighed. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cI may have lost track of time, there, so\u2026 we\u2019re definitely not making it to Shipton by sundown.\u201d</b></span> You shudder, remembering all the stories your folks told you of the horrific predators that roam the wilderness at night. Despite the seriousness of the situation, the ninetales nudged you in the side with a sly smile. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cOn the upside, you\u2019ll probably get to put those new hiding skills to use, huh?\u201d</b></span> With that, she continued down the winding path as if there was nothing to worry about, leaving you in the dust. You grimace as you hurry after her, unable to get over your anxiety despite her confidence. Hopefully you\u2019ll be able to find shelter, or else the both of you might be doomed after all...</span></div></div>",

Its roofs were triangular and towered slightly over the trees, and its interiors were lit by gorgeous lanterns, kept going by a constant flow of a magical energy. The building itself was surprisingly open for a building so exposed to the elements, with long windows and open doorways. Most notable was the big sign by its entrance - \u2018Travellers Welcome!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the ninetales were sitting on a nearby hill, overlooking the monastery. It was very late at night, at this point, and the two of you were panting with exhaustion and desperate for a place to rest. You squinted, watching the Pokemon inside the monastery from a distance, describing them to the ninetales. They were all dressed in strange religious garments, and despite the time, they seemed to be having some sort of jovial feast. <b>\u201cThey look\u2026 trustworthy,\u201d</b> you comment to the ninetales. Their smiles and laughter were so bright and genuine, and their uniforms so beautiful and mysterious, you kind of wanted to hang out with them just to see what this whole thing was about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cEhhh,\u201d</b></span> she shrugged, uncertainly. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201c... alright.\u201d</b> Seeing she wasn\u2019t satisfied, you scope the place out again. The two of you are silent for a while again, until something new of interest happens. <b>\u201cHuh. Now they\u2019re all kneeling down in front of some sort of\u2026 statue?\u201d</b> You raise a brow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cThey\u2019re worshippers,\u201d</b></span> she replied. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cCouldn\u2019t tell you who they\u2019re worshipping, though. They have cults for all kinds of Pokemon. Arceus, Mesprit, Giratina\u2026\u201d</b></span> You nodded contemplatively as she explained it. You knew that certain Pokemon were revered, but you were never aware they were worshipped in such an organized manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cSounds like you\u2019re not a big fan.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cI just don\u2019t get the hype,\u201d</b></span> she shrugs. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cYeah, legendaries are powerful, but they\u2019re not exactly paragons of virtue. Don\u2019t see how power alone makes you worth worshipping.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWell, the point stands that we need somewhere to hide out,\u201d</b> you insist, <b>\u201cand this looks as good as any.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ninetales is silent for a while, trying to come up with a good counterargument, only to come up short. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201c... I don\u2019t know if I want to spend the night around a bunch of cultists,\u201d</b></span> was all she could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWell, would you rather spend the night in some scolipede\u2019s colon?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of silence, she sighs in frustration, pulling herself up to her paws. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201c... fine. Let\u2019s go check it out,\u201d</b></span> she begrudgingly agreed, unable to argue with that logic. The two of you trotted down the hill to the monastery, stepping out of the darkness, bathed in the beautiful blue lanterns that lit up the entryway. Standing in the huge, intricate room at the fore of the monastery was a huge braviary, draped in the most beautiful arrangements of robes and ornaments you\u2019ve ever seen. Every inch of the huge bird\u2019s outfit was engraved with beautiful symbols and patterns, hinting at some higher purpose. Her eyes fluttered open soon after you walk in, apparently hearing you enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cOh, my! It seems we have some visitors!\u201d</b></span> She smiled, looking down at the two of you. Even the ninetales looked tiny in comparison. She shifts her gigantic wings as she wakes, but ultimately remains in place. <span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cWelcome to the Shipton monastery. What brings you to our sleepy little order tonight?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou assume the ninetales was going to say something, but she seemed wholly apathetic, so you had to answer for her. <b>\u201cWe were just heading into the city, and we\u2019re running a little behind schedule\u2026\u201d</b> You explain. <b>\u201cWe\u2019re wondering if you know of anywhere we can spend the night.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cWell, you\u2019re perfectly welcome to stay here, if you so desire,\u201d</b></span> she smiled, spreading her wings as if literally welcoming you into her embrace. <span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cThe sisters are busy with their nightly ritual at the moment, but one will be with you shortly.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cOh, sweet, thank you!\u201d</b> You say. You glance at all the books and artifacts arranged around the room while you wait. You\u2019d honestly never seen a place as beautiful as this little monastery -- the craftsmanship was staggering! <b>\u201cSo, uh\u2026 what exactly do you do here?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cOh, I am Alda the Venerable. I am the abbess of this monastery,\u201d</b></span> she explains, her voice deep but almost motherly in inflection. <span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cHere, we practice humility, introspection, and open love under the guidance of Cresselia.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cCresselia?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cCresselia is an aspect of the moon, and the weaver of all pleasant, meaningful dreams. We use the visions she sends us in the night to learn more about our own nature, and the nature of the world.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider it for a while. You\u2019d never thought one Pokemon could have all that power. <b>\u201cInteresting\u2026\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, heavy doors on the other side of grand room slid open, and a menagerie of oddly-dressed Pokemon stepped out, spreading through the room as they return to their duties. <span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cAh, there they are.\u201d</b></span> Alma smiles, turning to her sisters and waving a wing. <span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cSilvia! Oh, Silvia!\u201d</b></span> She calls. <span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cCome here, please!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them perks up at the sound of their name. This \u2018Silvia\u2019 trotted over dressed in similar patterned black robes as the rest of her sisters. Her thick hood and the ornate black veil draped over her face made it hard to determine her species, but when she drew closer, you recognized her as a persian. Everything about her, from the way she walked to the humble smile on her face, indicated that she was the pinnacle of grace and refinement. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cYes, miss Alda?\u201d</b></span> The persian said, kneeling before the great bird, humble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cThese two weary travellers are looking for a place to stay,\u201d</b></span> Alda instructing, gesturing towards the two of you with a wing. <b><span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cI think it would befit your penance if you were to host them for the night. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cOf course, miss Alda,\u201d</b></span> she nodded without a moment\u2019s hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cSister Silvia here will show you around the monastery,\u201d</b></span> Alda turned towards you again, satisfied with her answer. <span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cPlease, try not to touch anything.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cRight this way,\u201d</b></span> Silvia turned to you, gesturing both of her visitors to follow her as she gave you a tour of the monastery. A grand library full of ancient knowledge, a cafeteria where all kinds of delicious-smelling exotic goods were being enjoyed, a workshop where gorgeous monuments of devotion were being constructed\u2026 every room she led you through seemed more beautiful than the last! You were in love with this place by the time her tour concluded, and she was leading you towards the dorms. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201c... and these are my accommodations. You may stay here for as long as you\u2019d like,\u201d</b></span> she finished the tour with, as she pushed open a quaint little wooden door. You peeked inside, only to find that the persian\u2019s room was spartan compared to the rest of the monastery. Just a bed, a bathroom, a lantern, and a few books dotted the tiny wooden room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was disappointing to you, but to the ninetales, the basic room was a breath of fresh air compared to the opulence of the rest of the monastery. She slid past you, immediately crashing on the refreshingly old, crappy little wooden bed. You chuckle at this, before turning to the persian. <b>\u201cThanks for showing us around. This is a really beautiful place you all have here.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at you for a moment, as if surprised that you were even bothering to talk to her. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cI-it was no problem at all, really,\u201d</b></span> she says, in that same, constant soft, polite tone. You didn\u2019t quite know what her deal was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night was still young, and it wasn\u2019t like you had to get up particularly early tomorrow. Uncertain of what you should be doing, you like to your two new \u2018roommates\u2019 of sort, seeing how they\u2019re deciding to spend their night. The ninetales seems to be just interested in having dinner, getting washed off, and lounging around. The persian, on the other hand, was wandering down the hall as you speak, diligently returning to whatever duties she had scheduled. You wanted to spend the night with the ninetales, since this might be the last night you see eachother before you have to part ways. Then again, you kind of wanted to see what the persian was up to, and learn more about the curious little monastery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you decide to spend the night?</span></div></div>",

Now that I\u2019m technically an adult, I guess I\u2019m not their <i>problem</i> anymore, so they just left me to die out here.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cSo you\u2019re not a big fan of your ol\u2019 pops, huh?\u201d</b></span> she asks, in a weird, uncertain tone. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cWell\u2026 you wouldn\u2019t mind if I ate him them, would you?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cW-what do you mean?\u201d</b> You gasped, shocked. Why would she even ask such a question? Thousands of possible explanations passed through your mind, and none of them were pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cThe grumpig said you were son of Gunnar, right?\u201d</b></span> She says, leaning in closer, her tone deathly serious. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cGunnar works for Marden.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, that was one of the possibilities you were afraid of. It certainly brought a lot of things into clarity. He always did seem to busy \u2018busy\u2019 with something. <b>\u201cOh\u2026 Arceus,\u201d</b> you said, your eyes wide as you digest this new information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that I\u2019m hunting for him or anything\u2026 but if we run into eachother, and he attacks me\u2026 who knows what would happen?\u201d</b></span> She frowns. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cJust\u2026 thought I should give you a warning.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a little uncomfortable with it at first. I mean, he\u2019s your father, right? You didn\u2019t want him to get eaten! Then again, did that really matter? He obviously never even wanted to be your father in the first place. It\u2019s not like he raised you out of the sheer goodness of his heart. You had to be rational about this. <b>\u201cNo, no\u2026 do what you have to do,\u201d</b> you shake your head, <b>\u201cbut I need an explanation of this \u2018Marden\u2019 business. A <i>real</i> explanation.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods, thoughtfully. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cYeah. I guess I owe you that much.\u201d</b></span> She sighs, as if preparing to discuss something she didn\u2019t particularly like to recall. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cWhen I was about your age, I got in on ground zero of this little gang Marden was running. Y\u2019see, back then, \u2018wild\u2019 Pokemon were banned from entering most cities. Marden convinced us we\u2019d be able to take those cities over from the inside,\u201d</b></span> she explained. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cI pretty quickly became his right-hand woman, and for a few years, we were mates. Of course, it all fell apart when I realized he was a fuckin\u2019 psychopath.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused, and you urged her to continue. <b>\u201cHm?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cHe always had an extremely\u2026 <i>short</i> temper, and quick to leap to violence. I could convince myself that I deserved it, at least. But when I saw what he did to other, innocent Pokemon\u2026\u201d</b></span> She seemed to pause and shudder for a while, recalling grim memories. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cWhen he learned I was trying to leave, he\u2026 well and truly <i>lost</i> it. For <i>example</i>\u2026\u201d</b></span> She leaned over and brought a paw around the back of her head, undoing her little red blindfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou physically reeled back in shock as the ninetales faced without her blindfold for the first time. You expected that she had some sort of injury, but you were surprised to realize that her eyes were gone completely. Gone very cleanly too; they obviously hadn\u2019t been ripped out, but surgically removed. From a distance, it would look like she just had strange pink slits for eyes, but looking closer, you noticed her eyelids hovered halfway open to reveal the hollow sockets. There was no blood, or scars, or deformation, or any of the other things you would\u2019ve expected. It was just\u2026 pink. <b>\u201cW-what did\u2026?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cHe had them\u2026 removed, so I could never escape him,\u201d</b></span> she said, bitterly, as you stared in both awe and terror. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cOf course, I escaped his dumb ass anyway.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were shocked, but her explanation didn\u2019t fully sate your curiosity. After all, if she was already blind, one question remained. <b>\u201cWhy the blindfold\u2026?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cOh, just because nobody wants to see <i>this</i>,\u201d</b></span> she shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI mean, I-I don\u2019t mind it,\u201d</b> you insist, partially just to impress her. <b>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to wear that.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckles. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cThanks, kid, but you don\u2019t have to go staring at <i>these</i> just for my sake. It\u2019ll give ya nightmares,\u201d</b></span> she says, wrapping the thin red band around her head once again, covering her eyes completely before settling back into the bed. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cNow, uh, I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019ve got a busy day tomorrow. So I\u2019d like to get some rest, alright?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYeah, I guess I\u2019m pretty tired,\u201d</b> you say, walking up, eager to try out the comfy-looking bed. After sleeping in a tree your whole life, you couldn\u2019t way to see what sleeping in a real bed is like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cWhoa whoa whoa! Stay off the bed, pal!\u201d</b></span> She chuckles, lifting her paws. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cLook at you, you\u2019re dripping sweat!\u201d</b></span> You look down, realizing she was right. Apparently, she was athletic enough to not have broken a sweat all day, after you'd walked for miles and chased eachother through the woods for hours. You, on the other hand, were sweating like a dog. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cYou can wash off in there. For people who pretend to be \u2018humble\u2019, these cultists sure have some fancy restrooms.\u201d</b></span> She points to the bathroom in the corner.  <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cOh, but\u2026 try not to go rubbing one out in the shower this time. It\u2019d probably be sacrilege or somethin\u2019.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze in place, shuddering with shock as you turn to her, wide-eyed. <b>\u201cY-you\u2026 <i>knew</i>?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cUh, yeah, I noticed. I'm not an idiot,\u201d</b></span> she rolls her eyes, snorting with laughter. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cNot like it's anything to be ashamed of. If we\u2019re going for full disclosure here, I was buffin\u2019 the muffin all morning while you were asleep in here. Heh!\u201d</b></span> She gestured to her belly, and you flinched away in shock when you realized what she meant. You couldn't tell if she was joking or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cPfft. Don't look at me like that, hypocrite!\u201d</b></span> She laughs. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cGo ahead and take your little shower. Maybe it\u2019ll wash all that <i>sin</i> off ya.\u201d</b></span> She taunts you sarcastically as you close the door, trying not think about what you\u2019d just heard. You focus on the task at hand, immediately noticing that the persian\u2019s bathroom was, indeed, quite fancy. A <i>real</i> shower, a <i>real</i> (squat) toilet, a <i>real</i> bidet -- with <i>plumbing</i>! It was definitely way more modernized than any bathroom you\u2019ve ever used before. The best function of all was -- get this -- you could actually <i>change</i> the temperature of the shower! You eagerly adjust it until perfectly warm, relaxing water was running all  over your body. It felt\u2026 perfect. You wanted to just sit back and relax, but\u2026 one thought continued to plague your mind. You just couldn\u2019t shake the knowledge that this would probably be the last night you and the ninetales will ever even see eachother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew you were just traveling together; nothing more. You were just watching each other's backs on the trail for this dangerous little trek. Once you made it to the city, you were going to just part ways as if none of it had never happened. This was just the reality of things\u2026 but for some reason, thinking about that fact made your heart sink in your chest. She was one of the first strange Pok\u00e9mon you've met outside of your den, and everything about her was\u2026 perfect to you. Her body. Her cunning, unrestrained personality. The way hardship just washed off her back like it was nothing. Even her big, soft belly; fluffy on the outside and warm on the inside. You knew you'd have the opportunity to make plenty of friends on the outside, but you doubt you'd ever meet anyone quite like her. Perhaps this is why the very thought of her walking out of your life forever could make you panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to figure out a way you could remain friends\u2026 but how? Once you reached Shipton, you\u2019d just slow the ninetales down. She had way more important matters to attend to. Still\u2026 maybe you could help her find a place to hide out? Maybe you could just meet up after she done clearing out the city? You didn\u2019t know for sure, but\u2026 you had to think of something...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fifteen minutes later, you\u2019re finishing up, and open the bathroom door to see the persian was just sitting there the entire time, waiting patiently for her chance to take a shower. You flinched a bit, startled to see her there. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry!\u201d</b></span> She whispered frantically, seeing the look on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s fine. Y\u2019just startled me,\u201d</b> you smile, stepping out of the way. <b>\u201cYour turn, I guess. C\u2019mon in, water\u2019s fine.\u201d</b> You watched the contours of her sleek body beneath her robes as she slid past you into the cramped bathroom, before stepping out and closing the door behind you, giving the feline some privacy. You roll around on a towel for several minutes, drying off your fur, before finally climbing up onto the other side of the bed, across from the ninetales. It was a pretty small bed, obviously only meant for one person, so you didn\u2019t have much room to work with. It didn\u2019t help that the ninetales was already deep in slumber by now, and lying on her side, taking up a sizeable chunk of the bed. Just as you were getting comfortable, you hear the shower turn off, and the persian emerges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised when you saw her exit the bathroom. She had taken her robes and veil off for the night, revealing her sylphlike, curvy body in all its glory beneath the dull lantern light. You were astounded by her beauty; it was almost a shame she hid away beneath her robes all the time, following her ideals of humility. Her glowing yellow eyes blinked in the darkness as she crept silently towards the door of the room, as if trying to sneak out without being noticed. <b>\u201cWhere ya going?\u201d</b> You whisper, and she freezes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cI-I was just going to sleep outside,\u201d</b></span> she whispers back, turning towards you. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cI don\u2019t want to disturb you two.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhat? Nonsense! You don\u2019t have to go sleep somewhere else. This is your room, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</b> You laughed, quietly. <b>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to kick you out of your own room or anything.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stares at you for a while, as if confused, before shrugging. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you truly wish, then I will do as you say,\u201d</b></span> she said, deadpan, slowly and silently padding over the floor towards the bed. In that moment, you immediately regretted inviting her to stay. How were the three of you going to fit into this tiny, crappy little bed? It was too late now, though. You scooted over, lying on your back, pressing your side against the ninetale\u2019s belly, giving the persian as much room as you possibly could. She ended up having to snuggle up very, very close to you, just to avoid falling off the bed completely. You worried she would be uncomfortable with this sleeping arrangement, as you were complete strangers, but she didn\u2019t seem to mind in the slightest. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cGoodnight, absol.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cGoodnight,\u201d</b> you whisper quietly. Within moments, she had passed out as well, obviously exhausted by a full day of work... leaving you wide awake, sandwiched tightly between the rounded, fluffy bellies of the two beautiful Pokemon. It was\u2026 nice. You\u2019d basically been in solitary confinement for so long, you thought you just didn\u2019t need anybody else. But over the past couple days, you\u2019ve begun to realize just how desperately deprived you were of physical contact. It wasn\u2019t long until one of them wrapped their paws around in their sleep, cuddling you closer like a teddy bear. You couldn\u2019t tell who, so disoriented in the dark, but you happily nuzzled your head against their soft belly, using it like a pillow as you willed yourself to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2504\u2504\u2504<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, you dreamt that you were young again, but your father had never entered your life, so you and your mother could live happily in the woods together, and she\u2019d curl up around you and sing you songs as you nestled by the campfire. You dreamt you were surrounded by loved ones, all nuzzling close to one another, and you were happy together. You dreamt many comfortable little dreams, and peace flowed through your body once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were rocked back into the real world by the sounds of destruction. You could hear screaming and fighting in the distance, and your nostrils burned with the smell of smoke. You looked around, in a daze, to realize that your two companions were gone, having left you alone in your bed. All the gentle comfort and cozy satisfaction in your body was replaced with fear and confusion. You rushed over to the door, pulling it open just in time to see two Sisters of the monastery rushing down the hall, dressed in some sort of armor. A cacophony of sounds was erupting from all sides of the monastery, and you had no idea what was happening or where you should go. Confused, you decide following after the Sisters was a good place to start. Looking over the carnage of the partially destroyed monastery and overhearing their frantic conversations, you start to piece together what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Scolipede had apparently tracked the ninetales here, and knew this would be the last chance to take her out before she disappeared off the grid completely. Thus, she\u2019d rounded up an entire posse to attack the monastery head-on early in the morning, planning to block off all exits and devour everyone inside, one by one, taking the ninetales alive. Fortunately, Marden\u2019s goons ended up meeting much more resistance than they expected. You looked frantically out a window, to see a small army of Sisters in armor taking cover behind trees and debris, trying to prevent the goons from even entering the monastery. You watched in awe as the braviary battled fiercely with the scolipede, the two giants clashing with fire and fury, and shivered mournfully when you noticed the scolipede already had several of the innocent Sisters wriggling around in her belly. You may not have any combat experience\u2026 but you had to help somehow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding the ninetales would probably be the best place to start. You didn\u2019t see her anywhere along the front lines, so you sprinted towards the back of the monastery, wondering if you might find her hiding there or something. Unfortunately, the darkened, abandoned back corridors turned out to be eerily quiet in comparison to the entrance. <b>\u201cH-hello!? Ninetales?\u201d</b> You call out, your voice echoing unheard down the hallways. You thought you were utterly and completely alone\u2026 at least, until another voice split the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cWhat do we have here?\u201d</b></span> A deep, powerful voice boomed from behind you. You turned around, only to see the silhouette of a luxray sitting at the other end of the hall, obscured in darkness. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cAccording to my intel, you\u2019re one of Adriana\u2019s friends. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were deeply startled by his sudden appearance. Was he one of Marden\u2019s goons? Did he sneak in through the back? You were contemplating running, but he didn\u2019t seem hostile at the moment. <b>\u201cAdriana?\u201d</b> You stutter. <b>\u201cY-you mean the ninetales?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stands, walking towards you down the hallway at a leisurely pace. Eventually, he steps out into the light, revealing his sly smile, and the strange black vest wrapped around his shoulders.<span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cPfft. She hasn\u2019t even told you her name? Figures. If she had, you might read over a wanted poster sometime and see she\u2019s a criminal. A murderer.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he approached you, you back away at the same pace. <b>\u201cW-what are you talking about?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cYour \u2018friend\u2019 has digested thirty-nine civilized Pokemon. That\u2019s not even counting the wild ones. She\u2019s one of the most wanted Pokemon in the region.\u201d </b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cN-no! You\u2019re bullshitting me!\u201d</b> You insist, seeing a crack in his story. <b>\u201cHell, that scolipede outside -- she\u2019s eating Pokemon right now!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cShe\u2019s imprisoning them for later prosecution,\u201d</b></span> he rolled his eyes. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cThey\u2019ll be unharmed, don\u2019t you worry yourself.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trusted the luxray about as far as you could throw him. <b>\u201cWhere is\u2026 \u2018Adriana\u2019?\u201d</b> You growled, growing more and more panicked. <b>\u201cWhat did you do to her?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cYou searched the whole monastery, and she\u2019s nowhere to be found. Hm! Why don\u2019t you put two and two together, kid?\u201d</b></span> He said, almost mockingly. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cShe <i>left</i>. She snuck out the back the second this whole raid started. She was just <i>using</i> you, and the second things went south, she left you for dead.\u201d</b></span> He saw the look of denial on your face. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cDon\u2019t believe me? Well, where is she then? Do you have a better explanation?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, almost on the verge of tears. You were so confused. You\u2019d never had to deal with something like this before. It felt like your world was unravelling for the first time since your parents first left.. <b>\u201cNo\u2026 you\u2019re working for Marden\u2026\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grimace, he gestured to the ornate golden badge pinned to his vest, emblazoned with the words Shipton Police. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cI don\u2019t know what Adriana\u2019s told you, boy, but Marden\u2019s the <i>chief of police</i>,\u201d</b></span> he revealed. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cYou strike me as a good kid, though. Just got mixed up in the wrong crowd. If you agree to come peacefully, I\u2019ll bring you back to the station and we can clear this whole thing up.

You had to make a choice fast; either agree to\u2026 do what he says, or try to run. Both seem pretty like pretty hopeless options. You barely had a head start on him, and his long, toned legs seemed like they\u2019d catch up on your fast. Besides\u2026 if the ninetales did just abandon you here, hearing the luxray out may be your best chance...</span></div></div>",

You were eager to get back to the Shipton station, if it would give you a chance to learn what was actually going on here. Besides, part of you\u2026 wanted him to swallow you down, just so you could relive that feeling of deep calmness and comfort. <b>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d</b> You asked, standing still, allowing the supposed officer to walker up closer and closer. <b>\u201cI won\u2019t be hurt?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cDon\u2019t worry \u2018bout a thing.

You gazed in awe as he slid open his lips, revealing his slobbering maw and dark, cavernous throat. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cNever had any \u2018incidents\u2019 with prisoners under my watch.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cO-okay,\u201d</b> you agree, not even listening to what he said anymore, so transfixed on his throat. <b>\u201cI\u2019ll\u2026 do as you say.\u201d </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cSmart!

I\u2019m waiting.\u201d</b></span> Cheered on by the larger luxray, you curiously prodded at his tongue with a paw, excitement rising in your chest as you felt the texture of his mouth, your paw becoming wet with saliva. It reminded you of the ninetales\u2019, which comforted you to the point that you were willing to rest your chin on his tongue, peering curiously down her throat. You let him guide your snout in his tight throat, feeling his meaty breath bearing down on your face. Though the sight of the luxray\u2019s looming throat was enchanting, your eyes were forced shut by the saliva coating your face, slicking your fur down against your head. You leaned forward, the two of you working together to fit your horn into his maw. Eventually, the tight muscles of his throat were wrapped around your head, and you go limp, aware of the fact that you\u2019d long passed the point of no return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuxray loudly licked his lips as your body was forced unceremoniously into his rounded stomach, leaning back against a broom closet. It was pretty much identical to the ninetales\u2019, actually. Apparently, once you\u2019ve seen one stomach, you\u2019ve seen them all. His seemed a little rougher, though; a little darker, a little tighter, a little less comfortable overall. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cDamn! Tastier than I thought,\u201d</b></span> he said, rubbing his paws all over his belly as he sat there contentedly, losing himself in the sensations of you moving around, getting comfortable inside. You pressed your paws against the walls for a bit, trying to get his head back in the game. You didn\u2019t want to spend a second longer inside his stomach than you had. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cOh, uh, yeah,\u201d</b></span> The luxray said, noticing your protests, and you faintly heard the crackle of a radio, comforting you somewhat. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cDispatch, I\u2019ve, uh, apprehended an accomplice connected to the suspect. 10-4, I\u2019ll be\u2026 I\u2019ll be\u2026\u201d</b></span> The luxray\u2019s professional demeanor quickly dropped as he couldn\u2019t help but crack up. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cPffft hahaha! Who am I even kidding? You\u2019re screwed, runt!\u201d</b></span> At that, your blood ran cold. This luxray\u2026 wasn\u2019t really a cop, was he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cYou are really gullible as hell, aren\u2019t you? How did you fall for that? You have got to have been the easiest meal I\u2019ve had in years.\u201d</b></span> This can\u2019t be the end of your journey. Somebody was going to come rescue you at the last moment, or at least you\u2019ll find a way to escape. Your addled mind refuses to believe that this is the way you were going to go out. Still, looking at this rationally, you didn\u2019t seem to have much of a chance. The luxray had you right where he wanted you\u2026 and he seemed a little too excited by that fact. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cKinda wish you hadn\u2019t crawled down my throat so soon. I could\u2019ve used a toy like you,\u201d</b></span> he taunted, his voice suddenly taking on a disturbingly low tone. You felt something poke against your back through the walls of his belly; what you initially assumed to be a paw or something actually proved to be the luxray\u2019s slowly unsheathed dick, rigid and burning with anticipation. He was\u2026 getting off on what was about to happen to you. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cHeh. This almost feels like a waste of perfectly good ass.\u201d</b></span> It was another unpleasant realization that his member was coincidentally pressed up against the most unfortunate of places. Apparently, you weren\u2019t the only one to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cDamn\u2026 heh! Keep squirming\u2026\u201d</b></span> You could just barely hear him whisper as you struggling against your tight prison. You could feel him press his shaft up and down against the outline of your ass in his belly, hotdogging you even through the thick skin. Every movement you made only pushed your butt out even more, making you shiver and yelp as he humped against the bulge you created in his stomach with increasing fervor pressing his paws on top of his belly to push the bulge down against his shaft. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201c<i>Fuck</i>, you\u2019re a fighter\u2026 mn\u2026\u201d</b></span> Although you could barely hear it, he whispered obscenely to you for almost a half an hour while using your body just to help paw himself off, while the relentless battle for the monastery waged in the backgrounds. The relentless churning and undulating of his stomach was only made worse by the feeling of his dick pressing up against your back. Eventually, long after the fighting had already ended, you felt the luxray tense up and moan as he soaked his own big, round, fluffy belly with cum. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201c<i>M-mm!</i>\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe collapsed onto his back in satisfaction, feeling your weight pressing down against his torso. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cWell, at least I got <i>some</i> fun out of it\u2026\u201d</b></span> He smiles, rubbing his belly with a paw, only to flinch back the feeling of the cum soaked into his fur. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cEuch. Hey, runt, you know where the showers are?\u201d</b></span> He asks, sarcastically, as he wipes his paw off on the ground. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cThe silent treatment, eh? Guess I\u2019ll have to find them myself then.\u201d</b></span> He rolls over, straining to pull himself to his feet. You were jostled and rolled around uncontrollably in your claustrophobic surroundings as he walked through the halls, letting his distended belly swing beneath him until he found one of the bathrooms. Once he found himself a shower, all he did was rinse, relaxing as he felt the warm water roll over his sensitive belly, only serving to further heat up your already sauna-like prison. By the time he finished, it was sweltering within his belly, the heat almost unbearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cowardly lion only returned to the battlefield once the fight had already long concluded. You prayed that some of the Sisters had emerged victorious, or at least fleed with their lives, but it seemed they had fought down to the last man. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cWhat happened here?\u201d</b></span> You could hear the luxray ask in a vaguely professional tone, as if he wasn\u2019t jizzing all over himself just a few minutes earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother voice replied; a voice you immediately recognized as the Scolipede from earlier. <span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cEvery member of the monastery has been \u2018neutralized\u2019,\u201d</b></span> the voice reported. <span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cUnfortunately, it took longer than we expected. Adriana was able to slip away during the crossfire. Did you see her in the back?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cNope,\u201d</b></span> the luxray laughed, before slapping his belly with a laugh. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cCaught her boy toy, though.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\"><b>\u201cShall you have him interrogated?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cNah, he doesn\u2019t know shit,\u201d</b></span> he said. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cAdriana\u2019s probably halfway to Shipton by now.\u201d</b></span> He beamed with excitement as he looked over the remains of the battle. The monastery was filled with the cacophony of a dozen gurgling, churning bellies, and the muffled protests of the Pokemon inside. A dozen soon-to-be fat Pokemon, by your count, of all shapes and sizes, each lounging around the main hall with at least one of the Sisters gurgling away in their stomachs.  It seemed that Marden\u2019s goons had achieved a pretty decisive victory with this one. To make matters worse, it seems the ninetales really had just left you here to die. There was absolutely no one out there who could save you now; zero chance of your miserable life adding up to anything more than extra layer of pudge on the luxray\u2019s ass. The despair of the realization of your mortality was perhaps even worse than the pain, as the acids first started to set in...</span></div></div>",

Your primal flight-or-fight instincts kicked in, and almost without thinking, you started booking it down the other hall. The luxray just smirked  as he watched you sprint away. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cOh, you just made this <i>so</i> much harder for yourself\u2026\u201d</b></span> He said, giving you a good head start for his own amusement, like a cat toying with its prey, before sprinting after you. You try to take as many corners as you can, trying to knock him off your trail, but he was just so much faster than you could ever be. You occasionally glanced over your shoulder as you sprinted, only serving to further panic you as you realized he was gaining on you with terrifying ease. Your attempts to shake him off confused you more than they did him, and eventually you were lost deep in the darkest corners of the monastery, with no-one around to help you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he was close enough to leap forward at you, soaring through the air with speed and accuracy only a feline could manage. He landed dead center on your back, and you were given a faceful of the ground as he landed on top of you with all his weight, and the halls went silent again. You could only whimper quietly beneath him, feeling his huge paws press you uncomfortably against the ground. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cIs that <i>really</i> the best you can do?\u201d</b></span> He chuckled, sadistically. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d say you were just <i>teasing</i> me...\u201d</b></span> Your body tensed up in shock as you press something warm and rigid accidentally poke against the soft skin around your backside. Apparently, the luxray was at full mast, as if the chase itself had excited him somehow. Whatever the reason, it was uncomfortable to be pressed so close to the horny lion\u2026 especially when you felt him press his manhood into your crack. That time, it was definitely intentional. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cY\u2019know, I think I can make you a deal. You impress me, and maybe I\u2019ll convince Edda to let me take you home as a little souvenir. How does that sound?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe almost seemed to delight in the horror on your face as he stroked his shaft back and forth, pressing your soft, doughy cheeks down on both sides. You felt nauseous as strange liquids soak into the fur of your backside, the luxray\u2019s cock covered in\u2026 pre? Saliva? Lube? Whatever it was, his dick was already covered with it, allowing his huge member to hotdog itself with your ass with incredible ease. You had always had a very sedentary lifestyle, so you were a little\u2026 pudgy back there, admittedly. You were starting to regret all that, now, because apparently you were now exactly the luxray\u2019s \u2018type\u2019. He was already panting with excitement, and you tried to think about something else, going limp and letting him enjoy his \u2018fun\u2019 with your pillowy backside. It felt you were being violated, but at the very least it wasn\u2019t painful yet\u2026 at least, not until he switched positions. He seemed to stand up over you, which gave you some extra room to breathe, but had the added effect of pressing his throbbing, wet erection right up against the tightly-clenched hole just beneath your tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart leaped into your chest, realizing what he was about to do, and you used your newfound wriggle room to struggle against him with all your might. He seemed to be taken aback by just how adamant you were about escaping him. He enjoyed toying with you before, but now, playtime was over, and he just wanted to feel your tight ass wrapped around his dick ASAP. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cStop. Squirming! This isn\u2019t a negotiation...\u201d</b></span> He growled, pressing you painfully tight against the ground. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cJust fuckin\u2019 take it. You don\u2019t want me to make this any worse, do you\u2026?\u201d</b></span> You were prepared to keep resisting the luxray, no matter the consequences, but a surprisingly sight catches you off guard. The persian\u2026 Sister Silvia! She was there, hiding in the shadows, creeping up silently on the luxray, who was too caught up in his pleasure to even notice. Hope runs through you once again. Certainly, she was going to save you! Comforted by that knowledge, you go limp for a moment, letting whatever was going to happen, happen. The luxray smiled, thinking you had just given up. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cThere you go\u2026 that\u2019s a good boy\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clench your eyes tightly shut, praying that the persian would jump to your defense any second now.

Even though he was slightly larger than she was, the persian was able to easily pull his hind legs deeper and deeper into her throat -- having the side effect of pulling the luxray\u2019s huge manhood away from your ass, much to your relief. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing? Let me go!\u201d</b></span> He yelled angrily as he tried to flip around and claw at the persian; unfortunately for him, he wasn\u2019t flexible enough to lay a paw on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just laid there, refusing to move as you feel the luxray get pulled off of you, kicking and screaming. Eventually, his hind legs were lodged entirely inside the persian\u2019s throat. She had to pause for a moment, though, as his hips were as big as he entire head! <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to hurt him! I was just\u2026 just\u2026 nn\u2026 ngh\u2026\u201d</b></span> The feeling of the persian\u2019s tongue was apparently enough to push the luxray over the edge, and you\u2019re still close enough to get caught in the crossfire, shuddering as you feel jets of surprisingly warm cum spraying over your backside. His climax causes the luxray to go limp for a few moments, giving the persian just enough time to wrap her lips around his thick backside. It also gave you the opportunity to crawl out from under him, flipping over onto your back, leaning against the opposite wall as you watched the persian continue her grim task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201c... you\u2026 you s-stupid bitch\u2026\u201d</b></span> He finally choked out defiantly, once he was already half-way lodged in the persian\u2019s throat. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cI-I\u2019m Edda\u2019s right hand man! If you eat me, she\u2019ll just tell her husband, and then you\u2019re dead meat! You hear me?\u201d</b></span> Edda? Was she the scolipede? Her husband\u2026 could he be referring to Marden? Wasn\u2019t ninetales supposed to be Marden\u2019s mate? Perhaps he married others in her \u2018absence\u2019. You were so lost in thought that you hardly noticed the luxray grabbing a nearby wooden beam, halting his descent into the persian\u2019s belly. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201c... heh... y-you\u2019re not taking me that easy\u2026\u201d</b></span> He smirked, seeing a glimmer of hope, until he saw you walking curiously over to him. He only had a tentative grip on the beam -- it would be the easiest thing in the world to just pry his paws off and\u2026 send him on his way. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cNo! Come on! You seem like a nice guy! L-lets be reasonable about this!\u201d</b></span> He pleaded as you grabbed a hold of his paws. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cP-please\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitated for a moment, but remembering how sadistic and cruel he had been to you just moments earlier, you decided you had no qualms with letting him get gulped. In fact, you were a little excited by the idea of helping the persian swallow an entire Pokemon whole. You realized in that moment that your own manhood was rigid and at the ready. It wasn\u2019t something you were particularly proud of, but feeling the luxray hump against you earlier had started to get you a little excited, and watching him disappear bit by bit down the persian\u2019s throat definitely finished the job. Bits of excitement jolted up your spine as you pried the luxray\u2019s paws off the beam, leaving him with no avenue of escape from the persian\u2019s greedy, cavernous throat. Soon, only his head was still visible, his face broken and desperate as he slipped deeper and deeper still. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cN-no\u2026\u201d</b></span> was all he could say as you watched him disappear from sight completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You just almost been violated by a luxray, and watched one feline swallow another whole -- two things that definitely should not expand dong, and yet, there it was. Still, you tried your best to hide it from the persian, even as you watched her devour the last of her prey with fascination. Eventually, the bulge in her neck disappeared as the luxray was dropped into her belly completely, and the persian started coughing and panting immediately once her throat was clear. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cOhh\u2026 ohh\u2026\u201d</b></span> She moaned, overwhelmed by the feeling of devouring someone larger than her. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cCresselia, forgive me\u2026\u201d</b></span> Her furry belly had expanded to a size that seemed almost impossible, leaving her completely immobile, her huge, round gut pressed against the ground. You stare in awe at the clear imprint of the luxray\u2019s body as he struggled within, his paws stretching the sensitive skin of her belly as he pushed against her stomach walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she got her bearings somewhat, looking down at her huge gut in shock. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cOh no, oh no, oh no\u2026\u201d</b></span> She gasped, as if having a brief moment of lucidity. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cWhat have I done?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhat?\u201d</b> You asked, confused. <b>\u201cYou saved me!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cNo, no, no\u2026 you don\u2019t understand\u2026 I didn\u2019t have to-\u201d</b></span> She said, before gasping as she felt the luxray kick from within her stomach. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cAh! Ohh\u2026 n-ngh\u2026\u201d</b></span> She moaned and squealed silently at the indescribable sensations overcoming her. You couldn\u2019t turn away as she worked herself up into a greater and greater frenzy. With the next few minutes, her pleasure had completely overtaken any bit of modesty or common sense in her mind. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cI n-n-need\u2026 I need you to <i>fuck</i> me!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of everything that's happened, this probably shocked you at all. <b>\u201cW-what?\u201d</b> That's definitely not something you expected to hear from someone like Silvia. <b>\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t\u2026\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cT-then give me <i>something</i>!\u201d</b></span> She begged. With a belly like this, she definitely couldn\u2019t reach her pussy with her own paws, so it seemed she needed some outside help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cO-okay!\u201d</b> You agreed, looking around. Most of the stuff in the hallway seemed to be bolted down\u2026 except for one of those weird statues that seem to be scattered around the monastery. You were unsure whether or not she would be comfortable using that, since she seemed to like prayed to these statues a lot\u2026 but sure enough, the second you pushed it up behind her, she sat down on it without hesitation, her weight plunging the statue most of the way into her sex in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cFuck...!\u201d</b></span> Wasn\u2019t as big as she\u2019d have liked, but it would do. It was difficult to do anything given her added weight, but through sheer dedication alone, she managed to slowly bounce up and down on the de facto dildo as she rubbed eagerly over her sensitive belly. Her eyes were squeezed tensely shut as she concentrated on her prey\u2026 before she suddenly slid them opep, and you found yourself staring into her beautiful golden eyes.  <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cR-r-rub\u2026 ruub\u2026\u201d</b></span> She gestured to her belly, and you realized what she was asking, obediently sitting down in front of her and tentatively sending your paws over her stomach. You almost shiver when you realize you could feel the movements of the luxray inside. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cOhh\u2026 keep squirming all you want\u2026\u201d</b></span> she whispered to the luxray inside of her. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cY-you\u2019re gonna stay on my ass\u2026 forever\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren\u2019t entirely sure what to do with your own manhood, which was still rigid and burning in anticipation, but eventually, the persian decided to take care of that for you. You almost yelped in surprise when she leaned back, wrapping her hind paws around your shaft on both sides. You were about to pull away on instinct, but as she started stroking her paws up and down, you realized it it actually felt\u2026 kind of amazing. It helped that this was the first time anybody had been so\u2026 intimate with you. As you leaned into her soft belly, listening to the protests of the luxray inside as you rubbed with increasing fervor in an attempt to return the favor, you realized how incredibly surreal this whole situation was. Before, she seemed like the pinnacle of humility and class. The second she had gotten the taste of that luxray, though, it was like she had become an entirely different person. Now, you were watching her rub her bulging belly with one set of paws while giving you a footjob with the other, all while sitting on one of her own sacred idols. For a moment, you wondered if you were dreaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d become quite well-acquainted with your own paws, but feeling someone else\u2019s wrapped around your dick was incredible in comparison. This, combined with the feeling of the persian\u2019s distended belly and the sound of her delighted moans, it didn\u2019t take too long for you to finally get the release you craved. Your orgasm almost took you by surprise, not giving you enough time to even warm her before you sprayed cum all over her paws and belly. You gasped as you collapsed against her belly, using it like a pillow as you emptied your balls all over her fur. She was too distracted to even notice; at this point, she seemed to have checked out from reality completely, too overwhelmed by the feeling of the luxray inside her. You knew now what she meant by \u2018sinful urges\u2019. Just as you pulled away from her, you heard the braviary\u2019s voice ringing from down the hall. <span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cHello? Any survivors back here?\"</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe persian ignores the voice completely, lost in her own little world. You, on the other hand, were suddenly reminded of the violent battle that had just taken place. <b>\u201cI-I should go get help,\u201d</b> you say, cleaning up as best as you possibly can (not very well) before rushing down the hall. <b>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back!\u201d</b></span></div></div>",

Within, the remaining members licked their wounds and regrouped after their relentless battle. You noticed Alda, the braviary, first and foremost, leaning against a wall as she had her wounds bandaged by the other Sisters. Of all the survivors, it looked like she had battled the fiercest. The braviary seemed to be the only one standing in the way of that huge scolipede, so it was probably thanks to her that any of you survived. <b>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</b> You asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled warmly when she saw you. <span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cYes, I am quite alright,\u201d</b></span> she replied, <span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cthanks to your friend.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cJust as the bandits were about to take the monastery, the ninetales appeared to help ward them off,\u201d</b></span> she explained. <span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cI have to say, I was impressed by her competence.

You were proud of the ninetales, but something about the braviary\u2019s tone worried you. <b>\u201cWhat happened to her?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, staring at the ground. <span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cUnfortunately, she grew too foolhardy, and eventually she was\u2026 captured,\u201d</b></span> she confessed. <span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cThe moment they captured her, the bandits immediately cut their losses and left. I presume she is what they came for, yes?\u201d</b></span> Damn it! You came back too late! If you hadn\u2019t been busy getting pawed off in a back room, you might\u2019ve been able to save her. You sat there, pondering the situation. Good news -- it turns out the ninetales hadn\u2019t abandoned you after all. Bad news -- she was captured. Possibly dead. Probably trapped inside that scolipede\u2019s big, round belly at this very instant, being \u2018escorted\u2019 to their headquarters in Shipton city. If they were smart, Marden\u2019s thugs were long gone by now. You didn\u2019t know exactly how large this city was, but from the sound of it, it would take far too long to find her yourself. You had to have a lead\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYes, she is,\u201d</b> you nod. <b>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 so sorry. When I came here, I didn\u2019t expect\u2026 all this would happen\u2026\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cDon\u2019t say that. Regardless of what they were here for, none of this is your fault,\u201d</b></span> The braviary leaned back sagely. <span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cThis is probably Marden\u2019s doing. I told Elmira he shouldn\u2019t let him have the run of the place,\u201d</b></span> she said, looking sadly over the ruins of the monastery. <span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cNow\u2026 look at us. We are but humble worshippers. We don\u2019t take tithes or donations\u2026 how will we ever afford to repair this damage?\u201d</b></span> She gestured to the holes in the structure with a wing. <span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cThat\u2019s not even mentioning the Sisters we\u2019ve lost\u2026 though their souls are at peace with Cresselia, now\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWho is\u2026 Elmira?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cOh, yes. You are wild, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</b></span> She remembered. <span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cElmira is a delphox, and the mayor of Shipton city. Though, depending on who you ask, Marden is the one who really runs the place\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cSo\u2026 could she help?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cYes, go. Tell Elmira what happened here,\u201d</b></span> she nodded. <span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cShe was very supportive of our monastery, in the early days. If she\u2019s still anything like she used to be, I\u2019m sure she will be disheartened to hear of the atrocities that have occurred here. Perhaps it will finally spur her to take some action\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart leaped in your chest. This was the perfect lead! <b>\u201cYes, I-I\u2019ll get right to it. Thanks!\u201d</b> You said, just about to leave to rush to Shipton, before you remembered something. You pointed down the hall you just emerged from. <b>\u201cOh, yeah, uh\u2026 Sister Silvia is still in the back. She might need some help.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cOne of the raiders\u2026 attacked me, and she sort of\u2026 ate him,\u201d</b> you explained, sheepishly, recalling all that had happened. <b>\u201cNow, she can\u2019t move.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</b></span> She raised a 'brow'. <span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cWell, I should\u2026 speak with her, then.\u201d</b></span> You froze up at her tone, suddenly feeling like you had just told the braviary something you shouldn\u2019t have. You watched as she stood up, brushing her subjects aside as she walked dutifully down that darkened hall, despite her injuries. <span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cSo long, absol.\u201d</b></span> You stood there, conflicted. Of course, none of this was any of your business, but\u2026 you needed to make sure that you didn\u2019t land the persian in too much trouble. After she literally saved your ass, you felt like you owed her that much. When none of the other Sisters was looking, you crept down the hallway behind the braviary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were lost in the dark for a while, until you heard the persian crying from down the hall. From the sound of it, she was back to her old self again. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cMiss, you don\u2019t understand\u2026\u201d</b></span> You hear her sob. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cHe was\u2026 he was going to\u2026\u201d</b></span> You immediately used all the knowledge you had learned from the ninetales to hide silently around a corner, lifting an ear to eavesdrop on their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cYou could\u2019ve just incapacitated him, like you\u2019ve been taught,\u201d</b></span> you hear the braviary calm but stern voice reply. <span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cAnd not only that, but to\u2026 <i>desecrate</i> one of our idols? What is your justification for <i>that?</i>\u201d</b></span> The persian could only whimper in response, knowing she\u2019s been beat. You peek around the corner, only to see the persian still laying there on his huge belly, still completely immobilized by the squirming luxray. She was crying, now, as Alda loomed over here. The braviary pauses for a while, as she decides on a punishment for the persian. <span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cIf you do not respect our methods, you do not belong within our ranks. Henceforth, you shall be placed under exile from this monastery.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cE-exile\u2026?\u201d</b></span> The persian looked up at her, shocked. This is the only home she\u2019s ever known. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cM-miss\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cHm?\u201d</b></span> The braviary tilted her head. <span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cDo you not agree that you deserve such a punishment? We\u2019ve already given you a second chance.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe persian bit her lip, clenching her eyes shut as if that could stop the tears. She knows that this is what she deserves. <b>\u201cN-no\u2026\u201d</b> she admits, defeated.  <b>\u201cI understand\u2026\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cGood, then. I hope you find peace in your future dealings,\u201d</b></span> the braviary says curtly, wrapping things up. <span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cOne of the Sisters will have to escort you to town, now, since you seem incapable of moving on your own.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI could take her!\u201d</b> You insisted instinctively, stepping out of your hiding place, so desperate to do something to help. The two of them looked at you, surprised, and you backed up sheepishly, remembering that you weren\u2019t supposed to be eavesdropping. <b>\u201cI-I mean\u2026 I\u2019m going to Shipton city, anyway\u2026 maybe she could help me find my way around?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe braviary stares at you for a while, her expression unreadable, before shrugging. <span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cVery well,\u201d</b></span> the braviary says curtly, wrapping things up. <span class=\"cgrape\"><b>\u201cGiven her\u2026 immobile state, I will provide a cart to carry her around with on the way to town.

The persian laid miserable and immobile in the cart, her belly big and round enough to take up the entire compartment, getting squeezed slightly by the sides. She certainly wasn't wearing her robes anymore -- they would it fit on her anyway -- but she still had that odd black veil still obscuring half her face. Now, the veil had the added effect of hiding the persian\u2019s shame and humiliation. It was a little difficult to pull the weight of both Pokemon on a cart for all these miles, but it was definitely good exercise. <b>\u201cNonsense. I\u2019m glad to help out,\u201d</b> you smiled, looking over your shoulder. <b>\u201cBesides, you saved me.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued, seemingly ignoring you completely. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 so, so sorry for\u2026 everything that happened back there,\u201d</b></span> she said, crying openly for the fifth time over the course of this trip. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cSometimes, when I\u2019m\u2026 overcome by my urges, I become\u2026 someone else.\u201d</b></span> She held her head in her paws, trying to control her tears. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cI was\u2026 weak\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI mean, I thought you did a pretty good thing,\u201d</b> you shrugged, not understanding what she was so upset about. <b>\u201cAfter all, did you see what he was about to do?

You had never seen anyone so full before. It was still\u2026 quite exciting, to be honest. <b>\u201cHow is he in there? Still movin\u2019?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cYes, he is still moving. He\u2019ll be moving in there all day, that I know for certain,\u201d</b></span> she says, as if this much was obvious. You hoped she\u2019d let you rub her belly again today, though this didn\u2019t seem like the proper time to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cSo, according to you\u2026 isn\u2019t he going to, like\u2026?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cYes, according to Cresselia, he will become a part of me,\u201d</b></span> she sighs. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cHis soul will remain within my body until the day of my death\u2026 which will hopefully be soon.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flinched when she said that, but ultimately, you had no idea how to respond, so you just kept quiet. A couple minutes later, by coincidence, the towering skyscrapers of Shipton city peeked over the horizon. <b>\u201cTown\u2019s coming up.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cGreeaat,\u201d</b></span> she frowns, obviously not overly enthusiastic. For someone who tries to be as humble and unassuming as her, being seen like\u2026 this was probably going to be beyond humiliating. Still, there was no time to worry about that now. You hurried down the mountain trail, trying to make it to Shipton city as soon as possible. Every minute you waited was another minute that could\u2019ve been spent searching for the ninetales!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally reached the city, you were in awe. There were more Pokemon walking up and down a single stretch of road than you had every seen before in your life. Some of the buildings stretched so high they touched the sky. Beautiful neon lights and feats of art-deco architecture stretched as far as the eye could see, making you feel positively tiny compared its grandeur. Just looking at it from a nearby hill, one thought struck your mind\u2026 how were you ever going to find the ninetales in all of this? You didn\u2019t even know where to start. <b>\u201cWhat\u2026 what are we going to do?\u201d</b> You whispered to the persian, who you assumed would have more experience with this than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cFind a hotel, first off,\u201d</b></span> she replies. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cI\u2019d\u2026 really rather not be seen like this for too long.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cHow do we find a\u2026 \u2018hotel\u2019?\u201d</b> You\u2019d never heard the term before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugs. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cAsk somebody for directions.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brace yourself, before finally wandering down the hill into the expansive city. The citizens of the city were all well-groomed, wearing fancy accessories, and seemed shocked by the sight of two wild Pokemon walking in; especially when one has a massive, bulging belly, and the other\u2019s carrying them around in a cart. Everyone stopped to stare as you passed by, with expression ranging from shocked to amused. The persian hid her face with her paws, humiliated beyond belief. She wished she could just\u2026 melt away, right here and now. Meanwhile, you were distracted by the amazing sights of the city, but still preoccupied with finding a hotel. You definitely wouldn\u2019t fit in with any of the city\u2019s fancier citizens, so you decided to try and find another wild Pokemon like yourself. Maybe they\u2019d be willing to give you directions. Eventually, you come across a suitably wild...</span></div></div>",

She had a purple bandana wrapped around her forehead, and her cheeks were covered in dirt -- more notably, she had that wild, bemused look in her eyes that was distinct from the disingenuous posturing put off by most of the locals. <b>\u201cExcuse me? Miss?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mienshao turned to you, looking you in the eyes for only a moment before she was inevitably distracted by your friend. Unlike the more civilized Pokemon, instead of being disturbed the persian\u2019s huge gut, she only appeared amused. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cPffft hahaha!\u201d</b></span> She said, covering her mouth with one of her long arms. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cBit off a little more than you could chew there, huh?

The mienshao pauses, looking over the cityscape with a cynical eye. You could tell she didn\u2019t like this place much. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cWell, this district\u2019s only good for buying incense and getting caught up in gang fights.\u201d</b></span> She points towards the other end of the city, which shined so bright it lit up the evening sky even from miles away. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cSee all that?

It felt like you were travelling for miles, and soon your legs ached from the increased weight. You look over your shoulder at the persian for a moment, only to notice she looks absolutely miserable. To be paraded around town like this is probably the last thing she needs during her darkest moment. As you think back on the events that led to all this, you started feeling a little bad yourself. You definitely could\u2019ve handled things better. <b>\u201cY\u2019know\u2026 I\u2019m sorry for what I did, back at the monastery,\u201d</b> you apologized to her, so softly only she could hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</b></span> She whispered back, lifting her head, temporarily distracted from her misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cIf you really weren\u2019t in your right mind\u2026\u201d</b> You frowned. <b>\u201cIn retrospect, I might\u2019ve\u2026 taken advantage of the situation\u2026\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks confused for a moment, before realizing what you were referring to. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cWhat? You mean the pawjob? Honestly, that\u2019s the least of my worries,\u201d</b></span> she said, incredibly nonchalantly. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cHonestly, I would\u2019ve just pawed you off the night before if you had asked. I was your host, after all.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cW-what!?\u201d</b> You almost froze in place, surprised to hear the eloquent persian say something so vulgar. <b>\u201cBut weren\u2019t you, like\u2026 a nun?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cWe practiced humility and chastity, yes, but not <i>abstinence</i>,\u201d</b></span> she rolls her eyes. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cIn fact, instead of monogamy, Cresselia advocated for open and honest love. All members of the monastery were open and intimate with one another, and with outsiders on occasion. It\u2019s just a part of life.\u201d</b></span> Perhaps you were just sheltered, but you had no idea how so many Pokemon are so\u2026 open about sex. To you, it always felt like something you should be ashamed of; something you should keep hidden away from everyone except the one you trust the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncomfortable, you try to change the subject. <b>\u201cWhat about Noviella?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cYes, compared to the others, me and Noviella grew\u2026 worryingly close,\u201d</b></span> she frowned. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cThe abess warned us that devoting ourselves to a single, mortal Pokemon was the path to ruin. We should\u2019ve listened.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t like her tone. <b>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 sorry if that reminded you of some\u2026 sad memories.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cWell, like you said. I\u2019m not part of the monastery, anymore. So there\u2019s nothing keeping me from\u2026 getting this off my chest,\u201d</b></span> she says, closing her eyes as if mentally bracing herself to drop some kind of bombshell. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\"Here\u2019s something I haven\u2019t told a single Pokemon alive; Sister Noviella wasn\u2019t the first Pokemon I devoured.\u201d</b></span> Your eyes widened a bit. Apparently, her \u2018confession\u2019 back at the monastery didn\u2019t tell you the full story. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cIn fact, Noviella was always fascinated by the fact that I could\u2026 \u2018consume\u2019 Pokemon. Constantly urged me on. Took\u2026 carnal pleasure in it.\u201d</b></span> She grimaced, obviously wrestling with her guilt. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cStarted with\u2026 feeding me Rattatas. I only agreed to make her happy. I didn\u2019t know how far we\u2019d end up taking it.\u201d </b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, the rest of the monastery was none the wiser when wild Pokemon nearby starting disappearing. They didn\u2019t even notice when a few visitors went \u2018missing\u2019,\u201d she said, no longer bothering to moderate the volume of her voice. A few local Pokemon gave you weird looks as you passed by. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cBut\u2026 when my predatory instincts kick in, I become a different person entirely. Overcome by\u2026 gluttony and debauchery, my mind shuts down until my hunger is\u2026 appeased.\u201d</b></span> Even though she spoke as verbosely and calmly as always, you could feel the palpable emotion behind her voice. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cWhen one of our attempted victims escaped and I was left unsatisfied, Noviella herself fell victim to my\u2026 appetite.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked over your shoulder for a moment, and realized the persian\u2019s cheeks were wet with tears. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important I... control my desires,\u201d</b></span> she says, sounding stoic as ever. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cIf I give in... the same thing could happen to you, or some other innocent Pokemon.\u201d</b></span> The persian shakes her head bitterly. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cIt\u2019s just not worth it. What authority do I have to consider my pleasure more important than somebody else\u2019s life?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI-it\u2019s okay, Silvia. I understand,\u201d</b> you say sadly, trying to calm her down. <b>\u201cLet\u2019s just get to the apartment and let you get some rest. Okay? No need to think about all this right now.\u201d</b> The persian only nodded sadly, her lip quivering as she went back to staring at the ground in front of her once again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now you were starting to regret you said anything\u2026 not like there was any point in dwelling on it, what with the apartment building finally coming into view. An orange neon sign above the door read Faded Oak. Even from the outside, the big brick building looked run-down and filthy, but it would have to do for the night. You mustered the last of your strength to drag the persian-filled cart up the concrete stairs, and the mienshao smugly slid the door open for you and gestured for you to enter. You didn\u2019t expect much, yet the ancient, worn-down apartment building still managed to disappoint. The tacky wallpaper looked moldy and peeling; the carpet had an ugly floral print, and smelled vaguely of dried piss. Overall, you got the impression that this was a part of town that had just been left to rot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second you walked in, following behind the Mienshao, you accidentally bump into the Mightyena who was walking out, colliding face-first with their chest fluff. You stumbled back, clutching your aching snout with a paw. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cOh! Excuse me,\u201d</b></span> she apologized, before seeing the look on Mienshao\u2019s face, at which point she grinned smugly herself. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cOh, I see. Already managed to lure another poor sucker here, huh?\u201d</b></span> She walks around your side, sizing you up as she approaches the door. She seems particularly impressed when she finally gets a good look at your rear end, which was admittedly rather pudgy for a non-predator. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cDamn, he\u2019s actually pretty cute. I\u2019m impressed. I wouldn\u2019t mind a taste of him myself\u2026\u201d</b></span> Satisfied, she turns to finish walking out the door, only to come face to face with Silvia. She looked down at the persian\u2019s belly, wide-eyed, as the wooden wagon creaked under its sheer weight  <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cOh\u2026 dear.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cY\u2019see? You\u2019ve misjudged me, Luis. I\u2019m just doing my good deed for the day and giving these two poor, wayward outsiders a safe place to stay,\u201d</b></span> the mienshao mused sarcastically, pinching your cheek.  <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cThough this cutie right here might end up sleeping in the \u2018guest bedroom\u2019.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mightyena snorted. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cOh, Rana. Truly, you\u2019re a pillar of the community\u2026\u201d</b></span> She chuckles, before squeezing past the persian and trotting out the door. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cWell, good luck, you two!\u201d</b></span> You stand there, a little confused by that whole exchange. You weren\u2019t stupid \u2014 it wasn\u2019t hard to deduce that the mienshao was planning on keeping you in her belly at some point \u2014 but the ninetales had done the same thing when you first met, and you had actually quite enjoyed it. Admittedly, you\u2019ve since been longing to be curled up in someone\u2019s belly again, where you don\u2019t have to worry about all the struggles of the outside world\u2026 what concerned you, though, was the possibility that the mienshao might be planning to digest you. After having seen so much carnage today, the possibility of digestion was constantly on your mind, and you felt like you couldn\u2019t trust anybody. Still, when the mienshao gestured, you obediently followed; you just decided you would tread carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cLuckily I live on the first floor, so we don\u2019t have to roll your friend here up the stairs\u2026\u201d</b></span> The mienshao giggles as you pass down the hall. She sticks by your side now, seeming to admire the persian\u2019s belly whenever she got the chance. It was admittedly an impressive sight; Silvia\u2019s stomach was currently bigger than the rest of her entire body, totally immobilizing the miserable persian. It bulged and buckled as the luxray within squirmed in protest, helpless as the persian\u2019s powerful body churned him up into fat. You found it quite enchanting yourself, though out of respect to Silvia, you tried not to stare. Eventually, you crossed by a door that was left ajar; apparently, whoever lived in that apartment didn\u2019t value their privacy. You squinting as you glanced into the dark room, seeing an ampharos sitting at a high-tech setup in their living room, illuminated only by the glow of his multiple screens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over his shoulder when he heard your wagon pass down the hallway. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cRana! Rana! A moment of your time, please!\u201d</b></span> He immediately stood up and called upon seeing you, and you freeze in place as the ampharos rushes to the door of his apartment. The mienshao rolled her eyes in frustration upon being noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cCan\u2019t you see I\u2019m busy here?\u201d</b></span> She grumbles as the excited ampharos faces her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cThis is important! Marden\u2019s planning to finally make a move on the civilized districts!\u201d</b></span> The ampharos insists. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, I\u2019m onto something here! Something big!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cWell, it can wait until morning, can\u2019t it? Good,\u201d</b></span> the mienshao says dismissively, obviously prioritizing getting her rocks off over whatever the ampharos was so concerned about. Before the ampharos could respond, she raised a hand to his lips, silencing him. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cIf you have to, just use tonight to dig up some more details for me, alright?\u201d</b></span> The ampharos visibly deflated at being dismissed so easily, the mienshao easily brushing him aside as she continued down the hallway. Eventually, she noticed you staring at her as you walked, waiting for an explanation. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cThat\u2019s just Issac. He\u2026 keeps track of things for us,\u201d</b></span> she sighs, not wanting to go into detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cUs?\u201d</b></span> You raise a brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cLet\u2019s just say Faded Oak has a\u2026 specific clientele,\u201d</b></span> she responds vaguely, a little uncomfortable discussing the topic. Before you can press her for details, she finally stops at a door, labelled 106 in a golden, fancy font. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cEnough of that, though. We\u2019re here!\u201d</b></span> The mienshao sticks her eye up against some weird, high-tec little scanner, and sure enough, the door clicks unlocked. The door slid open, revealing her small, two-bedroom apartment to be\u2026 surprisingly nice, actually. Compared to the rest of the building, her apartment was at the very least quite tidy and well-kept, and downright homely compared to your room at the monastery. The mienshao skipped inside and crashed comfortably on the couch as you slowly wheeled in the bloated persian. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cMake yourselves at home, you two!\u201d</b></span> She said, as she flicked the television on, the blaring laugh track of some stupid game show filling the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you glance around the apartment, trying to decide what to do next, Silvia whispers in your ear. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but\u2026 I\u2019m beginning to feel sore,\u201d</b></span> she asked, timidly. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cCould you push me off this wagon?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had completely forgotten about that! <b>\u201cOh, yeah, uh, of course,\u201d</b> you nodded, dutifully getting to work gently unloading her from the wagon. Getting her off it was a lot harder then loading her onto it was, though, because now the luxray was squirming around like the devil in there. His every movement made huge bulges in the side of the persian\u2019s fluffy, spherical gut, and he damn near kicked you through the face at one point. <b>\u201cJeez, he\u2019s really moving around in there now,\u201d</b> you note, exhausted, completely unable to nudge the persian when her prey was struggling with such ferocity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cDigestion is started to set in,\u201d</b></span> Silvia sighs solemnly, waiting patiently for you to finish pushing her off, although you were making zero progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cArceus, that\u2019s hot. I mean, uh, I apologize, but\u2026 damn.\u201d</b></span> You both jumped a bit in surprise at the statement, and realized that the mienshao was shamelessly staring at Silvia\u2019s belly from the couch, looking enchanted as the persian\u2019s stomach bulged and groaned. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cYou ever going to tell me the story behind that belly of yours?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cThis is just... one of Marden\u2019s thugs,\u201d</b></span> Silvia explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cAh, so they had it coming,\u201d</b></span> she smiled, hopping off up onto her feet. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cLooks like I can get off on this guilt-free, then!\u201d</b></span> She giggled as she approached the cart, and before you knew it, she was standing on the other side of the cart, pulling up the feline\u2019s weight. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cHere, let me help you lift her off,\u201d</b></span> she offered, and the two of you started lifting with all your might. The powerful mienshao help definitely made this much easier, and soon enough, you had successfully lifted Silvia\u2019s gut from the cart with a plop, and gently dropped her onto the more comfortable, carpeted floor. The persian sighed in relief at this, trying to ignore the feeling of the mienshao eagerly rubbing along the side of her belly, pressing her ear against the skin. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cMmm\u2026 I can almost hear him in there\u2026\u201d</b></span> She noted, chuckling strangely as she heard the luxray\u2019s cries from within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next you checked, the Mienshao was practically pressing her snout into the pillowy flesh of the feline\u2019s belly, her labored breathing audible as she dug one of her long, flexibles arm between her thighs. With no digits to speak of, the best the mienshao was grind against her arm, overcome with sadistic glee as she listened to the luxray\u2019s prey and admired the persian\u2019s huge gut. The smell of the mienshao\u2019s sex made the tip of your own shaft involuntarily peek out of your sheathe, a tiny bit of pinkness revealing itself through your pure white fur. The mienshao\u2019s eyes lazily glance in your direction, though her position doesn\u2019t change by an inch. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cAlright\u2026 sorry, but I think it\u2019s a\u2019already time to c-cash in that f-favor\u2026\u201d</b></span> She said with a weird smile. She figured she\u2019d take some time to get to know her guests before she sent one of them to her gut, but she had become too horny to wait any longer. She finally manages to pry herself away from the persian\u2019s belly, hunched over as she faced you, her breathing growing labored. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cI-I\u2026 need you to\u2026\u201d</b></span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You backed away, wide-eyed, as the mienshao points down her waiting throat. She giggled, seeing the look on her face, cooling her down a bit. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cO-oh, come on. Don\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t see that coming,\u201d</b></span> she smirked, wrapping both her arms around your shoulders, holding you closer. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cYou seem like a smart guy. You knew what you were signing up for.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYeah\u2026 I did,\u201d</b> you admit, not sure how to feel as you try to pull your way out of her grip. You were getting uncomfortably excited at just the way she was teasing you. <b>\u201cI just\u2026 need a moment.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she pulls even closer, nuzzling your snout against her furry chest. Before you could react, she sends her long tongue along your face, covering your snout with her saliva. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cWho are you trying to fool? You couldn\u2019t take your eyes of your persian pal\u2019s gurlin\u2019 stomach this entire time. You live for this shit,\u201d</b></span> she teased, as she rested her tongue beneath your chin, so your snout is only inches away from entering her throat. The sheer smell, warmth, and moistness surrounding your snout was overwhelming, and you could only imagine what it was going to be like to feel this surrounding your entire body. Despite your horror, you were almost jittering with excitement, almost disappointed when the mienshao withdraws your snout from her maw. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cBe honest. You can\u2019t fuckin\u2019 <i>wait</i> to crawl down my throat and curl up in my warm, soft belly.\u201d</b></span> You gasp loudly as she suddenly grabs your package, running her paw along your shaft as it pokes out of your sheathe. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cBesides\u2026 <i>this</i> doesn\u2019t lie.\u201d </b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasped as she grabbed your manhood with a hand, slowly pumping her hand up and down your shaft. You knew she was right. You did desperately want to feel yourself slide into some gorgeous girl\u2019s stomach once more\u2026 but you got the feeling you couldn\u2019t trust this one any farther then you could throw her. The way she was trying to seduce you, and wear down your will until you were helpless to resist, made her think she probably didn\u2019t have your best interests in mind. Despite every inch of your body screaming at you to jump down her throat, your rational mind convinces you to try to escape from the mienshao\u2019s grip while you still can. <b>\u201cG-get off of me\u2026\u201d</b> You weakly insist, almost letting the words drip from your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled again, loving the feeling of having you wrapped around her finger. She knew you wanted this just as badly as she did, though you were loathe to admit it. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cAww, what\u2019s the matter? Are you trying to say you aren\u2019t enjoying this?\u201d</b></span> She said, as she keeps pumping her hand up and down your shaft. She keeps trying to tease you with views down her throat, but you keep pulling your head away, doing what little you can to avoid giving in. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cHonestly, you\u2019re a little <i>too</i> eager. You\u2019re already a few moments away from jizzing all over my nice, new carpet,\u201d</b></span> she giggled, your glistening, pink shaft now fully erect in her hand, <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cand that wouldn\u2019t be very polite, would it? Let\u2019s get you tucked away before you make a mess\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cN-no\u2026\u201d</b> You groan, trying to muster all of your willpower as you push the mienshao away from you. <b>\u201cG-get off me!\u201d</b> Unfortunately, even with all your will, the mienshao was far stronger than you were, and she didn\u2019t even find it particularly difficult to jerk her head forward and take your face completely in her maw. <b>\u201cMph!\u201d</b> You let out a muffled cry of surprise as your vision was shrouded with darkness as the mienshao\u2019s throat gripped tightly around your snout. You brace your paws against her chest in panic, trying to pull yourself free, but her throat\u2019s hold on you alone was too strong for you to resist. She took a few moments to fit in your horn, but before you knew it, she had shoved your entire head into her mouth with terrifying ease. She keeps beating you off painfully slowly as she worked more of you body into her throat; wanting to distract you, but also not wanting you to cum just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your entire head entered her throat, it felt like your skull was about to pop at any second. The pressure was just intense beyond belief, as her throat muscles squeezed and undulated around you. Your fur was also completely soaked with saliva, mucus and other foul-smelling juices, and the darkness only further disoriented you, making you forget which was up and down. Still, despite all this, pleasure was somehow the strongest sensation you felt. Her paws stroked you off with more dexterity and deliberateness then the persian had been able to manage, and your heart was beating out of your chest at the prospect of being sent to another Pokemon\u2019s stomach again, this time possibly for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long before your shoulders entered her throat\u2026 then your forepaws\u2026 then your ribs. She had obviously done this many times before, and with all her experience, gulping you down was practically a walk in the park. Thus, she felt more than comfortable taking her time and toying with you to her heart\u2019s content. Eventually, her maw squeezed widely around your rear, your furry white balls resting on her tongue. She obviously couldn\u2019t keep beating you off from your position, but she could do you one better. The corners of her stretched lips curled up into a smirk as she explored you with her tongue, sending it up between your pudgy cheeks and wrapping it around your shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you were much too far gone to even think about fighting back. Your brain has gone numb from lack of oxygen, increasing your raw pleasure tenfold, until you could hardly think about anything else. Some dim part of your brain recognized that you should be trying to escape, but instead, you started slowly grinding your hips against her tongue, desperate to finally feel some relief before she sends you to your new home. This time, she was more then happy to comply, trying to push you over the edge ASAP so she can finish sending you down her throat. Some part of you realized that you were doomed the second you came, and tried your best to hold back; but, of course, this was just as futile as you every other attempt to resist. Really, you were doomed to your fate the moment you entered her apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cum blended in with the saliva and juices already soaking the fur of your belly. Your legs visibly tensed up as you climaxed, before you went completely limp, your already addled brain basically going comatose as the last drop of energy was milked from you. She smirked at how easy the inexperienced absol boy was to control, as she leaned her head back, letting the pressure of gravity basically shove you, inch by inch, further down her throat. As your faculties slowly returned to you, you idly wished she would just get it over with. Compared to the interior of the mienshao\u2019s perfect body, the outside world seemed freezing cold. You just wanted to be surrounded by her comforting warmth completely, no matter the cost\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn\u2019t take very long for you to get your wish. Around the same time she finally closes her mouth around your hindpaws, you felt your snout pressing through a painfully tight sphincter. You could feel that ring agonizingly squeeze every inch of your body as you slowly slid into the mienshao\u2019s roomier belly, but eventually, you were sealed away inside her stomach completely. Your entire body only resulted in a moderate bulge in her belly, and she could easily be mistaken as pregnant. Locked away in the crushing darkness, the only thing your fractured mind could comprehend was the incredible warmth, which started at your skin before seeming to fill you, until your entire body, inside and out, tingled with the mienshao\u2019s warmth\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the persian had sadly averted her eyes throughout the entire process, unable to do anything as her only companion was swallowed alive before her. By the time she looked up at the mienshao, tears were streaming down her cheeks, soaking her fur. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cYou\u2026 you vow you\u2019re not going to harm him, right?\u201d</b></span> She practically begs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cPfft. Why even ask? You\u2019re immobile, so it\u2019s not like there\u2019s much you can do even if I say \u2018no\u2019,\u201d</b></span> the mienshao giggled as she pressed her paws down on her bulging gut, squeezing at the absol within. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cWell, if you\u2019re really so curious, I haven\u2019t decided what I\u2019m going to do with \u2018em yet. Perhaps you\u2019ll be able to help me decide, though, with a few more \u2018favors\u2019...\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever it takes to guarantee his safety,\u201d</b></span> she says without a moment\u2019s hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cThat\u2019s what I like to hear,\u201d</b></span> the mienshao smirked, pressing her paws into the side of the persian\u2019s belly. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cHere, let me roll ya over.\u201d</b></span> The persian was shocked by the mienshao\u2019s strength as she quickly rolled her over onto her back, until Silvia felt like she was being crushed by the weight of her own belly. Silvia gasped, the breath knocked out of her, clenching her eyes shut as she shuddered at the sensation of the luxray\u2019s renewed struggling. When she opened her eyes, she found herself staring up at the mienshao\u2019s dripping wet pussy. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cAlright, now. Take a deep breath!\u201d</b></span> The mienshao giggled, before suddenly dropping her ass down on the persian\u2019s face, almost crushing the feline\u2019s snout. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cAh!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, the horny mienshao was perfectly content to grind roughly against the persian\u2019s face, smothering Silvia beneath her weight as she rubbed her bulging belly up against the feline\u2019s. She was surprised, though, to feel the persian\u2019s tongue slip from her mouth once she realized what was happening, exploring the mienshao\u2019s sex. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cMm\u2026 oh\u2026 holy shit. Either you really care about this guy, or you\u2019re actually enjoying this,\u201d</b></span> she giggled, as she finally came to a decision...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The combined weight of both the mienshao and the absol within her belly was painfully crushing the persian\u2019s face, all while that absol cutie was brewing away in her guts, too overwhelmed by her incredible body to even resist. The sheer amount of <i>power</i> she had over the two Pokemon was intoxicating, and she was gasping and panting loudly with delight as she bounced her ass up and down on Silvia\u2019s face, her pussy enveloping the feline\u2019s snout and cutting off her air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite, or perhaps due, to the fact that she held both their lives in her cruel paws, the two were diligently serving her without complaint; the feline eagerly doing her best to please her with her long, smooth tongue, and the absol running his paws along the walls of her gut, massaging her from the inside. Unfortunately, this had the opposite effect than what they were probably hoping for. As the mienshao got hornier and hornier, her desire to digest her two guests only grew more intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t even try to restrain her digestive system, letting it run wild on you as it would any other bit of food. You immediately noticed something was off; the mienshao\u2019s stomach seemed a lot more <i>hostile</i> than the ninetale\u2019s was, almost scaldingly hot with very little air to breathe. The muscles of her belly also squeezed you painfully tight, and it didn\u2019t take long for you realize it was kneading her acid into your fur. You began struggling with what little strength you had left, but of course, all it accomplished was further arousing your predator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cMm\u2026 you better hurry up down here. It seems your boyfriend here\u2019s already starting to get gurgled away\u2026\u201d</b></span> She said, grinding against the persian\u2019s face with increasing vigor as her belly churned and gurgled loudly. Her belly, which had been perfectly round and still just a few moments ago, was now bulging and undulating erratically as the absol inside squirming with all his might. She was keeping him prisoner inside her powerful body\u2026 effortlessly digesting him, ending his life while he was too weak to resist, just to churn him up into pudge for her own pleasure. She felt like a <i>goddess</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cF-fuck\u2026 I hope\u2026 y-you never believed I\u2019d let you go\u2026\u201d</b></span> She finally admits, squeezing her thighs tighter around the persian\u2019s aching head. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cYour friend here\u2019s going to be\u2026 fat on my ass\u2026 and once he\u2019s done, you\u2019ll join him!\u201d</b></span> The mienshao cackled like a witch as she bounced on the persian\u2019s snout some more. For the mienshao, when something was digesting in her stomach, each orgasm only came easier than the last, resulting in her freezing and tensing up every minute or so, before she resumes her eager grinding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying that, though, might not have been the best idea. In truth, seeing the mienshao swallow someone down, and hearing the loud gurgling of her stomach, was starting to awaken those <i>predatory urges</i> within the persian. She had tried to resist in any way possible, but now that she had heard the mienshao\u2019s plans\u2026 there wasn\u2019t much point in holding back, was there? Besides, the mienshao smothering her with her pussy combined with the weight of the her belly pressing down on her chest was depriving the persian of air, further draining away any ounce of rational thinking she had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the persian went completely limp, her consciousness failing her. The mienshao was aroused by the idea of smothering the feline completely with her ass, but decided against it. She just had to be patient, and she\u2019d be able to feel the persian squirming around in her gut before she knew it. After reaching one last climax, the mienshao finally lifted herself off the persian\u2019s face, letting her snout slip free, now soaked to the bone in femjuices. The persian coughed a bit reflexively, though she seemed half-conscious at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cMm! Almost lost you there. Wouldn\u2019t want to end this too soon,\u201d</b></span> she said, practically panting. Every bone in her body ached from the activity, and she was panting in exhaustion, but she certainly wasn\u2019t done yet \u2014 not while you were still squirming, at least. Still, this seemed like a good time for a break. Eventually, the persian\u2019s consciousness slowly returned to her\u2026 but when she came to, she wasn\u2019t the same person any longer. Something had been awoken in the feline. The \u2018sinful\u2019 urges she once feared now ruled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mienshao eventually noticed the ninetales was already awake and staring at her, completely silently. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cOh? Already ready for round two?\u201d</b></span> She said, wandering back over the persian\u2019s head, toying with her clit with a paw as she stood over the feline. In return, the persian just stared at her, seeming strangely wild-eyed all of a sudden. <span class=\"cviolet\"><i>\u201cOkay\u2026 a little creepy,\u201d</i></span> she thought to herself, a bit put off by the persian\u2019s new demeanor. Did she sustain some brain damage or something? Not like it mattered, if she was going to be food soon. With a shrug, the mienshao straddled Silvia\u2019s head once again, before slamming her ass back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, though, she didn\u2019t feel herself collide on top of the helpless feline\u2019s snout. Instead, she only felt what seemed to be lips wrapping around her ass, with sharp teeth pressed against the soft skin of her cheeks. Shocked, the mienshao looked down, to realize that this time, the persian stretched her jaws all the way around her pelvis! <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cWhat the hell? Hey! Let go of me!\u201d</b></span> The mienshao cried out in shock, trying to push herself out of the feline\u2019s maw, even though her own weight was only pushing her deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe canine\u2019s tongue licked up her ass and slid against her sex, though this time it was simply out of a savage desire to \u2018savor\u2019 the mienshao\u2019s flavor. The mienshao was panicking when she realized just how strong the feline\u2019s grip on her was. This was impossible! She had battled with Pokemon multiple times her own size, and yet the simple feline\u2019s jaws were the strongest thing she\u2019d ever had to contend with. She was helpless to resist as the big cat stretched her maw even wider, accepting her rear entirely into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cN-no! This isn\u2019t fair!\u201d</b></span> The mienshao cried. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cI\u2019m the best pred on this whole fuckin\u2019 block! How can you be stronger than me?\u201d</b></span> Meanwhile, the maddened persian was fully dedicated to swallowing down her prey as quickly as she could, the mienshao\u2019s begging not even registering in her mind. As the persian\u2019s lips move up her belly, the mienshao\u2019s legs were pressed up against her sides, forcing her into a split that was painful even for the flexible, athletic martial arts pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mienshao considered calling for help. Surely, her neighbors would come running as soon as they heard her cry\u2026 but ultimately, her ego won out over her sense of self preservation. She didn\u2019t need anybody\u2019s help! She was one of the best fighters in the entire city! She\u2019d dealt with Pokemon a thousand times stronger than this pitiful, oversized housecat. She could easily handle this! Seeing that begging definitely wouldn\u2019t work, the mienshao tries unleashing every attack she has on the persian\u2019s gut before her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, her every move just bounced off Silvia\u2019s big, round belly, and by the time she thought to switch tactics, she was already in up to her chest in the persian\u2019s maw. Paradoxically, her huge, bulging belly only made it even easier for the persian to fit her deeper, her intense weight combined with the force of gravity forcing her down the persian\u2019s throat. With only a few more gulps, the rest of the mienshao\u2019s long torso was confined to the squeezing tightness of the persian\u2019s throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cN-no!\u201d</b></span> The mienshao cried, tears streaming down her cheeks as she was buried neck-deep in the feline\u2019s maw. She looked down at the huge bulge in the persian\u2019s neck, and realized that was <i>her</i>. That was a sneak peek of what she would look like once she was curled up in the persian\u2019s belly completely. Her pride destroyed, her only thought now was the horrors of digestion. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cPlease! Somebody! Hel-\u201d</b></span> She tried to call for help at the top of her lungs, but before she could attract her neighbor\u2019s attention, the persian snapped her jaws shut around her face. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cMph!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe persian\u2019s higher thinking abilities slowly started to return to her as she finished the busywork of forcing the mienshao (and in turn, you) down her throat. She immediately started gasping and panting as the mienshao was pressed into her stomach. She thought she had stretched her belly to its limit by swallowing the luxray, but she now had over 100 kg of meat in her stomach, far beyond what she thought was possible. Her belly was now almost four times larger than the rest of her entire body, and she felt like she was going to be crushed under her own weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mienshao sobbed as she\u2019s pressed through a tight sphincter, being unceremoniously dropped into the persian\u2019s stomach, being pressed up against the remaining bits and pieces of the half-digested luxray. Her prison grew even tighter when the persian managed to roll over again, using her own, huge belly like an oversized water bed. The desperate squirming of the mienshao only made her more exhausted\u2026 and it wasn\u2019t long until the persian drifted off into a food coma, dooming her meals to their fates.</span></div></div>",

She flinched slightly in her sleep, hoping that the sound would just go away if she ignored it, but it only grew more frantic. Eventually, she heard another sound; a muffled voice yelling, <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cRana! Ranaaa!\u201d</b></span> She was wrenched from her slumber with a start, gazing around in a dreamlike haze as she laid there, her surroundings completely unfamiliar to her\u2026 until the memories of the previous night slowly came back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cOh no\u2026\u201d</b></span> She whispered under her breath. Her worst case scenario had come true; she had lost control, devouring the mienshao whole, and in turn, also devouring her only friend. To make matters worse, it seems one of the mienshao\u2019s friends was here to check on her. The persian immediately tried to pull herself to her feet, only to be immediately taken off guard by her increased weight. Her own legs were struggling to support her! Just how much weight did she gain?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no time to figure that out, though. She could already hear the unexpected guest push open the front door of the apartment. Panic filled her, as Silvia used all of her strength to propel herself into the mienshao\u2019s bedroom, disappearing out of sight just in the nick of time. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cHey, do you think you could deal with whatever Issac\u2019s been blabbering about? He\u2019s been bugging the shit out of me,\u201d</b></span> she could hear the voice in the living room as she quietly slid the bedroom door closed. This door didn\u2019t seem to have a lock, so she\u2019d have to find a good hiding place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilvia quickly looked around the room, searching desperately for a place to hide\u2026 until she accidentally laid eyes on the full-body mirror leaned against one of the corners. She immediately froze up, stunned when she realized she couldn\u2019t even <i>recognize</i> herself! Like, her face was exactly the same as it always was, but the rest of her body looked completely different. She used to be so incredibly slim and sylphlike, and now she looked like a veritable tank of pudge. She resembled a millitank in physique, more than the sylphlike, dignified form persians usually have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe poked and prodded at her pudge, as if checking to see if it was real \u2014 even <i>seeing</i> couldn\u2019t make her believe this. Everything from her neck down seemed like it doubled in weight. The flesh along her sides seemed a few inches thicker, perhaps to support her immense belly. Her paunch was still huge and round, swaying back and forth beneath her with her every move. Wide-eyed, she poked at it, just to confirm that, yes, it was completely empty, her \u2018meal\u2019 from the previous night now just goo and bits of fur flowing through her colon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven looking at herself head-on in the mirror, though, she could clearly see her thick rear, meaning her hips were now by far the widest part of her body. She didn\u2019t even want to look, but\u2026 she had to assess the damage. Her cheeks jiggled even when she did something as simple as turn around, and looking over her shoulder, she could clearly see why; each cheek was now bigger than her head! She lifted her tail, staring at the veritable valley between her pillowy cheeks, her eyes drifting down to her lower thighs, which were similarly, sickeningly thick. It seems everything from her hock down went unaffected by the gains, which made it look like a miracle that her legs could even support her body at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must\u2019ve gained about 30 kg, and at least half of that must\u2019ve gone to her ass and thighs alone. She almost felt like crying as she looked into the mirror. <i>I look like a fat pig,</i> she thinks to herself. <i>In fact, that\u2019s exactly what I am. A fat pig who gurgled up everyone she\u2019s ever cared about.</i> <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cOh no, oh no, oh no\u2026\u201d</b></span> She said, horrified by the extra weight. Every bit of pudge was just a reminder of her mistake. She slops to her knees, whispering to her fat as if speaking with the spirits beyond. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cI-if you can hear this\u2026 I\u2019m so, so sorry. I\u2026 I\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if in reply, she suddenly chokes, feeling as if something is stuck in her throat. She starts hacking and coughing in surprise, and with her more stretchy throat, it didn\u2019t take her long to cough up the foreign object. It was covered in mucus and other juices, but when she stared at it, she realized she had just coughed up the absol\u2019s horn! This would almost be enough to make her cry again\u2026 until she was interrupted by that voice again. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201c... Rana? Rana, where are you?\u201d</b></span> It called out, sounding like whoever was out there was scouring the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe persian panicked, glancing around the bedroom once more for a place to hide\u2026 but the room was surprisingly spartan. There was no closet, and the mattress was on the floor for some reason. She couldn\u2019t fit behind any of the drawers or anything. Maybe she could jump out the window? Before she could continue with that thought, she was startled by a knocking on the bedroom door. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cUgh! Bitch is probably in a food coma\u2026\u201d</b></span> The voice growled. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cRana, get your fat ass out here! You better not have digested those poor pokemon!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Silvia, everything felt like it was moving in slow motion as the pokemon slid open the door. It was far too late to hide now; she already found herself staring that mightyena from last night in the eyes, the canine looking shocked to see her there. She had already searched every other room in the house, so the mienshao had to be in this bedroom. But the only pokemon here was that persian\u2026 that suddenly incredibly pudgy persian. It didn\u2019t take long for the mightyena to put two and two together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mightyena recoiled in shock as realized what had occurred. She\u2019d be relatively fine with it if only she knew it had been in self-defense, but unfortunately, she completely misinterpreted the entire situation. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cOh no...\u201d</b></span> She said, sounding both devastated and enraged in equal measures. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cY-you\u2019re one of Marden\u2019s thugs, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cWhat?\u201d</b></span> The persian blinked, taken aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cYou tricked Rana into bringing you here, and then you\u2026 you\u2026\u201d</b></span> The mightyena gasped, having to clench her eyes shut to staunch the flow of tears. When she opened them again, they were filled with rage, the mightyena practically foaming at the mouth with righteous fury at the death of her friend and lover. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cI\u2019ll <i>kill</i> you!\u201d</b></span> The canine practically roared as she leaped through the air towards Silvia. Terrified beyond belief, the persian finally tried to scream\u2026 only to feel a huge, fuzzy obstruction suddenly get shoved down her throat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take Silvia long to realize what had happened. When Silvia opened her mouth to scream, the mightyena went flying headfirst into her maw, which was so stretchy that it easily accepted the mightyena\u2019s entire upper body in a single moment! She was almost knocked off balance by the sheer force of the canine\u2019s accidental throat dive. The persian stood there in a daze as the mightyena\u2019s rear and legs dangled from her mouth, completely stiff as the canine was confused by her new dark, warm surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the mightyena realized what happened, she started squirming with all her might, all of her anger turning to desperation in a single moment. Of course, Silvia\u2019s primitive urges ruled her now, and it almost felt like her body acted of its own accord as she sat down, feeling her pudgy rear squish under her as she leaned her head back. Once the mightyena was lifted in the air, Silvia took a mighty swallow, which combined with the force of gravity plunged the unlucky canine deeper into the confines of her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mightyena\u2019s firm ass rested on the persian\u2019s tongue as she struggled with all her might. Her hind paws wriggled wildly, as she tried desperately to scratch at the persian with her sharpened claws, but just wasn\u2019t flexible enough to reach anything from her position. She was completely helpless as the persian swallowed again\u2026 and again\u2026 and again, bringing her in deeper and deeper with every belabored gulp. Soon, only her hind paws were left resting on the feline\u2019s tongue, before Silvia closed her mouth around them, sealing the mightyena entirely within her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe look in the mirror, watching in awe as the mightyena settled inside her stomach. Her belly was already fat enough that the canine didn\u2019t even make a bulge, besides the occasional kick pressing against the side. She moaned as she rubbed over the sensitive, distended skin with her forepaws, enjoying the struggles from within. For some reason, this time, swallowing a Pokemon felt\u2026 natural. She didn\u2019t feel ashamed of her huge, doughier body anymore. In fact, it made her feel\u2026 powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this new perspective, it was easy to rationalize the events of last night. After all, the absol she gurgled was already doomed anyway; better to be pudge on her body then on that horrid, sadistic mienshao\u2019s. Sure, she lost control, but she was just acting in self defense! Now, she almost giggled when she looked down at the absol\u2019s disembodied horn, lying on the ground in front of her. Perhaps it was a message from the beyond, reminding her not to beat herself up over something she couldn\u2019t control\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally, there was no point in mourning. She hadn\u2019t lost the absol; in fact, he was a part of her now. They\u2019d be closer than ever from now on! With a smile, she decided to take the horn with her as a keepsake as she trotted out of the apartment, happily showing off her big, bulging gut and jiggling fat. From here on out, she wouldn\u2019t be ashamed of devouring other Pokemon when she had to. She was a natural predator, and it was about time she\u2019d stop denying it\u2026 and it seemed that Marden\u2019s territory was the best place to start...</span></div></div>",

Still, just the fantasy of gurgling you away while suffocating your friend beneath her ass was enough to drive the mienshao mad. She grinded feverishly against the poor persian\u2019s face as she pressed her ear to the feline\u2019s stomach, listening to the dying sputters of the luxray within and imaging those sounds coming from her own gut. Every time the mienshao climaxed, the persian would only get a few second\u2019s break to enjoy the fresh air before the mienshao came down on her face again, thirsty for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, her stomach jiggled around you as she bounced, further disorienting you. Her moans were loud enough to be audible even between the thick skin of her belly, though, which reminded you that your rigid manhood still hasn\u2019t died down despite your dire straits. Despite the fact that the mienshao wasn\u2019t nearly so gentle with you, her belly had the same, surreal appeal as the ninetale\u2019s.

It was still achingly sensitive from your orgasm just a minute earlier, but you try to power through it, beginning to stroke your shaft up and down with your paws futilely, as if this would give you any true release. No\u2026 what you really craved, though you were loathe to admit it, was the ultimate relief. You wanted to melt away in the mienshao\u2019s stomach, and become nothing but fat on her perfect body. Then, perhaps, you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about the horrors of the outside world ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you knew that would only result in your death; so you had to be content with this for now. At this point, both you and the mienshao were pleasuring yourselves less to what was happening, and more to the thought of what <i>could</i> happen, if only the mienshao threw all her inhibitions aside and started gurgling you away. It was probably fortunate that neither of you ended up giving in to temptation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilvia was definitely getting the raw end of this deal. While the two of you were panting away in pleasure, the persian was buried snout deep in mienshao muff, her tongue already sore from her futile attempts to exhaust the mienshao\u2019s seemingly bottomless lust. The miserable persian tried to remember that she deserved this; after everything she\u2019s done, after all the Pokemon she\u2019s devoured, this could only be considered an act of penance. Thus, not an ounce of indignation passed through her mind; in fact, she was almost <i>grateful</i> to the mienshao for the abuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching your climax, you push your manhood tightly up against the walls of the mienshao\u2019s stomach, humping against the unbelievably soft, squishy pink rugae once you were properly positioned. You could practically feel the walls of her belly pushing back against your shaft, rhythmically spasming and undulated around your manhood as you pressed it into the wall. With your humping, it only took you a few moments more before you reached another climax. After that, there was only a few minute\u2019s gap inbetween orgasm after orgasm, the thrill of knowing you could be digested at any moment giving you an almost \u2018adrenaline rush\u2019 of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven despite the incredible sensations you were both experiencing, it didn\u2019t take too much longer for you and the mienshao to finally run out of stamina. The mienshao finally gasped as one last climax made her practically fall off the persian\u2019s face, lying motionless and panting on the carpet as the persian coughed and sputtered as she was finally allowed fresh air. At almost the same time, your fifth orgasm finally sapped you of your strength, and you went limp, letting her belly squeeze around you freely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mienshao laid there for quite a while, in a state of deep, truly relaxing half-consciousness. Eventually she came to, giggling as she sat up and noticed her hips were extremely sore. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, kitty cat? You don\u2019t look like you had much fun,\u201d</b></span> she giggled as she pulled herself to her feet, seeing the miserable look stuck on the persian\u2019s face. She patted her gut as she loomed over the feline, a smug smirk on her face. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cWell, me and your boyfriend here certainly did.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe persian groaned. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cHe's\u2026 not\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cDon\u2019t care, to be honest,\u201d</b></span> the mienshao interrupted, leaning up against the persian\u2019s huge, round gut, crossing her arms. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cNow, let\u2019s go over what will happen tonight.\u201d</b></span> She started circling around the persian as she spoke, admiring the helpless feline\u2019s body. \u201cYou\u2019re going to sleep in my room. You\u2019ll be locked in there, so I can be sure you won\u2019t try to swallow me the second you can move again.\u201d The persian grimaced at the revelation. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cIn the meantime, I\u2019ll ponder over what to do with your boyfriend. Guess you\u2019re just going to have to wait in suspense \u2018till the morning\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she reached the persian\u2019s other side, she press her paws against the feline\u2019s belly. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cAlright, now. Let\u2019s get you rolling,\u201d</b></span> she giggles, using every ounce of her impressive strength to literally roll the persian slowly through the house, amused as she further torments and humiliates the poor cat. Eventually, the mienshao shoved her into her bedroom unceremoniously. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cGood night, darling. Ta ta! It\u2019s been fun!\u201d</b></span> She waves with a smirk as she slides the door closed, before locking it tight from the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the persian taken care of for the night, the mienshao hops onto her couch, idly watching whatever dumb thing was currently on the TV while she rubbed comfortably over her huge, bulging gut. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cGood night, big guy. You need some rest,\u201d</b></span> she smiled, planting a brief kiss on her own belly where she thought your head probably was. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cWho knows? Maybe you\u2019ll even wake up in one piece. Hehehe!\u201d</b></span> She giggles as she stretched out and rested her eyes, enjoying the feeling of your weight resting atop her as she slowly dozed off\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yawned as you curled up in the woman\u2019s stomach, trying to get as comfortable as you can giving your hostile, constantly changing surroundings. Her \u2018teasing\u2019 - or, as it could be called at this point, \u2018threats\u2019 - of digestion neither frightened nor excited you at this point. You\u2019ve accepted your fate. Whatever happens, happens. If the mienshao decides to churn you up into pudge, you were perfectly fine with that. With that almost comforting feeling of resignation, it didn't take long for you to pass out as well\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u2504\u2504\u2504</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mienshao woke up early, feeling refreshed. She was almost disappointed to look down and see her stomach still just as bulging and form as ever; some part of her had been hoping she \u2018accidentally\u2019 gurgled\u2019 you up in her sleep. Still, it seems you were a survivor, and the mienshao couldn\u2019t really justify keeping you inside her for any longer. She wandered over to her bathroom, knowing she had to release the slumbering absol from her stomach\u2026 but how? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Locked away inside her dark, tight stomach, you were able to feel into a deeper, more relaxing slumber then thought possible. You felt like you could sleep forever in there\u2026 and you probably would\u2019ve, had the mienshao not jiggled her belly and torn you from your restful sleep. Your eyes shot open, your half-conscious mind confused by your surroundings for a moment, until the familiar grunts and groans of the mienshao\u2019s body around you reminded you of exactly where you were. It sounded like she was struggling to climb into a big, ceramic tub, although her hefty belly made things difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she settled in, and you thought you would be able to get some more sleep\u2026 until you started feeling her entire stomach shift around you! It felt like your cramped little prison was turning inside out, as soon you felt that tight sphincter squeezing painfully over every centimeter of your body once again. This time, the relentless, powerful muscles of her throat were pulling you in entirely the opposite direction\u2026 and though you were too dazed to fully register what was happening, you eventually saw light at the end of the tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, your head emerged back into the mienshao\u2019s maw, soaked to the bone with saliva to the point that you were hardly recognizable. You looked like a newborn kit for a moment, your fur slicked back, your eyes clenched shut, your ears pressed against your head\u2026 at least, until the rest of your body started sliding free from the mienshao\u2019s throat. The mienshao gagged and shuddered as she pulled you out bit by bit, like a clown pulling a handkerchief from their throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, your torso was free\u2026 then your thighs... and eventually, you fell entirely onto the floor of the tub with a grisly belch. She started hacking and coughing as you laid there, clutching at her sore throat. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cAh! Oh, almost tore up my throat there\u2026\u201d</b></span> She complained. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cAlways a lot less fun comin\u2019 up then goin\u2019 down\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t even bear to open your eyes, the dimly-lit bathroom achingly bright compared to her dark belly. It felt freezing cold in comparison, too, and the ceramic floor of the tub felt hard and uncomfortable compared to the snugly walls of the mienshao\u2019s stomach. <b>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d</b> You said, part of you wishing you could\u2019ve just stayed in there forever. While you got your bearings, the mienshao turned the shower head on, letting cool water rain down on the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cWell, welcome back to the real world sport! I hope you enjoyed your stay,\u201d</b></span> the mienshao said, sitting down on the far side of the tub. To your surprise, the mienshao soon picked you up and placed you gently on her lap. Before you could ask what she was doing, she rubbed shampoo all over her hands and ran her paws through the greasy, sticky fur atop your head. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cProbably a busy day today. Let\u2019s go ahead and get you washed off\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat you on your lap, the weird feeling between your legs intensified. Despite the brightness, you manage to squint your eyes open slightly, to see your manhood fully unsheathed, as rigid as it can get. Your back being pressed up against the mienshao\u2019s furry chest made this all the more awkward \u2014 surely, she must\u2019ve noticed? <b>\u201cI-I can wash myself\u2026\u201d</b> You protest in a quiet, exhausted voice, using what little was left of your strength to wriggle in her grip slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cHeh, what? You\u2019re a quadruped. Do you know how to use this?\u201d</b></span> She laughed, holding a shampoo bottle up in front of your face. You shook your head weakly. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cThought so. Now don\u2019t be stubborn.\u201d</b></span> She went back to scrubbing all the various gastric juices off of you, and despite your hesitations, you found yourself melting into her touch. Sitting on her lap and leaning against her furry body while she was washed you off was actually quite relaxing, and her intentions seemed rather innocent. With a sigh, you lean back in relaxation, almost falling back to sleep until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cAh!\u201d</b> You gasped quietly when you felt eventually wrap a hand around your shaft. You still didn\u2019t even open your eyes, although you did tense up at her touch. <b>\u201cW-what...?\u201d</b> You stuttered weakly as you felt her paw slide slowly up your manhood, while cold water continues to flow over your bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cRelax. I\u2019m just helping ya out. Always want to start the day feeling refreshed, no?\u201d</b></span> She giggled, cuddling you against her as she reached a hand between your legs. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cI\u2019m sure your girlfriend won\u2019t mind\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite your surprise, you weren\u2019t entirely averse to what she was doing. This was still nothing compared to what she put you and Silvia through last night. <b>\u201c... she\u2019s not my girlfriend\u2026\u201d</b> You sigh as you try your best to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cHehe! I know, I know. Hell, the way she munched carpet last night, I\u2019d hazard a guess she doesn\u2019t even swing your way,\u201d</b></span> she giggles as she slowly picks up the pace, laying her head on your shoulder and nuzzling your cheek with hers as she admires your vibrant, pink shaft. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cStill, she\u2019s really missing out. Damn\u2026\u201d</b></span> You couldn\u2019t tell if she was genuinely impressed, or if she was just teasing you some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remained completely still, as if still trying to get some sleep, though your breathing grows belabored as she very slowly, gently slides her soft paw up your slick shaft. <b>\u201cMm\u2026\u201d</b> You groan, spreading your legs slightly, leaning back against the mienshao\u2019s chest. She giggled, seeing you were getting into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cYou\u2019re still so pent up. You must\u2019ve really liked it in my belly, huh?\u201d</b></span> She said, starting to pump your shaft every so slightly faster as she hugs you close. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cDid you like the comfort of being locked away from the world, thinking I\u2019d keep you safe? Or maybe you liked the peril of being at the mercy of my stomach, knowing it\u2019s gurgled up plenty of cuties just like you in the past...\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cR-really\u2026?\u201d</b> You asked, your eyes finally sliding open slightly. You weren\u2019t sure why you would be surprised she\u2019s actually digested people in the past; she was obviously an extremely experienced predator. Still, you weren\u2019t exactly sure how to feel about that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cOh, of course. More than you can count, all added to my perfect body...\u201d</b></span> She smiled, letting you sink into the slightly pudgy fur of her chest and belly. The thought of all those dozens of Pokemon being added to her gorgeous body was incredible to you, though you knew it was wrong. Involuntarily, you started slowly grinding your hips back and forth. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cGoodness. You like that, don\u2019t you? Thinking of all the souls lost to this jiggling belly you\u2019re pressed against. Hehe!\u201d</b></span> She giggled, stroking faster in response. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. Just relax. Let it all out\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clenched your ears shut again as you humped weakly, her hand easily sliding up and down your dick as you sat on her lap, feeling the sensations become more intense as your senses returned to you. You soon realized you were on the edge of climax, and the mienshao was only stroking up and down your dick harder and harder. Before you could get a word in, you tense up and gasp as prodigious streams of jizz streaked across the tub, quickly getting washed down the drain by the cool water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued stroking your shaft for a few minutes as she nuzzled against your cheek, before finally pulling away, realizing her own paw was now covered in cum. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cGood boy. That wasn\u2019t so bad, was it?\u201d</b></span> She smiled, holding you close. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cNow let\u2019s get you cleaned off. For real, this time.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were only half-lucid as she went back to washing you off while you panted quietly, completely limp. Whatever tiny bit of energy you had left, your orgasm had completely sucked from you. You phased in and out of unconsciousness as the mienshao finished running soap through your fur, before she finally climbed out of the tub, letting you lay there and rinse. About a half hour later, you finally worked up the energy to climb out of the shower, feeling rested and refreshed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dry off, leaving your white fur looking more shiny and pristine then it\u2019s ever been as far as you could remember. Damn\u2026 you\u2019d never tried this \u2018shampoo\u2019 thing before, but you really had to more often. You looked great! Once you were finished admiring yourself in the mirror, you waltzed out into the living room, seeing the mienshao lounging around on the couch, watching the television. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cGood morning, sleepyhead,\u201d</b></span> she greeted when she saw you walk lazily out of the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cHey,\u201d</b> you said, rubbing the sleep from your eyes. <b>\u201cYou know where Silvia is?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cYou mean your girlfriend?\u201d</b></span> She smirks, and you roll your eyes. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cWhy, she\u2019s right in there\u2026\u201d</b></span> She points to her bedroom door. Wait\u2026 has Silvia been locked in there this entire time? Sure enough, the door was locked from the outside when you got to it. Damn it. As\u2026 <i>allurin</i>g as the mienshao is, you had to remind yourself that she seemed to have zero consideration for anybody other than herself. You quickly unlock the door for the persian, peeking into the mienshao\u2019s bedroom...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Overnight, you were so deep in your slumber that you didn\u2019t even notice the mienshao\u2019s body pulling you deeper through her digestive system, squeezing you through her pyloric sphincter while you were too limp to resist. Her body seemed frustrated that the mienshao would swallow down such a large, hearty meal without letting it digest, but tolerated it anyway, her small intestine straining to contain the massive obstruction. Luckily, you were asleep through much of this process, so you didn\u2019t have to languish for hours in the utter tightness as her muscles squeezed you slowly through her intestines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until hours later, when you were resting in her colon, that you were awoken by the mienshao slapping at her jiggling belly. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cGoooood morning! I hope you\u2019ve been enjoying your \u2018trip\u2019, because you\u2019re in the homestretch now,\u201d</b></span> she said, while busily brushing her teeth in the bathroom. Spitting into the sink, she continued, <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cHave you guessed where you are, yet?\u201d</b></span> She giggled as she rubbed over her cheeks with her paws, admiring her ass in the mirror, feeling you trapped somewhere in her winding intestines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cUnless you want to literally be trapped in my ass forever, I suggest you start crawling,\u201d</b></span> she said. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cBesides, all your wriggling is starting to make me nauseous.\u201d</b></span> With that, she grabbed a book from her shelf and set on the edge of the bathtub, waiting for you to complete your journey. You grimaced as you analyzed the soft, pink walls of the tight tunnel. Could you really be in her colon? It was a lot cleaner than you\u2019d imagine, but still unpleasantly tight, much more so than even her belly. You definitely didn\u2019t want to be stuck in here for too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start slowly shimmering and wriggling through the winding tunnel, feeling you\u2019re crawling your way out of Shawshank State Penitentiary. The journey was short, but there was a curve in the way that stifled your progress, as her colon was wrapped around her small intestines. The mienshao couldn\u2019t help but flinch and shudder at the sensation of you forcing your way through her body, but luckily, it wasn\u2019t long before you made your way around both turns in her twisting colon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you see her tailhole from an entirely new perspective as you finally make your way to her rectum. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cYou made it? Good, I was getting impatient. If you had taken any longer, I might\u2019ve just dragged you back to my stomach \u2014 for <i>good</i>!\u201d</b></span> She said, feeling a pressure in her colon. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cHeh\u2026 well, let\u2019s get ya out of there.\u201d</b></span> The sphincter was used to squeezing Pokemon your size in and out of the mienshao\u2019s persians, so it didn\u2019t take long for your head and horn to slip free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled as she admires her rear in the mirror. It was a humiliating sight, with only your head poking out between the mienshao\u2019s cheeks. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cHehe! Like this look, actually,\u201d</b></span> she said, squishing her soft cheeks together around your head. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cMight just leave ya like this and take a walk around town!<i> That\u2019d</i> be an interesting morning.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cPlease\u2026 just get this over with\u2026\u201d</b> You said, tired of the mienshao constantly toying with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed, seeing your frustration. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cAlright, buzzkill. I\u2019ll stop with the teasing,\u201d</b></span> she said, before spreading her cheeks and putting all her effort into squeezing you out. You felt the tight sphincter squeeze painfully around each part of your body as it slid down your form. Your chest\u2026 your belly\u2026 your groin\u2026 your legs. You clenched your eyes shut as she \u2018deposited\u2019 you into her bathtub, trying to power through the embarrassment. This was probably the most humiliated you\u2019ve felt in your life\u2026 and with all that\u2019s happened in the past few days, that was saying a lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before you landed in the tub completely, and covered your face with your paws in shame as the mienshao loomed over you. At least you were still pretty clean, aside from the usual saliva and mucus that you\u2019d expect from getting swallowed up. To make matters worse, you had a bad case of morning wood from the delightful dreams you had within the mienshoa\u2019s belly, and the squeezing of her colon had only exacerbated the issue. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cOooh! You look like you need some privacy,\u201d</b></span> she giggles, seeing your rigid shaft pressed up against your belly. True to her word, though, she walked to the door without any further teasing. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cAlright, now. You should go ahead and get washed up. I\u2019ll be in the living room if you need me.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed the bathroom door, finally leaving you alone. That was a relief, at least; nobody else had to witness your shame now. You lazily sit up and turn the shower on with a paw, shivering as freezing cold water blasted you for a few moments, before warming up to a more comfortable temperature. Before you started your new day, you definitely wanted to make sure you washed the mienshao\u2019s juices off you\u2026 but first, you had to deal with your manhood again. You sighed as you leaned against the walls of the shower, pressing your paws around your shaft once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just wanted one last bit of release, and you\u2019d be ready to put all this behind you. You let the warm water wash over your fur as you stroked yourself off, just wanting to get this over with as soon as possible. You tried to clear your mind, but your thoughts always drifted back to the events of the previous night. You were kind of excited by how sadistically the mienshao toyed with you, forcing both you and the persian to submit to her utterly and completely. Still, it made you miss the ninetales all the more. You definitely wouldn\u2019t trust the mienshao to swallow you again; you weren\u2019t sure she had to willpower to consistently avoid digesting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot like you hated the idea, of course. In fact, the prospect of being gurgled up completely by the mienshao\u2019s gorgeous, powerful body drove you wild. It was hard to describe just how mind-numbingly excited that thought made you. Your paws were almost shaking too hard for you to paw yourself off, just imagining yourself being turned into nothing but a useless, jiggling bit of pudge on the mienshao\u2019s ass, ruining her athletic figure until she finally works you off and you\u2019re forgotten forever\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp loudly as that simple image in your head drives you to splatter hot jizz all over the floor of the shower. You went stiff for a moment, before collapsing against the smooth, tiled wall, catching your breath as the shower washed your cum down the drain. It took you awhile to work up the energy to even open your eyes, and even when you did, all you could do was stare idly at the ceiling as your faculties returned to you. With a groan, you eventually pull yourself to your feet, getting to work washing yourself off, trying to clean away any evidence of what you\u2019ve been through\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped out of the shower a while later, a towel draped over your back. The mienshao was crashing on the couch, watching some dumb show, but you weren\u2019t interested in her at the moment. You wanted to make sure Silvia was okay, first and foremost. With a sigh, you unlock the mienshao\u2019s bedroom, slowly pushing the door open with your forepaws...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you step into the bedroom, you\u2019re immediately alarmed by the sound of the persian sobbing. You rush in, wondering if she\u2019s injured or something, only to find her sitting on the bed, rubbing over her expanded paunch with tears streaming down her face. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cOh, Arceus\u2026 oh no\u2026\u201d</b></span> She was whimpering to herself. You stood there, confused, until you realized she was looking at herself in the long, full-body mirror in the corner of the room. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cWhat have I done\u2026?\u201d</b></span> Just as you were about interrupt, the persian stands, and you were shocked into silence when you were suddenly given a good look at her \u2018new form\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d never imagined the scrawny, chaste persian looking like\u2026 <i>this</i>. It was like you were looking at a whole new Silvia. Her belly had obviously churned away that Luxray completely, almost doubling the persian\u2019s weight to about 60 kg. Every part of her body looked soft and pillowy, now, a few extra centimeters of pudge thickening her up. She even seemed to have grown a few inches, though you might be mistaken on that one.your mind might be playing tricks on you on that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took all of the details in in a single moment. Her belly was the most immediately noticeable; even though her prey had long ago been gurgling up, she still had quite a potbelly. Notably, her belly didn\u2019t have any rolls or anything; her paunch was perfectly smooth and round, jiggling and swaying beneath her whenever she moved. As she turned to face you, you couldn\u2019t help but notice her rear end in the mirror. When she was a nun, she was quite scrawny, with an ass as flat as a board\u2026 but now? Each cheek was wider than your head, and even at near the knees where her thighs were thinnest, they were still wider than any part of your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as you tried to suppress them, a thousand fantasies flashed through your mind in a single instant. You wanted her to smother you beneath that belly\u2026 you wanted her to bury your face between those cheeks\u2026 you wanted to lose yourself in her body, melting away into the soft furry skin, adding to her perfect shape. You clenched your eyes shut and looked away, ashamed of your feelings. What is wrong with you? Silvia was miserable right now, and you were just\u2026 <i>fantasizing</i> about her. Truly, that damned mienshao must\u2019ve corrupted your mind. You immediately went about trying to make things right, walking in to console the poor feline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cSilvia!\u201d</b> You called out as you locked eyes. As you looked into her beautiful, icy blue eyes, you noticed none of the weight seemed to go to her face, leaving her just as gorgeous as ever. <b>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cNooohoho\u2026\u201d</b></span> She cried, the fur of her cheeks wet with tears. She hated looking so <i>unladylike</i> in front of anybody, but she just couldn\u2019t compose herself. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201c<i>Look</i> at me!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cJeez, Silvia. It\u2019s not that bad,\u201d</b> you sympathized, walking closer as you admit, <b>\u201cI think you still look... beautiful.\u201d</b> Really, you wanted to tell her she looked more beautiful then ever now that she\u2019s added the luxray to her body, but you figured that would be creepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s not <i>that</i>. It\u2019s just\u2026 seeing myself like this\u2026\u201d</b></span> She says, looking down at her rounded gut with utter contempt in her eyes. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cIt reminded me of\u2026 what I looked like after Noelia.\u201d</b></span> She practically spat vitriol at herself through her tears. Your ears folded against your head as you froze in place, almost afraid to come any closer. You\u2019ve never seen her like this, even when she was at her most self-loathing. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cIt reminds me of how much she must\u2019ve suffered because of my mistakes. How much all my \u2018meals\u2019 suffered. It reminds me of what a disgusting, gluttonous excuse for a prioress I always was.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder as she practically hissed those words. <b>\u201cArceus, Silvia\u2026\u201d</b> You say, trying to come up with the words to respond. <b>\u201cYou can\u2019t shoulder the whole responsibility like that. I know you probably held yourself up to high standards, y\u2019know, being holy and all\u2026 but you\u2019re not perfect, and that\u2019s fine. You\u2019re still way a way better person than every other Pokemon I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</b> You sigh. <b>\u201cI mean\u2026 you can\u2019t change the past, you know? You can only try to make things better from now on.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe persian just stared at the ground, the shame on her face unflinching. You could tell that she wasn\u2019t really impressed by a word you just said, but at least you\u2019d managed to distract her from her self-loathing for a few moments. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cY-yeah\u2026\u201d</b></span> She says, the tears still streaming down her face. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cI just\u2026 I need a minute.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause, trying to come up with something else to say, but sigh when you can\u2019t think of anything. <b>\u201cAlright. Tell me if you need anything,\u201d</b> you say, pulling the door mostly shut as you walked out of the room. Still trying to get your own emotions in check, you walk silently over and hope shakily onto the couch beside the mienshao.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You looked shell-shocked,\u201d</b></span> she raises a brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUh\u2026 Silvia digested that luxray, and she\u2019s a lot\u2026 bigger, now,\u201d</b> you say, simply, trying to organize your thoughts. <b>\u201cShe\u2019s pretty torn up about it.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cEh, she won\u2019t be like that forever. Preds are always the chubbiest the day after a big meal,\u201d</b></span> she shrugs. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cOver the next week, she\u2019ll lose a few kg naturally, \u2018till she\u2019s only slightly chubby. After that, though, she\u2019ll have to work out to get as scrawny as she used to be.\u201d</b></span> You and the mienshao sat there for almost half an hour as the sun rose, before a knock on the door roused you from your laziness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cRana! Ranaaa!\u201d</b></span></i> You hear a familiar voice on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cCome in!\u201d</b></span> The mienshao called, too lazy to even sit up. You hear the door electronically click unlocked, that same mightyena you saw last night waltzing inside like she owned the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cHey, do you think you could deal with whatever Issac\u2019s been blabbering about? He\u2019s been bugging the shit out of me,\u201d</b></span> the mightyena asked as she enters, before pausing when she laid her eyes on you. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cOh, well <i>you\u2019re</i> a sight for sore eyes!\u201d</b></span> She smirked when she saw you sitting on the couch. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cGlad to see you survived the night, cutie!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201c... why wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</b> You raised a brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard? You should never let a strange predator lure you into their den. Who knows what they might do?\u201d</b></span> The mienshao tested, wrapping an arm around your shoulder. Before you could reply, the mienshao made her way for the door. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cAlright, well, I guess I\u2019ll talk to Issac. Take care of our guest here while I\u2019m out, would ya?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cWith pleasure,\u201d</b></span> the mightyena smiled. You felt a little uncomfortable being left alone with the wolf, but the mienshao had left the door wide open, so you could always call for help if things went south.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cOh, so you live together?\u201d</b> You asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cEh, technically I don\u2019t live anywhere,\u201d</b></span> she said, hopping up onto the couch next to you, <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cbut everybody at Faded Grove is like family, so\u2026 I pretty much get unlimited couch surfing privileges.\u201d</b></span> She spins around in place for a while, until she\u2019s lays down and curls up on the couch, half paying attention to the television. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cHow about you? Live in some tree or something, I\u2019m assuming?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWow, actually, yeah,\u201d</b> you say, surprised at her lucky guess. <b>\u201cThough, uh\u2026 I\u2019ve definitely come to prefer it in the cities.\u201d</b> Her tail wags absently behind her, and you could tell she \u2018enjoyed\u2019 your company, though you didn\u2019t quite know why. <b>\u201cSo\u2026 what do you think that ampharos is so worried about?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cOh, probably somethin\u2019 about Adriana,\u201d</b></span> she shrugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour words catch in your throat. You feel like you\u2019ve been woken from a daze. You knew there\u2019s something you\u2019ve been forgetting, but you just couldn\u2019t put your finger on it. The ninetales! She could be dead by now\u2026 or worse! <b>\u201cAdriana? T-the ninetales?\u201d</b> You gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cYeah. What, you haven\u2019t heard? She got captured by Marden\u2019s goons yesterday, and-\u201d</b></span> She said, nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve heard, I was there!\u201d</b> You insisted, jumping off the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cW-what?\u201d</b></span> She stuttered, taken aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201c<i>Fuck</i>, how could I have wasted so much time?\u201d</b> You panicked. <b>\u201cI came here <i>looking</i> for Adriana!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mightyena looked a little uncomfortable, her ears folding against the back of her head. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cWell\u2026 if you really witnessed Adriana get captured, you can give testimony to Rana when she comes back. I\u2019m sure that will help us find her...\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cNo! I need to help! I\u2019m her <i>friend</i>!\u201d</b> You insisted. Of course, you didn\u2019t quite know if she\u2019d consider you a friend\u2026 but she was probably the person you were the closest to in the world besides your family, so she had to count. Besides, you were travelling together when she got caught, so you felt it was your responsibility. You grit your teeth as you walked to the door, willing to put life and limb on the line to rescue Adriana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cUh\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t recommend interrupting Rana!\u201d</b></span> The mightyena yelled from the couch, a little concerned, but you ignored her completely, resolute in your ambition. You stomped out into the hallway, your heart racing at the possibility that the ninetales might already be dead...</span></div></div>",

You can faintly hear Rana\u2019s voice within, and she sounds absolutely terrified. You can only assume the worst as you peek inside, eavesdropping on their conversation. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cThe miracle machine worked. Adriana was successfully impregnated,\u201d</b></span> the ampharos delivered the bad news, his voice sounding shaky but resolute. You were completely caught off guard. Impregnated? Why the hell would she be pregnant? You were worried she might be dead!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mienshao presses a hand against her head, obviously mortified by the news. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cSo\u2026 it\u2019s viable, then? Marden\u2019s going to have a cub?\u201d</b></span> You were used to Rana looking so smug and confident.

We\u2019re not ready for this! Half of our manpower\u2019s been eaten, and the mayor\u2019s not going to listen to a damned word we say...\u201d</b></span> Eventually, her aimless pacing around the room resulted in her suddenly locking eyes with you! Both of you froze in place, shocked. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cY-you?\u201d</b></span> She stuttered. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI-I\u2019m just\u2026\u201d</b> You try to explain yourself, only for the mienshao to suddenly pounce! You yelp in pain as she pins you  to the floor of the hallway, sitting on your belly as she holds you down. <b>\u201cAgh!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cYou were eavesdropping! You\u2019re some kind of spy, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</b></span> She growls down at you, all of her bottled-up fear turning into anger. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cI fuckin\u2019 knew it. Like it was a coincidence two \u2018wild\u2019 Pokemon would-\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cN-no!\u201d</b> You cry out, covering your face with your paws, terrified by the knowledge that the martial arts Pokemon could just snap your neck in an instant, if she so desired. <b>\u201cAdriana\u2026 I\u2019m her friend!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe freezes, taken aback by this, her rage subsiding. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cWhat?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWe were travelling together! I was with her when she got captured!\u201d</b> To your embarrassment, a few tears rolled down your cheeks as you explained yourself, terrified. <b>\u201cI-I want to help!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks down at you, her eyes twitching, as if she\u2019s not sure whether to believe you or to kill you. Eventually, she sighed, deciding that you seemed to be genuine, and climbed off of you. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</b></span> She stepped back into the apartment, gesturing for you to follow. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to need every last detail, then.\u201d</b></span> You shakily pull yourself to your feet, the wind still knocked out of you by the mienshao\u2019s pounce. When you recover, you follow her inside, making sure to close the door behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Pokemon stared silently at you, expectantly. Feeling tiny beneath their gaze, you clear your throat and nervously begin to explain yourself. <b>\u201cMe and Adriana\u2026 we happened to run into eachother while we were travelling. Hid together from some scolipede,\u201d</b> you explained. <b>\u201cIt turned out that we were headed for the same place; Shipton City. So, we just decided\u2026 why not travel together?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cYou\u2019re fortunate she didn\u2019t just swallow you. Adriana isn\u2019t usually one to trust random Pokemon,\u201d</b></span> the ampharos noted. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cDid you happen to witness her capture?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI didn\u2019t see it myself, but I was there,\u201d</b> you admit. <b>\u201cWe were sleeping at the monastery outside Shipton, when it was attacked. She tried to fight back, but she was swallowed up by that same scolipede.\u201d</b> You shivered, sadly recalling the grisly memories. <b>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s all my fault, isn\u2019t it? We never would\u2019ve stopped there if I hadn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cThere\u2019s no time to go feeling sorry for yourself,\u201d</b></span> the mienshao grumbled. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cJust tell us; do you have any idea where they might have taken her?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cThe scolipede traveled towards Shipton. Beyond that, I don\u2019t know,\u201d</b> you confess. The two seem disappointed. <b>\u201cBut\u2026 I can help you find her! I\u2019m not very good at fighting\u2026 but I am pretty good at sneaking around!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mienshao stroked her chin. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d</b></span> She muttered, contemplatively. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cSo\u2026 did she tell you what her deal is with Marden?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cKind of. They were mates. He was crazy. She escaped. That\u2019s all I know,\u201d</b> you shrug. <b>\u201cShe\u2026 did show me what happened to her eyes. It wasn\u2019t pretty.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cShe actually took off that blindfold for ya? Shit, maybe she really did trust you\u2026\u201d</b></span> She raised a brow, looking surprised. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cWell, here\u2019s something she might not have told you \u2014 before she escaped, she vowed to find a way to carry his cubs. That\u2019s why Marden\u2019s been putting so much effort into finding old mystery machine schematics.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cMiracle machine?\u201d</b> You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cThe MM, uh, bridges the gap between sexually incompatible Pokemon. You don\u2019t need to know the details, they\u2019re actually quite grisly,\u201d</b></span> the ampharos explains. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cThe point is, now that his lineage is guaranteed, there\u2019s nothing stopping Marden from making a move on the civilized districts.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201c... what?\u201d</b> You blinked, uncomprehending, feeling hopelessly out of your element.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mienshao sighed in exasperation, not wanting to keep explaining things to a clueless absol when time is of the essence. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cAlright, listen. You want to help, don\u2019t you? Here\u2019s your chance,\u201d</b></span> she said, obviously at the end of her patience. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a guy working undercover in Marden\u2019s territory. I need you to sneak through there, find him, see if he has any intel, and deliver an envelope.\u201d</b></span> She grabs some paper and quickly scribbles something on it, before stuffing it in an envelope. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to meet him in the alleyway between the Figment theater and the BuzBros. Think you can do that?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t even know where Marden\u2019s territory is,\u201d</b> you sheepishly admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mienshao sighed, grabbing another piece of paper and dumping both on your back. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cHere\u2019s a map. Now get moving. We don\u2019t have much in the way of time, here,\u201d</b></span> she demands. You dutifully head for the door, ready to carry out her instructions, but you stop in your tracks when another thought strikes you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d</b> You ask, nervously. <b>\u201cWould you mind if I bring my friend along? Y\u2019know, the persian?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cYes, I <i>would</i> mind. You are not, under any circumstance, going to tell a single damn soul about this little errand. Am I clear?\u201d</b></span> She growls, and you nod obediently. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of the cat while you\u2019re gone, so scram!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u2504\u2504\u2504</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first trip into Marden\u2019s territory was as harrowing as one might expect. Entire blocks of the city seemed to have been converted into a military complex. All around you, you spot menacing thugs of all shapes and sizes, most with their bellies stuffed with screaming, wriggling, digesting Pokemon. There seemed to be some kind of celebration going on, which fortunately made it a little easier to sneak around unnoticed. You couldn\u2019t afford to check your map while sneaking through here, so you\u2019ve memorized the exact location of your destination as best you could. Now, it was simply a matter of making it through this territory without getting spotted. Judging by the bulging guts of many of the Pokemon here, you knew exactly what would happen to you if you\u2019re captured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe outskirts of his territory are easy to sneak around in, but as you move in deeper, you come to an impasse. There\u2019s an abandoned bar nearby that you know would be an absolutely perfect place to hide in, but you were on the other side of the street from it. You could just trot across the street and hope nobody notices you don\u2019t belong here, but that seems rather risky. On the other hand, you could travel through the network of alleyways\u2026 but that had its own risks, as Pokemon seemed to like to retreat to these alleyways for some \u2018private time\u2019 with their mates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to choose quickly. What was your next move?</span></div></div>",

And you doubt the common grunts are going to recognize each and every member. Trying to sneak around would just make you look suspicious, but if you just strutted across the street like you belonged here\u2026 what are the odds someone would stop you? After a long period of cowardly hiding, you finally walked up the nerve to step out of the alleyway and start power walking directly towards the abandoned bar. You tried to give off an air of confidence, while on the inside, you were on the verge of having a heart attack. A few Pokemon gave you weird looks as you passed by, but none approached you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh of relief when you finally walked into the bar, immediately slamming the door shut behind you. You sit there, still sweating and shaking from the adrenaline rush, slowly getting your bearings. Now that you started to take a look around, you couldn\u2019t help but notice this bar was actually quite creepy. Despite the fact that it was in the middle of town, it looked like it\u2019s been abandoned for years, cobwebs in the corners and dust covering every surface. There were a few statues of various Pokemon around, which looked spooky in the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to shake those childish thoughts from your head, placing the map on the ground and unfurling it. The meet-up place you were looking for wasn\u2019t that far away. Just a couple more blocks, and you were home free. Before you could get too excited, though, you heard something; a door upstairs, loudly creaking open. You freeze, holding your breath, suddenly getting a chill. You thought this place was abandoned! Was there somebody here? You strained your ears, but you didn\u2019t hear any footsteps. Your hair stands on end as you stand there for a while, listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were calming down, you suddenly heard a harsh, ghostly whisper from behind you. <span class=\"cgrape\"><i>\u201cWhat a delicious little morsel\u2026\u201d</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whip around, only to realize there wasn\u2019t anybody there. <b>\u201cW-who said that?\u201d</b> You panic, glancing all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re frozen in terror as you watch something begin to phase through the nearby wall. As it enters, you recognize its creepy, smiling face; it\u2019s a haunter! <span class=\"cgrape\"><i>\u201cDon\u2019t you know you shouldn\u2019t go sticking your nose in abandoned buildings?\u201d</i></span> It cackles, floating slowly towards you through the darkness. <span class=\"cgrape\"><i>\u201cThey might be\u2026 haunted\u2026\u201d</i></span> With that, it let its huge, spectral tongue slip free from its mouth. Your heart skipped a beat as you\u2019re paralyzed by fear, watching the haunter come to a stop\u2026 only for it to suddenly fly towards you!</span></div></div>",

Almost by instinct, you began scrambling away from the haunter, rushing down another hallway\u2026 only to find yourself face-to-face with a gengar! <span class=\"cmagenta\"><i>\u201cGet over here!\u201d</i></span> He said, leaping forward, his arms stretched out to grab you\u2026 only for you to roll out of the way at the last moment. <span class=\"cmagenta\"><i>\u201cH-hey!\u201d</i></span> The gengar called as you continued sprinting down the hall at full speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed every hallway you went down, you were attacked by another horror. A chandelure, a cofagrigus, a banette\u2026 this bar seemed crammed to the brim with ghosts! Luckily, you manage to just barely dodge each and every one of them, until you finally come across your salvation; a window! Without a moment\u2019s hesitation, you leap headlong through the window, landing in a pile of jagged glass shards. You ignore the pain, get up, and start running down the alleyways, hearing the ghost-types letting out a disappointed sigh behind you. Eventually, you collapsed in exhaustion, adrenaline still rushing through your veins. Whatever\u2019s in this envelope, it better be worth it\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you finally come across the alleyway you were looking for. You have an excited grin on your face as you walk in\u2026 only to realize the alleyway was completely empty! <b>\u201cPsst. Hello? Is anyone here?\u201d</b> You whispered, afraid you might have ended up in the wrong place. Just as you were about to give up and leave, you noticed a silhouette on a nearby rooftop, looming over you. You squint as you peek up, trying to make out what you were looking at\u2026 only for it to suddenly leap down towards you! Before you could even react, you felt the chilling sensation of another Pokemon\u2019s maw wrapping around your head! <b>\u201cMph!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squealed as the stranger landed on top of you, pinning you down against the concrete, instantly silencing you by stuffing your face in their drooling maw. The speed and strength with which they moved was unlike anything you\u2019ve ever seen before. Before you could even scream, they\u2019d already stuffed you a quarter of the way down their throat, your forepaws pressed against your chest as you futilely kick your feet. Darkness surrounds you, as well as the meaty stench of your predator\u2019s previous meals. You didn\u2019t even get a chance to see what was eating you, and already, it had you halfway down its throat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour predator gulped you down in just a few more savage, relentless swallows; the entire process of devouring you only having taken a few seconds. Whatever this Pokemon was, they\u2019ve obviously done this many, many times before. You cry and whimper as you\u2019re slowly, forcibly slid into the stranger\u2019s stomach, yelping when you realize you\u2019re up to your chest in acid! You squirm and wriggle against the fleshy walls as the gastric juices tingle and burn at your skin. <b>\u201cP-please! Let me go!\u201d</b> You cry out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, your predator actually responds. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cDid Rana send you?\u201d</b></span> A deep voice responded, sounding oddly nonchalant for someone who\u2019s just devoured you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart sunk. Was this the Pokemon you were sent to meet? Maybe this was one of Marden\u2019s thugs, who somehow learned you were coming? <b>\u201c... y-yes...\u201d</b> You didn\u2019t know how they would respond to your answer, but it\u2019s not like your situation could get any worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cThen you must be my 'payment',\u201d</b></span> your predator yawned. The belly around you shifts and gurgles as the stranger sits and leans against a nearby wall, rubbing gently over their belly as their acids viciously attack you. Already, some of the fur on your legs was starting to fall out in clumps, and the exposed skin was turning pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cY-your payment?\u201d</b> You whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cRana sends me delicious little snacks like you as rewards for good intel,\u201d</b></span> the voice responds. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cI was the one who broke the news about Adriana\u2026 so I guess she decided to send me a particularly tasty meal today.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart sinks. <b>\u201cB-but we\u2019re on the same side!\u201d</b> You cried out. <b>\u201cYou\u2019re just going to digest me?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cSorry, runt. Guess she decided you were expendable.\u201d</b></span> You were already crying, but at hearing this, you broke down sobbing. What a fool you were, to come to this town. To trust that damn mienshao. Now you were going to die, in the worst way possible, just to add to some random Pokemon\u2019s hips. You curled up and cried as his stomach slowly digested you, giving in to your inevitable fate...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you remember the envelope! <b>\u201cW-wait!\u201d</b> You suddenly yell, perking up. <b>\u201cRana\u2026 she actually sent me to deliver something!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cOh? That being?\u201d</b></span> Your predator asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cAn envelope! I-I have it right here! I swear!\u201d</b> You plead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cAlright. Stuff it back up the way you came in,\u201d</b></span> he replied. Nervously, you stuffed the envelope back up through the tight sphincter to his esophagus, and you could hear your predator loudly coughing it up. He loudly tears open the envelope, before going silent for a while. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201c... hm. Disappointing.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you feel your surroundings shake and shift! You gasp, trying desperately to keep your head out of the acid as you\u2019re jostled around in the predator\u2019s gut! <b>\u201cW-what are you doing?\u201d</b> Suddenly, your snout is forced upwards, back through the stretched sphincter! <b>\u201cMph!\u201d</b> You cringe and whine as the entire consumption process is played out in reverse. His throat muscles clamp painfully tightly around you, pulling you relentlessly back up his tight throat; so tight you couldn\u2019t even breathe, the air crushed from your lungs. Soon though, you finally see daylight again\u2026 and before you know it, you\u2019re coughed up, back onto the cold concrete ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lie there limp, dazed, still soaked to the bone in various gastric juices as you slowly regain your bearings. Finally, you laid eyes on your predator, leaning over you; a simple, curvaceous greninja. <b>\u201cW\u2026 wha\u2026?\u201d</b> You stutter, disoriented by your speed journey in and out of the greninja\u2019s body. The entire thing only lasted two minutes, and yet, it felt like it had been hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThere\u2019s been a change in plans,\u201d</span></b> the greninja said, tossing the letter aside as you climbed to your feet. You stood there, pathetic and shaking, and yet the greninja spares you no sympathies; in fact, he looks downright bored. He gestures for you to follow before trotting down the alleyway, his wide hips swaying as she walked, no doubt thickened by dozens of previous meals. You were about to follow\u2026 but curiosity overwhelms you, and you can\u2019t help but briefly check what the letter had said. It was torn-up and half-digested, but still, you could clearly make out the mienshao\u2019s simple message;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><div align=\"center\"><i>DON\u2019T DIGEST THIS ABSOL, FATASS!!!!! - Rana</i></div></span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rana seemed to imply that those who are captured by Marden\u2019s thugs tend to have gruesome fates. As you round the corner into a nearby alleyway, you truly realize what she means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you noticed was a huge, round, yellow belly, which a dozen Pokemon of all shapes and sizes squirming around within. You can clearly see their paws and faces make imprints in the distended skin as the Pokemon try desperately to free themselves from their huge, caustic prison. Your eyes slowly trail up the predator\u2019s body, only to realize that the bulging belly was attached to a zebstrika, who was whimpering and cringing as the Pokemon inside him tried to break free. Lastly, you noticed a mightyena rubbing all along the zebstrika\u2019s gut, moaning and taunting the helpless prey within. <span class=\"cgrey\"><b>\u201cSeriously, Kenneth, don\u2019t make so much noise,\u201d</b></span> the zebstrika whispers. <span class=\"cgrey\"><b>\u201cIf people find out about this, you know what Marden will do to us!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Nobody\u2019s gonna find out,\u201d</b></span> the mightyena chuckles, and you noticed his long, vividly pink shaft was fully unsheathed as he pampered his friend\u2019s churning gut. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cEven if somebody sees us, you know I can take care\u2026 of...\u201d</b></span> His voice trailed off as he turned around, and the two of you happened to lock eyes. You both stared at each other for a quiet moment, frozen in place\u2026 before the mightyena suddenly rushed towards you with a snarl! You try to flee, but before you can even turn around, he\u2019s upon you. You yelp, the breath knocked out of you as he leaps through the air and pounces on you, pinning you to the ground. Just as you\u2019re about to cry out, though, you suddenly feel him wrap his mouth around your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cDon\u2019t scream. You hear me? Scream and you die,\u201d</b></span> he growls, and you shiver as you feel his fangs press up against your jugular. All he\u2019d have to do is bite down. Then again, maybe a quick death like that is better than what these two might have planned for you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\"><b>\u201cJust kill him already!\u201d</b></span> The zebstrika complained, obviously nervous about this whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he confirmed that you weren\u2019t going to try anything, the mightyena released your neck from his jaws, turning and smiling at the zebstrika. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cAnd leave the evidence lying around in an alleyway? Nah,\u201d</b></span> he smirks. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cI have a better idea\u2026\u201d</b></span> The mightyena stands up and grabs you by the horn with his teeth, roughly dragging you down the alleyway towards the zebstrika.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\"><b>\u201cOh, come on, Kenneth! I can\u2019t fit any more!\u201d</b></span> The zebstrika groaned, trying to wriggle away, but he seemed to be completely immobilized by the sheer weight of his huge gut. His belly was stretched to almost twice the size of the rest of his body, at this point, and seemed on the verge of bursting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cOh, he\u2019ll fit~\u201d</b></span> The mightyena cooed. You manage to raise your head, only to find yourself staring directly into the zebstrika\u2019s huge, pudgy ass! Your heart sunk in your chest, horrified as you suddenly realized the fate they had in store for you. Anything but that! Almost by instinct, you start struggling and clawing at him, trying anything to avoid being brought any closer to the zebra\u2019s rear end. In response, though, the mightyena immediately grabbed you by the neck again, this time hard enough to draw blood. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cHey, what did I say? Don\u2019t move a fucking muscle. You\u2019re our bitch now, you hear me? Act like it!\u201d</b></span> You whimpered as he released your throat, before giving you one last shove, burying your head between the zebstrika\u2019s cheeks. Your recoil in disgust as your snout is pressed up against their tailhole. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201c... now get licking.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitated. The zebstrika was completely clean \u2018down there\u2019, but still, the prospect of being forced to rim the pudgy zebra seemed humiliating. Then again, what the mightyena would do to you if you disobeyed was probably much worse, so you eventually clench your eyes shut as you start lapping your tongue against the tight, puckered hole. The zebstrika whimpered and shivered slightly as you licked, his long, thick equine shaft pressing up against his bulging belly. Meanwhile, the mightyena keeps pushing on you from behind, pressing your snout harder and harder against the zebra\u2019s tailhole\u2026 until, suddenly, it slips in completely! The zebstrika yelps quietly, a bit of pre dripping down his belly as he feels your entire head slide easily up his ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cries are muffled by the zebstrika\u2019s ass you feel his tight sphincter clamp around your neck, smothering you in the unbearable warmth of his bowels. You press your forepaws up against the pudge on his flanks, trying to pull yourself free, but it\u2019s just too squishy for you to get any leverage. The zebstrika bites his lip, his face beet red from his blushing as the mightyena teased him. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cThere he is. Right where we want him,\u201d</b></span> he smirked. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cSee, didn\u2019t I tell you I\u2019d take care of it? There\u2019s nothin\u2019 to worry about\u2026\u201d</b></span> You tensed up when you felt the mightyena grope your chubby hindquarters while slowly shoving you deeper and deeper into his friend. Soon, you were in so deep that your front paws were restrained by the zebstrika\u2019s bowels, rendering you completely helpless. The mightyena paused for a moment, and you assume he was giving you some reprieve\u2026 until you suddenly feel the mightyena\u2019s rough tongue slide up along your tailhole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only frantically wriggle your hips as the canine stuffs his snout between your cheeks, lapping hungrily over your tightly-clenched ass. The only part of your body poking out from between the zebstrika\u2019s cheeks was your ass and hind legs, rendering you completely incapable of fighting back. You\u2019re helpless as he penetrates your ass with his tongue, drenching your hindquarters in smelly, canine saliva. Eventually, he pulls his snout free from your cheeks, panting in excitement. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cDamn, he\u2019s tight. What a catch,\u201d</b></span> the mightyena coos, licking his lips. Before you had a chance to contemplate what that means, he had already mounted you, gripping onto the zebstrika\u2019s back as his long cock pokes up against your virgin ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squirmed with renewed vigor as you felt him grind his shaft up and down between your cheeks, savoring their pudgy softness. Getting shoved up the zebstrika\u2019s ass was one thing, but letting the mightyena use you like this just wasn\u2019t an option. Unfortunately, you were so well-restrained that he didn\u2019t even notice your attempts to fight back. You felt him align his cock with your puckered tailhole, and despite your efforts to clench it shut, he easily forces it to stretch around his thick shaft. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cF-fuck\u2026\u201d</b></span> You could hear him moan out as he entered you, nausea filling your body as he slowly slid his cock deeper and deeper until he was buried into you up to his hilt. He froze, savoring the feeling for a moment, before he slowly began to thrust his hips, sliding his length in and out of your virgin ass. He gradually worked up speed until he was fucking you in earnest, his balls slapping against your cheeks as he roughly claimed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA the air within the zebstrika\u2019s bowels become thinner and thinner, you started to feel like you were disassociating with reality. Soon, all the sensations melted away, replaced with a cool, calm serenity. It was like some sort of out-of-body experience, as if you were watched the events in third person, with no attachment to the abuse occurring. The pain, the violation, the humiliating pleasure, all became a dim blur. You were almost amused as you \u2018watched\u2019 your cheeks jiggle as he practically fucked you and the zebstrika simultaneously, almost using you like some sort of living condom. You\u2019re suddenly snapped back to reality as you feel him pump a prodigious amount of steaming hot jizz straight into your bowels, the mightyena\u2019s thrusts reaching their peak for a moment before slowing down. The zebstrika apparently can\u2019t hold back for much longer either, and blows and incredible amount of cum over the ground and his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two pant and moan as they slowly recover from their orgasms, the mightyena resting his head on the zebstrika back for a while before finally slipping his cock out from your ass, cum dripping from your used tailhole. He smirks as he hops off you. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cDamn. It\u2019s almost a shame we can\u2019t keep him\u2026\u201d</b></span> He chuckled. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cOh well. In he goes\u2026\u201d</b></span> You\u2019re far too exhausted to squirm anymore as the mightyena lifts you up by your hind paws, and slowly slips your lower body the rest of the way into the zebstrika\u2019s ass. Inch by inch, you disappear into the warmth of the darkness and warmth of his bowels, the muscles lining the walls slowly pulling you further. Eventually, you were sealed away completely in the zebra\u2019s body, and the two horny Pokemon lock lips as the zebstrika processes his meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear the cries and feel the struggles of the Pokemon in the zebstrika\u2019s stomach, his belly loudly churning and gurgling as he digests them all at once. You figure that\u2019s where you\u2019ll be sent, too, once his powerful gastric acids have \u2018made room\u2019 for you. But at this point, your addled mind couldn\u2019t even register fear, so had no strong feelings about your impending, grisly fate. All you could do was get comfortable in the zebra\u2019s bowels, feeling the walls squeeze and massage your body. Meanwhile, the lovely couple settles into the alleyway to relax, letting the zebstrika digest his huge meal overnight. By the next morning, there was no evidence of all the lives that were lost to the zebra\u2019s immense appetite\u2026 besides, perhaps, a few extra layers of fat on the equine\u2019s ass.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over the course of a single night, over a dozen members of Marden\u2019s gang just suddenly disappeared off the face of the Earth. Not like this was anything unexpected; Marden\u2019s followers, largely being stupid and reckless, frequently made for easy meals for clever predators, and nobody cares about what happened to some low-life thugs anyway. All their pitiful lives amounted to was the growing sense of unease in Marden\u2019s territory, and of course, a few dozen pounds of fat on their wily predator. Indeed, no one will ever know what became of them\u2026 except for two, traitorous Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun rose early that morning, sunlight pouring in through the window of an apartment hidden deep within Marden\u2019s territory. This light shined down on the now considerably more robust body of the zebstrika, lying lazily on the carpet. Predators are always their fattest the day after a big meal, and this was no exception. Even after having laboriously churned and liquidized the bodies of the Pokemon within his body overnight, his paunch was so big and round, it almost touched the ground even when he was standing, the lion\u2019s share of the extra weight having gone to his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the pudge that didn\u2019t go to his belly instead went to his ass and thighs. Each cheek was now bigger than most small Pokemon, and they both visibly jiggled with the slightest movement; two huge monuments to all the Pokemon who sacrificed their lives to build them. Even his thick, stallion cock was practically buried in all the flab, getting rubbed between his drumstick thighs when he walked and pressed up against his soft belly when he laid down. As much as he was loathe to admit it, feeling his body jiggle and heave as he walked was an incredible turn-on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the mightyena was lying leaning up against the zebstrika\u2019s pillowy left cheek, gently stroking at his own rigid shaft with a paw. The tight hole buried in the dark crevasse between the zebstrika\u2019s cheeks was still dribbling cum, the two of them cuddling as the canine had just finished plowing that pudgy ass for the fifth time that night. The two of them had been going at it like rabbits all night, the mightyena intoxicated by the way the zebstrika's cheeks jiggled and bounced when he fucked him. <b><span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cMm~\u201d</span></b> The mightyena cooed. <b><span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cNot to toot my own horn or anything, but this was pretty much the best idea anyone's ever had.\u201d</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\"><b>\u201cOh, sure. Easy for <i>you</i> to say,\u201d</b></span> the zebstrika said. <span class=\"cgrey\"><b>\u201c<i>You\u2019re</i> not the one who can hardly even <i>walk</i>.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cEh, walking\u2019s overrated,\u201d</b></span> the canine replied, with a smug smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\"><b>\u201cSeriously, Kenneth!

What a waste of potential,\u201d</b></span> the mightyena chuckled, leaning harder against the zebstrika\u2019s ass. While the mightyena pressed his body into the squishy pudge, the zebstrika snorted, hiding his own arousal under a thin veneer of annoyance. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cI, personally, want to see just how big you can get~\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\"><b>\u201cOh, in your <i>dreams</i>,\u201d</b></span> the zebstrika grumbled. <span class=\"cgrey\"><b>\u201cYou know what?

Yeah, right.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\"><b>\u201cI\u2019m being serious! I\u2019m supposed to be a herbivore, for Arceus\u2019 sake! This just isn\u2019t healthy,\u201d</b></span> the zebstrika insisted angrily, turning to look the canine in the eyes. <span class=\"cgrey\"><b>\u201cI need you to <i>promise</i> me you\u2019ll stop trying to tempt me into eating Pokemon.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mightyena kept that shit-eating grin locked on his face, seemingly nonplussed by the zebstrika\u2019s anger. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cActually, come to think of it, there\u2019s this umbreon down the hall who looks absolutely delicious. You don't happen to be in the mood for breakfast, do you?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\"><b>\u201cKenneth!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cOh, come on, babe. You know you love it~\u201d</b></span> The mightyena suddenly pressed himself up against the zebstrika\u2019s huge, round belly, molding the malleable pudge with his paws as he practically melted into the zebra\u2019s flab. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cSwallowing helpless little snacks down. Slowly gurgling them up while they\u2019re still alive. Turning them into all this delicious <i>squishiness</i>!\u201d</b></span> The zebstrika almost shivered at the sensation. Try as he might to be the voice of reason, the thought of all those Pokemon being broken down into his new huge, pudgy body was making him light-headed with arousal. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cWhat\u2019s not to love?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe zebstrika clenched his eyes shut, trying to force those thoughts from his mind. Suddenly, though, the mightyena grabbed him by the cheeks, and the zebstrika gasped he held him close, gazing into each other's eyes. <span class=\"cgrey\"><b>\u201cYou\u2026 are pure evil.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cGuilty as charged,\u201d</b></span> he said, before locking lips with the zebra, the couple forgetting their worries as they passionately made out on the floor. They\u2019ve gone through this routine so many times before; the zebstrika vowing he\u2019d never eat a Pokemon again, only to give the canine the opportunity to assert his authority. Deep down, they both knew who was really in charge. Kenneth was going to keep stuffing the zebra to the brim with delicious, squirming Pokemon for as long as he pleases\u2026 and neither of them would ever want it any other way.</span></div></div>",

After all, you didn\u2019t need to sleep in this apartment tonight; you\u2019d rather sleep on the street then run the risk of your friend being digested! However, before you could say another word, the persian stopped you. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cAbsol,\u201d</b></span> she whispers, solemnly. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cJust\u2026 do as she says.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her, wide-eyed. <b>\u201c... what?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cIf it means she\u2019ll let you stay here tonight\u2026 I accept whatever might happen,\u201d</b></span> she says, almost begging. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cPlease.

Were they really serious about this? You\u2019d call this absurd, but Silvia swallowing that luxray was absurd\u2026 this is just insane. Still, it seems you\u2019ve been outvoted, and you didn\u2019t really have a counterargument. <b>\u201cAnd you swear you won\u2019t\u2026 y\u2019know\u2026\u201d</b> You stutter, trying to guarantee the persian\u2019s safety at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cScout's honor.

I\u2019ll take care of things on this side.\u201d</b></span> They both looked at you expectantly, and you reluctantly obliged, moving over to the persian\u2019s rear and getting ready to push. Meanwhile, the mienshao kept grinding up against her own arm as she teased the persian with clear views down her dark, cavernous throat, giving the feline a little \u2018sneak peek\u2019 of where she will soon be spending the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilvia\u2019s normal, stoic persona slipped. She had never been eaten before, and had no idea what to expect. Will it be like curling up in a nice, soothing isolation tank\u2026 or will it feel like being dipped face first into a deep fryer? Her concerns were a little exaggerated, but not unfounded. The persian\u2019s prey never seemed to have a very good time within her digestive system\u2026 but more experienced predators could partially control their digestion, and release their prey at will. Maybe it won\u2019t be that bad.  <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cHey, hey, look me in the eyes,\u201d</b></span> the mienshao said, tapping her chin. The persian looked up obediently, letting the mienshao stare into her beautiful, sparkling blue eyes. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cThere you go. Arceus, you are gorgeous! May I?\u201d</b></span> The persian obliged without hesitation as the mienshao pulled her closer, the two locking lips with surprising passion. Their kiss grew into something more as the mienshao\u2019s lips spread around the feline\u2019s snout, and the persian shuddered at the sensation of the mienshao\u2019s maw around her face, and the tongue tickling her neck. Eventually, the mienshao pulled back, leaving the persian\u2019s face wet with saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cMm\u2026 see? Nothing to be afraid of. I\u2019ll be gentle\u2026\u201d</b></span> The mienshao chuckled, licking the drool off her lips as she rubbed at the persian\u2019s shoulders. The persian blushed, looking away, trying to mantain her temperament. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cNo need to be so serious all the time. Smile for me.\u201d</b></span> The persian pulled her lips back just the tiniest bit, giving a beautiful, ladylike little smile, as fake as it may be. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cThere you go. Try to have some fun. You\u2019re gonna be in there for a while, after all\u2026\u201d</b></span> Compared to the way she talked to you, the way she treated the persian was strangely affectionate. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cMaybe I'll let you out in the morning... or maybe not. Something tells me you don\u2019t care either way, do you?\u201d</b></span> The mienshao suddenly pushed the persian\u2019s head down, pressing it against her belly, the feline\u2019s snout just inches away from her burning sex. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cThis is where you belong, after all. Your perfect body curled up inside of mine\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the persian looked up again, she found herself staring down the mienshao\u2019s throat. Her heart leaped in surprise as the martial arts pokemon leaned forward and took the persian\u2019s head into her maw with a single movement! In a moment, the feline\u2019s head was thrust into the blinding heat, crushing tightness and utter darkness of the mienshao\u2019s throat, as the larger pokemon pulled her closer, grabbing her by the shoulders. The experienced predator was able to consume the persian\u2019s head and shoulders with incredible ease, once she really got into the swing of things \u2014 this was the easy part, after all. The persian was an inexperienced predator, and she could still stretch her belly larger to a greater size than the rest of her entire body; you could hardly imagine just how stretchy the mienshao would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your shaft peek out of your sheathe more and more as you watched the persian\u2019s head and forepaws bulge against the mienshao\u2019s throat. For a moment, you even forgot what you were supposed to be doing, until the mienshao reminded you with a simple gesture. Now that the persian\u2019s upper body was securely in the predator\u2019s throat, you reluctantly stood on your hind legs and pressed your forepaws against the persian\u2019s plush rear end, pushing her with all your might deeper into the mienshao\u2019s throat. You could smell the persian\u2019s arousal, her warm sex inches away from your face, yet you tried your best not to look, focusing on the task at hand. You could almost hear the mienshao\u2019s jaws cracking, as if they came unhinged as the mienshao started trying to fit both the persian and the accompanying luxray into her maw simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t budge the persian an inch for a moment as the mienshao got adjusted, but eventually you were able to very slowly inch her forwards, hearing the mienshao gulp and gag as she worked the persian in. You couldn\u2019t help but glance around the persian\u2019s round stomach, trying to get a view of the mienshao, just to see if this was really possible. Your heart skipped a beat when you saw the mienshao on her hands and knees, her maw spread wide to an almost impossible degree, an incredible bulge in her throat as she worked the first quarter of the persian\u2019s belly inside. Tears were streaming down her face as her jaws were stretched to the limit, her body overcome with both pain and pleasure in equal measures. Despite how extreme this \u2018meal\u2019 was, her eyes were filled with nothing but desire to feel the persian curled up inside her completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaken to the core but the unnatural, seemingly impossible sight, you just clench your eyes shut and try to focus entirely on pushing the persian deeper and deeper. Every minute felt like it dragged on for an eternity, but soon enough, the persian was halfway down the mienshao\u2019s throat with no signs of stopping. The mienshao resembled a serpent more than anything, at this point, her throat and belly so utterly bloated as she progressed diligently on her herculean task. Every time you thought she would give up, she always found the strength to keep going\u2026 and eventually the hard part was over. The persian\u2019s belly had disappeared entirely into the mienshao\u2019s own, leaving only the feline\u2019s toned rear and legs hanging out her mouth. She sighs through her nose in relief as the obstruction in her throat is finally cleared, her cheeks still wet with tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mienshao sends her tongue up and inbetween the persian\u2019s doughy cheeks, savoring the moment, but eventually decides that it was time to wrap all this up; her jaws were sore enough as it is. With her approval, you give one final push with all your might, pushing the persian\u2019s rear end into the persian\u2019s gullet. Eventually, the persian was too deep for you to reach, and you could only watch as the feline\u2019s hindpaws slowly disappeared completely into the mienshao\u2019s body. When the bulge in her throat disappeared completely into her midsection, the mienshao coughed and sputtered for fresh air, clutching her sore jaws as she felt the persian settle in inside her. You slowly backed away, staring in awe at the mienshao\u2019s gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mienshao\u2019s stomach was almost twice the size of the rest of her entire body! Her belly alone towered over you in size, showing off a stretchiness more befitting a python then any biped. It was absolutely surreal to see such an athletic, slim pokemon attached to such a huge, rounded gut. She grunted and groaned as she felt the persian\u2019s movement straining the taut skin further, rubbing over her gut in a futile attempt to soothe her discomfort. When she said she was experienced with this, she wasn\u2019t kidding. She was handling this surprisingly well; in fact, judging by the look in her eyes, she was only hungry for more. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cY-you\u2026\u201d</b></span> Her arm shook as she pointed weakly at you, before gesturing silently to her backside, her jaws too sore to say another word. You were confused for a moment, until you realized she wanted you to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It\u2019s been a crazy couple of days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou admit, even before the ninetales dragged you along on this bizarre adventure, you had always fantasized about something like this. You had only heard the vaguest of stories about Pokemon swallowing other Pokemon, and always wondered what that might look like, or if it was even truly possible. When the ninetales offered to swallow you up for that fateful night, your curiosity burned brighter than your common sense\u2026 and, of course, the experience of being swallowed down didn\u2019t disappoint. But what always fascinated you the most was the idea of <i>watching</i> the process, keeping track of every bulge and movement of a Pokemon being locked away within another\u2019s body. And twice today, your dream has come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Silvia swallow that luxray was invigorating enough as it is, but watching the beautiful, slim, sylphlike mienshao swallowing up two Pokemon for the price of one was on another level entirely. Perhaps what so seduced you was the sheer power on display. Swallowing a meal of this size should be impossible, by all metrics\u2026 but the mienshao made it look easy. Her belly alone was almost three times heavier than the rest of her entire body, yet despite the skin being stretched and distended to the limit, you knew the persian could be never break free. The powerful predator effortlessly held her \u2018prisoners\u2019 completely at her mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter watching that level of sheer domination, it was no surprise that your manhood was fully unsheathed as you limped around the mienshao\u2019s rounded form, your pink shaft bobbing and rigid beneath you. You knew it was wrong. Silvia didn\u2019t seem to particularly enjoy being swallowed alive, and for all you knew, she could be in danger. You still didn\u2019t know whether you could trust the mienshao\u2026 but that element of uncertainty and peril only excited you more. You dug your snout beneath her tail the moment she commanded you to, like an obedient slave. Whatever fate the powerful predator had in mind for you, you would be honored to endure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mienshao panted, rubbing over her painfully stretched belly as you explored her sex with the long, slick tongue befitting canines. Despite your shame, the thought that her body might be churning your friend up into fat even at this very moment only excited you further, driving you to please the mienshao as best you could, neglecting to even breathe as her femjuices soaked your face and her musk overwhelmed your senses. While the mienshao was panting with pleasure, it was mostly due to the sheer sensation of fullness, and the knowledge that two Pokemon were imprisoned within her stomach. Your efforts to please her were cute, and she appreciated your enthusiasm, but she could do better herself if only she could fit her paws around her huge, bulging gut. She was going to have to take charge here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, she pulled herself forward up onto her gut, and you followed her every movement without thinking, your mind entirely preoccupied by the thought or worshipping the beautiful mienshao. You only realized what she was planning when she rolled back on her belly, bringing the full weight of her body down on your snout! The breath was knocked out of you as you were slammed roughly against the floor, her huge, painfully heavy belly landing on your chest. You gasp, trying desperately to fill your lungs, only to realize that you were buried snout-deep in the mienshao\u2019s dripping wet pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cMm\u2026 mm\u2026 ffuck\u2026 <i>d-digest</i>\u2026\u201d</b></span> She moaned out random nonsense as she smothered you mercilessly beneath her, using you like a living toy with little regard for your safety. Your only reprieve was when the mienshao would occasionally shudder and cry out, climaxing around your snout, arching her back and giving you some time to breathe before she was ready to plop back down on your face. Meanwhile, the persian within her stomach wasn\u2019t faring much better either. The mienshao masticated her with the walls of her gut, covered her with gastric acids, sucked most of the air from her stomach, <i>anything</i> she could do to make the persian squirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pleasure experienced by a predator who\u2019s been stuffed to the brim was without comparison. The mienshao was intoxicated by sensation of the Pokemon struggling both within and beneath her, and focused on nothing more than her own ecstasy. It seemed that, if the fighting-type didn\u2019t wear herself out soon, neither you nor Silvia were likely to survive this encounter. You could hear the cries of the persian within her guts, and feel the sheer weight of her stomach atop your body as the mienshao abused you. Your addled mind could think of nothing more than her powerful, gurgling belly, and despite the grimness of your situation, your manhood still stood achingly rigid, begging for some attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the mienshao rode out her fourth orgasm on your snout, she finally calmed down enough to go a bit easier on you. She still let her stomach run wild on the persian, but she gave you a bit more air to breathe, wanting to draw this out as long as possible. Better still, you felt her wrap her hind paws around your waiting shaft, slowly sliding them up and down, careful not to harm you with her claws. The gesture wasn\u2019t much, but it was enough. Your mind was dizzy with pleasure already, and despite yourself, you could help but slowly grind your hips up and down, electrified by the simplest touch. The experience overall was a blur. The more your brain was deprived of oxygen, the more pleasurable everything seemed. By the time the mienshao\u2019s paws finally worked you to orgasm, covering her fluffy belly in streaks of hot cum, your addled mind was struck with spasms of ecstasy unlike anything you\u2019ve experienced before. By the time the mienshao finally lifted herself off your face, you were barely conscious, your brain feeling like it was throbbing in your skull, a faint smile on your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she caught her breath, the now calm mienshao marveled at what she had done. She\u2019d been so stressed recently, and it\u2019s been so long since she had last been able to let loose like this, she\u2026 might have gotten carried away. First and foremost, the persian was kicking up a storm at this point, as the mienshao\u2019s digestive system bore down on her full throttle. She\u2019d have to let the poor cat out immediately if she wanted to avoid doing any lasting damage. Then again, what better way to cap off a night like this than with a filling meal\u2026?</span></div></div>",

She looked over and sees you still lying on the ground, half-conscious, your eyes completely blank, your tongue hanging from your mouth. She could only hope she hadn\u2019t accidentally smothered you to the point of brain damage! And the poor feline inside her\u2026 the harsh stomach was currently working full-force on digesting the squirming persian alive. Even now, it was gurgling and churning loudly as it worked on her \u2018meal\u2019. She genuinely hadn\u2019t planned to hurt her humble guests, just have some fun with them a blow off some steam. Guess she was a little more pent up than she thought\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, time to remedy the situation as best she could. First order of business; release the persian. The mienshao can control her digestion, but she had been so, err, <i>distracted</i> that she had just been letting her stomach run wild on the big cat. Then again, she\u2019d only been in there for, what, half an hour, maybe? She probably hadn\u2019t suffered any permanent damage by now. Probably. If she let her go now, no lasting damage would be done. There was only one problem\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Releasing</i> Pokemon isn\u2019t <i>nearly</i> as easy as <i>swallowing</i> them, and with the sheer size of the feline\u2019s luxray-filled gut, she wasn\u2019t sure she would be able to fit them back out the way they came. The muscles of her guts and esophagus were as stretchy as they were powerful, but they weren\u2019t <i>that</i> powerful. She couldn\u2019t afford to wait until the persian was finished digesting. She needed to get some <i>help</i>. With that thought, the mienshao waddled slowly out into the hall, practically dragging her huge, bulging belly along the carpeted floor. Any passersby would be able to clearly see the pawprints of the struggling persian inside her, but luckily, the hallway was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInch by inch, the mienshao slowly made her way down to Issac\u2019s apartment, the front door still hanging ajar. She peeked into the darkened room within. The ampharos had repurposed his living room into some kind of base of operations, with strange, high-tech devices strewn around. He was currently hunched over at his desk, tapping away furiously at his keyboard, as if worried about something. He jumped, startled, when the mienshao waddled in and closed the door behind her. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cIssac! Gonna need you to pause whatever it is you\u2019re doing,\u201d</b></span> she said matter-of-factly as she walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cRana! We need to talk about Mard-\u201d</b></span> The ampharos was about to protest, until the sight of the mienshao\u2019s huge, impossibly stretched-out stomach silenced him. She could only stare at it, awestruck, as he watched the imprints of the persian struggling inside. He was used to her eating Pokemon, but she hadn\u2019t seen her this full in quite a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cYeah, as you can see, I, uh, might\u2019ve bitten off a little more than I can chew here,\u201d</b></span> the mienshao groaned, cringing at the feeling of the persian\u2019s movements stretching her already painfully distended gut. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cShe\u2019s really digesting in there, so time is of the essence. You can tell me all about whatever it is you\u2019re so worried about once you\u2019ve helped her out.\u201d</b></span> Issac kicks his rolling chair away from his desk, immediately thinking the situation through. This wasn\u2019t the first time he had to help someone out in a \u2018situation\u2019 like this, so he knew what he was doing, but he also knew that it wouldn\u2019t be a particularly pleasant process, nor a safe one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cUrgh\u2026 alright, but we will have to do this slowly and carefully. No sudden movements. Am I clear?\u201d</b></span> The ampharos said as he dug around through his supplies, pulling out thick nylon rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Issac? Don\u2019t want to become part of all <i>this</i>?\u201d</b></span> She smirked, smacking her jiggly ass with a paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cNot particularly, <i>no</i>,\u201d</b></span> he rolled his eyes, always annoyed by the mienshao\u2019s teasing. He tried not to let her get to him, though, focusing on tying one end of the rope as firmly as he can around his feet. Once he was certain it was secure, he waddled over to the mienshao, handing her the other end of the rope. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cAlright, here. When I tap on the walls like this\u201d</b></span> \u2014 he demonstrated by poking her belly thrice, rhythmically \u2014 <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cpull me out, alright? And don\u2019t lose your grip.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got this,\u201d</b></span> she gave a toothy grin, though her reassurance didn\u2019t seem to inspire much confidence in the ampharos. He really didn\u2019t want to have to do this, but he couldn\u2019t just let an innocent Pokemon get gurgled away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cRight, you know what to do. Get into position and don\u2019t move a muscle,\u201d</b></span> he said, flinching slightly as the mienshao\u2019s jaws opened impossibly wide before him, her dark, cavernous throat hanging open in anticipation. With a sigh, he wrapped a thin band around his head that was equipped with a mini-flashlight, before hesitantly pressing his face into the mienshao\u2019s maw. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cAlright. I\u2019m going in. You ready?\u201d</b></span> She nodded slightly, and Issac began to push his paws up and into her throat, feeling the tunnel stretch easily as he braced his feet against her jaw. Eventually, he pulled himself entirely into her throat, creating a sizeable bulge in her neck as most of his body disappeared from the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let his mini-flashlight light the way as he crawled deeper down the strangely long tunnel of her esophagus on his knees and elbows. It was miserably warm, tight and moist inside her throat; he could only imagine what it must be like for the feline in her belly. Eventually, he came across a tight sphincter, and set about laboriously pulling it open with his paws. Peeking into the roomy chamber of the mienshao\u2019s stomach, he was immediately greeted with the desperate, frenzy eyes of the persian within. <span class=\"corange\"><i><b>\u201cP-please...\u201d</b></i></span> She begged, in the most heart-breakingly desperate voice he had ever heard. <span class=\"corange\"><i><b>\u201cHelp me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</b></i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I\u2019m going to get you out of here, okay?\u201d</b></span> He said, reaching his paws into the sac, while being very careful not to fall into the mienshao\u2019s stomach completely. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cJust reach out your paws.\u201d</b></span> The persian reached out her forepaws, and the ampharos grabbed hold of them. Once he had a firm hold of the feline, he elbowed the pink, fleshy walls thrice, as he had demonstrated\u2026 and after a worrying pause, he felt the mienshao pulling on the rope. With the combined strength of both the mienshao and the ampharos, the persian was slowly pulled back through the tight sphincter, finally freeing her from the confines of the mienshao\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mienshao gagged and choked as all three Pokemon filled her throat, but luckily it didn\u2019t last long. Soon, the ampharos was pulled back out from her maw, and with all his might, he dragged the persian out with him. The two collapsed in a puddle of saliva and gastric juices on the floor, while the mienshao coughed and sputtered, tears streaming down her cheeks as she clutched her sore throat. Eventually, the ampharos pulled himself to his feet, assessing the damage. The mienshao\u2019s eyes were bloodshot, her fur had fallen out in patches, and she had first degree burns running along parts of her body, but beyond that, she wasn\u2019t too worse for wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe relaxed the poor feline with some ibuprofen, dulling her pain so she didn\u2019t squirm as he dipped her burns in cold water, being slathering the affected areas in various gels, creams and ointments to soothe her wounds and prevent infection. After covering the most affected areas with gauze, she returned the persian to the mienshao\u2019s care. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cAlright. Not seeing any permanent damage here. She just needs to get some rest,\u201d</b></span> he said. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cBe more careful next time, okay?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cAlright, sorry for the trouble,\u201d</b></span> she nodded, her voice still raspy. With that, she took the exhausted, limp persian in her arms and limped back to her apartment\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u2504\u2504\u2504</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up the next morning with a major headache. You groaned as you slowly sat up, feeling like the world was spinning all around you. Everything looked blurry\u2026 felt dizzying. Even sitting still, you felt like you were about to fall over. Eventually, you got your bearings, and started to feel a little more normal. You looked around and noticed you were lying on someone\u2019s couch, covered in blankets. You didn\u2019t recognize it at first\u2026 until the mienshao walked into the room, and you remember what happened to you last night. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cOh, thank Arceus you\u2019re up! I was worried you might\u2019ve gotten brain damage or something,\u201d</b></span> she says when she noticed you looking at her. To your surprise, she clutched your paw. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cLook \u2014 I am so, so sorry about what happened last night. I got seriously carried away and-\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhere\u2019s Silvia?\u201d</b> You interrupted, blankly, pulling away from her. She frowned at this, but understood you didn\u2019t want to talk to her right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201c... in there,\u201d</b></span> she says, pointing to the bedroom door. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cIssac said she should be alright. Just some superficial damage\u2026\u201d</b></span> You immediately hopped up and limped towards the door, ignoring the mienshao. You wanted to make sure Silvia was alright with your own eyes...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The mienshao had to face the facts. She may not have intended it, but at this point, the damage done to both you and the persian was probably permanent. You were left twitching on the ground, only the faintest semblance of reasoning remaining, obviously short a few hundred neurons by now. You couldn\u2019t even remember why you were here, nor did you understand who this mienshao lady was \u2014 only that you still found her as beautiful as ever. Meanwhile, the persian within her belly would probably be left blinded and scarred even if she did immediately rush to the hospital. In both cases, it\u2019s just no way to live. At this point, gurgling up her two unlucky visitors would be a mercy\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looms over the half-conscious absol, licking her lips, a devious grin on her face. Something about how easily she dominated her two guests was exciting to her. Perhaps this made her no better than Marden\u2019s goons. Before she could continue down that line of thought, she noticed you staring at her from the floor. <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><i><b>\u201cHello\u2026\u201d</b></i></font> You say weakly, almost in a whisper, as if you were meeting the mienshao for the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks confused for a moment\u2026 before getting a mischievous look on her face. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cWhy, hello, sleepyhead,\u201d</b></span> she smiles, her entire tone changing as she tried to act reassuring and kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><i><b>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name\u2026?\u201d</b></i></font> You mumble, obviously having little understanding of what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cRana,\u201d</b></span> she replied, amused. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cWhat\u2019s yours?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><i><b>\u201c...

Before you knew, she had pressed up you against her big, round, furry gut. The soft, squishy skin was actually incredible comfy, relaxing you almost instantly. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cWell, when you came here, you told me you wanted me to put you in my belly here and gurgle you up into fat.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><i><b>\u201cReally?\u201d</b></i></font> You asked, looking up at her. The thought of being inside the comfy orb of her stomach seemed like heaven to your addled mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cYup! Doesn\u2019t that sound nice?\u201d</b></span> You gives you a toothy grin as she rubs her paws all over the top part of her belly, kneading the distended skin. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cTo be curled up in here, where it\u2019s warm and soft, knowing you\u2019ll become a part of me forever\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><i><b>\u201cY-yeah!\u201d</b></i></font> You nod excitedly, mustering up a little more energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles at your enthusiasm. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad to hear you\u2019re still onboard!\u201d</b></span> You stare in awe as she slides her maw open, a blast of her meaty breath hitting you in her face as she practically unhinges her jaw, showing you just how wide she could stretch. You glance wide-eyed down her throat, realizing just how smooth and soft the pink flesh looked. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go ahead and climb right on in?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a moment\u2019s hesitation, you try to plunge yourself into the mienshao\u2019s dark, warm throat. However, despite all your effort, you can\u2019t manage more than a few errant twitches. Your body simply won\u2019t obey you. <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><i><b>\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026 move\u2026\u201d</b></i></font> You complain. You were calm just a moment ago, but the realization that you couldn\u2019t control your own body was starting to make you more and more distressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed your distress immediately. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cOh, shhhh. Don\u2019t worry about it, cutie. Just relax. I\u2019ll take goood care of you,\u201d</b></span> she immediately reassured you, hugging you against her chest. This calmed you down somewhat. Sure, it was a bummer that you couldn\u2019t move a muscle\u2026 but as long as this kind mienshao was taking care of you, you had nothing to worry about, right? You smiled again as she reopened her maw, a few drops of saliva wetting your snout as she gives you a grand view down her throat. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cSee? Doesn\u2019t it seem lovely in there? There\u2019s really nothing to worry about.\u201d</b></span> Without further ado, once you seem comfortable, she plunges you head-first into her maw. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cIn you go!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><i><b>\u201cMph!\u201d</b></i></font> You said, flinching instinctually in surprise as you suddenly felt the powerful muscles of her throat clamp down tightly around your snout. Your panic subsides, however, when you realize just how pleasant the tightness was. <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><i><b>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d</b></i></font> To your broken mind, the world seemed dizzying and confusing. Compared to all that, being inside the mienshao\u2019s body just seemed\u2026 simpler. Comfortable. You don\u2019t have to worry about making tough decisions, or figuring things out. You can just let the mienshao do all that for you, while you\u2019re cuddled away safely within her belly. With that thought, you go limp completely, subjecting yourself to her will entirely\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact that her belly was already stretched to the limit, you were somehow one of the easiest meals the mienshao has ever had. Usually, even for an experienced predator like herself, swallowing such a large Pokemon would be a bit of a struggle, but she could practically slurp you up like a noodle. Perhaps it was your complete lack of resistance, allowing her to maneuver your body any which way with ease. You were so limp, she felt like she was just swallowing down a regular serving of food, rather than a living, breathing Pokemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the weight of her stomach, she managed to lean back, hoisting your haunches up in the air. From there, you practically slid deeper down her throat all on your own. She only had to give the weakest of swallows to ease your descent into her stomach. The darkness, pressure, and swaddling effect of her body was intensely soothing to you, beyond anything you\u2019d ever experienced. You were in heaven\u2026 and the mienshao was glad you were enjoying yourself. Of course, she knew your experience would turn sour the moment you reached her stomach and found what remained of your friend\u2026 but that wasn\u2019t her problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, her lips slid closed around your hind paws, and shortly after, the massive bulge in her throat disappeared into her chest. The skin of her belly visibly distended just a few inches further when another hapless Pokemon was deposited unceremoniously into the churning sac. By now, the persian\u2019s struggles had died down, leaving her huge belly deceptively still. She couldn\u2019t even imagine what the Pokemon inside were going through, and she didn\u2019t really care. All she cared about was the sensation of utter fullness, and the intoxicating feeling of power. These weren\u2019t the first Pokemon to be gurgled away by her powerful body, and they certainly wouldn\u2019t be the last\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach, at this point, was too big for her to even think about moving. Luckily, the sheer size of her meals made her feel like she was about to slip into a food coma. With a sly smile, she used her own, soft belly as a bed as she drifted off to sleep, probably for dozens of hours while her meal was worked off. Whatever important business Issac wanted her to deal with could wait. Right now, she just wanted some private time with her two very special guests...</span></div></div>",

As you made your way around her immense, bulging belly, you realized your paws were shaking, your fur was standing on edge, your heart was beating out of your chest. You know that all of this all <i>wrong\u2026 impossible\u2026 dangerous!</i> Still, those facts only made this all more alluring. Your conscious mind screamed at you to run, that this was all insane\u2026 but your body acted seemingly on its own, the mienshao guiding you with her body language with almost hypnotic ease, until you were face-to-face with her curvy ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt her long, band-like tail wrap around your neck, pulling your face closer. You almost shuddered at the smell of the mienshao\u2019s arousal, your snout nearly buried beneath her tail, staring at her tailhole and wet pussy inches away from your face. A drop of pre dripped onto the carpet, your cock fully unsheathed and burning with anticipation\u2026 though you figured she had much more in mind for you then just sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it, she rolled backwards on her belly, and her ass came colliding down on your face. Suddenly, it felt like a muzzle was squeezing down around your snout like a vice. Your vision is filled with the mienshao\u2019s fur as your face is pressed between her cheeks. You try to pull away, but your snout was firmly stuck; and it didn\u2019t take you long to realize where. Just as the realization struck you, she leaned back once again, and the painfully tight sphincter accepted your entire head with incredible ease.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cA-ah! Fuck!\u201d</b></span> The mienshao screams out so loudly the neighbors could probably hear, the pain of the incredible insertion only making the experience that much more pleasurable for her. Truly, this mienshao must be completely mad. Even though her body was already stretched beyond its farthest limits, she was still hungry for more\u2026 and she decided to seize it in the most insane and foul way imaginable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b> \u201cOh\u2026 oh Arceus\u2026 ohh\u2026 mmm\u2026\u201d</b></span> She was panting and moaning shamelessly, every movement making her gasp at the sensation. You were pressing your forepaws up against her pillowy cheeks, trying desperately to pull yourself free, but the ring wrapped around your neck was too tight. With your long horn, once your head slipped in, there was no chance you were going to be able to pull it out; you could only go in one direction. The mienshao cried out again as your forepaws slipped into her greasy tailhole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Now, she was practically sitting on your shoulders, gravity itself forcing you deeper and deeper into her rectum, which was an almost paradoxical combination of incredibly stretchy and unbearably tight. It was clean and dry, at least, but it was swelteringly warm, foul-smelling, dark, and claustrophobic. You could barely breathe! You hope she wasn\u2019t planning on sending you on a full trip through her intestines; you weren\u2019t sure if you would be able to survive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe undulating muscles behind the walls of her colon squeezed rhythmically around you, tugging you deeper like conveyer belts on both side. With this combined with her crushing weight bearing down on you, it wasn\u2019t too long before your entire upper half had disappeared into her rectum, the dual ring-like sphincters of her tailhole wrapped tightly around your middle, almost crushing your ribs. Terror filled your heart as you felt the sphincters slowly slide down your hind legs, but your attempts to escape your fate only succeeded in pleasuring the mienshao further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite your disgust at what was happening, your body betrayed you, and your dick was uncomfortably rigid as your thick thighs slid between her\u2019s. You gasped as the smooth walls of her colon squeezed and rubbed almost painfully tightly against your vivid pink shaft and fluffy white balls. You felt a bit of pre soaking into the fur of your belly, much to your shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cOh\u2026 mmm\u2026 f\u2026 ff...\u201d</b></span> The mienshao tried to taunt you, mock you like the glorified buttplug you were, ask her how you felt sliding into her perfect, superior body, where you belong \u2014 but all she could manage was an unintelligible gasping stutter, her mind fried by pleasure. Since she first started funneling that persian down her throat, the mienshao has been climaxing again and again, her mind foggy as she had to keep reminding herself to breathe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered all those years ago, when she swallowed down another Pokemon for the first time; it had been a measly Eevee, but still, its squirming resulted in some of the best orgasms of her life, ultimately leaving her panting, half-conscious and unable to move a muscle. Like many predators, she became practically addicted to the feeling, constantly looking to stretch herself bigger and bigger until she finally hits her limits. This certainly wasn\u2019t her biggest meal \u2014 she\u2019s gulped down a charizard before \u2014 but her two visitors were more than enough to \u2018satisfy\u2019 her tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, only your hind paws still emerged from between her voluptuous cheeks, braced against the ground. She panted as she ground her pillowy ass against the floor, desperate to seal the absol inside her entirely. Another climax struck her the moment her tailhole slid shut behind your paws. The sweltering warmness and crushing tightness now covered every single inch of your body, as her muscles continued to pull you deeper and deeper, taking a reverse journey through her large intestine. While it seemed completely clean inside her, what little air there was inside her colon smelled absolutely foul, and stung your nostrils every time you tried to take a breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swaddling effect combined with the oxygen deprivation quickly wore away at your mind, and soon you were half-conscious inside her, completely limp. Your journey through her colon became a dream-like haze, as you began to hallucinate images and voices in the darkness. They didn\u2019t say anything intelligible, but the voices comforted you somehow, and you went limp and allowed the mienshao\u2019s body to simply take you. Your manhood remained rigidly at attention, though your mind couldn\u2019t even register pleasure at this point, so it went ignored for now. The more surreal things got, the more your entire adventure out here just seemed like an elaborate dream. Any moment now, you\u2019d wake up back in your den, out in the forest, where things made sense\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you reached the end of your short journey through her colon, you had lost consciousness completely; which was good, because your trip through her small intestine would be a much longer, much more claustrophobic ride. Her intestines weren\u2019t nearly as sensitive as her mouth and throat were, so the mienshao couldn\u2019t tell where you were exactly, but she could definitely <i>feel</i> the warmth of your body within hers. She continued humping her own belly for a while, bringing herself to climax a couple times as you made your way through her intestines, but eventually even she lost consciousness, exhausted by the extreme \u2018insertions\u2019. Luckily, she was able to use her own belly as a big, soft, fluffy bed as she slowly dozed off\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were only travelling through her small intestines briefly, but in that time, you did have a single dream; a vision of your mother, silent, in a void, crying as if calling out for help but going completely unheard. You were shaken from that dream by the feeling of another incredibly tight sphincter squeezing around your body, forcing you out of the miserable confines of the mienshao\u2019s intestines. Panic filled you, as you forgot where you were for a moment\u2026 only to slowly remember everything you\u2019d just been through. This must be the mienshao\u2019s stomach! The sac was much, much roomier than her colon had been\u2026 or at least, it would be roomier, if the persian\u2019s huge belly wasn\u2019t taking up 99% of the available space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were soon deposited completely in the mienshao\u2019s gut proper, only to be pressed up tightly between the persian\u2019s fluffy belly and the slick stomach walls. You panicked for a moment, as you were almost smothered by the persian\u2019s belly; but after a few moments of desperate wriggling, you finally managed to push up your snout and give yourself some room to breathe. Now that you were confident the persian\u2019s belly wasn\u2019t going to smother you like a pillow, you took a moment to assess the situation you had found yourself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had just been eaten in reverse. You wouldn\u2019t have believed such a thing was possible unless you had experienced it yourself. Your parents had warned you about pokemon swallowing other pokemon, but they never mentioned anything about this. Still, what\u2019s done is done\u2026 and it doesn\u2019t seem to matter which direction the mienshao consumes you, as you seemed to end up in the same place either way. The mienshao\u2019s stomach was reassuringly similar to the ninetale\u2019s, at least; it was uncomfortably warm, a little under 100 degrees, but at least there wasn\u2019t any acid to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing forced up so tightly against the persian\u2019s belly was miserable at first, but it didn\u2019t take long for you to get used to it; in fact, her gut was so soft and pillowy, it was actually downright comfortable to snuggle up with. The struggles of the luxray inside seemed to have ceased; you figure he\u2019s finally met his fate within the persian\u2019s stomach. That thought exciting you for some reason, and as sensation returned, you noticed that your rigid shaft was pressed tightly against the persian\u2019s soft gut, sinking slightly into the pillowy, malleable flesh. It was more than a little awkward. Your body was desperate to climax, but you couldn\u2019t just finish against your friend\u2019s fur. You just tried to stay completely still and hoped that your arousal would eventually die down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you realize you haven\u2019t heard a word from Silvia yet. Sure, the rest of her body was on the other side of the other side of the persian\u2019s stomach, but surely she could feel you, considering you were completely pinned beneath her gut. Your heart sunk as you were struck with the paranoia that she might already be dead. <b>\u201cSilvia! Can you hear me?\u201d</b> You yell as loud as you can muster, your voice severely muffled by the persian\u2019s belly covering you. <b>\u201cAre you alright, Silvia?\u201d</b> You heard her groan from above, as if she had been woken from her slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cAbsol?\u201d</b></span> You could faintly hear her voice. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cIs that\u2026 really you?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s me!\u201d</b> You respond, glad to hear she was okay. <b>\u201cListen, the mienshao tricked me! She sent me up the, uh, \u2018other end\u2019.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201c... oh\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYou haven\u2019t felt any acid yet, right?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s planning on digesting us.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWell\u2026 that\u2019s a relief, at least,\u201d</b> you said, though it was a small comfort. You still had to deal with the fact that you might be stuck in these unbearably tight confines for the entire night. Plus, your arousal didn\u2019t seem to be dying down anytime soon. Any time your erection accidentally brushed against her stomach, a new wave of excitement shot through you. You clenched your eyes in shame; you knew she had to feel it poking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cYou seem a little\u2026 tense.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cW-what?\u201d</b> You ask, your eyes shooting open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault, really. I\u2019m the one that got you stuck in here. I wish I could offer you relief myself, but I\u2019m a little immobilized at the moment,\u201d</b></span> she said, completely nonchalantly. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cYou can rub up against me, if you\u2019d like.\u201d</b></span> <i>Fuck. Damn it.</i> You hoped that a nun, of all Pokemon, would be the voice of reason, but no! Instead, she\u2019s just as perverse as the mienshao. You\u2019d never run into anybody like her before. Despite the \u2018offer\u2019 she was making, she sounded completely monotone and uninterested, almost bored. It was obvious she only offered for your sake\u2026 but now that you had her permission, there was no way you were going to be able to restrain yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, feeling your shaft poking up against her gut, desperate for relief. You knew this was wrong, perverse, shameful\u2026 but you just couldn\u2019t help but start moving your hips, grinding very slowly against her unbelievably soft, pillowy, round belly. It was so soft and fluffy, it almost felt better then her paws, especially with how squishy and malleable it was now that the luxray within had been largely converted to useless goo and chyme. Your already heavy breathing grew even more belabored as you humped softly against her belly. The only reason you couldn\u2019t climax instantly was because the tight restraints of the mienshao\u2019s stomach forced you to grind painfully slowly, resulting in your humiliating quest for relief to be as drawn out as it possibly can. Unfortunately, you couldn\u2019t reach your paws down to stroke yourself off, so humping her gut would be the best you could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot making much progress, you start to think about how there used to be an entire Pokemon, alive within the fluffy belly you were currently humping. You remembered just how muscular and athletic the luxray was. It was obvious that he had taken care of himself, exercising and training his body for hours until it was absolutely perfect. You wonder if he would\u2019ve put some much effort into perfecting his body, if he knew it all would just end up as fat on some random persian? You think about all the friends he must\u2019ve made, and all the things he must\u2019ve accomplished in his life\u2026 only for him to end up as pudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus, that thought excited you. You wondered what it was like for him, as he was gurgled away. Did he consider the fact that his only real accomplishment in life would just be adding to the persian\u2019s already perfect body? A part of you almost envied him. Even though you knew it would be a terrible fate, as you grinded up against her stomach, you fantasized about what it would be like to be churned up inside. Maybe Silvia was right, and your soul would really be trapped inside her body. You knew it was ridiculous, but you thought about spending the rest of your life as just a bit of pudge added to her curvy ass. It\u2019d be an honor to become part of something so much larger than yourself\u2026 to forget about the horrors of the world, and devote yourself entirely to the persian\u2019s beautiful body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith thoughts like those, it didn\u2019t take long for you to push yourself over the edge. You clenched your eyes shut, a wave of ecstasy flowing over you as you emptied your balls over the persian\u2019s belly. Her fur was already completely soaked with various juices, so even your truly prodigious load went completely unnoticed\u2026 but she did notice how suddenly you tensed up, and heard the adorable little moan you let slip. She smiled warmly as you went limp, your shaft slowly retreating back into your sheathe, as you snuggled against her belly, satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cGood night, Absol\u2026\u201d</b></span> Her gorgeous, silky voice reached you. She was glad she could make you happy, at least. Now that she was kicked from the monastery, you were the only Pokemon she had left\u2026 and she was starting to warm up to you, slowly. She liked how innocent and timid and\u2026 honest you were, compared to most Pokemon she\u2019s met. As you dozed off within the mienshao\u2019s stomach, comforted by the pressure of the persian\u2019s soft belly pinning you down, you smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cGood night\u2026\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u2504\u2504\u2504</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mienshao yawned loudly as she naturally woke from her slumber. For a moment, panic struck her. She dozed off! How long had she been sleeping? Had she accidentally digested her visitors? Sure enough, though, it only took a single look at her belly to realize they were just fine. She sighed in relief, rubbing over her humongous gut in admiration, barely able to reach over it. It felt wonderful\u2026 but it was a little inconvenient, considering it was about three times the size of her entire body. She gazed out a window, and saw that the sun hadn\u2019t risen yet. She\u2019d only been sleeping for a few hours, so her \u2018guests\u2019 were probably just fine in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were probably getting a little tender, though. She could slow her digestion, but not pause it completely. Thus, if she wanted to let them out, now would be the time, before any permanent damage could be done. Then again, she was still feeling achingly horny, and looking down at her huge gut, the thought of turning all this into nothing but pudge sent chills down her spine. She certainly wasn\u2019t morally averse to digesting her prey\u2026 but she\u2019d rather not digest random innocents, if she could help it. Still, it was so damn tempting...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The mienshao was a truly upstanding citizen of Shipton City\u2026 or at least, that\u2019s what she tells herself. Sure, she might fit in a snack or two here or there\u2026 but everyone has cheat days! Compared to the mobsters and the elite of the town, she was practically a saint. Still, she had that very same predatory drive within her, and the very thought of gurgling <i>both</i> these helpless Pokemon up into fat almost sent shivers down her spine. Surely this one little binge couldn\u2019t hurt\u2026 right? She considered it for a while\u2026 before sighing as she ultimately forced those thoughts from her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how tempting it may seem, she knew it wouldn\u2019t be right. Besides, she couldn\u2019t afford to lounge around and digest all day. She had already had more than enough fun toying with the cute couple \u2014 it was time to let the poor suckers go. Her mind made up, she set about the laborious task of freeing the two huge Pokemon imprisoned within her body. Releasing prey unharmed was a difficult task indeed, and can only really be consistently done by master predators such as herself. It was especially difficult when dealing with prey of this size, but the mienshao was still confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe process consisted of using the contracting and undulating muscles of her stomach to painstakingly ease her prey up into her esophagus, and then let her throat muscles pull them the rest of the way up to her maw. Of course, this being exactly the opposite of the intended purpose of these two organs, she\u2019d face a lot of resistance, so her prey never felt so pleasant coming up as they did going down. Still, it had to be done. All of her dignity was thrown to the wind as the mienshao started loudly hacking and sputtering, like a cat coughing up a furball, feeling like she was turning her stomach inside out as she attempted to maneuver her prey up towards her esophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body rebelled against her, wanting to keep its nutritious meals \u2014 but eventually, it relented, and the sphincter atop her stomach spread and allowed the persian\u2019s head to slide into her esophagus. The big cat was immediately woken from her slumber when she felt the powerful muscles clamp around her snout, pulling her up into the painfully tight, dark tube of the mienshao\u2019s throat. Despite her initial panic, the persian stayed deathly still, immediately recognizing her surroundings. She knew that if she wanted to survive, she had to cooperate with the mienshao.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her esophagus caught the persian\u2019s snout, the mienshao started working double-time, bobbing her head back and forth with strange gluking noises as an implausibly huge bulge started travelling up her throat. Her eyes were clenched tight, and a few tears streamed down her cheeks as she felt her throat stretch to its absolute limit. Eventually, though, the persian\u2019s head emerged from the back of the mienshao\u2019s throat.Now that the hard part was over, it didn\u2019t take long for the mienshao to force Silvia entirely out of her throat, depositing the persian unceremoniously onto the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment her throat was clear of obstructions, the mienshao started coughing and gasping for fresh air, clutching at her agonizingly sore neck while the persian climbed to her feet. Silvia was shivering as she stood in a puddle of juices on the floor.  She was disoriented and soaked to the bone with saliva and gastric juices after having been trapped inside the predator\u2019s body for so long, but otherwise no worse for wear. The massive bulge in the persian\u2019s body had largely disappeared by now, the luxray\u2019s body adding considerable pudge to the once slim felie. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cWelcome back to the real world,\u201d</b></span> the mienshao smiled once she finally composed herself. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cYup, you survived. Being the pillar of the community I am, I decided to go ahead and take it easy on ya.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019ll always be so lucky, though. In a city like this, next time, maybe don\u2019t go crawling down the throats of random fuckin\u2019 strangers, okay? Heh!\u201d</b></span> She taunted with a giggle, tapping the persian on the nose. Silvia ignored her teasing completely, the disoriented feline weakly gesturing to the bulge that remained in the mienshao\u2019s gut. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cOh! Wonderin\u2019 how your little boyfriend\u2019s doing, huh?\u201d</b></span> The mienshao chuckled, rubbing her paws all over every inch of her round, distended belly. Despite having no intention of actually digesting the absol, the mienshao decided she wanted to tease Silvia just a little bit longer. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know. Maybe I\u2019ll just end up keeping him in there\u2026 give ya a lesson in common sense.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe persian shudders. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cN-no...\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smirk, the mienshao kneels down to face her, eye-to-eye. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cHm? You want me to let him out, eh? Well, why don\u2019t you make me?\u201d</b></span> She taunted. The persian remained motionless as the mienshao tapped her own chest, urging her on. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cGo on. Make your move. Rescue your little boy toy here.\u201d</b></span> The persian could only shiver in place, too weak and disoriented to fight the mienshao. The fighting-type chuckled sadistically, folding her arms as the persian cowered beneath her. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cNo? Not going to try anything? Guess you don\u2019t really want him back after all\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the persian\u2019s eyes slid open\u2026 to reveal that they were bloodshot, her cheeks wet with tears. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cPlease...\u201d</b></span> She begged weakly, the utter desperation in her voice tugging on the mienshao\u2019s heart strings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mienshao recoiled slightly, upset by the persian\u2019s expression. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cJeez, alright, alright. I was just messin\u2019 around. I\u2019ll let him out, sure thing\u2026\u201d</b></span> The mienshao insisted, trying to reassure the crying feline. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cYou look, uh\u2026 a little bit down in the dumps. My room\u2019s open, if you need some privacy.\u201d</b></span> She gestured to the bedroom in the back, and without another word, the mienshao limped weakly away, looking as defeated and broken as ever. The mienshao frowned at the sight, her good mood tainted. Might as well just get this over with\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were awoken to the feeling of being forced up a tight, wet tunnel, which squeezed and undulated painfully all around you. In your half-conscious state, you had completely forgotten the events of the previous night, and you\u2019re struck with panic when you realize you can\u2019t recognize your surroundings. You kick and squirm with all your might, thinking you were being swallowed by some dangerous predator\u2026 in reality, of course, it was quite the opposite. You had been reduced to a huge bulge travelling up the mienshao\u2019s neck; a bulge that distended and stretched painfully when you moved, much to the mienshao\u2019s agony. The pain was so intense, she was tempted to just give up and leave you in there\u2026 but she had already made a promise to Silvia\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, you completed your reverse tour through the mienshao\u2019s body; up her rear end, and out her front end. Truly, the biology of predators defies all logic. At least you made it out alive. You coughed up gastric juices as you laid there on the floor, catching your breath as the mienshao clutched her throat. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cUgh! You almost choked me!\u201d</b></span> She groaned, her throat raspy and creaking. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cStay fuckin\u2019 still next time, will you?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cW-what\u2026?\u201d</b> You stuttered, confused and disoriented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled her eyes with a groan. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cDon\u2019t you remember? You spent the night in <i>here</i>, pretty boy. I was just lettin\u2019 ya out,\u201d</b></span> she reminded you, gesturing to her now empty stomach. She reached over and helped you to your paws, patting you on the back as you got your bearings. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cThere you go. Up and at \u2018em. You\u2019ve got a big day ahead of ya.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squint as you glance around the room, the dimly-lit apartment seeming almost blindingly bright compared to the darkness of the mienshao\u2019s belly. You realize that the persian was nowhere to be seen, and for a moment, the possibility she\u2019s been digested flashes across your mind. <b>\u201cW-where\u2019s Silvia?\u201d</b> You muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cIn there,\u201d</b></span> she pointed to the bedroom, the door hanging partially ajar. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cYou should talk to her, actually. Maybe seeing you\u2019re okay will lift her spirits.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look aimlessly around, your consciousness returning to you. <b>\u201c... okay,\u201d</b> you reply, almost in a whisper, as you step towards the bedroom door...</span></div></div>",

She didn\u2019t know if she could stand leaving her belly <i>empty</i> again, after putting in all the effort of stuffing it to this extent. No, no\u2026 the only way she\u2019d be willing to give up this belly was for the sake of churning the delightful couple into pudge. Besides, something tells her they both wanted to be gurgled up into fat, whether they\u2019d want to admit it or not. Thus, on a whim, she makes the decisive decision to just\u2026 leave them in there, and whatever happens, happens. Delighted by this thought, she yawned against, and quickly drifted back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntermittently throughout the night, she\u2019d be awoken from her slumber by the desperate kicking and wriggling from inside her stomach as digestion began to set in. Each time, she\u2019d just giggle, rub over her belly for a while, before dozing off again, digesting the three Pokemon without a care in the world. Of course, she was intensely \u2018excited\u2019 by these struggles, as well as the thought of what exactly was about to happen to the two Pokemon she was keeping prisoner. Still, that was something she could deal with in the morning, when she was nice and pudgy. For now, she focused on getting a good night\u2019s sleep\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe struggling actually ceased surprisingly quickly, as if the pair had just given up and accepted their fate early, for whatever reason. They, too, faded into unconsciousness as the slumbering mienshao\u2019s stomach worked away at them. This made it much easier for Rana to get some shut-eye, and it wasn\u2019t until about seven hours later until she was woken once more, this time by the sight of sunlight peeking in through her windows. Her belly was mostly gone, now, her meal having been harvested of all useful nutrients and reduced to goo sliding through her intestines. Still, she felt\u2026 different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up off the uncomfortable, carpeted floor, stretching out her back as she gazed around her apartment in a haze. Sparks of excitement shot through her body was she considered the events of the previous night. When had she last digested a Pokemon, even? Three months ago? Longer? She felt sort of bad for the couple, but she\u2019d been so stressed recently, gurgling up a few hapless outsiders was just what she needed to raise her spirits. She stumbled over to the couch, which creaked under her extra weight as she considered her next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs an experienced predator, her metabolism was incredible. The persian and the luxray added perhaps a tenth of their weight to her now curvier form. The weight seemed to be spread evenly around her body, puffing out her fluffy chest and belly in particular. Despite the fact that her stomach was completely empty by now, she still had quite an impressive potbelly, which jiggled and bounced whenever she walked around too fast. While her added paunch sort of ruined her athletic figure, it was minor compared to the rest of the damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe absol, on the other hand, added most of his weight to her ass, thighs and legs. She didn\u2019t even have to look, really \u2014 she could <i>feel</i> the extra cushioning as she sat down. Predators often liked to joke that the day after a big meal, every chair felt like the comfiest chair on earth; and it was funny \u2018cause it was true. Her pillowy, soft rear end was lifting her a solid few inches off the couch, to the point that she was more sitting on her own pudge then she was on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she couldn\u2019t take it anymore; she <i>had</i> to see what her new and improved ass looked like with her own eyes. It was so rare that she got the opportunity, after all, and she wanted to fully savor the voluptuous new body the three Pokemon had sacrificed their lives to give her. She hopped up, feeling her cheeks rub and jiggle against one another as she rushed to her bedroom where a full-length mirror adorned the far wall. This wouldn\u2019t be the first time she had gained this sort of weight, so it\u2019s not like she\u2019d be surprised by what she sees, but she wanted to seize the opportunity to fully admire her pudgier self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a pear-like figure now, with her hips being over twice as wide as her shoulders. Her calves, hamstrings and thighs looked like three distinct entities, each one pudgier then the one below. Her soft, round cheeks swelled out so much, it was difficult to tell where her back ended and her ass began. Most of her weight stayed above the knees, and it almost seemed like a miracle that her skinny calves could support her humongous rear end and thick hips. She had about doubled in weight, probably gaining about 35 kg overall, with most of it going to her ass, thighs and belly, as well as plumping out her chest a bit. The rest of her body seemed largely unaffected. She pinched her arm, seeing that they\u2019d gained a few pounds, but not much. Her cheeks were fuller slightly, but overall, her face was as skinny and beautiful as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bounced a bit in place, watching her rear cheeks jiggle and slap against eachother slightly. Her body was so perfect after a fresh meal, she almost wished it could be permanent. She wondered; is it narcissistic to be attracted to yourself? \u2018Cause she definitely was at the moment, or at least excited by the incredible body her \u2018visitors\u2019 had given her. The thought that multiple Pokemon had sacrificed her lives to make her this beautiful was titillating beyond belief, and before she knew it, the mienshao was almost tingling with arousal. Surely, one of her neighbors would be help her fully enjoy her pudgier form\u2026</span></div></div>",

She poked her head out of her bedroom, and was a little disappointed to see the mightyena walk in. To be frank, she was kind of hoping her surprise visitor would be someone with a cock\u2026 but she supposed the canine\u2019s long, rough tongue would serve her well enough. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cHey, do you think you could deal with whatever Issac\u2019s been blabbering about?

Shiiit, guess I see where you\u2019re comin\u2019 from now,\u201d</b></span> the mightyena said.

Might as well enjoy it while it lasts, huh?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, without warning, the mightyena dipped her legs between her thick legs, and lifted the pudgy mienshao up on her shoulders. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cHehehe!\u201d</b></span> Rana giggled excitedly as the canine took charge. Of course, being about 70 kg, the mightyena couldn\u2019t lift her long, but she could manage it just long enough to dump her onto her couch. In one smooth motion, the mightyena hopped up ontop her, straddling her pudgier body, and locked the mienshao in a kiss before she could even get a word out edgewise. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cMmf!\u201d</b></span> The mienshao reacted, a little surprise, but immediately melted into the mightyena\u2019s touch, wrapping her arms around her and hugging her against her pudgy body as they locked lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the mightyena pulled back, smirking as she looked down on the mienshao\u2019s smiling, blushing face. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cNow, I want you to tell me every detail,\u201d</b></span> she said, assertively, as she moved down the mienshao\u2019s body. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cDid they squirm?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was confused by the question for a moment, only to be spurred into action by the sensation of the mightyena sending her tongue along her rounded, sensitive belly. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cOhhh yes, they s-squirmed and wriggled all night! I thought my stomach was going to burst!\u201d</b></span> She gasped, gritting her teeth as the mightyena passionately kissed and licked her way down Rana\u2019s pudgy body, slowly coming closer and closer to the mienshao\u2019s waiting sex. Of course, describing the vents of the previous night was difficult with all the anticipation burning in her chest. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cSlowly\u2026 they j-just\u2026 stopped\u2026 like they couldn\u2019t\u2026 they couldn\u2019t...\u201d</b></span> She eventually pants out, hardly able to even concentrate on her story as the mightyena drifted lower and lower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she was interrupted completely when the canine parted her lips with a paw and slid her smooth tongue slowly against her clit. \u201cOoh!\u201d She gasped out at the sensation, the building anticipation finally getting its payoff. She leaned back and bit her lip as the mightyena went down on her in earnest, squeezing the canine\u2019s head between her thickened thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, though, the mightyena pulled away, leaving mienshao wanting. Rana whimpered, looking down, confused as to why the mightyena would just stop so suddenly, leaving her burning with anticipation. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cMhmm? Continue,\u201d</b></span> The canine looked up at her expectantly, her snout still covered in fem juices. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cWhy do you think they stopped struggling?\u201d</b></span> Mienshao was baffled for a moment, until she realized what the mightyena wanted. The deal was obvious; if she wanted to ride the canine\u2019s skilled tongue, she\u2019d have to keep describing how she gurgling up those innocent Pokemon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201c... I-I think they realized they belonged inside me. I think they <i>\u2014 ooh! \u2014</i> wanted to be\u2026 p-part of my body, f-f-forever,\u201d</b></span> she obediently continued, though she occasionally paused to gasp and moan as the mightyena\u2019s snout disappeared between her thighs once again, returning to work. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cI mean, w-why would they want to leave? S-sealed away in my <i>\u2014 mm! \u2014</i> big, r-round belly, their whole <i>\u2014 f-fuck! \u2014</i> lives leading up to becoming nothing but useless pudge on my ass...\u201d</b></span> She whimpered, trying to come up with the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mightyena smirked, having Rana wrapped around her finger. She didn\u2019t just want to give the mienshao release; she made her <i>crave</i> it. She made Rana practically <i>beg</i> for it. With every pause in the story, the mightyena would pause, too\u2026 and every time the mienshao said something the canine found hot, she'd be appropriately 'rewarded'. The canine herself was growing more and more aroused as she forced her lover to describe how she gurgled those poor outsiders up into nothing but a little extra fat. Eventually, brought to the edge, Rana clamped her thighs around the mightyena\u2019s head again. <span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cF-fuck!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the release she craved eluded her as the mightyena went completely limp, and the mienshao whimpered audibly in genuine despair as her climax just narrowly escaped her. She looked down in desperate confusion as the mightyena pulled away once again, looking up at her with that same expectant expression. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cYeah? Keep tellin\u2019 the story,\u201d</b></span> she said nonchalantly. And just like that, the mienshao was filled with rage. Rana wasn\u2019t in the mood to be toyed with right now. The mightyena always loved to tease, draw things out, and build the anticipation\u2026 but Rana\u2019s anticipation had already hit a boiling point, and all she wanted now was release. If her neighbor wasn\u2019t going to satisfy her, it was time for her to turn the tables. Before she knew it, the mienshao had grabbed the mightyena by the sides, and pinned her on her back on the couch. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cWhoa!\u201d</b></span> She yelped in surprise. The poor canine only had a few seconds to react before the mienshao brought her full, incredible weight down on her face, squeezing her head up between her thick thighs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cEnough <i>talk</i>. You\u2019re not fuckin\u2019 <i>breathin\u2019</i> \u2018till I\u2019m satisfied,\u201d</b></span> she practically hissed, a toothy smirk on her face as she buried the mightyena\u2019s head beneath her pudge. Of course, the mienshao would never actually hurt her; but the peril and utter domination excited the mightyena enough to drive her to keep eating the mienshao out with renewed vigor, all while looking up at Rana with feigned pleading eyes as if begging to be spared. With mienshao in charge, things were much more straight-forward; she just mindlessly grinding the mightyena\u2019s face against the couch as she practically buried her snout-deep in her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing held true; she definitely had to hold her breath. Worse still, the weight bearing down on her was incredible. The mienshao was almost twice her weight, and with all the pressure on her head, she had an irrational fear that it might just pop between her thighs. Of course, the element of danger only urged her on, and she dug her tongue into the mienshoa\u2019s sex with reckless abandon, trying to push her to the edge as fast as she could. The chubby mienshao was panting as she grinded her hips roughly against the mightyena\u2019s face, growing closer and closer to the release she so desperately craved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the canine was starting to run worryingly low on air, the horny mienshao finally reached her climax. Once again, she was loud enough that the neighbors could hear, her entire body going tense as her grinding slowly grows less coordinating, before stopping completely. Eventually, she leans back, lifting herself up off the mightyena\u2019s face. The canine immediately coughs and gasps for fresh air, the fur of her face and snout completely soaked. The two Pokemon rested on their backs on opposite sides of the couch, slowly winding down as they caught their breath. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cJeez, Rana\u2026 y\u2019almost <i>drowned</i> me,\u201d</b></span> the mightyena eventually joked, wiping the femjuices from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cHeh! Should\u2019a hurried up, then!\u201d</b></span> The mienshao giggled, sitting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe canine rolls shakily off the couch, coughing a little bit as she walked towards the bathroom. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cY\u2019know, I wish we could hang out and do gay shit all day, but\u2026 y\u2019really should see what Issac's up to,\u201d</b></span> she said over her shoulder. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cIt sounded important.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>\u201cOh? You sure you don\u2019t\u2026?\u201d</b></span> The mienshao frowned, a little distressed that she hadn\u2019t returned the favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cNah. Call this a favor,\u201d</b></span> the mightyena called from the bathroom. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cLet\u2019s just get cleaned up.\u201d</b></span> Rana sighed wistfully as she returned to the drudgery of daily life. This was all a nice reprieve, and she needed \u2018breaks\u2019 like this to keep herself from going crazy, but after this, it was back to dealing with the bullshit politics of trying to keep Shipton city from tearing itself apart. Still, she\u2019ll never forget the lovely night she spent with that persian and that adorable absol...</span></div></div>",

At first, you thought her jobs looked fun\u2026 but as the night dragged on, you noticed the persian\u2019s \u2018sisters\u2019 seemed to pile up as much work on her as they can, seemingly for their own amusement. <b>\u201cThey don\u2019t seem to treat you very well,\u201d</b> you comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cNo, no. They\u2019re helping me,\u201d</b></span> she frowns. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cFor the past few years, I\u2019ve been trying to seek penance wherever I can.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhy?\u201d</b> You ask, only for her to freeze in place, tensing up at the simple question. <b>\u201cI-If you don\u2019t want to talk about it, that\u2019s fine!\u201d</b> You insisted, taken aback by hear reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns to you, the sadness evident in her eyes even through her veil. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cNo, no. It is my duty to always be honest about the sins I\u2019ve committed, and thereby accept the consequences for them,\u201d</b></span> she sighs, explaining it as if she\u2019s said it a dozen times before. She closes her eyes and takes a deep breath, mentally preparing herself, before elaborating. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cWhen I first found this order, I was\u2026 lost and alone. The prioress, Sister Noviella\u2026 she took me under her wing. She gave me purpose. She led me to faith. And over the years, we grew\u2026 closer.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pauses for a while. <b>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</b> You ask, your curiosity burning. Still, she remained silent, as if struggling to force the words from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cI\u2026 d-devoured her!\u201d</b></span> She managed to choke out, as if physically expelling the confession from her body. You were stunned. The persian stared at the ground in abject shame as she continued. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cNot out of hunger \u2013 for pleasure. I had... sinful urges, and in a moment of weakness, I let them overtake me,\u201d</b></span> she explains, a bit of anger rising in her voice. You could almost feel her self-loathing. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cI\u2019ve spent every day of my life trying to atone for\u2026 what I did that day. I can only pray that she is able to forgive me.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cForgive you?\u201d</b> You ask. You assumed this \u2018Noelia\u2019 was long dead, but from the way the persian talked about her, it was as if she was still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cMany scholars of Cresselia believe that when a Pokemon\u2019s physical form is digested, their soul is sealed away as part of their predator\u2019s body, temporarily unable to pass on to whatever afterlife there may be,\u201d</b></span> she sighs. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cSister Noviello will remain a member of this order, but for the time being she must attend from\u2026 well, here.\u201d</b></span> She gestures shamefully to her own backside with a paw. While it was covered by her veil, you could tell her ass was notably plump compared to the rest of her. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cFrom the look on your face, you must think I\u2019m crazy.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly realize you had the most baffled expression. <b>\u201cN-no! I\u2019m just, y\u2019know, I\u2019m curious,\u201d</b> you insisted. Despite how crazy her story was, you sympathized with the persian somehow. <b>\u201cWhat makes you all believe she\u2019s\u2026 a part of you?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cWe have no central doctrine, but disciples of Cresselia can derive great meaning from dreams,\u201d</b></span> she tilts her head. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cIn every\u2026 <i>case</i> like mine, the spirit of the disciple\u2019s prey has been able to communicate with them through visions and symbols in these dreams.\u201d</b></span> She finally looks up at you again, her eyes steely. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cSo, yes. I see Sister Noviella in my dreams whenever I need guidance, and I can feel the warmth of her soul within me, whenever I meditate.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a moment to digest all that information as the two of you walk together. Feeling sorry for her, you insisted on helping the persian with some of her duties; which she seemed uncomfortable with, but was much too polite to say anything. The two of you cleaned up around the monastery for the next hour while the other \u2018sisters\u2019 settled in to rest for the night. The process was deathly silent, especially whenever she settled down to pray in front of the strange statues dotting the building. She seemed to be the exactly opposite of the ninetales; courteous, well-mannered and restrained, with a calm and subdued personality. Still, you respected her just as much for some reason. Perhaps the two could balance each other out? <b>\u201cSo\u2026 what are you, like, praying for?\u201d</b> You break the silence, curious after she\u2019s stopped to pray to a statue for the 3rd time in an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cOh? Nothing. In her infinite kindness, Cresselia has offered me enough of her blessings for one lifetime. I can get by,\u201d</b></span> she turns to you.<span class=\"corange\"><b> \u201cI was simply expressing my gratitude.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201c... you sure do express your gratitude a lot.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cWe all have much to be thankful for,\u201d</b></span> she nods, sagely. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cNot just Cresselia, but many Pokemon have given us their blessings. Groudon gives us the ground we walk on; Rayquaza gives us the air we breathe. Zekrom gives us peace of body; Cresselia gives us peace of mind.\u201d</b></span> The persian looks at the ground, sadly. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cThose like me, who come to worship Cresselia in particular\u2026 need peace of mind in their lives, above all else.\u201d</b></span> With that, she continued walking, and you hurried after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWell, who do you think I would worship?\u201d</b> You ask. <b>\u201cIf I ever get into that sort of thing.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives you a weird look. In retrospect, it was a weird question. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cErr\u2026 I suppose that depends on what you value in life.\u201d</b></span> She explained. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cTruth? Knowledge? Victory? Music?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cOooh, I like music!\u201d</b> You smile, densely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cOh, uh\u2026 then, you\u2019d like Meloetta, perhaps,\u201d</b></span> she shrugs. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cBut ultimately, it\u2019s a question I cannot answer. Deciding what sort of cause you want to dedicate your life to\u2026 that requires years of introspection and study.\u201d</b></span> She gestures to a map on a nearby wall; seemingly just a regular map of the region, with various symbols scrawled all over it with paint. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cThere are plenty of monasteries across the region you can learn from. Each celebrate a different aspect of life.\u201d</b></span> She explained while you curiously look over the map. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cBut I would advise you stay away from followers of, say, giratina or necrozma. They can be a\u2026 negative influence.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stare up at the strange map, you find yourself yawning unintentionally. You wanted to stay up and learn more from the persian, but\u2026 you\u2019d had a long, active day today. <b>\u201cVery interesting\u2026\u201d</b> You say, turning to her. <b>\u201cWell, I\u2019m gonna call it a day, I think. Thank you for showing me around, really!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cThank you for accompanying me,\u201d</b></span> she smiles through her veil as you trot away. By the time you make it back to the room, stumbling lazily inside, your body was giving up on you. You desperately wanted to get some sleep, but\u2026 you were still pretty sweaty after all that exercise today. The bed was pretty cramped, and you didn\u2019t want to gross the ninetales out. Maybe a nice warm, shower would help you relax\u2026</span></div></div>",

She seemed to be blind, or at least wore a blindfold for some reason, so you didn\u2019t have to worry about being seen; all you had to do was stay quiet and downwind. When dealing with a lesser hunter, this strategy probably would\u2019ve worked; but against the ninetales, everything you tried seemed futile. She sprinted all through the forest in incredible silence, making her difficult to keep track of, combing every inch so that you had to constantly reposition yourself to avoid her getting too close. You were putting more effort in this than, perhaps, anything you\u2019ve ever done in your life, and yet you still couldn\u2019t last more than a minute before the massive vixen pounced suddenly on you from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cGotchya!\u201d</b></span> You let out a squeal of surprise, the air being knocked from your lungs as she pins you against the ground with all her weight \u2014 and keep in mind, with all the Pokemon she\u2019s gurgled away, she\u2019s definitely on the heavy side. She giggled as she loomed over you, looking a little worn-out from the constant sprinting. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cWoo! Nice hustle there, for a first-timer. You almost gave me a run for my money\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew she said she was planning on eating you, but the fact that she hasn\u2019t already gulped you down was giving you some hope. Not like you\u2019d mind too much if she did. <b>\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re not going to\u2026?\u201d</b> You ask, only to shudder when the vixen suddenly runs her long tongue up your face, wetting your snout with her saliva. <b>\u201cOoh...\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cOhoho, you\u2019re not getting off that easy. After all, what kind of teacher would I be if I didn\u2019t give you the full experience?\u201d</b></span> She cackled, and you shiver, halfway in excitement and halfway out of nervousness, as she slips open her jaws and gives you a close-up view down her wide, cavernous throat, drool splattering over your face and her meaty breath filling your nostrils. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cTake a deep breath, runt\u2026\u201d</b></span> You clench your eyes shut and inhale as much fresh air as you can, bracing yourself for the inevitable. She pins you down there for a while, teasing you and slowly building up the suspense, before her jaws suddenly clapped shut around your head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes shot open, only to see nothing but darkness. You were overwhelmed with the familiar sensation of the vixen\u2019s soft, drooling wet maw stretching widely around your head, her tongue tickling your neck as she savored your flavor. Already, you feel the strong muscles lining her throat squeezing down around the end of your snout, pulling you deeper and deeper towards the sweltering sauna within her belly. The way her maw and throat seemed to stretch so readily to contain you made her seem so powerful, like you were fully at the mercy of her gorgeous body. The way she pinned you down completely, to the point that you couldn\u2019t hope to fight back even if you wanted to, excited you somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, you didn\u2019t shy away from her touch. Quite the opposite, actually. Your heart felt like it was beating out of your chest as you leaned forward, letting your slip deeper and deeper into the tight confines of her throat. You wanted to feel her body wrap all around you again; to experience that incredible level of trust and intimacy with the vixen. She was being playful, but somehow you could just tell that she had no intention of harming you. You started to realize how gentle she was with you, shifting you around with minute movements to make your journey into her body as comfortable as possible. You think of all the Pokemon who\u2019ve been gurgled away in that gut of hers, adding to her toned frame or firm hindquarters. What an incredible honor it was to be tucked away in that belly and live to tell the tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were halfway down her throat, you started to wriggle around, trying to help her throat wedge you deeper and deeper. You grew a little nervous when you noticed your manhood was slowly sliding from its sheath amid all the excitement, but the ninetales doesn\u2019t seem to mind in the slightest. You gasped as her tongue was pressed up against your furry balls while she was straining to wrap her lips around your pudgy thighs. You didn\u2019t get much of a chance to savor it, though, as the vixen was focused on forcing you down her throat as fast as she could, a few more swallows sending you down until only your hind legs and tail remained. She leaned her head back, and with gravity alone, your hind legs slowly but surely slid down into her throat, until your entire body was surrounded by the incredible warmth and softness of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you finally slid back into that familiar, roomy sac within her belly. The vixen breathed a sigh of relief as the blockage in her throat was finally cleared, and her \u2018meal\u2019 finally settled in her stomach. She gasped and whimpered quietly, getting used to the feeling of you moving around inside of her, getting comfortable. You smiled as you felt her rub her paws over her gut, invigorated by the feeling of the sensitive, distended flesh.  <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cMm\u2026 you really love it in there, don\u2019t ya? If I didn\u2019t know any better, I might assume you got caught on purpose\u2026\u201d</b></span> She chuckled. The thick walls of her stomach muffled most sounds completely, but somehow, her velvety voice was as clear as can be. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cNot like I\u2019d mind. I appreciate having a good snack for the road.\u201d</b></span> After a while, once you\u2019re fully settled in, she stands up and starts walking again, hoping to make at least some progress towards Shipton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed in contentment as you snuggled against the soft walls of her stomach. Her belly swung to and fro beneath her as she walked, slowly swaddling you to sleep. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cHey! Don\u2019t think you can just relax in there. This is supposed to be a punishment, you know,\u201d</b></span> she laughed, batting at her belly with a paw to wake you up. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cI want to feel you squirming! And you better do a good job \u2014 if you don\u2019t want to be ass fat, that is.\u201d</b></span> You couldn\u2019t tell if she was joking about that or not, but either way, you were glad to wriggle all around and give the vixen a nice belly rub from the inside. She groans in amusement as your kicks and stretches made sizeable bulges in her swaying belly as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d let you out long before the stomach acids began to kick in. For now, all you have to do is relax and enjoy the ride...</span></div></div>",

You dreamt of being chewed up in the mouth of some giant beast. You dreamt that the ninetales had attacked you when you first met, and the sky went black with ash. You dreamt all sorts of terrible things; your addled mind\u2019s only way of interpreting the pain you were being subjected to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually regained your consciousness, though only just barely. Your body was completely numb by this point. You looked down, noticing that the tiny puddle of acid had no risen up to your chest, and your body was about halfway gone. You couldn\u2019t remember your name, or your past, or your parents. You could only remember the ninetales. Last night. The reason you came here. The outside world all faded away, as you were struck with a single thought; <i>guess the ninetales was lying after all!</i> That thought was supposed to be horrifying, but really, you just found it funny at this point. Looks like she pulled a fast one on ya. No point in crying about it now. She won fair and square -- might as well let her enjoy her victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to curl up, but it seemed you didn\u2019t have enough ligaments left to actually move anymore, so all you were capable of was calmly considering your fate. This had its upsides. Out there, you couldn\u2019t be sure of anything. You didn\u2019t know whether you would find your parents, or how things would go even if you did. You didn\u2019t know what kind of Pokemon you would meet, and if they would stick around or abandon. You didn\u2019t know what your goal was in life. But in here, everything was certain. Everything was guaranteed. Her stomach will churn you down. Your body will become part of hers. She\u2019ll become bigger, stronger, more beautiful with your help. All the while, her heart will beat that same exact <i>thump thump\u2026 thump thump... thump thump\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ll be helping that heart keep beating. You were... fine with that. Everybody always looked for meaning in life, and it seemed like that was yours. The powerful enzymes were specifically designed to strip your nutrients away; not just to nourish the vixen\u2019s body, but to add to it. Everything that had once given you life would be made into an extra layer of pudge on her already voluptuous form. You would become part of something truly beautiful. A part of her body would become a monument to your life. This was your destiny. It always had been, same as hearts were destined to beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you faded away, her heart rung softer and softer in your ears...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">thump thump\u2026</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nthump thump\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">thump thump...</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">thump thump...</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">thump thump...</font></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2504\u2504\u2504</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">She emerged from her hut early the next morning, stumbling wearily down the dirt roads through the village. Nobody was wandering the streets then, which was probably a good thing; otherwise, someone might've noticed that a ninetails and an absol walked into that hut, and only a significantly curvier ninetails walked out. While she couldn\u2019t see it herself, she could <i>feel</i> the weight that once was the absol. She could <i>feel</i> the extra softness of her ass as she sat down, she could <i>feel</i> how thick her thighs were when she tried to fit through the front door, she could <i>feel</i> how rounded her belly was as it swung to and fro below her. Most of her body was still as muscular and toned as ever, but her ass and thighs were probably twice their original proportions, and she could feel all the extra pudge shifting and wriggling as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d never know for certain if that absol had actually been one of Marden\u2019s spies, but she could never be too careful; and besides, he definitely made a great travel snack. Her little meal was definitely going to tide her over on her way to Shipton; hell, it was probably going to be weeks before she was hungry for anything more than a light snack. When she made it to the big city, she made a mental note to check out the local tavern before she got down to business. Before she ended up working this weight off, she wanted to at least bury someone\u2019s face in this monstrous new ass of her\u2019s for a little while. <b>\u201cSpy or not, runt,\u201d</b> she smirks, teasing her own pudge as if the absol that composed it could somehow still hear, <b>\u201cyou really did a number on me.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe definitely didn\u2019t expect him to be this fattening. He was almost her height, sure, but he seemed quite scrawny at first glance. Maybe her metabolism was failing her in her age. She chuckled morbidly at the thought. If her metabolism craps out on her now, with the rate she\u2019s gulping down these Marden goons, she can\u2019t even imagine how pudgy she\u2019ll be in a few month\u2019s time. Maybe she should just accept that life. After all, it\u2019s not like there was any chance she was going to stop swallowing up these tasty, squirmy snacks whenever they foolishly give her the chance. Indeed, her body was a walking, wriggling obituary for every single person who ever crossed her; <i>and</i> a warning to the others. She liked to keep it that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eventually had to pause her musings. She had reached the edge of town, and the wilderness awaited her. It was time to concentrate on survival. Plenty of predators would just love to get their hands on a meaty treat like her\u2026 but she was ready to turn the tables on them. With a sly smile, she finally left the village, disappearing into the early morning fog, the impossibly plump rear swaying behind her being the only evidence of what she\u2019d done there...</span></span></div></div>",

You should know better than to let someone talk you into being eaten.\u201d</span></b> Her sudden shift in tone makes you realize how <i>screwed</i> you are. You start trying to push her off you, but your paws meekly dent her seriously padded rear. She\u2019s too heavy to lift and her rump is only crushing down on you more! There\u2019s no way you can fight your way out of this -- this vixen can just about crush you with her butt alone! You\u2019re away from her mouth at least, maybe you\u2019ll only be used as her\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Mmngph!</b></i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour snout comes into contact with her tight, pink sphincter, and due to the fox\u2019s sheer weight, you <i>slide in.</i> As embarrassed as it is, that\u2019s as far as she can send you, right? You start getting desperate. Her tailhole is way too tight, there\u2019s no way she could slip you inside her fat rump. But your heart sinks as you hear a half moan, half cackle as her greasy rear continues to slide across your face without any signs of stopping. Her rear entrance soon enough covers your eyes, redirecting your vision from the immense plushness of her yellow cheeks to her pulsating red tubes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"ctan\">\u201cIf you can't keep your wits, you'd be devoured in an instant with where I'm heading. Better you inside me than inside of them... and ha-ah, Absol, there is <i>nothing</i> better than shoving runts like you back there!\u201d</span></b> For the first time, you feel her ass tug on you, pulling your entire face into the depths of her colon. You let loose muffled whines as the Ninetales gradually and methodically shifts your head to allow her anus to swallow your horn, her tailhole grinding on your face in the process. You know by the rapid breaths she takes and speed she\u2019s grinding down on your body, that she is <i>totally</i> getting off to this. <i>M-maybe she\u2019ll let me out when she\u2019s done? This is just her toying with me, right?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a minute, but the brief annoyance the Ninetales feels shlicks inside her bowels all the same. Pesky horns are no match for her impressively stretchy anatomy -- once they\u2019re inside her they\u2019re calories all the same. Most predators would simply break off the Absol\u2019s horn, but she loves the good challenge of slipping it in. To her, there\u2019s something satisfying knowing every single part of her soon-to-be-assed Absol toy will be gurgled up into her own useless pudge. Not to mention, it covers any and all traces of her being here. Having her fun with snackable critters like him is what she lives for, and in the relative safety of the town, she doesn\u2019t need to hold back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her anus clenches up against the your neck, the Ninetales repositions herself to shove your shoulders in next. You feel her lift your body up before sitting back down, letting her weight quickly slide over your widest point and send your entire chest into her stretchy tubes. Being in such a cramped, sweltering area, the part of you furthest inside the Ninetales\u2019 guts is already snaking around to account for the curves of her large intestines and forces you to curl up even tighter as more of your body is sent past her plump, squishy cheeks. You\u2019re only given a brief respite when her fat rump comes in contact with your own pudgy rear. <b><span class=\"ctan\">\u201cFor a runt, you\u2019re not half bad down there.\u201d</span></b> she says, as you feel your cheeks compressing under her superior tush\u2019s weight. <b><span class=\"ctan\">\u201cToo bad that ass of yours is going to be part of mine soon enough!\u201d</span></b> <i>Shlunk!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tanen moons slam into the ground, taking the rest of you in. She hauls her rump skyward, presenting your fidgeting pawtips for all the world to see -- before her tailhole gives one last tug, her red ring swallows your toes and you\u2019re erased from the outside world. <i><b><span class=\"ctan\">Hnnph\u2026</span></b></i></span> You can feel her give one massive, satisfactory sigh of pleasure, only helping to embarrass you further. Tucked in the vixen\u2019s bowels, the tightness of her body crushing you in her guts feels like it can snuff you out at any moment. The only residual hope you have left is maybe this is some trick, some bad dream you\u2019re having\u2026 but with each tug of her guts pulling you deeper, reality sets in. You were <i>shoved inside her ass!</i> That beautiful vixen\u2019s tush\u2026 swallowed you! And as you feel her adjusting her position, seemingly flopping down on top of your ever-prominent bulge, you understand: <i>This Ninetales is going to</i> digest <i>me. But how?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour question is answered soon enough, once your body is sent into her even tighter quarters: her small intestines. The snaking tunnels seal to your body like cling wrap, outlining every detail of your small form with squishy, wet flesh. And the deeper you get, the tighter the tubes seem to feel. When you\u2019re in the centermost of her red tunnels, at the very core of her bowels, do you feel like your body has\u2026 <i>shrunk</i>. You can\u2019t discern if it\u2019s simply loss of circulation or not, but it feels as if parts of you were simply soaked up by the fox\u2019s powerful anatomy. The overwhelming numbness gradually spreads over increasing portions of your body, especially numbing your fatty regions. A sharp contraction of her guts and the numbness spreads. This goes on for what feels like hours, but it\u2019s hard to tell fading in and out of consciousness -- until it seems, even that is absorbed by the vixen\u2019s body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing on your mind was a picture of her jiggly ass, when you first saw it. How perfectly rotund it was\u2026 and how <i>you</i> are going to be a part of that. Just how things in nature should be: she is your predator, and you are her prey. <i>You are fox food.</i> Even if you\u2019re an <i>ass snack</i>, you\u2019re nourishment nonetheless, inevitable fuel for her impressive curves. Surely enough fuel to help her burn brighter, push her sultry bod to new heights with a near full 40kg of Absolfat, distributed across her body in some shape or another. Or at least you hope, in your increasingly broken state of mind -- being a part of <i>her</i> can\u2019t be so bad, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome early morning, the Ninetales finds herself resting on not a wriggly lump of Absol, but instead a solid pillow of a paunch nestled between her legs. Her belly, long emptied of all the food from last night, feels as if there\u2019s an eevee or three permanently tucked inside it. Unable to see the damage the runt did to her, she has to get <i>physical</i> with her new additions. Digging her front paws into her potbelly, she squishes the plump yellow hill left and right, before giving it a reverberating slap of satisfaction, confirming not a dash of Absol is left inside. Kneading it is easy, the Absol-pudge molds like baking dough, except once pressed in far enough, it quickly rebounds into a naturally spherical shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she tries to stand, her back legs almost immediately fold, flopping her tush onto the nest below and leaving her sitting on a sea of her pudge. She\u2019d never expected her body to be so backheavy. He's almost entirely on her hips and tush -- she can tell thanks to her <i>immense</i> ass being the main counterweight to her sudden movement. With the damage he did to her ass, she can hardly feel the floor! The inches of flab on her tush give her an almost pear shape body, impressive for a quadruped like her! Of course it\u2019s ruined with the perma-pudgebelly in her middle, but it\u2019s nothing she can\u2019t work off in\u2026 a few months. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rocks her hips left and right, soaking in the level of chub he\u2019s put on her thighs and reveling in the sheer size of her Absol-butt molding to her will. While she still has her goal of taking down Marden and his goons, she needed this. A wonderful travel snack and some much needed rest, with the added bonus of taking away a cute Absol boy on her hips and gut as a permanent souvenir. <b><span class=\"ctan\">\u201cYou really did a number on me, runt.\u201d</span></b> She stands up, this time prepared for the wobbling of her thighs, and looks towards her tush, as if he were somehow stuck inside her still. <b><span class=\"ctan\">\u201cYou wanted to travel with me, I hope you don\u2019t mind the <i>accommodations.</i> You were cute before, but now you\u2019re <i>squishy,</i>\u201d</span></b> she clenches her legs, forming a perfect heart-shaped ass with cheeks slapping and bouncing in unison. <b><span class=\"ctan\">\u201cAnd runt, I can work with squishy.\u201d</span></b> She clasps her thighs together and with her jiggling bod, she begins the trek to back to Shipton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven the cover of early dawn, she makes her way out of the hut, luckily finding none of the locals are out and about. It\u2019s a struggle -- she can\u2019t walk too fast, lest risk her mountain of assfat slap together and cause a commotion. The best she can do is use her tails to mask her prize, waiting until the outside forest to show it off proper. The real issue with indulging in ass meals is they have a habit of relocating near the point of entry, resulting in particularly explosive gains on her ass such as these. Her once ample-behind expanded into massive, squishy boulders, and her thighs are equally big to support the huge mounds of foxflab. But as always, satisfaction outweighs the added work of lugging the pudge around. Turning weaklings like him into something <i>successful</i> like herself. He\u2019d never make it in the real world, she reasons with herself. Better a few rolls on her ass than someone else\u2019s. And those that challenge that statement, she\u2019s always done a good job of adding them to her frame too. Engulfed, absorbed, relegated to nothing more than a few layers of assfat on a thick foxy Ninetales, trapped under her skin for eternity\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/U2Gi9Vj.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/U2Gi9Vj.png</a><br>\r\n<b>YOU ARE FOX FAT</b></div></div></div>",

You froze up like a deer in headlights as she came barrelling towards you, bracing for your inevitable death. To your surprise, however, she just\u2026 passed by? You watched the lioness disappeared into the forest once again, not paying you any credence as she passed. Just as relief began to fill you, you heard the stomping of multiple pyroars following after her, kicking up dirt. You watched in awe as an entire pack split around you. They seemed to be hunting, but none of them have taken any interest in you -- not yet, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cAbsol! Three o\u2019clock! On him!\u201d</b></span> The apparent leader of the hunt shouted, as she, too, just passed you by. Their huge paws threw up dirt as the pack stampeded around you, awing you with their speed and size. Even the smallest of the Pyroars seemed to be almost twice your height, each sporting a big, round, smooth belly which jostled and swung beneath them as they ran. At first, you assumed they were all just pregnant\u2026 until you realized every single one of these lionesses had whole Pokemon in their stomachs! All in varying stages of digestion, too; some of their bellies were smaller and still, their prey longed passed, but others\u2019 bellies were still big and bulging visibly as the Pokemon inside struggled futilely against the onslaught of acid. Either way, it didn\u2019t seem to slow them down a bit. Before you even had time to process what you were seeing, one of the pyroars was upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, you were given a mouthful of dirt as the pyroar at the back of the pack pounced on you, her huge paw pressing your face into the ground. <span class=\"cred\"><b>\u201cGot ya!\u201d</b></span> She laughed cruelly. The other lionesses left her behind, as they continued sprinting through the wilderness, relentless in their hunt for prey. She could easily handle you all on her own, after all; there was nothing you could do to resist as she picked you up by the scruff of your neck, before sprinting back the way she came. You winced and shivered in pain as the lioness\u2019s teeth dug at the soft skin at the back of your neck, forcing you to go limp or risk accidentally breaking your own neck. She certainly knew what she was doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t spare you any comfort on the \u2018ride\u2019, didn\u2019t offer you a moment\u2019s consideration. She didn\u2019t even bother to tease you. She seemed to act with almost mechanical efficiency, as if she\u2019s done this hundreds of times before. She ducked and weaved through the forest with incredible ease, carrying you at speeds you\u2019ve never experienced before. It would almost be pleasant, if you weren\u2019t busy considering your inevitable fate. This lioness was one of the ones with a big, full stomach, paw prints making bulges in her furry belly as Arceus-knows what squirms around inside. Was that going to be your fate?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t seem to have any choice in the matter, now. Before you knew it, the pyroar had returned to the place that seemed to be her home. Adobe huts and strange tarp structures were scattered around a grassy valley; six huts in total, actually, presumably one for each of the lionesses. You hoped she'd let you go right here, but instead, she wandered over to the entrance to a dark, cramped little cave in an alcove a nearby rocky cliff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cH-hey\u2026 let\u2019s be reasonable about this, now,\u201d</b> you whimper as you were plunged into darkness, hearing only the sound of the pyroar\u2019s paws stomping against the cave floor as she walked you deeper into that abyss. <b>\u201cI-if you just let me go, I\u2019ll do whatever you want. I swear. No need to-\u201d</b> Before you could finish your sentence, you were suddenly bathed in light once again. They had set up some sort of prison at the end of the cavern! The chamber was all lit by torches, and filled with large, rusty cages that looked like they had been built by humans long ago. \u201cWhoa.\u201d You said, glancing around the huge, subterranean room. There were about half a dozen Pokemon in various cages already, most curled up, looking weak and miserable. Content, the lioness starts trotting over to one of the empty cages. <b>\u201cHey! No, no, no! Don\u2019t put me in-\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, you were interrupted, as the lioness swung you by the neck and tossed you, headfirst, into the cold iron kennel. She turned around, kicking it shut with one of her hind legs, the door\u2019s hatch sliding locked automatically. You immediately pressed yourself against the bars, trying to break free. No use -- you were trapped. <span class=\"cred\"><b>\u201cSee you later, runt!\u201d</b></span> She padded happily away, her sylphlike body beautifully illuminated by the fires for a few moments, before your captor finally disappeared into the darkness once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trotted around your cage, nervous and dejected, wondering exactly what they had planned for you, here. None of the Pokemon in the other cells seemed to want to talk to you, either, simply ignoring your pleas for answers. Over the next few hours, other lionesses stepped into the chamber intermittently, holding other squirming Pokemon in their maws and locking them up in cages. The freshly-arrived prisoners seemed just as distressed and confused as you were, and unfortunately, you could offer them no answers. After about five hours total, all six lionesses had brought in a Pokemon, ending the day with about a dozen prisoners total. This seemed to be the point that they decided their work was done, and every single one of them crowded into the chamber, celebrating another successful hunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the pyroars stepped forth to address the prisoners. She was a shiny, it seemed, with beautiful golden, silk-like fur along her perfect boy. From the way the others revered her, she seemed to be the de facto leader of the band. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re wondering why you\u2019re here,\u201d</b></span> she said, strutting around the cages, taunting the Pokemon within. You couldn\u2019t help stare at her pudgy rear as she passed you by, imagining the hundreds of Pokemon who must\u2019ve been sacrificed to build her toned, voluptuous body. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cWell, your initial suspicions were probably correct. For the next few days, you will all serve us\u2026 eventually, as our food.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cMy apologies for the confusion. You see, over the years, we\u2019ve fine-tuned the art of the hunt to the point that we\u2019ve amassed quite a backlog,\u201d</b></span> she leaned back, showing off her furry, bulging belly. You shuddered as you saw the desperate face of the Pokemon within bulging against her skin for a moment. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cHave no fear. You, too, will eventually get to become a part of one of us\u2026 but you\u2019ll have to wait your turn.\u201d</b></span> The rest of the lionesses were similar alluring. Under the light of the torches, you got a better look at them. They definitely weren\u2019t fat, but considering their diet, they were a lot more \u2018curvy\u2019 than they otherwise would be, considering their impressive and constant athleticism. You\u2019d consider them quite attractive, to be honest, if it wasn\u2019t for their round, swinging bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other freshly-captured prisoners cried out or shivered as she made her announcements. She offered them no solace, continuing to taunt them through their tears. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cMost of you will have a few days before the\u2026 time comes,\u201d</b></span> she said, trotting around in circles throughout the chamber. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cHopefully, you will have made peace with your fate by then.\u201d</b></span> She turned to face a particularly defiant-looking leafeon locked in one of the other cages. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cIn the meantime, know that if you disobey us, there will be\u2026 consequences,\u201d</b></span> she threatened him, before turning to you. Your heart skips a beat as you stare into her beautiful golden eyes. She smiles at your enthusiasm. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cBut if you <i>please</i> us, we will make your stay as comfortable as we can.\u201d</b></span> She walked back towards the entrance, nodding to the other lionesses as she slipped into the darkness. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cAlright, girls. Do as you will.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the pyroars stepped forward eagerly, ready to \u2018meet\u2019 the new prisoner.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The five remaining pyroars wandered around, eager to size up the newly-captured prisoners. You had been placed in a cage near the back, so none of them reached you for a while, giving you a chance to watch their interactives and get a feel for what kind of Pokemon they are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately notice that the one they call <span class=\"corange\"><b>Shandra</b></span> had taken an interest in you. She seemed to be the most bubbly member of their little \u2018pack\u2019, jumping with excitement as she looked over some of the new prisoners. She seemed to try and cheer the prisoners up, but this was a futile effort, as she didn\u2019t seem to understand why they were so sad in the first place. Surely they\u2019d want to be gobbled up by such a big, beautiful predator, right? The poor girl didn\u2019t seem to even realize why all the prisoners were so afraid of her. Anyway, of all the pyroars, Shandra seemed to be by far the plumpest, with the biggest belly and the widest hips. She was even a little pudgy around the face, too, making the overgrown cat seem just that little bit cuter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, there was the lioness that first captured you, <span class=\"cred\"><b>Noelia</b></span>, with the beautiful streaks of scarlet in her mane. She was perhaps the most curvaceous of the pack, indicating a wealth of previous \u2018meals\u2019, and seemed to delight in teasing and taunting the prisoners. Besides her curves, she was also surprisingly the most muscular of the group, with her mane cut short for a slightly more masculine appearance. Whatever empathy she had for her prey has been worn down by experience. You notice her occasionally shake her belly violently whenever the Pokemon inside squirms around too much, and doesn\u2019t seem to hold them with any higher regard than simple food. She seemed to target the most vulnerable and terrified prisoners, and while she didn\u2019t harm them yet, her taunts were downright sadistic. She liked to warn that whichever Pokemon ended up in her belly was in for a world of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clkhaki\"><b>Nova</b></span> seemed to be the most sensual of the bunch. She seemed to enjoy teasing the prisoners just as much as Noelia did, but instead of threatening them, she liked to see if she could get a rise out of the male captives. Despite the horror of their grim situation, most of them couldn\u2019t help but be mesmerized by her perfect ass for at least a moment, eliciting a giggle from the lioness before she moved on. She seemed to be enjoying the struggles of the Pokemon in her belly a little too much, even though they had mostly quieted down in there by this point. You didn\u2019t even want to imagine how she acted when she first gulped them down, and felt them wriggle inside of her with all their energy. She looked like she cared for her appearance the most out of the bunch, and her fur and mane were utterly pristine, her body sylphlike but still voluptuous. She winked at you when she noticed you staring, forcing you to immediately turn away, your face flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one with the most faded fur was apparently known as <span class=\"cbrown\"><b>Felecia</b></span>, who looked to be the eldest pyroar in the group.. Of them all, she seemed the most sympathetic to the prisoners\u2019 plights, but considered this the \u2018natural way\u2019 of things. She immediately took one of the prisoners -- a buneary who had been crying in fear -- and curled up around her, humming little tuns and cracking jokes to calm the buneary down in an almost motherly fashion. She had quite a way with words, able to easily convince the buneary that their inevitable trip into her belly would be a good thing. You were impressed by easily she got them to calm down; soon, they were simply giggling happily, as the lioness playfully licked over their forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"crose\"><b>Salena</b></span> hung near the back, watching the door, making sure none of the captives was able to break free. It was all business for her. Judging from her scars, she\u2019s been through a lot in her life, and thus didn\u2019t have much enthusiasm for such silly things as toying with their captives. The Pokemon in her belly was small, and moved rarely, and Salena acted as if it wasn\u2019t even there. She wasn\u2019t the curviest of the group, nor was she the most muscular, yet you still got the feeling that she would be the one you would answer to if you dared anger the pride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEavesdropping on their conversations, you deduced the shiny pyroar who taunted all the prisoners just a few minutes earlier was named <span class=\"ctan\"><b>Katia</b></span>. They seemed to refer to her with an almost fanatical respect, and apparently think it\u2019s an honor for the \u2018lucky\u2019 prisoner who gets chosen to be devoured by her. She was apparently the leader of this little \u2018sisterhood\u2019, as they called themselves, and the other pyroars clung to her every word with blind devotion. You weren\u2019t sure if this was because she was a particularly competent leader, or if it was just because she\u2019s a shiny, and shinies are supposed to be \u2018blessed by fate\u2019 or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, one of the pyroars finally reached your cage. You cowered nervously as she loomed over you with a smile on your face. Which of the lionesses had taken an interest in you?</span></div></div>",

I just made sure to come over and nab your before Shandra gobbles you down.\u201d</span></b> The lioness lurches forward and opens her mouth wide, almost wide enough to swallow your head right then and there! You get light headed staring at her pearly white fangs that are barely hidden by her thick, slavering tongue. Her breath is overpowering, raunchy and sweet like pheromones but with a subtle deadliness mixed in, likely the remains of whatever\u2019s boiling away in her squishy middle. Her maw <b>clacks</b> shut in an instant, letting you realize you began leaning <i>towards</i> her gaping maw while you were following the scent trail down her wet throat. <b><span class=\"clkhaki\">\u201cOh my, you\u2019re an eager one. Sadly, I\u2019ve got to finish the Mightyena boy I had earlier.

How about I show you how <i>good</i> it is, hm?\u201d</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a constant coolness to her movements, the gorgeous Pyroar swings her body around, letting her rear stop and the momentum swell to her ass cheeks, resulting in a sudden bounce to their bubbly form. She then raises her tail and lies down, pressing her heart-shaped booty against the open doorway to the cage. Now, her ass effectively locks you shut in the kennel. <b><span class=\"clkhaki\">\u201cI bet you\u2019re tired, pent up waiting for us to come home. So how\u2019s this, Absolboy? Two perfect pillows for you to rest your sleepy head in between.

I am well aware of the Zoroark in the area and he\u2019ll be on my hips soon enough.\u201d</span></b> You think to yourself, <i>they\u2019re nearby! Surely father and mother are going to rescue me from here, this is all a ruse - gack!</i> The Pyroar curls her tail around your neck and shoves you snout-first in between her plump buttocks, smothering your vision with tan and brown booty. The way her fat folds around you, the deformation effectively masks your entire face, short of your horn, from the outside world. Her tail then tugs even harder, moving your snout to the bottom of the crevice between her cheeks, landing your face pushed directly against Nova\u2019s anus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"clkhaki\">\u201cInstead, disaster-boy, I think you should forget everything you knew about the outside world and start thinking about <i>my</i> world. You\u2019re blanketed under my superior ass and I hope you know I can take this <i>further</i> if you misbehave.\u201d</span></b> You let out a grunt and Nova squeezes her cheeks around your face, becoming crushingly tight despite the layered flab and it ends up pushing your nose <i>in</i> her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"clkhaki\">\u201cIn case you weren\u2019t aware, predators like us stretch fantastically well.

She lets loose a bellowing, pleasured purr, raunchily grinding down on your face-turned-buttplug. Instinctively you push your paws into her fat rump, but the sheer squishiness of the buns prevents you from gaining any leverage to push yourself out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear her talking with one of her sisters, except the words are muffled through her insulating padding.

But if he gives you trouble, let me know.\u201d</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Nova moves her rump from between the cage\u2019s doorway, turning and giving you a wink before walking to another kennel. With a hum, <b><span class=\"corange\">Shandra</span></b> takes no time to lean inside the cage and nab your neck scruff, pulling you outside the cage and into the middle of the torchlit cavern. She plops you and herself down, positioning you next to her big, bubble-like belly. Surprisingly, there\u2019s not a bulge to be seen, and it\u2019s incredibly cushy to lean against. She giggles as your smaller form sinks into her belly slightly, <b><span class=\"corange\">\u201dAw, you\u2019re sweet! I know Nova was getting ahead of herself back there and I had to have you.\u201d</span></b> She possessively curls around you, beginning to clean the femjuices off of your face from earlier. The motion ends up pushing you further into her belly and you start to question just what is inside there. <i>Surely that\u2019s not all fat\u2026</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"corange\">Hey, don\u2019t be afraid to snuggle up to it! I know I\u2019m a bit chunkier than the others here, but it\u2019s from all the cuties like you that help me out!\u201d</span></b> Your initial thoughts were right: she\u2019s incredibly enthusiastic about everything that\u2019s going on, and views her body as a squishy temple for prey creatures like yourself to take refuge in. <b><span class=\"corange\">\u201dSee, Absols are always grouchy, but you\u2019ve been proving that wrong and it\u2019s so good to see. Is my belly comfy enough for you, deary?\u201d</span></b> You <i>guess</i> she means from the outside right now, and isn\u2019t her asking about you taking a permanent nap within. You give a timid nod and she returns the favor with a closed-eyed, happy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"corange\">\u201dWonderful! It\u2019s nice to have someone to just snuggle up with! My belly was a nice resting place for a Delcatty I had earlier this day. I think it\u2019s empty now, the kitten did a real number on my gut! All that pudge you get to curl up against must feel so good.\u201d</span></b> She nudges your face deeper against her bellyfat, masking how wide-eyed you are at the confirmation her bloated middle is <i>inches</i> of pure pyroar chub. You\u2019re surprised critters can even make a bulge through the padding! <b><span class=\"corange\">\u201dAw, I saw that face. Did I frighten you? I promise it\u2019s not as bad as you think!\u201d</span></b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo hold such a portly frame, with her impressive bubble gut and voluptuous set of thighs, hundreds of critters must have been in the same situation as yourself. Nuzzled up against her belly as she coaxes you into your fate as her kittyflab. The thought of yourself swallowed down past her maw and sent packing into her padded stomach worms its way into your head. Your entire body, tucked away between her legs, sagging her belly just a little and hardly making a bump through her plush padding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe breaks you away from your daydream by licking across your face, but catching a glimpse of her deep, salivating throat sends you right back. Her stomach will have no issue transforming you into liquid goo and nutrients to be sent further down her body. Your Absol self, sloshing around in her crotch region as her digestive tract absorbs your body for the mere purpose of putting even more fat on this cat\u2019s hips.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe situation you\u2019re in starts to wear on you. As \u2018reassuring\u2019 as she is, she is still planning on <i>eating</i> you eventually.

I jus-\u201d</span></b> is all you can stutter out before Noelia grabs your tail with her mouth and drags you back into the cave, deliberately dropping you off in the center. <b><span class=\"clkhaki\">Nova</span></b> is there waiting for you, antsily licking her chops with a big grin plastered across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cred\">\u201dShandra, if you don\u2019t mind, we\u2019ll take care of this one.\u201d</span></b> Noelia says after dropping your tail out of her maw. Shandra gives an affirming nod and begins looking over the dumbfound prisoners. Noelia turns and addresses the crowd, <b><span class=\"cred\">\u201dAs our leader mentioned, you morsels usually have a few days time. But when you do something stupid,\u201d</span></b> she presses her paw well into your back, causing you to squeak, <b><span class=\"cred\">\u201dwe\u2019re more than happy to make examples out of you. Nova, are you ready?\u201d</span></b><br>\r\n <br>\r\nLike clockwork, the other, sultrier pyroar takes her place in front of you, with Noelia positioned behind where your back paws are. <b><span class=\"clkhaki\">\u201dOh honey, that was a mistake. Shandra isn\u2019t going to protect you now. Noely and I have plenty of room inside our guts to\u2026 take care of trouble makers like you.\u201d</span></b> Nova\u2019s huge, looming rump slowly sits back upon your face, very similar to what you experienced before. She\u2019s seemingly cleaned herself up back there from previously, maybe she had some unfortunate critter lick her clean after you sent her over the edge. While you\u2019re familiar with these tan cheeks descending on your face, you feel a very concerning, new warmth at your footpaws, one that is rapidly eclipsing your ankles and more. <i>Oh, no\u2026 that\u2019s Noelia.</i> Out of the corner of your eye you can make out that it\u2019s not her mouth swallowing you up, no, it\u2019s her own, plump rump engulfing up to your thighs now. Before you can inspect further, Nova does her best to keep up and <i>shoves</i> your face within her cheeks\u2019 crevice and pushes your snout up against her anus once again: this time mercilessly shlucking it deeper. Your vision is soon enough consumed with her pulsing red passageway that is Nova\u2019s bowels, slowly welcoming you further inside as she makes progress across your head. You feel her reach a brief blockage, surely your horn, but it isn\u2019t long until you hear her <i>mrrrowl</i> up top and stretch her puckered star across your appendage, then clenching her stretchy flesh together to swallow up your neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your other end, like a machine, Noelia impassionately continues sliding your thighs and inevitably rump within her own ass. Your white Absol cheeks cause a brief blockade, but the Pyroar\u2019s clearly superior booty is able to continue pushing you inside with ease. Compared to Nova, Noelia\u2019s insides feel much tighter, but it also feels like she\u2019s trying to simply get as much as possible of you in her while Nova is enjoying the moment. You can even feel her stroking the bulge you\u2019ve formed in her crotch region under her skin. Before Nova\u2019s embrace suffocates any noises besides her body\u2019s natural functions, you hear the duo grunting and moaning as they \u2018ass\u2019 more and more of you. Two big kitty butts begin eclipsing your white middle, your body becoming the \u2018rope\u2019 in their anal tug-of-war. Their cheeks mold and squish together as their butts consume you in entirety, sealing you from any outsider\u2019s view with two thirds of their Absol-toy stuffed inside their respective bowels and the remaining portion rests hotly insulated by their booties. There\u2019s a brief moment where they relax, before you can feel Noelia tug on your again, trying to drag you from Nova\u2019s ass, before Nova responds by grinding down on your face and trying to get off by you being her anal plug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to realize, if you want <i>any</i> chance of surviving this, you need Nova to take you in. Maybe you could\u2026 get her off by struggling, show you\u2019re worth keeping around. <i>Something</i>, just try something to escape. Because you know for a fact Noelia will <i>eagerly</i> churn and reduce you to pudge on her rump. There\u2019s not a chance of getting out of her once you\u2019re in, while Nova gives you the faintest hope she\u2019ll give you the mercy of being her full-time boy toy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile outside, the pair of fat lionesses pound their asses together and their grips become tighter.

Instead of providing the necessary grip to let Nova re-insert your snout into her yawning tailhole, her efforts instead help Noelia\u2019s star swallow up the Absol buttfodder past his shoulders!

Her bowels are adjusting to the curves of your body, making the necessary room to house your entire Absol self.

Then your legs. Like a snake slipping over its prey, your body is gradually fed deeper into Noelia's small intestines, where her bowels engulf you so tightly you can barely even wiggle your toes. The further you get, the more strenuous it becomes for your predator to shove your deeper, and her paws begin pushing against your horn-bulge to shove the rest of you in. Her colon easily stretched and stored you within, but her smaller passageway seems to struggle. It seems like she's used to only liquified Pokemon in there, while her colon easily stored the bones of entire Pokemon within -- just how yours will be in there soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo doubt, your fear was right: you were going to be just a swinging bulge between her legs before long, already are in fact. And after means just another flabby layer on her perfect ass. At this point, the sphincter has swallowed up your horn, and worse yet, her paws outside are doing their best to push you further. You take a few last gasps of breath before her tubing locks your jaws shut, and encapsulates you fully. You\u2019re several feet deep within the lioness\u2019 ass now, there's no escape. You try to wiggle, but the sweltering clamp of her constricting bowels is too much for you: all you can do is make peace with becoming a slab of kitty ass fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngry slaps break you away from the thought, vaguely you hear Noelia, <b><span class=\"cred\">\u201dSheesh, at least squirm in there! You're not even going down with a fight!\u201d</span></b> She tries kneading you to get a reaction, at best you whimper and make a few shifting bulges on the outside -- worthless by her standards. She wanted a fighter, and worse still, her body seems used to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoelia, giving up on getting entertainment out of you, looks up to the crowd of cages, <b><span class=\"cred\">\u201dWhat a joke, even my guts are tougher than he is. You prey want to know why you shouldn't try and escape? We\u2019ll do this to you.\u201d</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Gwrrrbllllll\u2026</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoelia's brown belly begins tightening around your form, near vacuum sealing an outline around you. Her guts try sucking you further towards her stomach -- but as that fails, her bowels become even tighter. Tighter than what should be possible. And your limbs become numb. The numbness seems to expand all across your body until in certain areas, along with systematic pulses from her intestines, it seems to just <i>disappear.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoelia for the first time this night lets loose a purr as her bulging, Absol-stuffed belly transitions from lumpy into soft and malleable. Her bowels bloat with his soft tissue as her guts begin absorbing him directly, the cause of his rapid deformation. He becomes dead weight within her middle, a soft, rolling hill jutting out from her sitting position. Kneading it is like a sponge, except wherever she pushed results in her belly shrinking just a bit more. Wherever she touches allows her villi inside to get a better grasp of the sludge the Absol has become, which quickly absorbs all the nutrients it can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight in front of the crowd\u2019s eyes, the Absol is not just swallowed up by Noelia\u2019s ass and digested by the Pyroar\u2019s bowels, but is quickly reforming as bubbly brown fat on the lioness\u2019 sitting rear. Once half the Absol was gone, it was apparent her ass is not just swelling in size, but pushing outwards, becoming increasingly visible from the front. The Pyroar in turn becomes taller thanks to her seated padding, and she starts shifting back and forth, trying out her gorgeous flab. By the time the Absol is barely a noticeable bump on her, she finally stands up and shows off her gains: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo. Massive. Moons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Noelia is shocked at the amount of chub you had become. Rocking her hips causes her mammoth buttcheeks to cascade into one another. Her thighs are equally infused with your body, squishing like puddy into each other as she flaunts her giant ass around. Her jello-y cheeks easily contain more than half of the Absol\u2019s body, and her thighs and belly jiggle and sway with the rest. With her disaster-cat infused ass, she's worried she\u2019ll lag behind her pride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cred\">\u201dAt least this runt knows how to leave a mark. It's like I ate an Arcanine!\u201d</span></b> Noelia\u2019s tail cutely slaps against her tush, the indent causes a rolling wave of fat on impact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cred\">\u201dAnd he\u2019s all gone. Not a trace of him left, besides my ass. Even his horn didn't survive.\u201d</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cviolet\">\u201dNoelia, if you're up for it\u2026\u201d</span></b> Salena, seemingly absent towards the end of the \u2018show\u2019, comes back with Felecia, two prey in tow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cviolet\">\u201dAre you up for round 2?\u201d</span></b> </div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Every day of your life, you thank your lucky stars you weren\u2019t born a snake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously, imagine having to constantly wriggle every single inch of your body just to move around. Plus, without any limbs to speak of, the simplest of tasks could prove to be monumental struggle. You used to think snakes were cool, of course\u2026 until you met your partner, Zona. Now you just felt sympathy for them. All that slithering around seemed absolutely exhausting for her\u2026 especially when she had a huge, misshapen lump in her belly. <span class=\"clgreen\"><b>\u201cPhew\u2026 could we, uh, take another break for a second? I\u2019m gonna need a breather\u2026\u201d</b></span> The serperior panted, weighed down by the contents of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cUgh. Fine\u2026\u201d</b></span> You groaned, and Zona immediately stopped dead in her tracks, curling up and catching her breath. With a sat, you sat down on a nearby boulder, deciding to use your free time to unfurl your map and review your route. What was supposed to be a quick trek back to town had dragged on far longer than you anticipated, thanks to your partner\u2019s \u2018appetite\u2019. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cI could have helped you drag that Meganium back to town, y\u2019know, if you hadn\u2019t eaten \u2018im.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\"><b>\u201cHe was a dangerous criminal! He needed to be restrained!\u201d</b></span> She protested indignantly, as she nursed the painfully distended bulge in her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cHe was <i>knocked out</i>!\u201d</b></span> You roll your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour name is Flinch, and together with Zona you\u2019ve formed Team Valor, your standard gold rank rescue team. You\u2019re the leader, and definitely the brains of the operation, with the voracious serperior being the brawn. And when you said voracious, you meant it \u2014 being a snake, she can unhinge her jaw on command, and likes to swallow other Pokemon whole whenever she has an excuse. Of course, she\u2019s no killer, always releasing her \u2018prey\u2019 unharmed, sooner or later. Still, her habit can be quite annoying sometimes; especially on the occasions where you\u2019re the one getting swallowed, as opposed to some random bandit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did have some utility, at least. First and foremost, it allows her to conveniently imprison wanted outlaws inside of her body, so you can \u2018escort\u2019 them straight to jail. Take, for example, the unconscious meganium that was currently making a larger-than-usual lump in her belly. He had definitely been a tough bastard; he was a crook and a robber that had terrorized the countryside for years, and when you finally found his hide-out, he had put up quite a fight. He was so big, too, that you had to knock him out just to fit him inside Zola\u2019s belly without it bursting. Even now, the poor serperior was straining to lug his weight around. Still, she seemed to partially enjoy being so full\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she gets her bearings, turning her focus back to the task at hand. <span class=\"clgreen\"><b>\u201cMm\u2026 alright, I\u2019m ready. Let\u2019s get this over with,\u201d</b></span> Zola says, and with that, you\u2019re back to travelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u2504\u2504\u2504</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><b>\u201cThank you two so much! That rapscallion nearly drove us out of business!\u201d </b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment you got back to town, Zola released the half-conscious meganium right in front of the local prison, letting the busy prison workers tie him up and drag the outlaw away. While the two of you were sitting around waiting for the sheriff to give you the bounty\u2019s reward, a cheerful millitank walked up to you, serenading you with gratitude. Apparently, that meganium had stolen from her regularly in the past. <span class=\"chotpink\"><b>\u201cI don\u2019t think I could ever truly repay you. Still, perhaps you\u2019d accept a token of my gratitude\u2026\u201d</b></span> She offers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cNo reward needed, ma\u2019am. We\u2019re just doin\u2019 our jobs,\u201d</b></span> you said, holding up a hand. She seemed to be struggling financially enough as it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><b>\u201cNo, no, no, I insist! Look!\u201d</b></span> The millitank said, digging through her bags. You were just about to turn her down again when she pulled out a big, ancient-looking key. You stopped dead in your tracks, forgetting whatever it was you were about to say. <span class=\"chotpink\"><b>\u201cI found this big key up in the mountains a few years back. I\u2019ve never found a lock big enough for it\u2026 but you probably travel a lot! Maybe you\u2019ll figure it out!\u201d</b></span> You stare at the artifact wide-eyed as she unceremoniously plops it into your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cT-thank you,\u201d</b></span> you stutter, immediately hiding the key in your bag. You gesture to Zona as you walk away, obviously in a rush. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cC\u2019mon, Zona! Let\u2019s go!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\"><b>\u201cBut we haven\u2019t collected the bounty yet,\u201d</b></span> the serperior frowns, though she follows along behind you anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cW-we\u2019ll come back later,\u201d</b></span> you say, clutching the bag tightly against your chest as you hurry back towards your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople wonder occasionally what guild you\u2019re associated with. The answer is, of course, none. There weren\u2019t any exploration guilds left; not after the mystery dungeons all closed up one fateful day, sealing whatever Pokemon who were unlucky enough to be caught inside within them forever. No, no, no\u2026 you were just a freelance team. You were nominally dedicated to law enforcement; y\u2019know, catching bandits, collecting bounties, keeping the peace. But the mystery of those old dungeons still lurked in your mind. Nobody had ever found a way to unlock them again, and eventually, Pokemon just stopped trying. But this key\u2026 reminded you of those dungeons, somehow. Could it be\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\"><b>\u201cAh! I\u2019m almost going to miss that meganium\u2026\u201d</b></span> Zola reminisced as she slithered into your humble home on the outskirts of town. <span class=\"clgreen\"><b>\u201cHope we run into more outlaws like him soon! He was huge!\u201d</b></span> Normally, a remark like that would annoy you\u2026 but your mind was elsewhere at the moment. While Zola gets settled in, you get to work hiding the key as best you can. You needed to research the artifact\u2019s power before you made your next move. While you were stealthily sneaking the artifact beyond a bookshelf, you almost jumped out of your skin when you heard Zola behind you. <span class=\"clgreen\"><b>\u201cHey, what are ya doin\u2019?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cJeez, Zola! Don\u2019t sneak up on me like that,\u201d</b></span> you said, clutching your chest as you turned around, trying to act natural. In response, she only giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\"><b>\u201cTrying to hide something from little ol\u2019 me, huh? Don\u2019t worry; I respect your privacy,\u201d</b></span> she smiled slyly, before changing the subject. <span class=\"clgreen\"><b>\u201cSo, uh\u2026 I\u2019m sorry I took so long out there, actually. It\u2019s really getting late.\u201d</b></span> She glanced sadly out the window, staring into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cNah, it\u2019s fine. I couldn\u2019t have caught him without you, anyway,\u201d</b></span> you sigh, standing and walking up the creaky, wooden stairs. Your whole house was one big, circular room, though you did have a loft tucked away at the top of some stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\"><b>\u201cSo\u2026 want to watch a movie or something?\u201d</b></span> She asked, following you to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cNo, I think I\u2019m going to call it a day,\u201d</b></span> you said, stretching as you hopped onto your bed. You were moderately surprised when the snake followed you all the way to your room. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cOh, uh, sorry, Zola. I\u2019m gonna need some space, tonight.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\"><b>\u201cOh, come on! Can\u2019t we snuggle?\u201d</b></span> She grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared up at her, considering it, before finally shrugging your shoulders. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201c... oh, fine,\u201d</b></span> you said. The instant you nodded, you felt the snake\u2019s coils wrap around you with terrifying speed! <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cMmph!\u201d</b></span> Before you knew it, Zola\u2019s body had wrapped around you like a steel vice, squeezing you gently but firmly between her coils as she curled up on your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\"><b>\u201cHehe!\u201d</b></span> She giggled, leaving only your head free from her coils as she settled in on your bed. <span class=\"clgreen\"><b>\u201cGood night, lil\u2019 cheri berry!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou catch your breath as you get comfortable in her coils. She always squeezed you a little more tightly than you were comfortable with, though the pressure all around your body was always oddly pleasant for some reason. It was better than spending the night in her stomach, at least. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cGood night, Zola,\u201d</b></span> you whispered as the two of you started to drift off to sleep\u2026</span></div></div>",

The life within was so desperate to escape, thrashing hard enough that a few times the bumps made would almost sock Ara in his nose despite the considerable distance between the belly and his face. Sometimes the fighting would slow and he\u2019d hear the exhausted meal plead and beg, sometimes even sob, through the dampening flesh, before the futile flailing would start up again. The situation made the young Audino, a Pokemon whose very nature was to help and aid others, sick to his stomach, but he kept rubbing under the threat of the same fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the sack stopped moving completely, the prey inside drowning in the booming <i>gluts</i> and <i>gurgles</i> of digestion. The solid form of the Pokemon \u2013 Ara wasn\u2019t sure what kind they were. Or what kind they <i>had been</i> \u2013 collapsed under the gentle touch of his fingers, his rubbing helping them break down into a nutritious sludge for the body to absorb and add to itself. His hands began shaking as the stomach continued getting smaller and smaller, shoving more and more of the prey-soup further into her \u2013 his mistress\u2019 \u2013 digestive track. From above, his mistress let out a gigantic, putrid belch, setting free the last chunk of breathable air within her stomach and signaling the passing of her meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAra couldn\u2019t stop the tears forming in his eyes. He had just witnessed the power of a predator\u2019s system, how easily it could destroy and take life to fuel it\u2019s own. How easily it could take <i>his</i> life if it so wanted. He closed his eyes and tried to imagine he was somewhere else, like at home with his family or playing with his friends, but every fantasy he imagined would crumble into dust when the sound of the churning gut reached his ears. He continued rubbing, weeping quietly all the while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mistress was apathetic towards his muted crying. \u201cI do hope you <i>burn</i> this into your mind, slave.\u201d The huge Scolipede said as she rolled over. Her big belly slapped the unprepared Ara and knocked him to the floor as she came to stand over him. The dangling sack pressed onto him, pinning everything beneath his nose under with combined weight of both the predator\u2019s stomach and the sloshing chyme that remained inside. Her head loomed over him, staring down with those piercing orange sclera. \u201c<i>This</i>,\u201d She said, grinding her gut against the trapped Audino. \u201cwill be your fate if you ever disobey or disappoint me. Understand?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes, Mistress Rhiannon.\u201d Ara said, his voice muffled slightly under the hanging, black flesh. He fought down the urge to puke as her scent seeped into his nostrils, a horrid smell that scorched his senses and seared his brain, and waited for his mistress to free him, like a good slave would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhiannon seemed satisfied with his answer, as he felt the weight slowly lift off of him. \u201cGood.\u201d She said and waltzed to the other side of her cave, settling beside a small pool of water as Ara stumbled to his feet. \u201cNow, slave,\u201d She barked as the Audino hurried over to her. \u201cI want you to\u2026\u201d </span></div></div>",

You found yourself walking into a cloud of pungent ethanol, which felt funny.

Now that you weren't struggling with the smell, you began to take in the room around you. The walls were lined with thin, lavender curtains, thin enough for you to see silhouettes of mienshaos, each picking up trays of drinks before coming out from the curtains and approaching the many tables within. The tables were upon a black floor, with silver-y trimmings within it and lavender carpets around the floor. The bar counter you were at itself seemed to be made of mahogany, but looked like a light purple shade. Past the counter, you could see several taps, each attached to their own brew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to those taps, you could see the bartender, a fairly big blaziken. You realized she was about 3x your height! She also had legs as thick as tree trunks, abs toned enough to grind meat, and breasts bigger than your head. You felt yourself blush upon seeing her. Even moreso when you noticed the look she gave you once she turned towards you. She froze up, surprised at seeing you. Suddenly, you felt like you were in trouble. She approached you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, bud,\" she said in a gruff voice. She sounded like she was about to get in a fight. \"Don't you think you're a bit young to be here?\" You realized you were looking exceptionally puny to her. You felt insulted. While stil lhot and bothered, you couldn't just let yourself look lame to her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm not young!\" you angrily declared. \"I-I'm just short...\" WIth that, she shrugged.

You understood that you had to do as she said now, so you simply nodded. \"It's break time. Come, follow me.\" She then began to walk away, forcing you to jump down and follow after her.

She started moaning \"You are better than Charles, if you keep this up I might have to take you home.\" Hiliana joked petting your head for a second but removed it so you can focus on pleasuring her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou admired the softness of the Liepards fur. \"I am a regular here, I always eat an immense amount of food in hopes of becoming more attractive but I inherited my mother's metabolism so I don't gain much weight.

You smiled as you remembered seeing the smile on many Pok\u00e9mons' faces as they marched into your maw before sending themselves down your throat. Even if you didn't eat anyone high on your stench, they could always serve you a purpose. Even now, a few Salandits were out searching for weak Pok\u00e9mon to drag off to you, and one Salandit was still quaking after all of the... attention you gave it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, you felt like you should work in some exercise. You'd get out into the world, and search for some poor Pok\u00e9mon looking for a nice, strong, powerful Pok\u00e9mon to rule over them.

You weren\u2019t some savage that devoured innocent Pokemon by brute force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just gave Pokemon what they <i>wanted</i>. The pheromones you release simply wipe away their fears and inhibitions, letting them focus on what they truly desire. Some end up wanting to worship your unparalleled beauty; some want you to serve them with the grace and skill only you\u2019re capable of; and a surprising amount want to be curled away inside your belly, their entire lives leading to the moment that they became part of your gorgeous form. You can never be sure of what they\u2019ll desire until they\u2019ve been dosed with your pheromones, and the surprise always makes things exciting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf, even after breathing your pheromones, they don\u2019t seem interested in being devoured, you respect their wishes. But the ones that opt to be eaten are in for a treat; as due to the extreme pheromones within your body, while they\u2019re gurgling away inside of you, your prey experiences hours of unparalleled bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub a spindly hand over your flat gut, feeling the perfectly smooth scales. It gurgled loudly, protesting the fact that you haven\u2019t had much to eat this week besides rattatas.

If you can\u2019t, well, you can just chow down on one of the salandits that serve you in your lair.

Someone new. Someone\u2026 cute. Thus, you go to scour the forest below, looking for someone to have some fun with. Most prey Pokemon aren\u2019t as wary of predators during the day, so it was easy to sneak up close enough to someone that, by the time they notice you\u2019re there, they\u2019ve already gotten a good whiff of your pheromones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pass by a few Pokemon that were a little too large or too ugly to make for a fun meal, until eventually coming across...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your attuned ears faintly picked up the familiar sound of a male grunting and gasping somewhere in the distance. That sound immediately drew your attention. Did you just strike gold? Your jagged lips curled up into a sly smirk as your sylphlike body slid silently through the forest, your dark scales camouflaging you beneath the tree canopy as you approached the source of the noise. Eventually, in a hidden-away glade, you spot a handsome grovyle sat leaning up against a tree, his eyes closed as he quietly whimpers and groans in pleasure. You bite your lip in excitement when you lay your eyes on his long, vividly pink shaft, one of his hands sliding easily up and down its impressive length. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently he thought that this glade was a good enough hiding place for him to come blow off some steam. Sure enough, he would\u2019ve evaded the notice of most predators\u2026 but not you. You sneak through the bushes around him, sneaking closer as you prepare to surprise him from behind. Already, he\u2019s picking up some of your pheromones, and his furious stroking is only growing more and more desperate. You giggle in excitement as you watch the grovyle jerk himself off, waiting for him to be just on the edge of climax before stepping out of the bushes beside him. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cYou know, it\u2019s dangerous to be out in these woods all alone\u2026\u201d</span> You smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cAh!\u201d</span> He yells out in surprise, immediately jumping to his feet. He turns to you, wide-eyed, recognizing you on sight. As a predator, you had a fearsome reputation in the forest, and the grovyle knew immediately the danger he might be in. Still, his addled mind can\u2019t decide between fight or flight, and thus, he just ends up freezing in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cHehe! See what I\u2019m talking about? You never know who might sneak up on ya,\u201d</span> you giggle, and the grovyle was taken aback. This isn\u2019t how predators usually acted. You don\u2019t seem to be very hostile, so the grovyle\u2019s embarrassment overcomes his fear, and he blushes deeply as he tries to cover his erection with his hands. You giggle at his futile attempt, his palms barely concealing his long, pink shaft. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cOh, come, now. No need to try being modest at this point. I\u2019ve already seen everything\u2026\u201d</span> You gesture for him to move his hands. Normally he wouldn\u2019t think of exposing himself to you like this, but the pheromones were already significantly clouding his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly, the grovyle slowly pulls his hands away, revealing his manhood in all its glory. He blushed as you licked your lips shamelessly whilst admiring its length. You certainly weren\u2019t disappointed. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cThere you go. My, my. How fortunate I am to chance on such a \u2018gifting\u2019 young man...\u201d</span> His dick was still absolutely throbbing, begging for release after you blue balled him, the anticipation growing worse and worse every passing second. He looked like he could barely keep his hands off it, especially with a gorgeous gal like you standing before him. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cOooh, poor thing. You must be so pent up. I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt.\u201d</span> Your wide hips sway to and fro as you sashay over to a nearby tree stump, giving him momentary glances at your rear as you walked. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cMaybe I could\u2026 give you a hand?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cW-what?\u201d</span> He blushes, his eyes widening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cYou know what I mean. Just thought you looked like you could use some <i>help</i>,\u201d</span> you smirk. When you see the uncertain look on his face, you shrug, turning away as if about to leave. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cBut if you\u2019re not interested, I\u2019ll be on my way...\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cN-no! I\u2026 I\u2026 urgh\u2026\u201d</span> He whimpered, raising a hand. You turn to him, a smug smirk on his face, as if expecting him to finish that sentence. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to beg you for a handjob, but his body language told you all you needed to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, deciding to have mercy on him. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cYou poor, poor thing. Come here\u2026\u201d</span> You lean against the tree stump, sitting down with your legs spread just enough to give him the tiniest glimpses of your sex. You beckon to him with a finger, and with the pheromones slowly dominating his brain, he can\u2019t help but follow your command. Gasping and whimpering in desperation, the grovyle shakily stumbles towards you, his burning shaft bobbing as he walked. Eventually, he collapsed in your arms, his dick poking against your soft belly as you cuddled the smaller male against you. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cHehe! There you go! Just sit back and relax, darling. I\u2019ll take good care of you...\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grovyle\u2019s arms were weakly wrapped around you, his head resting on your shoulder as you reached a hand down between your bodies. He gasps audibly as he feels your hand finally wrap around his manhood, feeling your cold flesh grip his burning hot shaft. You\u2019re still for a few seconds, enjoying the sounds of his desperate whimpering, before you finally start to slide your hand painfully slowly up and down his shaft, his cock already lubricated by his pre. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cSee? Isn\u2019t this so much better? There\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of\u2026\u201d</span> To the grovyle\u2019s dismay, you move as slowly as you can; you want to savor how he shivers and cringes in desperation whenever you move, but you also don\u2019t want him to cum just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver and over, you quickly bring him to the edge of release, only to pull away completely, leaving him wanting. You carefully shut down any attempt he makes at just bringing himself to orgasm, wanting him wrapped around your finger for as long as possible. As you hold him close, your pheromones slowly chip away at his higher thinking abilities. Eventually, his tongue is hanging from his mouth and his eyes are foggy and purple, his expression displaying nothing but a piercing desire to serve you at all costs. Perfect. He was under your control now. You didn\u2019t even have to say anything at this point, his body following your every move as if he was under some kind of hypnotic trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he was more obedient, you pull your hand away from his dick and maneuver yourself into a more vulnerable position, laying him down on the tree stump and climbing on atop him. While you roughly lock lips with the gasping grovyle, you simultaneously squeeze your soft, pillowy thighs around his long shaft, gently letting the smaller Pokemon thrust his wetted manhood back and forth between your squishy thighs. The side of his shaft slid smoothly against your labia with every thrust, and with a single movement, you could easily slip him inside of you\u2026 but you weren\u2019t ready for that just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how quickly he thrusts, now that he\u2019s under your control, the grovyle is completely unable to cum until you give him permission. You draw it out for a few minutes, but eventually even you get tired and sore, so you decide to finally give him the release he so craves. You squeeze your thighs together one last time, the grovyle going tense against you as your butt and the grass behind you is coated in a prodigious amount of cum as he\u2019s rocked with the most intense orgasm of his life. Afterwards, you simply cuddle with the exhausted grovyle, planting small kissing along his neck and chest as he slides in and out of consciousness. You were quite horny yourself now, of course, but that could be taken care of later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give him some space, freeing him from the constant barrage of pheromones for a while. Eventually, he mustered the energy to sit up, his mental faculties slowly returning to him. When he saw you standing over him, he smiled warmly, not even an ounce of fear or shame left on his face. All he could think about was how beautiful you were, and just how lucky he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you've taken care of his little 'problem', you could immediately tell what he wanted next...</span></div></div>",

You think you remember your parents mentioning that you might be too cute to harm, but your parents would also say that looking cute alone won't save you in the outside world. Well, maybe you'll learn what it takes to survive. Your parents were missing, and you weren't sure they'll be back anytime soon. So, you leapt out of the tree, and looked around for signs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, you weren't good at finding tracks. So, right now, you had to make a wild guess. The closest things you see are a cave, a forest, a land with a strong psychic presence to it, and a dilapidated house that looked like it'd be haunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to go to...</span></div></div>",

You hated the idea of going in that spooky-looking house, but that was the most interesting looking spot now. You approached it, and the closer you got, the more freaky it felt. You began to feel your hands stand on their ends, the chill of fear running down your spine. You reached for the doorknob, but it opened up in front of you. Surely a trick with the wind, right? At least you thought until you heard a faint chuckle. Still, you had to do this for your parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou entered, scanning around fearful. As you scan around, you notice a couple of rooms. One room seemed to have a bird-shaped creature boasting fan-like appendages. One room held a doll with a zipper-like mouth. One room held a Magical Pok\u00e9mon with a witch-like hat. And one room had a... Pikachu-shaped figure? Which room do you think would help you out?</span></div></div>",

Due to how small you are, many Pok\u00e9mon could easily eat you up, or do something worse. However, when your parents go missing from your home, you have to brave the world, avoid terrifying predators, and hopefully find your family. Can you succeed? Or will you be eaten, or worse, by bigger Pok\u00e9mon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou play the role of a small Pok\u00e9mon. Something like a Riolu, or a Teddiursa. When your parents go missing, you can only go out and try to find them. But you have to worry about the other Pok\u00e9mon. Lopunnies might kidnap you, Arcanines might eat you, and so on and so forth. You, being so small, can't defend yourself too well, so you have to run and hide. Be careful of the tall grass, watch for hungry birds, and try not to attract too much attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecommended practices:<br>\r\n*Vore<br>\r\n*Flatulence<br>\r\n*Squashing<br>\r\n*Domination<br>\r\n*Stench<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules<br>\r\n1: Don't be too gory<br>\r\n2: Player characters are small and susceptible to predators<br>\r\n3: Don't make chapter too short<br>\r\n4: Please keep good grammar<br>\r\n5: The player is male<br>\r\n6: The player is never willing in voracious, gaseous, or sexual acts<br>\r\n7: Please no humans<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecently, new scenarios are being added, so the following rules are disabled/amended.<br>\r\n2.
