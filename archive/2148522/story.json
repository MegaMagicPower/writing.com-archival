In short, Lauren just broke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina had her boyfriend but he was starting to get sick of her super clingy new personality. He never could do anything without telling her where he was going, it was horrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was the same bubbly girl but obsessed with cleaning because now everything felt wrong and dirty.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dani was sitting on the living room couch where an array of food, mostly desserts, was set out just for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had her own personal maid with Amy cleaning the empty pans and personal cook with Katherine cooking like a mad woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer life would have been heaven if it wasn't for one thing, Lauren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDani slightly looked up her neck fat pinching together as she pictured what her once closest sister was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably staring at her wall like the mentally ill person she is. Dani's blunt thoughts told her and she missed Lauren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDani stopped thinking about her older sister and focused back on herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to other's dead set on being immobile as quickly as possible but only food and one other person in her life could make her happy and since the other person is Lauren food is the only one there for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took another bite of the snicker doodle, which was practically the whole cookie that Katherine had made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrumbs fell into her cleavage and rolls but she didn't care she was only growing there was room for a lot more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd by growing Dani meant in weight not height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe weighed about 500 pounds it being very apparent in the change of her once bony features to squishy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnywhere a person poked on Dani they would have felt at least an inch or two of fat before bone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face was the shape of a sphere not having visible cheekbones anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have a neck it being swallowed by her fourth chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms had rolls on them where an elbow and wrist should have been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers couldn't type her phone and most of the time they were filled with food so it didn't matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cleavage was the size of two volleyballs and since she had none before it was a big change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach, when not taut, had three massive rolls that her hand could be lost into. One was right under her cleavage, the other right in the middle of her stomach, and the last one at the bottom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a skinny girls definition of rolls she probably had ten plus. The little ones were just barely noticeable compared to the three large ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach was starting to droop over her knees not that anyone would know that they were knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was in a straddling position to make room for her bulky belly but her thighs taught her belly always squishing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would take five people to get their hands around my thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like with her arms her leg fat also hid their joints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most noticeable part was her butt though. When sitting she gained about a foot of height and her legs were slightly off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she walked, which was a very slow waddle, it would jiggle with every step and hit the back of her thighs while waddling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatherine's comfort food was because she couldn't figure out what else to put her energy into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would write but that just reminded her of the band and unlike Lauren she didn't want to engulf herself in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was happy Dani was eating it and not worried about her ginormous size but her other sister, Lauren's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren had been MIA for the year but Katherine happened to catch a glimpse here and there and Lauren was dying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was starving herself, purposely or not, she was still not eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatherine was determined to fix her sister but her sister was determined and determined in shutting people out.</span></div></div>",

Anyone who had met Lauren knew she bought clothes that fit her, not too big and not too small, unless it was a huge sweatshirt or flannel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now though her clothes looked two sizes too big, hanging off of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe caller of her name finally comes in and tries to wake her out of her trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was...</span></div></div>",
