But, one day, out of boredom, you took the web adress and looked it up. Called \"the game\" without any originality, the site looks pretty simple, too simple. Just the title and a \"start the hunt\" button on a white page.<br>\r\nWhen you hit the \"start\" button, the terms and conditions you can usualy find on any site appear and you start reading. But got quickly bored and just hit \"I agree.\" And then another page open with just few sentenses, like an enigma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut first who are you ?</span></div></div>",

A quick look on the internet didn't help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a stupid game...\" I said out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, I decided to toss the phone away and though that maybe it was time for me to sleep early, for once.<br>\r\nThat night, I slept quite well and woke up rested. But something was off. I felt weird, everything was weird, ... Maybe I slept too much, who knows... So I decided to go the bathroom for a good shower, maybe I'll wash off thoses sensations... But it was only the start of my predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I saw myself in the bathroom mirror, I was shocked to see that I had elf ears. Probably ten inches long, pointy elf ears. And there wasn't just that, I was sure I got slimer and... shorter, maybe one feet. Looking down I discovered the disapearance of my breasts. I had a good C-cup in size before, and I was B-cup, at best... What the heck ?<br>\r\nTouching my ears proved that it was real, and I wasn't dreaming... but how ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to work this morning, no way I would go like this ! But... I couldn't afford to miss a day... Shit...</span></div></div>",

But before that, I took a shower, which reminded me how much I had lost in size. I had to take a big step to enter into the bathtub. I was probably just under five feets now. The hot water relaxed me well though.<br>\r\nAfter that I dryed myself, put on some make up and looked for clothes. The best thing I could find to conceal my new appearance was to put on a bonnet. It was a gift, I didn't like it, but right now it was really useful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took my car and had to pull the seat at the higher settings to be able to see above my dashboard. I drove to my job, a perfume store in the mall and tried to act as normal as I could. I felt like everyone looked at me. I was in opening duty and so, openned the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFew customers came by and I was starting to get confortable enough to almost forget I wasn't looking as usual. And then, Andrea came in... but she looked really different from the one I knew. She was wearing a black mini-skirt, high heels, a light top with a big cleavage and a lot of make up. She kind of looked like... a whore...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andrea ?!? What the fuck ! Why do you look like that ?\" I said a little bit too loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho ! Ya started the game I see !\" She just answered with a thick accent I couldn't put my finger on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't understand what she meant at the moment I just said.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya read tha rules aren't ya ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what rules ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tha ones before ya tha game. And ya have ta say that ya understood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suddenly remembered what I though was the conditions to apply and barely bothered to read.<br>\r\n\"Shit... that was the rules ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh maggad... what a dipsie ya're. So first thing, never tell anyone about ya're enigma or it's game over. Ya have to work alone on it. Two, every hunt starts with a handicap that only ya and other players can notice. Like me being a stripper or ya, being... shorter... ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took away my bonnet and showed her my ears.<br>\r\n\"I'm a fucking elf ! I look ridiculous !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that Andrea smiled and even giggled.<br>\r\n\"Oh maggad ! Ya look sooo cuuute !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you ! ... But wait ! What do you mean, you're a stripper now ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a gum from her ridiculously small hand bag and started masticating.<br>\r\n\"Well, it's nat always physical, some changes can be mental or affecting yor past and present. Here, it's been three days that I know I have to go to work at the strip clab dawntawn every evening. I can't help myself bat trying to look as slutty as possible and I know how to danse and please the client.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was mental, no way I would continue.<br>\r\n\"How the fuck do we leave this game ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya can't babe ! Ya have ta finish it before someone else does. Or else ya're stuck with tha last change ya got !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kidding ? Why did you bring me into this ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bacause, tha changes gives ya perspective, girl ! After some changes ya won't see tha world under the same eye ! And also, at the end you can have any wish ya want !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but one of us is going to be stuck like she is !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knaw, but I don't intent ta continue, I love this new life of mine ! Sex is great, and the look of the man looking at me dansing, it's a feeling I can't get enough !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't believe it, she was such a stuck up, and now she wanted to live as a slut. No way I was going to stay like this, if my only chance to get out of this shit is to clear it, I will do !<br>\r\n\"Get the fuck out ! I can't believe you dragged me into this !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, I'll let ya breath. But before I leave, I'll give ya a little trick. The changes are a hint fer tha hunt. See ya !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on that she left, leaving me furious in the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finished my shift without my bonnet and indeed, no one aknowledged my ears. After that I worked on the enigma, with the hint that I was an elf.<br>\r\n<i>In the dark of the night, they gather. In the dungeons of the mind, they master.</i></span></div></div>",

A social game named dungeon and dragon could make you play various races, like elves. And it needed a game master.<br>\r\nIt's usualy played at home, but when I searched the name with the name of the town, I found a store who rent a room to play it after 8pm.<br>\r\nSo I decided to take a look and drove to the store. It was still open and I was welcomed by a man in his thirties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, are you here for the game session ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just here to take a look...\" I said uneasy, the place not being my usual spot to have fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man smiled and nodded.<br>\r\n\"Ah, no problem, it's not often that women take interest in this hobby, so don't hesitate to join in if you want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nervously smiled back and walked to the table behind him, with five guys talking and laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched that strange storytelling game for a while, until I noticed a token on the table. \"The treasure hunt\" was engraved in it.<br>\r\nCould it be that easy ? Somehow, I had the feeling that it was the real deal. But it seemed to belong to one of the player. At that moment, the mecanic of the game they were playing come to my mind.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I decided to be sly and tried to take it discreetly. So I decided to get close to that player who left his token on the table, next to his dices. Once I got close enough I pointed something on the battlemap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand why you could do that thing here.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they tried to figure out what I was talking about and mansplaining the entire rules of DnD, I got my hand on the token.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then waited few minutes before telling some lies about having to go home, and I took my leaves.<br>\r\nAs I was stepping out, I got a message on my phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Congratulation for resolving your first hunt. You will recieve the next one in the morning, in the meanwhile take a good sleep, knowing you just won 100$.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n100$ ?!? Just like that ? Holly shit ! The other enigmas wouldn't probably that easy, but still that was quite welcome.<br>\r\nI went back to my car and looked in the mirror, but I still didn't change. Probably the next day. I then, went home, changed and watched netflix before going to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day I woke up with some weird sensation between my legs. Like I had something hard and stiff. I lifted the sheets to take an half asleep look and was happily surprised to see that my tiddies were back. They even seemed bigger, maybe... but then I saw what was going on and my heart stepped a beat. I had a dick ! And not a small one ! Probably around eight inches long and fairly wide... and proudly erected...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you shitting me ?\" I shoutted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow quite awake, I rushed to the bathroom. In the mirror I could see that I was back to myself, with maybe bigger breasts... I wasn't sure since I lost them for a day... But that wasn't the issue here ! I had a dick, with balls and all ! And shit... I was fucking horny !<br>\r\nThe memory of Andrea, from yesterday, popped into my mind. Damn she was sexy...<br>\r\nWait ! I'm I gay now ? Well... Am I even a woman now ?<br>\r\nI needed to resolve this enigma... but first, a little bit of masturbation to clear my mind.<br>\r\nSo, I sit on my bed and started touching and strocking my new member. The feeling was alien at first, but the pleasure quickly kicked in and soon I was madly fapping. All I could think of, was how I would love to feel Andrea's lips around my cock and how I would fuck that bitch raw. And within two minute I came, making a mess in my hand and sheets.<br>\r\nIt wasn't as strong as the orgasms I got as a woman, but I got there really fast... so fast, it felt a little bit short and I was in need to do it again.<br>\r\nIt was my day off, so I had time. I went to my computer and looked for porn. And I found plenty to have fun on. Before I knew it, the day was gone and all I did was watching porn and jack-off. I was teared between being disgusted of myself and pretty happy for all the pleasure I got.<br>\r\nI was exhausted though. But I needed to watch the new enigma to know what to do. So I took my phone and looked for the new message who was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Whatever the path you take, if you want to play, for the fun's sake, you'll have to pay.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain with a very vague enigma. And the hint of having a dick doesn't help.</span></div></div>",
