You get approximately half way through mowing the front lawn when your hands start to stiffen.  You eventually have to let go of the lawn mower.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down and notice your nails have fallen out. The tips of your fingers flare up in agony as tiny points tear through the top. The holes are small and tight enough that almost no blood comes out, but the pain is unbearable. It feels as if your very bones are pushing themselves out. As you stare dumbfounded,  a swelling builds up in the skin surrounding each claw, and slowly spreads to the entire digit. The top joints of you fingers swell grotesquely while the rest simply shrinks into your knuckles. Your thumbs almost completely disappear; all that remains is a tiny little clawed nub. The palms of your hands swell as well, drying and cracking as they gain mass. They feel like leather pads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arches of your feet grow, more than doubling in length as the bones stretch your skin like a drum. Your pinky toes disappear as the others swell to become the same size as your fingers. You can't see the soles of your feet, but you can feel that they too are swollen and leathery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at your legs and gasp at how thick the hair is; it's practically fur! But why would you be growing fur? After a quick overlook, you realize your arms and the backs of your hands, now paws, are covered in the same fuzz, which feels like it is still growing, but that isn't possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tickle at the base of your spine brings your attention back to your own body. Something is pressing its way out from the base of your spine. As it continues to grow, you realize what it was; a tail. You try to pull it back into yourself, but only succeed in making it stand at attention, as it ripped through your shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hips pop loudly, which send you tumbling to the ground. You try standing again, still in a half-crouch. The vertebrae in your lower back each pop individually, sending your paws closer and closer to the ground. Your shoulders lock, and your hips pop and crack once more, this time for good. You fall four-on-the-floor and cringe as your back tenses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly your head remains human, but your ears are already changing. You groan and cry as they flatten and lengthen.  Your skull splits and mends itself as it became flatter. Bones creak and snap in your face, and your teeth become thinner, longer and sharper. Your nose becomes black and slimy. Your whiskers flare as you cringe again while your jaw lengthens. As it grows, your teeth jut forward menacingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over your new body, you realize that you look very similar to your neighbor's poodle, Beauty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there, on all fours panting, trying to figure out what to do when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you glance back you see some sort of fleshy growth, maybe and inch long.  \u201cA tail!\u201d  you whispered to yourself, \u201cI\u2019m growing a tail!\u201d You watch as the tail continues to grow and a large ball of white fur grows on the tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, your chest starts to hurt.  The pain in your ribs becomes unbearable.  You feel short of breath, and start to hyperventilate.  As you suck in the air, you actually can hear your ribs beginning to crack.  You can feel them expanding outward and look down. In a panic, you lift up your shirt and look down.  Your ribcage is expanding before your eyes!  And your abs are pulling even tighter, further exaggerating the look of your expanded chest.  You feel your expanded chest.  It feels heavy to keep upright \u2013 it\u2019s weight and shape are clearly intended to force you forward, to force you to all fours! Finally, it seems to stop.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause for a moment and remember the ring on you finger.  You wonder if that could be causing the transformation.  No matter what caused it, you realize you need to get home as soon as possible.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue running as your thighs start to change shape, thicker at the top, but too thin at the bottom \u2013 too thin for a human, that is. Your hamstrings also start tightening too, as do your lower back muscles, forcing you into a hunching position.  You feel the vertebrae in your back pop into position, one by one, each one sending hands closer and closer to the ground.  Then you feel your Achilles tendons tightening, slowly, relentlessly conspiring to pull you heels up off the ground, to force you onto all fours! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you land on all fours, it feels obscenely good.  As you look over your body you are horrified at what you see -  leaning on your hands like this, your expanded chest and tightened stomach make your shape look unmistakably canine.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your nose hurting and jaw aching.  You realize that something was happening to your face.  Your nose starts to turn black!  You feel a huge pressure from within your nose and jaw, and realize your face is starting to push out into a dog\u2019s muzzle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at your arms, horrified to see white fur sprouting from your skin.  Your hands are lengthening before your eyes as your fingers curl and shorten into mere paws.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperate, you attempt to lift off your shirt to witness the inevitable, but you only succeeded in tearing at your shirt with your new claws, your tattered shirt falling to the ground, leaving you completely naked.  You look at your chest as the fur began to sprout all over your formerly perfect, smooth skin and over your shoulders as well.  You also notice two rows of nipples lining your belly.  You twist to get a glimpse of your back, only to see fur sprouting profusely there too, making you feel utterly bestial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cry out, \u201cHowwwooorp merr, preeeasssee!\u201d and realized he had practically howled, as your vocal chords are changing.

You lift a hand and touch your ears, the right, then the left, feeling that they are becoming long and floppy, with a light coating of fuzz now covering them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFur starts to poke through your skin along the sides of your face and neck, a brushing feeling that was almost\u2026pleasant. A slight sting enters your eyes, very briefly, as the fur started to cover your face. A black smudge touches your nose. You wonder where the smudge could have come from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO\", You yell as you realize, your nose itself is turning black! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCracks and jolts rock your face as your mouth pushes outward into a dog\u2019s muzzle, quickly becoming covered in soft golden fur. Your teeth sharpen, into fangs, as your tongue lengthens further and further out with your muzzle. The human hair you have begins to fall out, falling gradually to the floor, to be replaced by the same fur that was invading the rest of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" No, stop. Nogghhh.\" A lump forms in your throat. Your vocal chords are changing. \" Ngghhh, Grrrrfff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head with a huge effort and try once more to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrrrfff\u2026 Grrrr\" Is the best you can manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move a hand, or is it a paw? You no longer have hands, you think desperately. Not anymore. Your hands, paws, have changed, your fingers are shorter and your thumbs now a long way up your wrist, with short black claws protruding out. Leathery pads have developed on your palms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My-help me!\" You try to call out, but could only make a high-pitched whine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slash your right paw down your shirt tearing the garment off your body. You are horrified to find thick golden fur covering almost all of you chest and back. Pressure builds up at the base of your spine, an uncomfortable pulling sensation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, not that, you thought, not a tail! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell to the floor, crawling hysterically out of your jeans as the pressure of your changing hips and legs becomes too much to bear, using your newly formed forepaws to drag yourself along. You watch, panting, as your new tail grows at an astonishing rate, snaking out until it lay on your backside. God, you could feel the thing sitting there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassment flushes your mind as the fur grew across your hips. Bone crack across your legs as they become thinner, differently jointed, suited to the rest of your body. Your feet creak and you are pushed up on to your toes, on to all fours like the animal you know you are becoming. Leathery pads invade the bottom of you altering feet, while fur grow on the few patches of skin that still remained bare. You tried to stand, strained to get up, but clumsily fell back on to you four legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the changes stop. You look over your golden-furred body, at your tail, your four paws, at your black nose, which is always in your vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA golden retriever. That is what you are.  Not human anymore, not physically at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In fact you look a lot like Misty, Stacy's dog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me out! Let me out of this, please! I don\u2019t want to be an animal!\" you try to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Grrrr ahoooo.\" You howl, vainly attempting to call out for help. </span></div></div>",

Your dreams drift from human activities to chasing rabbits in an open field.  Normally you would dream about your boyfriend, but images of him are replaced with big muscular dogs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, you wake up early, your sleep uncomfortable. You are lying on your back, and it feels like there was something in the bed right under your lower back. You roll over and feel the mattress, but it is perfectly smooth. You slide yourself on to your back again, and fell the same pressure. This time you glide your hand directly up from your ass to your back to feel what could be under you. Again, you fell nothing but soft sheets\u2014but as you sweep up, the back of your hand fells a small nub just above your butt. It also seems like there is a fine coat of hair on your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump up from the bed in panic and look at your naked body in the mirror. You almost break down in tears as you look at yourself. Your face looks almost normal, but there is a slight elongation to the shape of your skull, your ears are almost imperceptibly pointy at the tops, and your nose was just slightly longer than normal-- and worse, there was a small dark spot, slightly wet, at the tip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you gasp in despair you can see your teeth. Your canines had become more, well, canine. They are noticeably elongated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the real problem is your body. Your feet and lower legs have thinned noticeably, your toenails are black, and fine golden hair is growing thickly from your ankles, thinning as it comes up your legs and up your back to your shoulders, which are also flatter and more narrow. Your hands, too, have become slightly misshapen, your fingernails thick and black, thin hair growing on the backs. Your chest is flatter than normal, and six little spots\u2014almost like large blisters or boils, but painless\u2014 have sprouted in two rows down your torso. You recognize these spots from all the times you have rubbed Misty's belly--they are the beginnings of canine teats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down and cry for a while as you look at your deformed body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening to me?\" you cry.</span></div></div>",

As you pull down your pants, you get a better look at the tail growing from your backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNoooo, no it can\u2019t be it\u2019s a trick it can\u2019t be real.\u201d you try to convince yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to feel a strange tingling sensation across your body, then you feel a sudden hot flush followed by another pulse through your body.  You begin to sweat as your body struggles to come to terms with its increased temperature. Then suddenly a throbbing pain begins in your hands, you look at them in horror as your carefully manicured fingernails fall out, within an instant they are replaced by black claws which pierce through the end of your fingers. You begin to cry out as you watch your fingers bloat and widen while your thumb retreats into your hand and moves around so that it now sits at your wrist. The skin on the palms of your hands begins to harden as it to swells, within moments your hands had been transformed into paws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, oh my god, make it stop\u2026please make it stop!\u201d you cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a burst of pain hits your feet. First you feel a stretching sensation as the arches of your feet begin to lengthen until they seem to be almost twice their normal size. Your toenails fall out as they make way for the black claws that pierce through your skin. Your smallest toe disappears as the other four become enlarged. The mutation continues until your feet are no longer recognizable as anything other than paws. Suddenly you are forced onto your knees as more pain pulses through your shrinking hips and calves as they begin to change shape and reform themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time you feel a tremendous tightening across your chest as your rib cage begins to expand. With this expansion, your once plump breasts seem to flatten out until all that is left is your pert nipples. You feel a strange sensation as several new pairs of nipples push through your skin and line your belly.  You try to raise yourself from the crouching position, but the wave of pain from your hips as they begin to shift prevents you from doing so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try again, but this time it seems as if your shoulders are collapsing, changing. You feel the vertebrae in your back pop into position, one by one, each one making your new form more and more permanent. Once complete you feel your hips make a final adjustment, and hear a loud popping sound, and with that your new body shape is locked into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to cry out, but find your human cries have been replaced by canine whines and howls. The changes then move to your head, which until now had remained unchanged. Your human teeth feel out as your new sharp, pointed canine teeth push through the gums of your lengthening jaw. Your skull seems to remold itself into its new shape.  Your eyes increase in size and move further apart. As your human nose disappears to be replaced by a muzzle and black moist dog nose, you feel your human earlobes sink back into your head as your ear hole is pushed higher and new dog ears form. Finally you feel your neck stretch and lengthen and your neck bones reset themselves so that the position of you head has changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you feel a strange itching sensation across your  whole body as white and brown fur begins to burst through your skins pores. As the strange sensation continues your former human hair is forced from your head to make way for your new fur.  Finally the sensations cease, the transformation was completed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your reflection. You are shocked by what she see, looking back at you is a Beagle, your Beagle Peanut, nothing of your former self remained.</span></div></div>",

Now you can smell that delicious dog food lying in its' bowl before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to hang onto your humanity for a bit more.

You eyes widen and you can feel your ears perk up in surprise. The food before you might be dog food, but it is very tasty dog food. You find yourself liking the taste of dog food. You lower your head down again into the dog food bowl. And you begin to happily wolf it down.</span></div></div>",
