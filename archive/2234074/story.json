No this year all of your family (Well only the girls from your family) are coming down and over half of them you never meet in person, but you know them all by face and name. And the only reason your the only male at this thanksgiving is because all the other men of your family are spending their thanksgiving out on tour for the next 3 years. And you were left behind because you don't like the kind of tour they left on. (It's a tour of every haunted spot in the world).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your finishing your part of the work your mom tells you to stay in your room and see will slide your dinner under the door when its done. She then says that if you leave your room at all while the family is here you will be grounded until the guys get back from there tour. You think to yourself THAT'S 3 YEARS AWAY!!! With that said you go upto your room and close your door as everyone starts to arrive. You go over to your bed and see a gift addressed to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you open it?</span></div></div>",

In no time you see the world around you rise up and up and up until you blackout completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up moments later, you take a look around you. Strange alien trees rose above you. You shook your head to shake away the dizziness but quickly realize your head felt different.. lifting your hands to your face you realize they\u2019re no longer your hands... but that of insects! Wait a minute.. the gun.. the ant option.. you really were an ant! The trees around you were your bedroom carpet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit shit SHIT\u201d you say out loud. \u201cOk.. ok don\u2019t panic.. all I have to do is climb back up my bed, and somehow undo this..\u201d You begin making your way through the forest of your carpet as fast as your newfound six legs can take you. You finally make it to one of your shirts draped over the edge of the bed. You begin the ascent on your shirts long sleeve, weaving over wrinkles until you reach the top of your bed. Hopping off your shirt you saw the monument of the gun ahead of you. Bingo. \u201cOk time to take care of this freak accident.\u201d You make it over and gaze up. The gun was the size of a building, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be an obstacle to you anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidway up the gun you are interrupted by a loud sound behind you.. your ant sense alert you that someone has entered the room.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn and see ______</span></div></div>",

Between her and Josie, she and you were closer. But man, she could be a brat sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTucking the rest of her waffle knit, burgundy, button down sweater into her jeans, she casually waltzed into your room carelessly picking up items on your dresser and putting them back just as apathetically.

You could understand your voice but could she? You knew it was hopeless to get Emma\u2019s attention. Why on Earth would her first thought when seeing you be \u201coh look it\u2019s my brother, I better help him\u201d... no, this is about survival. You needed to get atop this insect gun before you before she really does see you and, God for it, squash you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no more time, you crawl up the side of the gun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGosh his room is a mess\u201d. At your bed, Emma decides to sit and wait for you. Moving your shirt, a few other articles of clothes and other random materials out of her way, she plops down onto your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shockwave of this affected the gun, and you now on top of it. The impact flipped the gun up and between the wall and the bed only to crash to the floor below. Luckily the flipping device flung you off before it crash landed into the pit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour tiny ant form screamed as you landed...</span></div></div>",
