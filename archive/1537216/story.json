But as soon as you sow them, you saw that nothing happened. \"They told me these seeds will grow in an instant.\" you said angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a waste\" you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then went to sleep. During the night, the under the moon ray the seeds began to grow until it become a giant beanstalk. In the morning, when you looked out the window you got shocked when you saw the giant beanstalk. You exited out the house and you thought \"I know I will regret this; but I will climb this beanstalk\" you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climbed the giant beanstalk with relative ease. By the time you reached it, you saw a big giant castle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it is a good idea to enter someones home but... what could possibly happen?\" you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran to the door of the giant castle.

Then in front of you, appeared a giant red female porcupine with a lot of dandruff on her quills. She saw everywhere, trying to find someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I am down here\" you shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the red porcupine looked down at you and she began to scream so loud; that you almost became deaf. You could her screaming \"It is a chicken!!! Go away, go!!!\" You then understand the situation and you shouted to her you were not a chicken. She did not heard you at first. You shouted again and this time she calmed enough to stop screaming. Then she picked you and examined you better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you are not a chicken, right?\" she asked a bit nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I am just a villager below the clouds.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed a little, and she took you inside. You saw a lot of luxury furniture and plants in every corner. The place was pretty clean.. and silent, like a pacific garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant porcupine sat in a coach and continued examining you. She said \"My name is Flaky. You know, You are not the first to come here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? But first, are you afraid of chickens?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.. that is a long story. And about the other people, I suggest you not to ask much questions about it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a large moment of silence. Flaky was still seeing you with a strange look that made you uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou break the silence asking \"Do I have something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you ask?\" replied Flaky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you keep seeing me with those eyes for a long time\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is because you are different from the others. You are more... interesting than the others\" said Flaky with a happy face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put you in a table and said: \"Wait me here, I will bring you something special\" and she went through a door and looked at you thinking \"What a sweet thing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a bit perplexed about the porcupine's behavior. Before you could think anything about it, you heard a noise in the ceiling. You thought you should investigate it... but you thought it wasn't a good idea to upset the porcupine. You can also wait for her and ask her about why you are more interesting from the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You waited politely, sitting cross-legged on the wooden table, listening to the giant porcupine's large footsteps slowly begin to fade. You turned to your left and noticed a bowl...with a sliver of milk drizzling down the size, making a small puddle of white by the bowl's edge. \"Hmm... cereal?\" you inquire. You look around more at your surroundings, marveling at the bright, brick-walled room. It was almost like a dream. You were awoken from your trail of thought by the soft thuds of Flaky's footsteps, which turned to thunder, as she approached the table you were on, clenching a fistful of...what appeared to be a leg or two and an arm sticking out from between the matted paw that held it. \"Tee hee,\" she giggled, noticing your curiosity, which she thought was \"cute.\" She revealed the specimen, or specimens, in her paw, which turned out that to be three wriggling, writhing villagers. None of them looked familiar to you, though. \"That's what I meant when I said 'others,' little one.\" Flaky said softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what are you trying to say?\" you look up at Flaky nervously, noticing a gleaming smile from her red, exubrant face. The quills on her back seemed to stick up in suspense from this question, as she answered, \"Well, you're not the only one who's visited my castle high above in the clouds before. Many people, all from whom have managed to reach here different ways, have succeeded as well. Yep, I think I've had about ten in my life's pastime...but now, of course, with you here, that can be arranged to eleven, now.\" \"Ten? What happened to the other seven? You're holding three...\" you gulp, feeling a tightness in your throat. \"Well... I was kinda hungry, admittedly...\" Flaky said, blushing, turning even redder than her skin pigment already was. You felt a deep sickness in your stomach. \"You ATE them?? How could you!\" \"Now now, little guy, I only eat the ones that disobey my orders. These three have been loyal and haven't tried to escape, though... They service me well, occasionally tending to my chores, watering my plants, easy stuff.\" You look at the three men, all of which trembling in Flaky's hand, probably frightened by how loud her voice was, even though she was speaking in a steady tone, but they were tiny and all. \"So you're going to make me YOUR slave too now, right?\" you say, taking a few steps back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlaky smiles warmly, \"Well...you're really just so small, and...cuter than the others. I think I'll just have you do ONE task for me. But if you disagree...\" Flaky, using her other hand's paw finger to pinch one of the little man's shirt by the collar, hoisted him up high above her head, him screaming and flailing his arms, both from the shock of being lifted up so high and fast, and from knowing what would probably come next...and he was right. As you looked on with horror, Flaky's enormous, bucked-tooth jaws slowly opened, revealing her huge, glossy, sticky maw. Saliva clinging to the roof of her mouth, tongue bulging like a pink blob beneath the ringed cavern, a set of white teeth each hidden within the wet-ridden mouth, and a eeriee darkness at the back of the reddish room, where the tongue connects with the throat, uvula hanging above, rising and lowering with each deep breath Flaky inhaled, then exhaled, blowing gusts of hot air into the tiny human's face, with the smell of what may have been Flaky's last meal. You and the other two men, still standing on Flaky's paw, could watch and do nothing as Flaky lowered the shrieking being, tears flowing down his face, which was red from both the heat exhausting from Flaky's maw and the shock of all this happening so fast. Flaky closed her eyes to enjoy the situation better as she quickly threw the man onto the squishy, wet tongue, in which an audible squelch was heard from the outside, and instantly, Flaky's lips snapped shut, trapping her prisoner tight in the hot, salivating, alive cave. She took a moment or two to get a taste of the man, her cheeks flexing, using her tongue to sway him by flipping him around side-to-side, like a washing machine, covering him in her saliva, filling her taste buds with a multitude of different flavors. Then, finally, she tilted her head back a bit, and you saw saw a small lump begin to grow at the top of Flaky's throat, just under the chin. You and the others head a loud, sickening gulp, and watched as the lump expand exuberantly, and travel down, in vain, down down her lustrous throat, where it shrunk and then disappeared, once reaching the belly, in which, you could see her stomach expand ever so slightly with the tiny man's body taking up space from being dumped in. She opened her eyes and sighed deeply... She placed a paw on her tummy, smiling. \"Ahh... such a tasty meal.\" she giggled, looking at your face. \"So, will you be a good boy and do as I ask? Or will you have to become the next part of the meal\" she said, patting her red belly playfully. You looked up at the huge porcupine, then back at the two remaining men, crouching down in fear. You thought for a moment...</span></div></div>",

I really wanted to have him as my personal slave... Oh well... it can't be help\" then she put the two other men in a jar and then continued to chase you. You continued running now seeing you were now inside the kitchen. Then you hide below the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... this is very appropiate... you hide right in the perfect place so I casn have another meal!\" said Flaky. Then she began to crouch in order to find you. \"Peek-a-boo where are you?\" You breathe heavily knowing what would happen if she found you so you decided to remain hidden until you found an opening to excape. But...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peek-a-bee... you will be my next meal!\" said Flaky finding you and trying to catch you... you managed to avoid her paw making her to hit with the table and a jar that was above the table fall on her head, somewhat stunning her. Then you tried to hide inside one of the counters that had an open door.

She saw you and picked you up. She seemed to be happy when she saw you, as she took you inside quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled a little and said \"I am Giggles. It is good that another little cutie comes to visit me\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are there others?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Right now we were taking the tea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you arrived, you saw other animals dressed elegant. There was a purple beaver, a yellow rabbit and a blue moose. Giggles put you down next to a table and said: \"Wait me here. I will go for the tea\" and she went to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi. How are you? And who are you?\" you asked friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Toothy and we are going to escape.\" said the beaver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Cuddles and it is because her cooking is the worst.\" said the rabbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Lumpy and I rather prefer to eat mud than her food\" said the moose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is so bad?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will taste it soon\" said Toothy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggles returned with a teacup full and served you in little cups. Then she went again saying something about bringing you new clothes. You taste the tea and as soon as you tasted it you threw it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My God!!!!! Is this a drink?! It tastes like...\" you said spiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes we know. Now we have to escape\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought for a second about the situation and you thought it would be better to say something to the chipmunk.

Then, you fainted. \"What's with him?\" said Lifty. \"Dunno, but I think he looks delicious.\" said Shifty. \"Let's invite him in.\" \"Alright,\" said Lifty. Shitfy grabbed you and placed you into their castle. \"What should we do with him?\" said Shifty. \"Let's put him in the jar with the others, then we can eat him.\" said Lifty. He puts you into the jar, closed it with the lid and put it with a cupboard and left the room. Suddenly, you woke up and said, \"What the? I'm trapped in a jar?\" Then, you saw 6 trapped HTFs, Toothy, Handy, Nutty, Flaky, Sniffles and Mime. \"They must have captured the others.\" you thought, \"What should I do?\"</span></div></div>",
