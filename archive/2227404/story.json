She couldn't help but giggle to herself at the inaccuracies and anachronisms as she read further into the first third of the story, in which Dante and Virgil travel from limbo to the deepest bowels of Hell. Mortals, she thought, what silly things they believe. From what she understood, most mortals were under the impression that the Devil was a male, and had several other names such as Satan, Beelzebub, Mephistopheles, and Lucifer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last one was actually the closest to the truth. The devil's real name was actually Lucifina, and yes, was actually female. She should know, because Lucifina was her mother. She had also heard many other stories of her mother, like how she had taken the form of a snake and tricked the first humans into disobeying God. First of all, her mother despised snakes. Second, the humans disobeyed God because that was their nature, to do as they are told not to. She still didn't know how the story had come to be, probably a sort of smear campaign by biblical writers or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, her chamber door opened and her personal servant and friend Cleo poked her head in. \"Hey Lucy? Your mom wants to see you.\" Lucina closed her book and got up off her bed. \"Thank you, Cleopatra. Tell her il be there in a couple minutes. Cleo frowned. \"Didn't I ask you not to call me that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cleopatra, my full name.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right. Sorry, Cleo. That will be all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore heading to the throne room, she checked herself in the mirror. She had bright blonde hair, fair skin and glowing yellowish orange eyes with catlike pupils. Two small horns protruded from her forehead, and a demonic tail sprouted from the base of her back. She wore a black silk tank top and skirt that went down to her knees, along with fishnet stockings and blood red high heel shoes. Making sure she was presentable, at least by Hell's standards, she proceeded to her mother's throne room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucifina, sat on her black throne, dressed much like her daughter, except her horns were much larger and her tail longer. As Lucina entered the room, she smiled. \"Ah, there you are my dear. I have something very important to tell you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Mother?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you know, I have been the ruler of Hell since...well, nearly the beginning of time. As such, as my only heir, I feel the time has come to pass on the title of Queen to you.\" Lucina nearly gasped. \"Mother, you can't be serious!\" But her mother only nodded solemnly in response \"Oh, but I am. The time has come for me to retire, and for you to take the reigns. Now, of course I'll have to teach you exact what you're supposed to do, of course. Deciding sinner's punishments, managing the influx of arriving souls and so on. By the time we're done, I bet you will be an even better devil than I was!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina, however, wasn't so sure. She really should have expected this, after all, she was the princess of Hell. But even so, the thought of so much responsibility being thrust on her all at once was almost too much to bear. \"Is something wrong, dear?\" Her mother asked.</span></div></div>",

Well, except for the fact that she's not human. She's a succubus, in fact. Oh, and there's the whole her mother is literally the devil and she's next in line to rule over Hell. Other than that, though, totally average! You see, the devil happens to really be a woman, and she's working on teaching Lucina to be her successor when she retires. Turns out, even when you're immortal you still need a vacation now and then. Lucifina, Lucina's mother, has been doing this whole Ruler of Hell job for a very long time, and thinks it's about time she passed it on to a new generation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrouble is, Lucina isn't totally sure that she even wants the job. Sure, being princess of Hell has it's perks, but she doesn't really believe she has what it takes to fill her mother's shoes. Time will tell whether she does or not, because Lucifina's retirement is getting closer by the day...</td>",
