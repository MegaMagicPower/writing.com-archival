In her travels around the galaxy, she had managed to track the signal of an old Chozo research station, supposedly inhabited by a scientist AI, programmed to keep inventing long after the Chozo had been destroyed. She was here to see if that way true, and she donned her armor, stepping off the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have to walk for long until she found the main research hall, and was surprised by what she saw. In the hall, were rows and rows of upgrades, all compatible with her armor, as a quick scan showed. A terminal to her right told her that the AI had done what it was told, and made upgrades for years and years, all for a variety of different purposes. Some were for combat, some were for cleaning, and some were truly bizarre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of these were at Samus's disposal, and she decided to try some out. She even found that some could be applied to her zero suit. Samus turned down the hall, and began to find out just what some of them did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Choose an upgrade below</b></span></div></div>",

The computer sorted through the upgrades, and gave it to Samus in the form of a small chip. It was an upgrade for her body, and required Samus to take off her armour, which she did, stripping down to her zero suit. It had been upgraded to take upgrades via a small dock on her hip, which Samus inserted it into, and waited for it to take effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus's skin started to feel strange, a tingling feeling going up her body. Her zero suit felt tighter, and had a strange sensation on her skin. Samus' feet began to feel strange, and a slight pain went through them, the sensation spreading to her legs as she began to become taller. She looked down, and her zero suit's boots tore as claws came out, her toes merging together into three large toes equipped with large talons, the centre one raised, and Samus saw what had caused her skin to feel strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skin had gained red scales, a mottled black pattern over them as her body began to shift, her zero suit shredding from her as a long tail sprouted from her rear, gaining length until it was a metre and a half long, brushing on the floor behind her.<br>\r\nSamus was rooted to the spot, panting as she stared at her now digitigrade feet, switching her view to her now merging fingers, gaining similar talons. The last of her zero suit fell off, revealing her patterned chest, covered completely in scales, as Samus began panting harder as the changes began to affect her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus's neck grew longer, stretching outward as her features began to painfully elongate, growing flatter and longer as her ears disappeared and her hair fell out, replaced with stripes and small spikes. Her nose flattened and became two nostrils, and her lips spread to the sides of her face, her tongue becoming longer and thinner as the final change took place, her pupils slitting as they became those of a lizards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus gasped as her changes finished, before coming to a mirror and looking over herself, now an anthropomorphic raptor. She gave her tail a few experimental swings, and took a long look at herself. How did she feel about this?</span></div></div>",

A swipe of her clumsy. muscled forearms left a deep gouge in the metal plating by the mirror. By the Great Galaxies themselves, she was <i>powerful</i>, and no thieves would dare steal from her now. No more worrying. As her ship was operated by a telepathic interface, gleaming black talons instead of hands would pose no problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the best things about being a raptor, she decided, was that she didn't have to wear a bra. Those things were awfully uncomfortable. Samus swiped her tail in an experimental motion, then practised movements. An attempt to walk ended with her toppling to the ground as her short arms were unable to break the fall, and running practise was equally painful. After a few minutes of crashes and bumps, she became accustomed to her taller height and limbs that felt like they held springs inside them. This strange new body felt like home. Judging by the scratches she had left in the hard floor when practising, it would be a problem to avoid harming someone by accident, but she planned to be careful. She walked to the door, pleased by the powerful feel of her muscles, and hesitated. What now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She took the chip the computer offered to her, plugging it into her armour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus' skin began to get a leathery, tougher feel, greying as the first of the changes took place. Her fingernails turned black and lengthened, her toes following suit as a tail began to sprout from her rear, growing in length and thickness as it split at the end, fins forming at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer chest, inner arms and thighs got a lighter shade of grey, as a fin grew from Samus' back, smaller versions growing from the tips of her elbows and hips. On Samus' face, her features grew slightly longer, but still remaining human as her teeth sharpened into fangs, the grey pattern ending at the end of her flatter nose, her lower face taking the whiter tinge of her chest. Finally, her ears grew longer and pointed at the end, becoming fan like, while gills sprouted on the side of her neck, completing the changes to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her body was changing, her suit was also changing to match, the second part of the upgrade coming in. The orange colour split into a lighter shade, matching the mottled pattern on Samus' body, while an extra shaft of metal was added to accommodate Samus' tail. Metal fins grew around her organic ones, as her arm cannon lacking hand grew claws, her boots matching. Finally, her armor shrunk slightly, losing mass, but allowing her to swim, an ability now heightened greatly by her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus took a look at herself in the mirror, first in her armour, and then without, finding that her zero suit had changed into more of a bikini, now lacking boots as well, while her ponytail had managed to come undone, her hair falling to her neck.  She examined her mottled skin, the new shark-girl watching her gills match her breathing,  giving her tail a quick flick. How did she feel about this?</span></div></div>",

She was curious about what something called a \"Pear upgrade\" would do. She took the chip, and saw that it was for her zero suit, and complied, removing her armour and plugging it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus began to feel a strange grinding feeling in her groin, and looked down to see that her hips seemed to be moving apart! Her hips slid apart, an odd sensation to Samus as they approached the width of her shoulders, and then passed it, giving Samus an extreme pear-shape figure. After that, Samus noticed that her rear end felt\u2026 Fuller than usual, and looked around to see that expanding too! Her normally average ass was growing in size and volume, swelling to match the growth from normal, to if someone had attached melons to her rear, each cheek larger than her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus have a small gasp as she began to sway backwards, her centre of gravity off as she toppled onto her newly padded ass, and rather than feeling any pain, felt merely a small thwap from the impact. She pulled herself back up, and walked over to a mirror, her hips giving her a large sway, accompanied by copious amounts of jiggling. Samus looked into the mirror, turning as she took a look at herself. How did she feel?</span></div></div>",

She mentally listed the pros of this upgrade. For one thing, the new size gave her some more protection in the rear, so she would hurt less if she was hit there. The extra weight could also help her use any weight sensitive panels she comes across. Finally the added weight could potentially make her butt a weapon in dire circumstances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking about for a moment, Samus made her decision. \"This is supposed to be an upgrade, and I can think of a few ways it can help. Ah, what the hell, I'll hold on to this upgrade for a while.\" She said to no one in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left the upgrade hall and started to investigate the base, blushing along the way as she felt her new butt jiggle with every step. She eventually comes up to a small corridor with four doors in it. One was a training room, one was a lounge, and the other two were far down the hall, difficult to make out. She decided to enter...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well,\" Samus said to herself, \"I suppose I should see how useful this 'upgrade' really is.\" While she had endeavored to keep the update for a while, the walk here had made her question that decision. With her new proportions, she was having difficultly moving any faster than a slow walk. It was starting to seem more like a downgrade than an upgrade; increasing her size and making her a bigger target, while also decreasing her speed. She was honestly considering yanking the upgrade chip out of her zero suit right now, and she probably would have if she wasn't afraid of what might happened if she didn't follow the proper procedures from removing an upgrade from her zero suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlodding along into the training hall, Samus decided to test whether her decision to keep the Pear Upgrade was a smart one or not. To her surprise, the room was mostly empty, save for one lit up panel on the floor in the middle of the room, slightly raised up above the rest of the tiles. A pressure sensitive tile, she presumed. Normally she'd probably need her Power Suit to be heavy enough to activate one of these, but with her newly expanded rear, perhaps she could make this work. She walked up the the panel and stood on it, feeling it lower beneath her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, that's one thing it can do, I guess.\" Regardless of one of her hypothetical uses for the upgrade being proved, she still didn't see it as all that useful. After all, this was still easily something she could have done with her Power Suit on, without sacrificing firepower and mobility. Speaking of her Power Suit. Samus realised another downside of this upgrade. With her lower half so large now, how would she fit inside her Power Suit? The negatives were still outweighing the positives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Samus could think about anything else, one of the panels on the wall behind her suddenly, presumably caused by Samus stepping on the panel. A robot that looked somewhat similar to her Power Suit, although a bit smaller, scrawnier, and coloured grey, stepped out, and pointed its arm cannon at Samus. Samus unfortunately noticed its presence a little too late, and it was able to fire off a shot at her before she could do anything. The blast hit her right in the behind, but surprisingly, it didn't really hurt all that much. Sure there was still a bit of pain, and the force almost knocked her off balance, but the added padding cushioned the blow surprisingly well. Samus had really just been trying to come up with any possible positives she could think of before, but to think there was actually some truth to the idea that it wouldn't hurt as much definitely surprised her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow there was the problem of fighting back. Samus was able to pull out her Paralyzer fast enough, but turning around was another story. She was still having trouble adjusting to her current proportions, and so her turning around was slow and clunky. By the time she had turned around enough to get a clear shot at the robot, it had already charged up another shot, this time hitting her hand and knocking the paralyzer across the room. Normally she would have never lost her grip on her weapon like that, but she was caught off guard a bit by how painful the blast had been, considering how little the shot aimed at her rear seemed to hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she had been disarmed, the robot slowly approached her, probably seeing her as an easy target. Samus racked her brain for a way to beat this bot. She certainly wouldn't be outrunning the robot to get to her paralyzer with her current proportions. She remembered the three positives she had managed to come up with about this upgrade, two of which had been proven true. But the last one, that was just ridiculous, right? Still, she saw no better way of dealing with this. She turned to face the robot side on, putting the side without the chip in front. She didn't want to risk damaging the upgrade chip, after all. As soon as the robot was close enough, Samus leaped towards it with all her might, swinging her hips in its direction. Her hips connected with its chest, sending both of them tumbling to the ground, Samus now basically sitting on the robots chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making sure the robot wasn't moving anymore, Samus stood back up. It seemed the weight of her behind had crushed the robot's chest. Samus didn't know whether to think of that as a good thing or a bad thing, but either way, she still doubted whether this held any real combat potential. Sure, she could beat a training robot like this, but not only was the robot not the brightest opponent, but it didn't seem to be constructed to solidly either. Her hips might still be able to knock people over with enough force behind them, but she doubted she'd be crushing anyone with her behind like she'd done to this robot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked over to retrieve her paralyser, Samus thought over the upgrade she still possessed. Sure, she had been able to list several hypothetical positives before, and all of those positives had been proven true, but Samus still wasn't sure if the pros outweighed the cons. Even if she got used to her current proportions, allowing her to hopefully regain some of her mobility, there was still the issue of how to squeeze her new hips into her Power Suit. The upgrade proved useful for defense for when her Power Suit wasn't available, but that wasn't too useful if it prevented her from using her Power Suit in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter weighing up both the pros and the cons, and getting her paralyser back, Samus left the training hall and...</span></div></div>",

And right now, it was trained on Samus, who continued to watch the footage of the scientists and guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe AI, in a way, was a bit worried. It knew that Samus had chosen the Pear upgrade to take, and it couldn't understand why. The upgrade had very limited use, and it was prone to glitching. The AI didn't know what the upgrade would be doing to Samus, but there was much it could do right now. All it could do was watch and hope nothing went wrong.<br>\r\n------<br>\r\nSamus kept watching the footage, having almost totally forgotten about her enlarged rear. The footage wasn't exactly telling, only showing the breaks of each scientist guard. Some ate, others mingled, she even saw a romance or two between the workers, but nothing to show why the station was abandoned. Eventually, the footage ended, and Samus sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least I know they were happy here.\" Samus said to herself, before getting up from the chair. It took a few seconds, due to her now increased weight. When she got up, she sighed and placed her hands under her butt, hefting it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, my ass is heavy.\" She said. \"Why would anyone make this upgrade? What's the purpose? Maybe I should head back to the upgrades and switch it out.\" With that, Samus left the lounge, her butt bouncing with every step. As she left, the AI watched, concerned.<br>\r\n------<br>\r\nAn hour later, Samus returned to the upgrade hall. She was about to activate the upgrade menu, when she instead decided to check herself out in the nearby mirror again. She couldn't explain why, but she wanted to see her butt again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading over to the mirror, she turned around and looked into it. Like before, her butt-cheeks were slightly larger then her head, and her hips were as wide as her shoulders. She swung her hips a little bit, and watched her rear end sway. She then lightly slapped her butt, and watched it jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus couldn't help but smile. Dumb as the upgrade seemed, a larger butt DID look good on her. And she felt like she could get used to the weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she kept looking at her rear in the mirror, she couldn't help but feel something. She couldn't know it, but the upgrade was altering her again, not physically, but mentally. It was brief, but the upgrade had quickly changed Samus's mind.

Lifting it up, she then dropped it and watched them jiggle up and down as it sloshed back into place. They were like 2 big balls of jello she could play with anytime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tee hee\" Samus said giggling, a trait quite uncharacteristic of her. She shook her booty left and right, watching the adipose filled balls of backside jiggle left and right this time as she played with them. They shook left and right until she stopped and they settled back in place while still doing some residual jiggling before stopping. She then poked her right buttcheeks. The finger sunk into the blobby flesh. She was having so much fun and she didn't know why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then decided to sit on the floor and squish her butt on the cold floor. She couldn't feel any of the cold except on her bigger thighs.

She giggled as she felt her huge butt wobble while she got up. \"I think I've already found the perfect upgrade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief pause before the AI spoke up again. \"Are you certain?\" The AI asked. \"I believe the Robot upgrade could be of value to a bounty hunter like yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, it's fine.\" Samus replied, admiring her rear end in the mirror again. \"Why would I want anything else? This ass is absolutely magnificent. In fact, I think later I'll go get a new Zero Suit. Having this one hug this gorgeous behind is amazing, but I want something that'll REALLY show it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe AI sighed. \"If that is what you wish Ms. Aran.\" The AI said, sounding somewhat upset. \"I should warn you, though. The Pear upgrade is glitched. Over time, your butt and hips will continue to expand and increase in weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's even better!\" Samus said, happy. \"Having even more ass to love will certainly make my day.\" She then gave her butt a happy smack, making it jiggle. \"It's like a bowl of jello, and I love it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe AI just sighed.<br>\r\n------<br>\r\nA little while later, Samus was on her way to her ship. She was deliberately swinging her hips in a way that made her butt jiggle and shake with each step, a feeling Samus adored now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Samus returned to her ship. Looking at it, she decided she wanted to test something. She wanted to see if her new butt could fit in the top entrance hatch of her ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to the ship, she pressed a button on the side of it, and a ladder descending, reaching to the top of the ship. Samus began climbing the ladder, feeling her butt-cheeks wobble every time she stepped on a rung. She decided that she wanted to use the ladder exclusively now, just to feel her ass wobble and shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got to the top of the ship, and opened the top hatch. Smiling, she lowered her legs into the hatch and began climbing down. She got her legs down fine, and started sliding her hips and butt down. They barely scrapped the sides of the hatch, but Samus was able to get in just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the ship, Samus smiled and hefted up her massive ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll need to upgrade my ship soon. Don't want my sexy, sexy ass to get stuck in anything.\" Samus said. \"Although that does sound pretty hot.\" She then gave a hard smack to her ass and watched it jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, though...</span></div></div>",

Samus giggled more and more at how blob like and jiggly her rear was. Just then though she felt another feeling. Shortly after she smacked her bottom it felt like it was vibrating and rumbling. It felt familiar somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly it happened. Her giant butt was growing even bigger right before her eyes. The globular cheeks swelled even bigger as they grew and grew and the zero suit grew with it. Thankfully it could stretch to most sizes, or perhaps this was the upgrade's doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh YES. Yes yes YES baby. Get biggeeeeer\" Samus said excitedly. She had almost none of her old reasoning left as she completely gave in to her desire for admiring her growing butt. She felt a euphoric, possibly sexual sensation course through her as her butt grew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer butt swelled and swelled as her cheeks grew to the size of a large bouncy ball kids play with. Additionally her thighs were getting more fat in them as well, becoming thick like tree trunks. She also started getting some pudge in her tummy from excess fat from her thighs and butt, a slight bulge on her once toned middle. Samus didn't care though as she enjoyed her situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer buttcheeks now bigger than kids' bouncy balls, jiggled heavily with every small movement and sounded like they had water in them as they made \"boing\"sounds. Samus could still walk however as they didn't weigh her down...yet. They also had become so big that they almost couldn't fit through the small space of her ship's bedroom and cockpit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh Yeah, I love this big butt so much\" Samus said as she attempted to squish the cheeks...only to find she could reach behind her. Her giant rear jugs were too big and reached too far behind her. \"Oh poo\" she said. She tried to walk but discovered the space was too cramped. Her jiggling body sized buttocks took up too much space for her to properly to move to her cockpit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh? Ugh I'm stuck. I love this booty but it's too bootilicious for this ship\" Samus said, now taking on a more typical girl way of speaking due to the mental changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The chip had broken into pieces. The stirring sensation had returned and her butt started to grow again. This time though something was wrong. Her suit didn't grow to fit her butt and it started to squeeze into some uncomfortable places. She started to push herself out of the armrests as she was stuck underneath. As she landed on her butt on the floor a strong sensation was felt in her butt as she landed on the ground and the suit started to rip. The sensation made her feel warm and she knew she had to stop the process somehow. She stood up and her suprishingly sensitive butt started to jiggle furiously with every tear of the suit. Samus knew that keeping the growth would be dire and thus she ripped the last part of the suit. But the sensation didn't stop, It simply moved to another area of her body. Standing naked in the lounge she felt her cest region tingle with the same sensation as before and she tried to rip the suit off. But the fabric wasn't streched enough to rip and so she had to watxh in dismay as her tits grew. At first they looked a bit bigger than usual but they started to grow bigger. While fear took her, another sensation was felt and she started to grind her thighs to the heat. As she looked down an extra mound was puffing up on her slothing breasts. And that was soon met by a small sensitive nub.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The suit had now broken and all growth had stopped. But something was aloof. She couldn't stop fondling her breasts. Even though she liked it she knew this was wrong.

She grabs it again and again and screams in glee and falls straight onto the floor and faints. She wakes up by a cleaning robot nudging her she has the same body but without her need to fondle she takes a step and feels her body jiggling as she keeps walking towards the bay. Unbeknownst to her she hasn't even reacted or bothered about the fact that she's displaying herself unconditionally and it would never be broached in her attention span. She reached the upgrsde hall shaking her butt and rubbing her breasts as she sits down and cums. She sits down and her body breaks out a requiem of emotions (and liquids) as she re falls asleep and wakes up again, satisfied. She then designs a new suit that would keep her body up while not removing her bodily liberty. The suit is made out of a few straps digging into her flesh a wide gap around her pussy and stomach while she had a pair of straps presenting her breasts and nipples by giving them a cone form. Though as times goes on and after a long food break her head gets wimsical yet again. She added vibrators, whips, ejectable dildos, pussy spreaders to show off her womanhood and fondling mechanics for every strap. She presses the button and the suit is about to be delivered to a surprised Samus.</span></div></div>",

Her body keeps searing as slimy hot dildos are placed between her tits. She grabs her tits and starts to rub them against the dildo as more of them appear. Her nipples are being fondled by them and her butt cheeks are being grinded on and between. She then gets one into her mouth that shuts her moaning and she starts to suck and lick furiously. Her pussy is then presented with something that makes her crack up in glee. A huge studded dildo and it's shoved up her pussy and suddenly newly added weight of her boobs and butt crack the suit and she is nude again.

She pressed the button again to confirm her choice, and the screen went blank. A slot opened up, and the terminal presented her with a blank upgrade chip. She picked the chip up and connected it to the Pear Upgrade, and the change began almost instantly. Her butt immediately felt lighter, and Samus could feel her feet sliding on the floor as her hips returned to their original width. Samus felt a tingling on her chest, as well as a steadily increasing weight, just below her breasts. After about thirty seconds, the tingling stopped, but the weight remained, and her Zero Suit felt tighter on her breasts than it normally did. Samus brought a hand up to her breasts, cupping her breasts in her hands. She ran her hands down her breasts, and her hands confirmed what she\u2019d suspected as she felt a second mound of flesh in each hand. She now had four breasts of equal size, with the second pair being directly below her original pair. Samus gently squeezed her new lower breasts, and also confirmed that they were fully functional breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was finished with her breasts, Samus turned her attention to her Zero Suit\u2019s upgrade slot. She removed the upgrade chip that had given her four breasts, and tossed the useless chip aside. She then pulled at the Pear Upgrade. Thankfully, the Pear Upgrade came out easily this time, and Samus snapped the defective chip in half. The broken halves of the upgrade chip fell to the floor, and Samus turned her attention to her reflection in the nearby mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus immediately noticed just how obvious her lower breasts were, especially when viewed from the side. However, there was something that excited her about how her four breasts looked. To her surprise, she was actually glad that she\u2019d chosen this particular option. After all, how many women could say they had four breasts? She was also surprised that the extra weight wasn\u2019t causing any strain on her back. The biomass reshaping chip must have enhanced her spine and back muscles to allow her to carry the extra weight on her chest without detriments. Samus also noticed that her Zero Suit, while slightly tighter than normal, was actually following the curves of both pairs of breasts rather well, with no signs of stretching visible on her Zero Suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus pondered her next move. While part of her was tempted to remain at the space station and test another upgrade, she didn\u2019t want to risk getting stuck with another upgrade she didn\u2019t like. Besides, she was quite pleased with her lower breasts. Maybe it would be best if she just left the space station altogether...</span></div></div>",

The airlock closed behind her as she boarded her ship, and she took her seat at the cockpit. She disengaged the airlock and fired up the engines, leaving the space station and its many upgrades behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four-breasted bounty hunter pulled her helmet off and sighed, running a hand through her hair. She placed her helmet on her ship\u2019s console, and pulled up her list of active jobs. It seemed the Space Pirates had been performing raids in a star system a few parsecs away. Samus quickly plotted a course and engaged the autopilot. Once the ship\u2019s course was locked, Samus stood up, and made her way to the back of the ship, where her armoury was located. Hopefully, she\u2019d have enough time to make her Power Suit fit her lower breasts better before she arrived.</span></div></div>",

These wings will be both large enough and strong enough to allow the user to fly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that was interesting. Having four arms might allow her to use multiple weapons at the same time. However, Samus was very intrigued by the potential of having wings. Sure, she probably wouldn\u2019t be able to fly while wearing her power suit, but that didn\u2019t really matter. She\u2019d be able to fly without any sort of assistance. That could open up all sorts of possibilities in combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich option did Samus choose?</span></div></div>",

Having a third leg might allow Samus to run a little bit faster, though she had no idea how a centre leg might look.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Samus spent a few minutes thinking over her choice, before finally reaching a decision. She selected the first option under the Legs category, causing the text to light up, and a new message appeared on the monitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>WARNING!</b><br>\r\nThis upgrade will result in permanent changes. Are you sure you wish to continue?<br>\r\n&lt;Yes&gt; <b>&lt;No&gt;</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus took a deep breath to steady herself, then tapped the screen to confirm her choice. Once she had confirmed her choice, the screen went blank, and a slot on the side of the terminal opened up. An upgrade chip popped out of the slot, and Samus took it gingerly. She connected the new chip to the Pear Upgrade, and swallowed nervously as she waited for the changes to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t have to wait long. Once again, she felt a strange grinding sensation in her groin as her hips slid apart to give her third leg room to grow. Samus grabbed the sides of the terminal to brace herself as her feet slid apart, then stopped. Even though her feet had stopped moving, the grinding sensation in her groin continued as her hip bones were reshaped by the upgrade. The grinding feeling stopped, and Samus braced herself for the next changes. There was a strange pulling in her groin, and Samus felt the fabric of her zero suit stretching as she felt a tingling between her legs. The tingling grew stronger as her new leg started growing, pulling the zero suit to its limit. Finally, the zero suit gave way, ripping open as her new leg continued to grow. Samus looked down at her new leg, and saw that the knee joint had just finished forming. Samus watched in morbid fascination as her new leg grew, forming the lower leg. She shivered when her new leg touched the cold metal floor with her newly formed and surprisingly sensitive ankle. Samus became more aware of the cold as her foot grew in, and watched as five toes slowly grew on her new foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was surprised at how fast her heart was beating, and took a few deep breaths to try and calm her heart rate. Now that she was sure the change was over, she let go of the terminal and straightened up. Keeping her three feet together, Samus bent her knees and lowered herself to the ground. Once she was seated, Samus placed her hands on her centre knee and straightened her left and right legs. As she had suspected, her centre leg also tried to straighten out, but Samus kept her grip on her centre knee, keeping it close to her chest. Samus used this opportunity to get a good look at her centre foot. Like her left and right feet, her new centre foot had five toes. However, unlike her left and right feet, her centre foot had two big toes, one on either side. She also had two index toes and a middle toe in the centre, between the two index toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Example image in link, NSFW: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://f3.to/mbap/images/extra/extra104.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://f3.to/mbap/images/extra/extra104.jpg</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she finished studying her new foot, Samus realised that she now had to get used to walking with three legs, rather than two. Samus brought her left and right feet back in line with her centre foot, and pushed herself up from the floor. She was able to stand up without toppling over, and steadied herself. Samus slowly took a step forward with her left foot, then her centre foot, then her right foot. She repeated this process a few times, getting used to moving her new leg, and noticed that it felt slightly unnatural. Admittedly, nothing about a human with three legs was natural, but that was besides the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus remembered how she\u2019d straightened her left and right legs simultaneously while keeping her centre leg bent when she was sitting down, and an idea began to form. She took a step forward with her left leg again, but this time, she took her next step with her right foot. This left her left and right legs in front of her centre leg. She then stepped forward with her centre leg, and began repeating the process. She quickly found her stride, stepping forward with her left and right legs simultaneously, then stepping forward with her centre leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this isn\u2019t so bad,\u201d Samus said to herself, feeling rather pleased with herself for adapting to her new leg so quickly. It was at this point that Samus remembered that her new leg had ripped through the zero suit when it had formed. She found her zero suit\u2019s upgrade slot, and pulled at the chips. Both chips came out easily, and once she had removed the two upgrades, she started removing the zero suit. She didn\u2019t particularly like being naked in this place, but she was the only person here, so she wasn\u2019t worried about being immodest. It took a few tries to get the zero suit off her outer legs, but she managed it. Once she was naked, she walked over to the nearby mirror and looked herself over. Looking at her naked reflection, she noticed that she appeared to have two vaginas now, one between her left and centre legs, and one between her centre and right legs. Samus glanced over her shoulder at her ass, and noticed that she also had three butt cheeks. That was interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she finished examining herself in the mirror, Samus began wondering what she should do next. She had only visited the main research hall so far. She could explore the station, maybe find a training hall of some sort to test out her new leg, or a machine that could modify her zero suit to fit her new body. Samus yawned suddenly, and realised that the transformation had tired her out somewhat, and left her rather hungry, now that she thought about it. It might be a good idea to just return to her ship and call it a day...</span></div></div>",

When he did, his jaw dropped at the sight of Samus and her huge rear. For a brief moment, his eyes were glued to her butt, but then he looked at her face.

They could get killed!\"<br>\r\nThe janitor stared at her for a minute. Then, he sighed and looked at her.<br>\r\n\"Lady, I'm a janitor. It's not my job to deal with all these upgrades. I just clean the place. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one with the Pear chip installed. No one gets an ass like that naturally.\" He said.<br>\r\nSamus's anger cooled down a fair bit. \"Fine.\" She said. \"I'm Samus Aran.\"<br>\r\n\"The famous bounty hunter?\" The janitor said. Then he grinned. \"Oh, sweet! I've heard of all your adventures. Huge fan. Name's Silas. Sanitation engineer, repairman and upgrade and chip expert.\"<br>\r\nSamus raised an eyebrow. \"How can you be an upgrade and chip expert if you're a janitor?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"Miss Aran, do you have any idea how important and huge this station is? Not everyone can be on it at once, so most of us pull double duty working with the upgrades. Even a lowly janitor like me has to be taught how they work.\" Silas replied.<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Samus said. She then gestured to her inflated butt. \"So can you explain this?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I assume the computer told you what it does. Or at least, what it's supposed to do. It was meant to make a pear-shaped barrier around the user. Meant for dangers that target the legs.\" Silas said. \"But it was buggy. R&amp;D found out that it actually inflates the users... erm... butt, and is almost impossible to remove. Thankfully, it got shelved before anyone could use it.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I found and used it,\" Samus replied, annoyed. \"Look at me. I can't go on missions like this.

Only a few extra inches were added, but it was still noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus turned back to Silas and grabbed him by the throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's going to keep happening.

Can't get any worse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the upgrade, Samus inserted the chip and waited for the changes. The first thing she notices was the change of texture for her skin; becoming tougher and more leathery, as well as taking on a grey color on her back and sides while also gaining a white color on her front. Her fingernails also grew long, black, claw-like nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFins began to grow on her limbs, starting first with her arms and legs, and then even a fin on her back. Suddenly, though, Samus began to feel a new weight; turning back, she saw that a tail was forming on her backside; albeit one as big as her new inflated behind. \"Great...\" Samus moaned as her features grew slightly longer and sharper, her teeth becoming fans, her ears becoming like fans, and gills forming on her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven her suit changed, splitting into two sections and becoming a lighter shade of orange similar to Samus' new molted color. Metal fins appeared around her organic ones, her arm cannon gaining claws, and a new metal portion covering her new tail. Finally, the armor shrunk, losing mass to allow Samus a better chance at swimming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a look in the mirror, Samus realized her suit had become more like a bikini, though sadly it left her buttocks very exposed despite the coverings. Her ponytail had come undone and now fell to her neck, while her gills always moved as she breathed. She didn't feel a shortness of breath, so she was sure this made her technically amphibian; a nice sign she wouldn't have to change her life too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does she feel about this all?</span></div></div>",

Shaking it a little, she turned back towards the computer and considered her options. Although she could only wonder what the Nurse Upgrade would do, receiving the ability to heal and medicate herself was a good option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteadying herself, Samus bit back her hesitation and pressed the button to receive her new upgrade. She watched as the chip came out and plopped gently into her hand. Taking into her gauntlet, she shoved it right in and waited for the effects to occur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer once sleek suit---which greatly enhanced her ass--twisted and curved. The fabric on Samus' arms began to recede, disappearing until it became a t-shirt sleeve, the fabric around her hands fading into a pair of white gloves, while her short sleeves loosened, becoming less skin tight and not clinging to her shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of her shirt loosened similarly, gaining a set of buttons running up the front, as it detached from her legs, lengthening slightly into a very short miniskirt, which did nothing to show off vast tracks of ass and panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fabric on her legs changed into a slightly transparent light blue pair of stocking, held up by a garter belt, while her shoes became blue high heels. Her enlarged thighs and calves seemed to almost break through the thin articles of clothing without actually breaking through them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n A stethoscope appeared and wrapped itself around her neck as her mini-skirted dress faded to a pale blue, finishing the change with a identically colored nurses cap appeared on her hair, a red cross on the front..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought my ass would shrink down to normal!\" Samus proclaimed as she saw her skimpy getup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, your upgrades combine, not necessarily cancel out.\" Silas replied. \"Thats why I asked you to take the more mundane upgrades, who knows what would've  happened if you'd tried to take the more prosaic ones?\"</span></div></div>",

She got them in an awkward half-cradle; her hands were too far apart to touch. They felt heavy, possibly enough to trap a normal person's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a small grunt, she lifted each cheek as much as she could. They came up to the small of her back. Her eyes widened a bit and she let go. A loud smack echoed throughout the room as her ass cheeks slapped her thighs. Her entire lower half rippled. It felt like it was her own skin, jiggling with what seemed to be body fat. The ripples lasted for several seconds. They gradually settled down, but Samus didn't expect them to last more than one or two seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What a strange upgrade,\" she mumbled, struggling some to turn around and face the mirror directly. Her over-sized lower half strongly clashed with her far more reasonably proportioned upper half. It was almost comical enough to make her laugh. She grimaced. \"How is this useful anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She assumed it was meant for defense. Perhaps the idea behind it was to provide extra protection in the event she lost her Power Suit. But in that case, why limit it to below the waist? Only smaller varieties of hostile lifeforms, or possibly a space pirate trying to incapacitate her, would aim there. Incredibly limited and situational, at best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Plus, why would it make her grow to such a ridiculous size? She could understand the upgrade requiring ample amounts of padding in order to be effective, but this? This was far too excessive. It slowed her down, made movement cumbersome, and worst of all, forced her to take up far too much space than acceptable. All in all, a poorly thought out upgrade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Samus looked to the computer, her lips pursed as she thought. \"It's useless on its own...\" She ran her hands down the sides of her hips. \"But if this place has been making upgrades nonstop, maybe it's made some to help improve this one.\" She looked down at her legs. After a moment, she sighed and began waddling over to the computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With the initial shock out of the way, it was much harder to ignore how troublesome walking was. Wider proportions meant Samus needed to swing her legs in far wider arcs to get them around each other. Extra weight meant it took more effort. It wasn't impossible for someone as fit as her; she could at least be thankful she hadn't lost her leg muscles in place of all the fat. But regardless, it took too much effort. Even someone as capable as her would tire out before long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It reminded her of the times she had to push her way through underwater areas without her Gravity Suit. A slow, awkward fight against heavy resistance that never got easier. The main difference, however, was that all of said resistance came from water pressure in the past, not her own body. Her Power Suit was also nowhere near as bulky as she was with this Pear upgrade. In that sense, it was actually worse than travelling underwater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Upon reaching the computer, she sighed with relief. \"Quite the workout,\" she said, wiping some sweat off her brow. Sitting down was a tempting idea, but she shook it off. \"Fix it now, rest later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The menu hadn't reset itself, thankfully. The Pear upgrade was still highlighted, though now the checkbox next to the name was checked off. A sub-list had opened up below it. While none of the items in this new list had anything specific in their names like \"Pear Add-On\" or anything similar, Samus assumed it was for upgrades that could work in tandem with hers. Still no option to display descriptions for them, though. Quite an odd oversight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Samus frowned at the first name on the sub-list. \"Mental augmentation?\" What did that mean? Would it give her the power to adjust her added mass with mental commands, or would it be more along the lines of altering her mind based on whatever upgrades she had in effect? The first possibility sounded pretty helpful, but if it ended up being the second one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She shook her head. Not worth the risk, at least not right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Next on the list was still a bit vaguely named, but less so. \"Self anti-gravity,\" Samus read aloud. It was compatible with her Zero Suit. Maybe it would take care of the weight problem. Shrugging, she selected the option and a chip identical to the last one popped out of the console. She studied it for a moment; no distinct features, aside from the \"SELF ANTI-GRAVITY\" label. Well, at least she'd know which is which. Not wanting to spend anymore time with her heavy legs--they were starting to feel sore--she put it in, right next to the Pear chip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Several seconds passed, then she felt a tingle below her waist. She looked over her shoulder. Her ass and thighs didn't shrink in the slightest. However, the taxing weight on her legs vanished, one pound at a time. After about a minute, it felt like she'd lost all the weight she gained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Allowing herself a small smile, she raised a foot in the air as high as she could manage. Not as flexible as she was normally, but at least she didn't have any extra weight to work against. She then put her foot down and walked in a circle a few times. There was a disconnect between her normal weight and the added mass, but at least it didn't feel like she was fighting through a thick liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So the Pear upgrade wasn't a complete hindrance anymore, which was certainly nice, but did that give it any utility?</span></div></div>",

She'd have to get some suit upgrades next before she started playing around again. She took the chip, and plugged it into her zero suit, waiting for the upgrade to take effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, Samus began to feel strangely lighter, presumably to do with the Balloon part of the name. After a few more moments, she realized that it was a certain section of her body that she feeling lighter, and looked down, only to find that she couldn't! Her breasts had swollen outwards, obscuring her view of her feet. There was a squeaking sound as the latex-like material of her suit rubbed together as she realized that it wasn't just her breasts that were becoming huge spheres, but her belly as protruding outwards as well, managing to be seen even past her head-sized breasts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt lightheaded as her belly grew to make her seem heavily pregnant, then past that until she couldn't even reach the sides when she tried to reach around, and yet it grew bigger still, making her seem like more of a blimp than a woman, easily almost as big as herself, and could have easily fit herself inside. It finally stopped growing, and as her melon sized globes of air rested upon it, Samus felt a stirring on her behind, and saw it similarly inflating, serving as a strangely light counterweight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, just when Samus thought it had ended, one final change happened, as Samus' face puffed up, her cheeks rounding as she gained a second chin, completing her perfectly round look. Samus took a few experimental steps, barely able to look over her jiggling breasts, but found herself strangely able to move at an average speed. She gave a quick squeeze to the sides of her belly, and rather than holding firm, it pushed in, filled with some strange gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took another few steps, and heard a strange clacking sound coming from her feet. She looked down, and found that her boots had some kind of platform heel to them, and a strangely heavy one at that. She looked back up, noting that she certainly looked like a human balloon, before seeing that the symbol on her zero suit had changed placing from the front of her breast to the side, glowing strangely. She gave it a touch, and gave a yelp of surprise as her heels retracted in, and she began to float upwards, flailing about as she tried to control her ascent. How did she feel?</span></div></div>",

Overall, Samus Aran, intergalactic Bounty Hunter, was vividly enjoying every passing moment and second of being a literal \"human balloon\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after exhaling out a light moan of pleasure, Samus soon lightly patted her puffed out belly a few times as she said, \"*giggle* Well, I'm certainly keeping this upgrade. For leisurely purposes, of course!\" From there, after deciding to voluntarily keep the Balloon upgrade, Samus slowly but carefully rose her rounded self from the ceiling, allowing her feet and bloated legs to touch the metal ceiling, especially due to Samus's newfound lack of center gravity or any sort of gravity whatsoever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, due to how bloated and almost rounded out her body had now become, Samus's puffy arms were somewhat forced out towards the rounded sides of her inflated frame, which certainly seemed a little awkward for the calm and collected bounty hunter, where she soon pondered to herself aloud as she said, \"*sigh*...Okay, now that I'm back on my own two feet, how exactly am I supposed to get down from the ceiling now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Samus quickly remembered the heavy platform heels on her boots, as she then tapped one of the shapes of the symbol on her Zero Suit on her rounded side to see if there was anything that could help her get down from the ceiling, which soon appeared in the form of...</span></div></div>",

Clearly each of the shapes that now made up the symbol on her Zero Suit did something, but she couldn't quite remember which one had toggled the heels, having been a bit preoccupied with adjusting to becoming a human balloon. While somewhat concerning by itself, she also now had to worry about the shape she'd pressed. If it wasn't the one that activated the heels that kept her grounded, what did it do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if in response to her question, Samus suddenly began to hear something odd. It was sort of a trickling sound, like water filling a cup. Had something in the station sprung a leak while she was here? Did she dislodge something when she landed on the ceiling? However, as she looked around to find the source of the noise, the sudden sloshing sound that accompanied the trickling alerted her that the source may be much closer than she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that water... inside of me?\" she pondered, placing a hand on her inflated belly. Slowly but surely, she began to feel heavier as the trickling emanated from her body, from her breasts, her stomach, her read, and even her puffy limbs and head. She could not only hear the water, she could feel it sloshing about with every movement she made. Before long, the water began to outweigh whatever gas she'd been filled with, and her feet left the ceiling. With a small gasp of surprise, Samus wiggled about in the air, doing her best to right herself so she'd be able to touch down on her feet, feeling the water shifting inside her as she slowly spun in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the water continued to fill every part of Samus that the upgrade had inflated, her descent began to grow faster, with more water to weigh her down and yet less gas to hold her up. As a result, Samus found herself unable to correctly orient herself before she reached the floor, landing on her rear with a resounding thud. Strangely, the impact didn't hurt at all, despite the speed at which she was falling by the end. It almost felt like jumping onto a water bed, only the bed was attached to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is... different.\" With a reasonable amount of effort, Samus managed to pull herself to her feet, feeling much heavier and more bloated than she did before, even before she'd installed the upgrade. The transition had completed by the time she hit the floor, all the gas within her being replaced with water. With no air pocket within her, the water wasn't audibly sloshing anymore, but she could still feel it shifting around as she moved, its weight dragging her along if she tried to move too quickly. Instead of feeling light and airy, as she had previously, she now felt heavy and bogged down. It wasn't entirely unpleasant, though, as the same novelty of being a human balloon still seemed to shine through to Samus, even if she was now a water balloon rather than one filled with helium or something similar. She pressed her hands into her stomach again, finding it to have less give than when she was inflated with air, but still clearly being more malleable than ordinary flesh. She was thankful that at the very least, she didn't seem to be as fragile as an actual balloon, ready to pop and spill her contents everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus hummed in thought as she looked down at the symbol on her Zero Suit again. Unlike with the heels, she remembered which shape of the symbol she pressed to replace her air with water. Pressing it again would presumably drain it out, leaving her light and buoyant again, floating back up to the ceiling again until she could find which shape activated her heels. Of course, now that she was on the ground, there was no need to immediately disengage her current form. Being filled with water was just as fine as being filled with air, surely. There was no harm in testing what the other shapes did while she was a water balloon, was there?</span></div></div>",

She could also hear the same trickling noise like a faucet being turned on. \"No, impossible, I'm being filled with MORE water? I'll be a blimp that can't move like that\" She said angrily. She loved being a balloon but there could be too much of a good thing.<br>\r\n  The thing was, she could hear trickling but she didn't see her belly or puffy hands growing. Instead the growth seemed to be focused on 2 areas, 2 that she wished weren't the ones picked. <br>\r\n  She looked down and saw that her water filled breasts were once again growing, expanding like bread in an oven as they filled with more water. The trickling turned to gushing as gallons were filling her breasts. \"Oh come on seriously? What pervert designed this?\" She said. Her breasts were becoming very heavy as they grew to the point of touching the floor. <br>\r\n  Around back Samus could feel a similar sensation in her blobby water filled butt. It was also growing as it gushed with more and more water, the cheeks wobbling like the water balloons they were as they grew and grew, becoming 2 giant beach balls. Samus could feel how heavy her breasts and butt now were and sat down, feeling the cushion of her beach ball buttcheeks as they flattened and spread with all the water in them. It was like Samus' own waterbed built into her body. Her breasts kept growing until they became as big as her torso and legs together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the growth stopped. Samus looked forward at her massive water filled mammaries. The 2 giant orbs sloshed with liquid as Samus pressed against their sides and squished them. She then shook them as they jiggled. They were like 2 storage tank water coolers. In fact her breasts grew so much that water was leaking from her nipples, making her suit wet. She then poked her butt, which was a pair of giant yoga balls with water now. Her chubby finger sank into the blob like flesh as she felt the water move. She took her finger out of the buttcheek and saw it jiggle, sloshing with liquid. Her backside in general seemed to slosh and jiggle with even the slightest movement from herself due to the sheer amount of gallons in her. Her butt was her own personal waterbed now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok....now what do I do..this function seems useless\" Samus said not liking looking like a sex object water balloon. It was impossible to move with these giant breasts and buttocks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at the array of buttons again. Deciding she didn't like this she pressed a button in hopes it would change things for the better...</span></div></div>",

Upon closer inspection, Samus realised that the symbol on her breast seemed to be made of several different shapes, and wasn't just a single button. She grumbled slightly, realising she should have paid closer attention when she first pressed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat closer inspection seemed to reveal something else, however. \"Am I... growing even larger?\" She could once again feel the same swelling and lightheadedness that had signalled the start of her initial transformation, only something was a little different this time. While her breasts certainly seemed to be swelling, the swelling felt like it was emanating from all over her body. Her limbs, which had only been made slightly puffy from the previous inflation, was well as her back and sides, which has been previously unaffected, all seemed to be feeling the same swelling. Though she could barely see over her large breasts, she could still look behind her, only to find that she not see her rear anymore! Her back had started to bulge out, and though it was not as large as her belly yet, it was quickly approaching that size. A pressure from below lifting her arms up made her realise the same was happening to her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...\" she mumbled. Though she wasn't quite there yet, she realised what was happening. Whereas the original Balloon Upgrade has turned her stomach, breasts, and rear into individual balloons, this button seemed to be turning her whole body into a single giant balloon. She couldn't see her rear, but she could tell her breasts were losing definition, sinking into her stomach to create a single rounded front. No doubt the same was happening at the back. This was not what she was hoping for. She needed to stop this before it was too late. There was only one problem, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't... reach. Damn.\" While her body had been rounding itself out, her limbs seemed to be puffing up as well. With her arm as puffy as it was, combined with how round her body had become, her hand could no longer reach the button that had activated it her attempts eliciting nothing but a squeaky noise as her parts rubbed against each other. The inflating was not done, however. Though her front, back, and sides had practically formed themselves into one giant ball at this point, Samus' body seemed to be growing still, the distinction between her body and limbs beginning to blur. Samus could do nothing but watch, distraught, as her limbs vanished inside her growing body, leaving nothing but her hands behind, unable to see the fate of her feet. And then, at last, the inflating seemed to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... this is awkward,\" Samus mumbled, a fair amount less joyous than she was when she was ascending to the ceiling. No longer was she a woman with ballooned body parts, she was a large, inflated ball, with a head, hands, and feet stuck to its sides. Not only did this not help her get down from the ceiling, even if she wasn't airbound, she'd still have trouble moving around, owing to her limbs being dwarfed within her bulbous body. \"How am I supposed to get down now?\" With her hands practically useless, there was no way she could press the symbol on her chest to deflate herself back down to what was considered normal for the Balloon Upgrade. The only reason she could move at all was because her feet were still pressed firmly on the ceiling. Perhaps she could bounce herself across the ceiling and press her chest against something up here, hopefully hitting the right shape. Of course, that was a very haphazard plan, and surely there must be another way. The facility still had an operational computer system that controlled the distribution of upgrades, perhaps it could control other things in the facility too? Maybe that could get her down, the scientists who made this facility must have had some way of sorting things out if they tested something by themselves.</span></div></div>",

While the computer system in this facility still worked, she had no way of knowing it could even accept voice commands, let alone find a way to get her down. No, she'd have to handle this herself, and right now, there was only really one way for her to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting her sights on some sort of antenna sticking out of the roof, Samus attempted to push off the ceiling with her feet. She rolled through the air, thankfully in the direction she wanted, before the gas inside her forced her back up onto the ceiling, this time landing on her stomach. After much wriggling through what little control she had left in her limbs, she finally managed to press a hand to the ceiling, and send herself rolling once more. Thankfully, her ballooned body was light enough that it didn't take too much force to get it moving. The entire process was frustrating, tiring, and disorienting, but she was making progress. Samus refused to give up, keeping her sights on her target as it drew closer and closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know how long she was up there on the ceiling, but eventually, Samus neared the antenna. It was but a single push away. As much as Samus had enjoyed her initial balloon form, this particular feature of the upgrade was far from desirable, and once deflated, she had a feeling she'd probably never be using it again. In future, she'd have to remember to be more careful about testing these things out, and make a note of which part of the shape on her breast activated which feature. Thankfully, she did remember which shape had made her spherical, but if that were all that was required, she would have already deflated herself by now. There would be no precise way for her to press the correct shape. She just need to slam herself into the antenna and hope for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, that's exactly what she did. With one final push, she sent her body careening into the antenna. She soon felt it digging into her breast, or at least where her breast once was. It was difficult to see with how round she'd become, but she was almost certain she landed with it right on the spot where the symbol was. Unfortunately, light as she may be, the sheer size of her body, and the force of the gas pulling upwards, was too much for the antenna to handle, and it snapped beneath her. For a second, Samus was worried she might have to make her trek across the ceiling a second time, but she soon felt something shifting inside her. She wasn't sure what was happening, but the antenna had definitely pressed hard enough to activate the symbol. Now all she could do was hope it was the right one.</span></div></div>",

In response, she exhaled a relieved sigh then quipped, \"*sigh* ...Well, at least it was a lucky guess, I suppose.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly afterwards, Samus felt her now plump feet touch the cold metal floor plating, which sent a minor shiver up the hardened Bounty Hunter's spine. \"...I guess this Balloon Upgrade also has made my sense of touch more acute than normal.\" She pondered, putting a calm but chubby-looking gloved hand upon her rather round middle, hearing a minute *squeak* upon gently rubbing the surface of her cobalt suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, it certainly didn't deter her from wanting to keep the Upgrade. For leisurely purposes, of course! And yet, as she calmly but carefully stood back up, Samus noticed that she now had more of a mild bounce in her step. At first, she didn't notice this as much, but whilst she casually waddled back toward the console, the mild bouncing became more noticeable. She soon stopped moving, only to examine this odd phenomenon, giving a few experimental hops in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped after the fourth hop, placing her rounded hands upon her wider hips in contemplation, looking just past her enlarged bosom and thought aloud, \"Huh. This...will take some getting used to.\" And with that, Samus brushed that thought to the side for the time being, as she made her way to the main holo-console. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith luck, there should be some form of instructions or manual guide to properly understand the mechanics of this weirdly erotic Upgrade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she made her way to the holo-console, Samus carefully maneuvered her somewhat puffy arms onto the holographic keyboard, whilst avoiding making any accidental physical contact with the symbols on the bosom of her now stretched Zero Suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, whilst she was concentrated on searching through the facility's research files, a part of her mind thought back to when she was in a completely spherical shape moments ago. It was undoubtedly strange and weird, to be rendered in such an abundantly bloated shape. However, she soon thought back to a...once happier time in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the tragedy that defined her had occurred, she remembered watching an old film on the holo-vid with her parents, some old movie from the Pre-Colony Era called \"Charlie &amp; The Chocolate Factory\". Sure, some parts of it she had forgotten about, but there was a certain scene that seemed to stick in her memory the longest; The scene where one of the characters, Violet Beauregard, ate some special candy that turned her into a living balloon full of...blueberry juice? Yeah, it was probably that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her mind seemed to contemplate some more on that experience. Sure, she wasn't as BIG as Violet was in the holo-vid, but she was certainly the same spherical shape as her in that moment on the ceiling. And yet, some part of Samus...actually \"enjoyed\" the sensation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't sure why, but...it felt rather comfy and relaxing the more she thought about. Just bouncing about like some sort of human-sized beachball. Maybe...maybe it wouldn't be so bad to take on that shape again in her downtime, as she subconsciously placed a tubby hand against the outermost curve of her bloated stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she was soon pulled back into the physical realm when a pair of beeping chirps sounded off, indicating that the processors had found the desired information. And well...it was extensive. Upon searching through the data shown before her, she was shown...</span></div></div>",

The pressure made Samus groaned in discomfort right before it made its way somewhere more personal on the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The heat's traveling near my..\" Samus observation was cut off by that particular area feeling extremely <i>well.</i> The bounty hunter's face began to turn read from the pleasure she felt caressing her groin. The sphere flipped on its axis from the force of the woman bucking her body to the best of her ability. Inside, the heat and wind power began to strengthen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This is so good~\"</i> If Samus were to be seen now, she'd had probably felt embarrassed.

A blue ball that was over nine feet in width hung in the air,bobbing slightly from a breeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt rumble for a brief moment and then...burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes. A loud burp erupted from one of the divots. The force of slowly began to push the ball across the ceiling, which soon transformed into the sphere flying like a cartoon balloon. It flew here and there and everywhere as the air escaped her body. Finally it seemed whatever was inside Samus had reached its end as what appeared to be a flat tarp hit the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugggh.\" The tarp groaned. Rising up from the pile was the blonde hair of Samus followed by the rest of the head. The bounty hunter raised her head to look over her flat body. It was like a deflated balloon blown up to large proportions. Rolling her eyes, Samus did a second scan of her body. This time she noticed that her limbs weren't visible.Worried,Samus thought of a way to reveal them.The bounty hunter tested her body, raising her right hand. In relative distance to her head, her hand seemed to be halfway across the world.She repeated the action again, this time with her left foot. And the same results played out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least i'm back down.\" Samus joked. \"And it seems that I can only raise my hands,feet, and head.</span></div></div>",

She didn't feel the same lightheadedness that had accompanied her inflation, so presumably she wasn't inflating any more than she already had. Her eyes locked to her body, she hoped what she was feeling was the gas escaping from her, but in the back of her mind, she couldn't help but feel like something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat feeling was forgetting as she noticed what was happening to her limbs. \"Yes!\" she all but shouted, watching was her limbs slowly began to regain definition. She wiggled her puffy arms as they reappeared out of the roundness of her body, and steadily began to grow less puffy as time went on. Slowly but surely, her body began to grow less round as the gas inside her continued to shift. However, it wasn't until Samus's limbs had shrunk down to around their normal size that she realised what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, this is isn't right!\" Her eyes were locked to a certain part of her body. With everything else seemed to be deflating, one part in particular was doing the opposite; it was growing even larger! She wasn't deflating, her body was just moving the gas somewhere else. Unsure of what would happen if she pressed a symbol while her body was in the middle of changing, and completely unsure of which symbol the antenna had pressed against, Samus could do nothing but watch as the rest of her body shrank back down to the size it was before installing the Balloon Upgrade, leaving one specific part filled with all the gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich body part was being inflated?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Slowly but surely, the shifting feeling faded, leaving Samus almost completely back to normal. She was no longer shaped like a ball, and even her stomach and rear, which the initial Balloon Upgrade installation had inflated, were back to their normal size. There was one part that clearly signified that the upgrade was still in effect, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus blushed, both out of anger and embarrassment, as she stared up at the ceiling, which her chest was pressed against. All the air in her body had shifted into her breasts. After pressing the symbol, her body had inflated to be as round as she was tall, and now all that air was concentrated into a single body part. The default upgrade had made her stomach large enough that it could likely have fit herself inside it, and now, she had two such spheres hanging from her chest, each just as big, if not bigger than her former belly. Perhaps \"hanging from\" wasn't the right way to put it, though. It would be more accurate to say she was hanging from them, her body dangling down as he chest stayed pressed to the ceiling. How this wasn't causing her any pain, Samus had no idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a loud sigh. \"I'm really going to have to be more careful about those symbols. This is just getting silly at this point.\" Thankfully for her, Samus found at even her breasts at such a large size, the symbols that had been altering her since installing the upgrade were still within her reach, sitting on the side of her chest, close enough that she could still press them without much issue. This prompted Samus to think about her next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, that's the symbol that turned me into a ball,\" she mumbled to herself, observing the symbols on her chest, She thankfully had enough sense to pay attention to which symbol she'd pressed last time, and remembered which it was. \"Although, that doesn't really help me get down.\" Presumably, pressing the symbol should deflate her chest until it only held enough gas for her original transformation. At least, that's what she hoped; for all she knew, it could turn her into an even larger ball now that there were parts uninflated again. Unfortunately, she didn't know which symbol would make her platform heels reactivate, nor which had shifted the gas into her breasts. She'd be guessing at random if she wanted to try and use either of those.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's guide to be a guide to this somewhere.\" Staring down towards the ground, Samus locked eyes on the computer. It had information regarding all the upgrades, surely it had information on which symbol did what. That'd be way less risky than trying to figure it out herself and potentially getting stuck somewhere along the way. She just needed to try and find a way down first, something that would prove rather difficult considering her chest was now the only part of her touching the ceiling.</span></div></div>",

It took her a second to realize where the sound was though: inside her literal balloon boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I...\" Samus started to ask, before she got her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel something filling up her boobs. And based on the fact that it sounded like a faucet, she guessed whatever that symbol did was replacing the air in her boobs with water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was doing this, Samus felt herself lowering a little bit. She assumed the water was acting as a counterweight now, and she was finally returning to the ground. As the water continued to fill up her breasts, she got lower faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she managed to get her feet back on the ground, and her boobs landed on the ground too. But they apparently weren't done filling with water, though. She could hear the sloshing in her boobs as they continued to fill, but eventually, that stopped as the water completely replaced the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with every inch of her boobs filled with water, Samus decided to try and pick up her massive bosom. This proved an issue since being filled to the absolutely brim, plus being so huge that the top of her boobs were level with her neck, made her bust incredibly heavy. After a few seconds, Samus gave up.<br>\r\n\"This was not well thought out.\" Samus muttered to herself, as she placed a hand on the side of her immense bust. Her boobs wobbled like a water bed, which she had to admit felt nice. Samus tried a different tactic, and pushed on her boobs. This worked better, as she actually got her bust to slide on the floor. Granted, she sank into her boobs as she pushed but it was better then being immobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter experiementing with movement for a bit, Samus looked at the symbols. She now knew which symbol was water, but the others were a mystery. She wanted to test them again to see if she could shrink down, but odds were likely it'd make things worse. After a moment, Samus decided...</span></div></div>",

She had already gone from being a big puffy balloon woman to a full on sphere to a woman with water balloon boobs. She didn't want to risk morphing her body even more and becoming some sort of combination of gassy balloon woman with water boob tanks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, these stupid things are heavy\" Samus said as she pushed her giant water filled breast balloons. Part of her wanted to get rid of this upgrade but another part thought maybe she could gain better control over it after going through the button combinations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squished the side of her left water breast. It pushed inward as that part of her body was made of rubber. She could feel the water inside of her shifting as she pushed, the surface of her boobs feeling squeaky and rubbery. Letting go of it her boob jiggled furiously as they jostled with the water in them. Her bosom was a big waterbed. It would have been a nice feeling if they weren't so heavy. She put both hands on the sides of her gigantic breasts. Shaking them she heard swishing and swirling noises as her breasts jiggled like the water balloons they were as they bounced left and right before returning to position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe it is sort of fun\" Samus said, unusually jovial over playing with her boobs. She had to admit they felt amazing, but the issue of movement was still there. Looking around she saw a chair. Dragging her heaving water bosom she headed to the chair. Finally arriving near it she sat down, taking a large load off her back. \"Now, how am i going to handle these\" she said slapping her water melons as they sloshed with the pool sized amount of water in them. She saw the buttons to the side of the balloon boobs. She recognized 3 of the 4 modes she had activated before. The left triangle button was for receding the water and filling her with gas making her a human shaped balloon woman again. The right was for the massive spherical balloon shape she took. As for whichever button made her boobs gas filled she didn't know as that was pressed with the broken antenna. The button for filling her breasts with water she recognized as the blue button next to the bottom triangle. Which one should she press?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand maybe she should ask the computer. Come to think of it why didn't she do that before. Mentally berating herself she came to a decision.... </span></div></div>",

After a few seconds, the computer replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Balloon upgrade does allow for quick switching between liquid and gaseous states, depending on the symbol pressed.\" The computer replied. \"The type of liquid and gas the user can be filled with can also be changed through usage of the menu. Currently know gases for Balloon upgrade include Helium, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen, and Neon. Currently known liquids for Balloon upgrade include water, soda, milk, acid, liquid nitrogen, and lava.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus just stared at the computer for a moment, absolutely stunned. \"Um, some of those sound like they could kill me if I switched to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Balloon upgrade user is completely immune to whatever they are filled with at the moment.\" The computer helpfully explained. \"Also, even if completely deflated, user will retain some elasticity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus nodded. That actually sounded incredibly useful. She then took a look at her gigantic bust, and turned back to the computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Computer, is there any way to make the Balloon upgrade easier to use?\" Samus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are currently two options to make the Balloon upgrade more user friendly.\" The computer said. \"First, the upgrade can be wired directly to the users brainwaves. This will allow the user to control the upgrade with their mental functions, rather then the symbols. However, the current state of the user will become their default state, so I suggest draining your bust before choosing this function.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus frowned at that. \"What is the other option?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The second option is to remove the upgrade, and place it in the nearby slot.\" The computer said, as a slot opened near Samus. \"After this is done, I can update and rewrite the chip to include more features, and an easier user interface. However, if you choose to do this, the chip must be removed immediately, and you will be stuck in your current state for the duration of the chips upgrading, which due to current faculties and equipment, is estimated to be a month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus went bug eyed. Her choices right now were to either get it tapped right into her brain, at the cost of having water filled boobs for the rest of her life, or getting the chip upgrade, at the cost of being stuck like this for a month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some mental debatting, Samus finally made her choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Computer, I choose to...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Samus contemplated her choices. Either she gets a user friendly upgrade to the balloon upgrade so she can modify herself easier at the cost of having balloon boob forever, or have balloon boobs for a month in order to better control the device afterwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm this is tough\" Samus said. She squished her balloon breasts' sides. They felt like rubber with water sloshing inside as the rest of her body was normal flesh and bone, which she can modify to become rubber like her breasts with a push of a button. With this upgrade she can change herself at will with easier control and probably modify the size of whatever will be balloonified of her like her breasts. However whatever form she was currently in would be her default one. She would never go back to being pure flesh and bone again, only someone who was rubber in one place all the time. She would have turned back into her default form...if she knew the button, which was the whole reason she wanted better controls in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought about it and decided she actually liked how she was now, big water balloon funbags and all. Perhaps a reduction in size would be in order first though. If she had to be a jiggly water balloon chested bimbo for the rest of her life she should at least make them manageable to carry around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Computer, i have made my decision\" Samus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have the upgrade chip wired to my brain\" she answered. \"But is there a way to make these water balloon breasts smaller first\" Samus asked..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The upgrade will allow you to modify your default form as long as nothing besides the size of the modified body feature is changed. After wiring this upgrade to your brain you may change the size of your breasts\" the computer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, excellent\" Samus said. \"Well, wire me up then\" she said confidently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Proceeding with balloon upgrade database upgrade. Connecting with host user: Samus Aran's, nervous system functions....connection to be complete in 5 minutes\" the computer said more robotically than before. As Samus felt the wiring working she felt a tingle inside her. She felt a reworking of her motor functions as she gained control over inflating and filling herself up with water and other fluids as new functions entered her brain with new additions to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Process complete. Upgrade interface made more suitable for host: Samus Aran . Current state is now default state\" the computer bleeped out. Samus woke up from her mental and physical change. The change in her nervous system had made her sleepy. She saw that she still had giant rubber water balloon boobs the size of her body. They jiggled as she pushed them inward from behind and pulled out her hands. Somehow they felt more genuine than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's see if this worked\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus concentrated on altering her default form. She focused on getting back to her normal form. What happened was her water breasts began to drain. She could feel and hear the water flushing out of her breasts. Where it was flushed she didn't know...but most likely into herself as her body is now different. As that happened her zero suit along with her balloon breasts shrunk. They receded upward into smaller and smaller balls of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Suddenly the draining stopped. Samus looked down and saw that her boobs were no longer body sized. They instead were the size of 2 yoga balls attached to her chest filled with water. She concentrated more to shrink them but they wouldn't drain any further. It looked like this was her default form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is me now huh\" Samus said. She cupped her giant liquid boobs. They squished and sloshed with water in them as they quivered when she let them go and they jiggled and bounced up and down. She looked at her hand. She morphed it from flesh and bone to an air filled fist balloon and inflated it. She tried to see how much air she could inflate it with. Her balloon hand grew bigger and bigger until it reached the ceiling. Obviously it could get that big if she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I think I like this\" Samus says squishing her water balloons together, feeling the squeeze of her rubber breasts and slosh of the water in them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered what to do now though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If she could work with the control buttons on her suit better she would go back to normal but she couldn't quite do that at the moment. This left her the other option; get a better control panel interface so she could easily change her balloon body back to normal at her whim. The issue was staying in whatever form she was in when taking out the chip to modify it for a month. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she didn't want to risk morphing her body into something worse and more uncomfortable like being a fully inflated water balloon woman with giant water filled boobs and a hot air filled butt (she dreaded the thought crossing her mind) and didn't want to be a water boob woman forever she went with option 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Computer, i would like to update the balloon upgrade interface\" Samus said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood Samus. Please remove chip and place it in the nearby slot for modification\" the computer said. As it finished saying it a small opening appeared on the console front. It had a line shaped slot that was roughly bigger than the small chip was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caution, chip must quickly be placed within slot after removal or modification will not work and current form will be permanent\" the computer said warning Samus. Samus kept it in mind and, heaving her gigantic water filled breasts with several pushes, made her way to the console. She squished her breasts from behind and pushed. \"Hnng umph\" she said as she pushed, her mondo water balloons dragging on the floor and sloshing as they moved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pant, pant, stupid balloon upgrade\" Samus said finally making her way to the console. Looking down at her left side she pressed the button on her chip slot and the chip came out, the buttons on her suit disappearing. immediately she put the chip in the slot. The slot closed, looking as if it was never there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chip installed into database, changes commencing, modification will take one earth month to complete. Please return on later date\" the computer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus looked down at her bust. \"Great, now I'm stuck with these for a month\" she said groaning. Pressing her hand in she felt the rubber latex of her suit, making her feel the sensitivity of her rubber breast as she felt her breast slosh with the water in it and feel hot as the water rubbed the inside of her breast. Her rubber nipples were being rubbed on the outside by the floor and from the inside from the water sloshing and hitting it. Samus felt warm as she was stimulated by her constantly sloshing breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, stupid balloons\" Samus said feeling the sensitivity of her boobs. They became more part of her in a sense as she removed the chip from herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving her hand from the back of her boob she felt something. Her hand felt strange. \"Huh\" Samus said curiously. She clenched her hand several times. Her fingers felt different. Not just solid and slender as usual but flexible and more squishy. She used her other hand to pull a finger. Surprisingly the finger stretched. Samus was shocked as the finger stretched more and more like rubber. Letting go the finger returned with a snap back into its position normal sized. It didn't even hurt. <br>\r\nShe then felt her face. Her cheek stretched as she pulled on in, lengthening like sticky goo. Her eye stretched with it as her vision got more wider with her face stretching. Letting go her face snapped back into place. \"Ow\" she said. That snap hurt as she blinked a few times to get vision back into her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I...entirely made of rubber now\"? Samus asked herself. She pulled her entire arm longer until it was in a long heap on the floor as long as a garden hose. she still felt her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Computer, what is the status of my body\" Samus asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samus Aran. Status, all internal organs functioning normally. Alteration of cells by recent upgrade has resulted in entire body compostion changing into mallable rubber, organs included\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus found herself intrigued by this. She then asked \"Is there any way to alter my form with this, perhaps redistribute this water\"?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Redistribution possible. Half of the water supply can be redistributed to inside of lower posterior. Other option include even distribution of water in whole body. Water cannot be removed in current state\" it said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus cursed under her breath at that statement. Her options were getting a ghetto jiggly booty of water or become a water balloon fully throughout her body.</span></div></div>",

In a fight, she could potentially inflate her stomach to block attacks, before rapidly inflating her arms to deal some serious damage.

The more she thought, the more she realized how useful this form could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she thought, though, another idea crossed her mind. She thought back to how strangely fun it was to just jiggle her massive boobs around, feeling the water inside them shift and sway. Her gargantuan boobs also felt so squishy and warm, despite being filled with probably cool water. And being so heavy, needing to exert real effort to move felt... strangely nice.

She waddled her feet and hands for a bit trying to get into a better position. Her body's expanse rolled with her movements, which caused Samus' some slight motion sickness. Finally, she angled down towards the computer. It was lucky for her in this mode that she didn't have to worry about any blood rushing towards her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\" She called out. \"Computer! I need you to get me down from her!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waited for a bit, worried that her command wasn't processed. Thankfully it seemed she was acknowledged as a beep followed by a voice chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Acknowledged.\" The voice stated and Samus could hear the sound of a pressured door opening. Her hope was quickly dashed as she saw a distinctively clawed hand begin to uncoil and slither upwards. A bead of sweat dripped down her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Computer! Subject is a balloon!\" She cried. The clawed hand stopped right before it pierced her body.The hand started it journey backwards, Samus watched wondering what would help bring her back down instead. What could only be described as a suction cup attached to a length of string popped out. Samus stared in utter bafflement as it shot forward and squarely nailed her in the head. She grunted in surprise,she had suffered worse hits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA creak emitted from the hole and surely but slowly did Samus come back towards the floor. The bounty hunter slowly formulated a plan to get her back to a slimmer shape. A bulb lit up over her head, Samus opened her mouth to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Computer, are you able to shrink a subject back down to size? If you are, shrink the current subject being reeled in to the smallest size of the balloon upgrade!\" Samus declared.</span></div></div>",

It went to the symbols on Samus's chest, and pressed one of them, though Samus couldn't see which one. Instantly, a pair of heavy heels activated, and the hand helped Samus's body to right itself. Soon, she was standing... sort of. With that done, the hand removed the suction cup from her head, and both retreated into the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm on the ground now.\" Samus said. \"I'm still a giant ball though, and it looks like the computer can't shrink me down.\" She looked around the room, and saw an antenna sticking out of the wall. \"Maybe I can use that to hit a symbol. Hopefully, it'll shrink me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but surely, Samus waddled over to the antenna, which luckily was level with the symbols.

A flight pack? An escape mode? What was this stupid thing meant for? The bounty hunter struggled in mid-air like,well...a balloon in the wind. Her face was a deep scarlet, which when on her puffed up head, appeared adorable rather than threatening. Being immobile was the very movement loving hunter's worst nightmare.And that was besides the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer whole body felt <i>tight</i>,but strangely erotically bothered. at the same time. Every clench of her hand, every move of her buttocks, every breath she took, did Samus feel a bit of her drip. It did nothing to lighten her mood,in fact in made her feel angrier. She could imagine the stares or mocking that someone would say behind her back if they found her like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd why did it grow her body, but made sure her suit was <i>just</i> the right amount of small that it constricted certain <i>areas,</i> It was as if this entire thing was made to make her feel embarrassed and horny. Wait, was this the entire upgrade's point? She wished she could reach the monitor to read off its purpose, but seeing as she was a floating ball at the second, the action seemed very far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing with her air filled legs, Samus went from floating on her inflated back to 'standing' on her legs. Standing be a stressed word,because she was currently doing it on the roof that is. Samus' thought was immediately drawn to getting herself out of this situation, so the best course of action was to her shoes back on.<br>\r\nBut now that she thought about, Samus forgot where the button was. She tried her best to look over her engorged curves,but that was a hassle. She moaned in frustration as she now realized she didn't know how to fix herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Wait, what are these buttons right here?\"</i> Samus thought, as she saw her once flat symbols now appearing to be somewhat 3-D.</span></div></div>",

The yellow lower torso of her suit went from pulling in to pushing out as her belly gained size, rounding out into a smooth metallic sphere, gaining enough additional metal to make another suit. The large chest plate on her suit lasted longer that her belly, eventually going from a flat plate to two round spheres, while her rear simply became rounder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her inflation complete, now a round ball of metal rather than sleek armor, a notification asked Samus if she was ready to deploy.

Her zero suit began to lose fabric at the shoulders, leaving her shoulders down to her breasts uncovered, exposing her cleavage and splitting the fabric on her arms into elbow high gloves. Her breasts swelled up, growing a size as her cleavage bulged out glaringly, while her hips flared out, giving her a very hourglass figure as her rear swelled to match. Finally, Samus shrunk a few inches, going from her tall figure to something much shorter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fabric on her arms grew thicker, changing color to white as they changed from skin-tight to a well-fitting glove, a ring of pink fabric at the end of her elbows. Her shoes followed suit as they too faded to white, a similar pink ring of loose fabric showing where her zero suit ended and her boots began as they became thigh high boots, the heel growing into a high-heel, giving back a few inches of her height. The toe of her boot gained a pink heart, as her zero suit managed to become even more skin-tight, becoming a shiny black as it became backless, while a pink heart with a white outline adorned her chest, folding down as it emphasized her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Samus's face began to change, her nose becoming smaller as her lips plumped up, while a layer of blue mascara adorned her eyelids, her eyelashes growing as a similar layer of eye shadow was applied. There were a few adjustments to her vocal chords, giving her a lower, more seductive tone to her voice. Two black wings began to sprout from her back, growing until they flared out the sides, and a small, stubby and pointy tail sprouted from right above her behind, matching the brown of her skin. Finally, Samus' ears disappeared from the sides of her head, while two silver-furred bat ears poked out of her hair on the top of her hair, twitching as they became Samus's source of hearing.

The fingers on her gauntlet grew thicker and longer, extending into long talons, the toes of her boots gaining similar long talons extending from the boot. She bent over and gave a slight grunt as her hips widened considerably, a short metal tail growing between the now very wide hips, although not to the extent of her previous upgrade, even with the metal of the suit. On her head, a thick leathery cap grew over her scalp and down to her nose resembling an armadillo, while her ears grew pointed and turned the same leathery color of the cap.

Next, her zero suit began to lose fabric, material disappearing from her shoulders and her upper thighs, what was left becoming thigh-high stockings and opera gloves. Her zero suit also lost fabric in a diamond shape from her navel to just above her breasts, showing off the sides of her breasts and her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus looked down and saw that the chill she felt on her skin had been from her skin fading to a pale blue colour, while a set of thorny black tattoos ran along the exposed skin of her legs.

Her hair grew longer, reaching just above her ass, as her eyelashes grew longer, her lips becoming fuller as the overall beauty of her face increased. The whites of her eyes became black as her bright blue irises became a dark red colour, giving her a very demonic appearance to match the rest of her. She felt a slight pain and bent over as a pair of bat-like wings grew out, fairly large, but not enough to allow flight, clawed at the tops and bottoms, while a long, spade tipped tail grew out, flicking idly unconsciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus ran to a mirror to examine her drastic changes, her high-heels making a clacking sound as she moved.

She pushed a lock of her long brown hair off of her glasses as she sighed to herself. She knew she shouldn't have stayed at that party for so long, and now the transport units were closed and she'd have to walk all the way around back home. The young woman sighed again at the thought, wishing she had brought something warmer than her t-shirt and jeans. She wished she wasn't a species that had to worry about the cold on this out of the way planet, and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey cutie. You lost?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around at the sound of a woman's voice, slightly lower and more sensual than anyone she recognised from the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's there?\" She said, looking around for the source of the voice. She heard the clicking of high-heels on the pavement as she saw a woman vaguely in the poor lighting of the alleyway, backing away slightly as she came into view, and she got a better look at her. It was some very well endowed woman, as the general lack of covering on her skimpy attire showed. Another thing she noticed was that while she appeared to be human, she was also blue, and had bat-like wings and a spade-tipped tail, something she had never seen before. Some kind of half-alien cross?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, she was getting closer to her, and for some reason, Larisa couldn't seem to force herself to back away any faster than a few steps. Unable to take her eyes off of her, she nervously answered her earlier question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no, and I'll, um, just be going now, I really need to\u2026\" She trailed off as the woman's tail brushed against her thigh, almost wrapping around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the rush? You don't need to go anywhere, you've got everything you need right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill unable to pull herself away, despite alarm bells now going off in her head, she continued to stammer and backed herself into a wall, the woman pressing herself against her, Larisa blushing profusely at the action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, miss, I just-\"</span></div></div>",

Two tiny horns pushed through her hair, as two similarly small wings sliced holes through the back of her shirt, while a spade-tipped tail snaked up from the constraints of her jeans, her hips trying to burst through her jeans as they widened, her breasts straining at her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of these changes weren't quite as large or noticeable as the woman, but that was the last thing on her mind as their lips finally parted, the confused and intimidated look on her face being replaced by one of pure adoration and lust. She looked down at herself, her tail flicking around as a look of glee went over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress, thank you, thank you! Just instruct me on how I can repay you, I'll do anything!\" She said to her mistress, who gave a seductive smile back at her. Samus felt satisfied at her latest servant, joining the ranks of her fast-growing army of adoring lesser succubi. She was her seventh tonight, and the night was still young and ripe for her taking. While she could of course do this much faster, she preferred to take her time with her little game before she recruited them, raising them to their proper status as her servants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, my pet, you can repay me by going back to your little party and just doing what comes naturally.\" She said, Larisa understanding exactly what to do. While they weren't nearly as strong or powerful as she was, anyone Samus converted shared her powers to a lesser extent, able to convert and multiply with a simple kiss.</span></div></div>",

Doing a field test ran the risk of the Succubus personality coming back, and right now that was the last thing she wanted. So she started to head down the corridor to the training room, the clack of her high-heels echoing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes (and several trips due to not being used to heels), Samus arrived at the training hall. It was big and empty, save for a small console for reconfiguring the room. Now it was time to test her new abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing that came to mind, obviously, were her new wings. They didn't look big enough for proper flight, but she guess that they might just be big enough for gliding. She turned to the console. The screen lit up and asked her to type in an exercise. After doing so, two very tall pillars rose from the floor, one taller then the other. The taller one also had a ladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing the ladder proved problematic. Her heels kept slipping and getting stuck on the rungs. Though eventually, she made it to the top. Looking over at the shorter pillar, she exhaled, spread her new wings, and jumped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her amazement, she actually began gliding. It was a bit slow, but she was actually gliding! Samus felt exhilerated. She manuvered herself to the shorter pillar, lined up... and slid onto the pillar belly first. Obviously, she'd have to work on landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour and some more practice, Samus was getting the hang of gliding. She practiced diving and pulling up, turns, and landings. Eventually, she felt like she'd had enough, and landed in front of the console. Typing, she got rid of the pillars. Now, she wondered what to test next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she could decide, she heard a voice. The voice came from...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I know a lot more than you think,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once, Samus was ready to combat her mental enemy again, until the Succubus surprisingly said, in an annoyed tone, \"Wait, wait, wait! Calm down!

One I think that'll make us both happy,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill a little wary, but feeling this might be better than constant fights, Samus replied, \"Okay... what's the deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Samus couldn't see it, she could feel the Succubus Personality smiling--though it was difficult to tell if it was beneficial or malicious. \"Alright, we both want this body, but before we fought over it. So... maybe, this time, we should just share it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, share it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah--you have some time where you're in control, then I switch over, and we go back and forth.

If you like someone but I don't, or I like someone but you don't, we leave that person alone. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, a girl needs to have standards. So I'll agree to that. Is that it?\" The Succubus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one more. There are some situations where I HAVE to stay in control, like a mission or if I'm speaking to the Federation. In those cases, I want you to wait until I'm done with those things before you take over. I have a reputation to uphold, and suddenly losing control to you could destroy that.\" Samus explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Succubus was silent for a second. \"Samus, I can see your memories. I see you're one of the greatest bounty hunters ever. I would never even think about hurting that reputation. So for that one, you don't even need to ask.\" She explained. \"So, does this mean you agree to my idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus nodded. \"I do.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Succubus grinned. \"Wonderful! I'm glad we could work something out. So, now that we're in agreement, I'd like to go for a test drive in your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was a little surprised. \"Already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Succubus chuckled. \"I can tell that you want to know just what your new body can do. So, why not watch a master at work? Don't worry, I'll try not to go too far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, why not... I'm sorry, do you have a name?\" Samus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... for simplicities sake, call me Leanan.\" The Succubus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Leanan. You can take over.\" Samus said. Suddenly, she felt like she was being pulled back. Then, she felt like she was floating. It took only a second to realize she was no longer in control. It felt weird. She could still see through her eyes, but couldn't control her body. She was just a passenger in her own body now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeanan, meanwhile, was now in full control. She ran her hands over her curves and grinned. \"Mmm.

While she was quite happy with her body and its potential, she had discovered that the computer was capable of combining upgrades, and she was extremely curious about the apparent compatibility with the Balloon upgrade. She took the chip and inserted it into her zero suit, or at least what was left of it after its modifications.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Samus began to feel strange. Her blue skin began to tingle, and felt different somehow. Samus looked down, and saw a slight shine on her cleavage, and headed over to the mirror to take a look at herself. When she looked, she noticed that her skin seemed to be shiner than usual, and increasingly so. Her skin went from merely blue to a fake looking light blue, her flawless skin losing all texture as it was replaced with a perfectly smooth layer, glossy and obviously fake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe layer appeared to be rubber, and seemed to give more than her regular skin as she pushed at it, her hands beginning to be affected by it, her opera gloves merging with her skin, the faint imprint of her fingernails underneath it disappearing as the line where the glove ended and her skin began faded, color being the only difference between the areas. Slightly alarmed at her change, Samus looked at her skin-baring leotard to see if the same thing had happened, and sighed in relief when she found that she could still remove it, although she found through her now regular sense of touch thanks to her technical lack of gloves, that it felt like the same rubbery material as her skin, although thicker and more shinier, more like latex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs however, weren't spared, as her thigh-high stockings melded with her skin as well, although she luckily found that her high-heels were left untouched when she bent over to remove them, a very faint squeaking sound of rubber-on-rubber being made by the action. She pulled one off, and found that her foes had merged together, her foot foot-shaped and fully functional, but much more suited to being under her shoes, which she slipped back on immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe examined her tail, mostly untouched, apart from the latex-like look and shine that had been added, and took a look at her wings, made of the same shiny rubber that her skin had, making it look much faker than normal, although no ability of flight had been stripped of it, since she wasn't capable of the act in the first place. She was still able to flap them, and had full control of her tail as normal, but when she moved, she felt very odd, and lighter somehow. She ran her hands across her horns, which had come out of the transformation completely untouched, and took a look at her face, changed along with the rest of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her rubbery skin, her face was somewhat odd, retaining full control over it despite the new material. However, her eyelashes and eyebrows seemed to be painted on, her eyelashes completely flat and unmoving as she blinked. Her lips were puffier and shiner than usual, gleaming as she rested them, and directed her attention to her hair. Her hair had ceased to be proper hair, as the long ponytail had merged into one shiny mass, lighter and more flowing than rest of her body, but still a single mass, her bangs and fringe staying in the same shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus made a few poses, having a look at herself and all her changes. All in all, she looked like a rubber version of herself. A very realistic rubber version, but still a rubber version. She wasn't particularly happy about it. Her looks had remained and she was a beautiful as ever, and she was sure there were a lot of people into her current look, but she felt like her seductive qualities had been reduced somewhat. If only she had gotten a bigger chest\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at that thought, there was a squeaking and stretching sound as her chest inflated, swelling until each breast was almost as big as her head, still as perfectly supported as before, giving her a very top-heavy look to her hourglass figure. Samus was surprised by this, but quickly imagined what she could do with it, and imagined her chest being just slightly smaller and rounder, her chest deflating and stretching to match. She gave a seductive smile at the thought of what she could do with an ability like this, and briefly thought of having enormous hips. On cue, her hips ballooned outwards to the same proportions, overshadowing her chest in terms of bulk as she quickly adjusted it back to a more manageable level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus adjusted her pose in the mirror one again on her enormously curvy body, starting to see the upsides of her change. As she idly appreciated her own form, the thought occurred to her that her stomach may also be adjustable, and she was left to try to suppress her rapidly swelling belly.</span></div></div>",

The sleeve of zero suit became longer, trailing outward until it became four or five meters long, and Samus was able to rest comfortably on it, like the Naga that was its namesake. The zero suit from her hips down began to become shinier, resembling scales, and Samus could no longer feel any sensation from the material of the zero suit, the suit merging with her skin into what was now the scales of her tail, looking exactly like a snake. On her lips, Samus felt a strange pressure, and found that two of her teeth had extended outwards into fangs, resting just past her lips. Her tongue also felt strange, and she was surprised at it darted out; long, thin and forked at the top, a snake's tongue. How did she feel?</span></div></div>",

At first, Samus played around with her serpentine tongue a bit, both as a form of entertainment and as a way of experimenting with her newfound senses. After all, if Samus was to be a Naga, the female bounty hunter had to get familiar with her additional senses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when Samus looked at newly formed snake tail, she noticed how long it was. From Samus's point of view, her Naga tail appeared to be around 10 to almost 12 feet long, as the yellow scales on the front of her tail were much larger than the rest of her scales, since each of the yellow scales were about the size of a baseball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, after looking at herself, Samus frowned a little and said, \"Even though I love being a Naga, I need to find a way to change my colors.\" Thankfully, there were two options for Samus.

Thankfully for her, one of the main computers connected to the AI Core wasn't that far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as a bonus, Samus can move faster in her new form as a Naga than her old bipedal form, due to her Chozo DNA mutating with her new form, her altered skeleton was still lightweight but now more durable than before. And it wasn't just her skeleton that was affected by her transformation into a Naga. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, the muscles on both her human half and her snake half were somewhat enhanced as well, all while still keeping her beauty. Originally, Samus could sprint at around 40 miles per hour and lift up over 600 pounds in we human form.

And how do know my name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, in an effort to ease the female bounty hunter, the AI spoke to Samus and answered, \"I greatly apologize for giving you a sense of unease, Samus Aran.

So basically, if Samus is actually going up a rogue Chozo AI, she is basically unarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as her serpentine-like eyes slowly scanned the large room, Samus noticed how advanced the equipment was within the research facility, as there were various keyboards and holographic monitors that contained different readouts of various upgrades. \"Wow.

While she remembered Ridley's attack on her colony and the death of her parents in vivid detail, most of her other memories from that time were foggy at best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a name?\" Samus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am the Chozo Artificial Intelligence Network,\" said the AI. \"I do not have a name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not using that mouthful every time I want your attention,\" said Samus, pausing briefly to think of a name. \"How about Cain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An acronym formed from Chozo Artificial Intelligence Network,\" said the AI. \"That is an acceptable designation. I am Cain, the artificial intelligence installed in this facility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Cain,\" said Samus. \"What can you tell me about the Naga upgrade?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Naga upgrade is designed to be compatible with the Zero Suit,\" said Cain. \"This upgrade is based on the Naga deities from the Hindu and Buddhist religions on Earth, where they were depicted with humanoid upper bodies and snakelike lower bodies. Other relevant information will be displayed on the main terminal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe terminal in front of Samus lit up as words filled the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see it,\" said Samus. \"Thanks, Cain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are welcome, Samus Aran,\" said Cain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus turned her attention to the screen in front of her and began reading. The first section didn't contain much she was interested in, mostly just detailing the inspiration and creative process of the Naga upgrade. The second section had a list of all the changes that had been made to her body by the upgrade, which was far more interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Naga upgrade's serpentine body is approximately 11 feet long (3.36 metres). As a result, Samus Aran's total length is 14 feet (4.27 metres), measuring from the top of her skull to the tip of her tail. The resultant new musculature adds approximately 250 pounds (113.4 kilograms) of mass. As a result, Samus Aran's total mass is 450 pounds (204.12 kilograms). The new musculature includes enhancements to Samus Aran's existing upper body, increasing the amount of mass Samus Aran can lift from approximately 600 pounds (272.15 kilograms) to 1 ton (2000 pounds, 907.18 kilograms). The serpentine body can also increase Samus Aran's top movement speed from approximately 40 miles per hour (64.37 kilometres per hour) to approximately 60 miles per hour (96.56 kilometres per hour).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Naga upgrade also affects Samus Aran's visual and olfactory senses. Samus Aran's eyes can now detect infrared light, allowing limited heat vision. However, in order to compensate, Samus Aran's eyes are now less capable of distinguishing between colours in the violet end of the visible light spectrum, and she will have difficulty telling the different between black and darker shades of blue. Samus Aran will also develop a forked tongue, which will periodically exit her mouth through a small divot in her upper lip. This forked tongue will collect airborne particles, which will be drawn into her mouth and analysed by a vomeronasal organ (Jacobson's organ), which will allow her to analyse tastes and smells, and can also be used directionally to a small degree. However, Samus Aran's nose will be less able to detect scents due to the changes made to her nasal structure to accommodate the vomeronasal organ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs humans are homeothermic, Samus Aran will be able to maintain a stable body temperature in most climates. However, due to her new ectothermic nature, Samus Aran will be adversely affected by low temperatures, which will cause her to become sluggish. At temperatures at or below 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius) Samus Aran's body will no longer be able to maintain a stable body temperature, and she will freeze to death.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus read through the information on the monitor carefully, taking note of the drawbacks to her new body that she hadn't noticed before. She also spotted a list of upgrades that were compatible with the Naga upgrade, though none of them seemed too interesting at the moment. A prompt at the bottom of the screen asked if she wished to download the information for future reference, and Samus accepted. The terminal saved the data and sent the file to her Power Suit, which was still where she had left it, back in the main research hall. When Samus realised that her Power Suit was back in the research hall, she remembered that she had wandered down here to ask the AI if it was possible to modify the Naga upgrade so that her new scales were a different colour. However, after reading through the information regarding the Naga upgrade, she was also wondering if she could combine the Naga upgrade with a second upgrade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cain?\" Samus said. \"I have a question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I help?\" the AI asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Samus ask?</span></div></div>",

Fortunately for the Naga bounty hunter, C.A.I.N soon gave Samus a definitive answer, as the A.I calmly explained, \"...Yes. There is an advanced Chozo DNA Synchronizer already installed and properly maintained here in this research facility. It will alter and configure some sections of the DNA coding to suit to your preferred specifications, Samus Aran.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, C.A.I.N. So, tell me: Where is this \"DNA Synchronizer\" then?\" Samus inquisitively said, just as C.A.I.N swiftly responded by shifting a drop pod-sized section of the floor, raising up what appeared to be a highly specialized set of machinery and medical equipment from the inner bowels of the derelict research facility. From there, C.A.I.N swiftly responded as it answered, \"It is already prepared for use, Samus Aran.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Samus calmly slithered her way toward the DNA Synchronizer machine itself, where she then approached the machine's primary console, as it silently whirred to life, revealing a holographic keyboard with the buttons in the Chozo alphabet. Fortunately for Samus, she could easily interpret and understand the entire Chozo language and it's entire alphabet, so this essentially came naturally to her, typing in the procedural commands \"Alter Appearance\", then \"Change Scale Color\", causing the machine to extend a mechanical arm out toward the serpentine Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, the mechanical arm began to perform a standard medical biometric scan upon her, thoroughly scanning every inch and ounce of Samus's Naga physique from head to tail and back for approximately two to three minutes. Of course, Samus patiently stood still until the biometric scan was complete, where I he machine's primary monitor then displayed a holographic outline of Samus's Naga form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the biometric scan said and done, Samus instinctively cracked her knuckles some as she said, \"...Alright, let's get to work.\" From there, Samus began to gently slide the multi-colored bars from left to right to see which colors she personally preferred for her Naga scales.

Suffice to say, she certainly seemed interested in this specific color scheme, as Samus calmly pressed a few buttons on the Chozo holographic keyboard in sequence, ultimately confirming her decision on the DNA Synchronizer machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, the machine whirred to life once more, as it then unclasped a medical gurney, which seemed to be large enough for someone of Samus's current size and serpentine physique, where Samus exhaled a deep sigh and said, \"...Well, here goes nothing, Samus.\" After that, she proceeded to slither toward the sloped medical gurney, carefully positioning herself onto the gurney's metallic surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she instinctively shivered upon making physical contact with the cold metallic surface of the gurney, due to her now being ectothermic, as Samus then spoke toward C.A.I.N and calmly ordered, \"*sigh*...C.A.I.N, begin the genetic sequence.\" \"Of course, Samus, Aran. Beginning Genetic Sequencing now...\" C.A.I.N bluntly replied, where it then autonomously activated the DNA Synchronizer's programming, causing six mechanical arms equipped with syringes full of genetic fluid to whir to life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, Samus was undoubtedly not going to like this part of the procedure, as she soon felt the syringe needles inject themselves into her serpentine lower half, causing her to let out a light grunt of pain, inadvertently crunching a part of the metallic gurney with her newfound enhanced strength, mildly gritting her teeth and serpentine fangs to stave off the enduring pain from the syringe needles impaling her snake half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, she soon felt the liquid inside the syringes entering her bloodstream, gently and deliberately altering her serpentine lower half, as Samus soon heard light crackling noises coming from her scales. Looking downward toward her lower half, Samus could easily see that the fluid was certainly doing it's job, as the yellow and blue scales on her snake half rapidly changed colors, transitioning into a Jade Green hue with yellow tiger stripes adorned throughout her serpentine lower half. Finally, after a few minutes have passed by, the mechanical syringe arms slowly pulled away from the Naga bounty hunter, indicating that they were finished with the procedure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Genetic Sequencing: Complete. Warning: I would advise extreme caution before standing up, Samus Aran.\" C.A.I.N flatly answered, advising Samus on not taking any sudden movements until she has fully recovered from the medical procedure. Of course, Samus felt sore as hell from the procedure, experiencing some difficulty standing upright on her serpentine tail whilst the fluid began to dissolve in her bloodstream and her muscles healing from being injected in various different areas on her serpentine half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually after a few minutes have passed, Samus soon felt reinvigorated from the procedure, where she then slithered toward a nearby mirror typing o get a better look at her new scales, striking a few poses at her reflection in the process. \"Hmph! Well, this had definitely proved to be most fruitful. Thanks, C.A.I.N!\" Samus confidently replied, as C.A.I.N swiftly answered, \"It is in my programming to serve, Samus Aran.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Samus began to contemplate on what to do next. She had a few choice ideas to choose from. The first idea that came to Samus's mind was to renovate and refurbish her signature ship to better accommodate for her genetically altered physique. After all, her ship didn't exactly seemed to be Naga-friendly when it came to it's design and interior. However, the next idea was to alter and refurbish her Varia Suit to accommodate for her newly acquired Naga physique. And finally, there was the temptation of seeing what other Upgrades she could use while in the research facility. In the end though, Samus eventually decided to go with...</span></div></div>",

She had become so enamoured with her new body that she had completely forgotten that it was, in reality, simply a power-up that had been installed into her Zero Suit. Samus picked at the blue fabric that covered her human upper body. She hadn\u2019t noticed it before, but her Zero Suit had been altered slightly by the Naga Upgrade as well. Her suit ended just before her scales in a belt, and the belt\u2019s buckle was her Zero Suit\u2019s upgrade slot. Her fingers traced the upgrade slot, and the Naga Upgrade held within. Was she really willing to become a Naga permanently? Maybe, now that she had changed her scale\u2019s colours to her liking, it would be a good idea to remove the Naga Upgrade from her Zero Suit and return to her original human form.</span></div></div>",

After all, the Chozo had modified her DNA so she could survive on Zebes and use the Varia Suit without hurting herself. Even so, that had still left her (mostly) human. She loved her new form, it was true, and while it was certainly useful, Samus wasn\u2019t willing to become a Naga permanently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed the Naga Upgrade chip and pulled it out of her Zero Suit\u2019s upgrade slot. Samus\u2019 tail felt strange, and she looked behind herself to see the jade green snake body shrinking behind her. Her tail continued shrinking until it reached the size her legs had been before the transformation. She then felt a pulling sensation on either side of her tail as her tail split into a pair of legs. The green scales retreated up her tail as her legs formed, and once her legs had finished reforming, the blue fabric of the Zero Suit slid down and covered her up. She felt her fangs slide up back into her mouth as they turned back into regular teeth, and her tongue stopped darting in and out of her mouth as it became a regular human tongue again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was back to normal, Samus took a step towards the Varia Suit. However, she\u2019d gotten so used to having a snake tail that she tripped over her own foot. Samus yelped in surprise as she tripped and fell on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright, Samus Aran?\u201d C.A.I.N asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine,\u201d said Samus, her words sounding a little slurred. \u201cJust getting used to having legs again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAffirmative,\u201d said C.A.I.N. \u201cDo you wish to cancel the Varia Suit modification?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, I was wondering,\u201d Samus said as she stood up. \u201cCould you make a second Varia Suit for me? One that I could use while in my Naga form?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAffirmative,\u201d said C.A.I.N. \u201cBe advised, Varia Suit construction for your Naga form will take at least one hour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Samus, nodding. \u201cDo you need me to go use the Naga upgrade while you\u2019re making the new suit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNegative,\u201d C.A.I.N said. \u201cThe biometric scan I performed earlier will suffice. Please return to the Varia and Zero Suit Modification Bay in one hour to receive your new Varia Suit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus nodded. She had an hour to kill before she got her new suit. When her new suit was finished, she\u2019d put the Naga Upgrade back into her Zero Suit and try out the Naga Varia Suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Samus do in the meantime?</span></div></div>",

She could remember the way back to the Upgrade Hall, and figured she could travel down there and try out some new upgrades, and possibly find upgrades that were compatible with the Naga Upgrade.

On one hand, there were much more pros than cons when it came to her newfound serpentine form, including seeing things in infrared, as well as enhanced speed and strength. But on the other hand however, C.A.I.N did say that if she didn't uninstall the Upgrade Chip from the Upgrade slot before removing her Zero Suit, there was an extremely high probability that she would be permanently a Naga for the rest of her life. Needless to say, this was undoubtedly a life-changing decision for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after weighing her available options, Samus uncharacteristically threw caution to the wind and decided to permanently install the Naga Upgrade, where she then calmly spoke toward the Chozo A.I and firmly said, \"C.A.I.N,  I need you to permanently install the Naga Upgrade.\" \"Are you absolutely sure you want to proceed with this decision, Samus Aran? There is a potential 4.57 percent chance of possible negative side effects during the genetic infusion and solidification.\" C.A.I.N bluntly asked, double checking to make sure if Samus's answer was not an instinctive response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's my final answer, C.A.I.N.\" Samus flatly answered, confirming what she wanted to the Chozo A.I, where C.A.I.N easily complied as it replied, \"...Understood, Samus Aran. Commencing permanent DNA Splicing and Infusion... Warning: The process itself might be...painful.\" Moments later, as C.A.I.N began the permanent transformation, Samus soon felt a noticeably sharp jolt of pain throughout her spinal column and serpentine lower half, causing her to relatively collapse onto the metallic floor in pain. Fortunately for her, the process itself was relatively brief, as only a few measly seconds had passed before the pain swiftly subsided, allowing Samus to collect herself from the floor, just as she then heard C.A.I.N speak as it said, \"DNA Infusion Sequence: Complete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after that, Samus managed to stand upright with her long serpentine tail, shrugging off the residue pain somewhat, as she thought aloud to herself and said, \"*sigh*...Well, that could've been much worse.\" \"Do you still want to continue with the Varia and Zero Suit modifications?\" C.A.I.N queried, wanting to know if Samus was still able and wanting to proceed with the modifications to both her Zero Suit and Varia Suit, just as Samus calmly discarded the scorched Naga Upgrade Chip from the upgrade slot, then spoke toward C.A.I.N and replied, \"Affirmative, C.A.I.N. Just merely recovering from a little bit of whiplash, nothing more.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, after Samus had gave it the all-clear,  C.A.I.N began to work on heavily modifying both Suits, starting off with...</span></div></div>",

As a result of the DNA Infusion Sequence, the lower half of the Zero Suit was destroyed, which also damaged the Naga Upgrade Chip.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like me to repair your current Zero Suit, or would you prefer a new Zero Suit?\u201d C.A.I.N asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d rather you repair the one I already have, thanks,\u201d said Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish, Samus Aran,\u201d said C.A.I.N. \u201cPlease remove your Zero Suit so I may begin repairs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d said Samus. She reached down to her hips and grabbed the torn hem of her Zero Suit. She easily pulled it up over her head, then pulled her arms out of the sleeves. A mechanical arm extended from the ceiling, and Samus, now naked, held her Zero Suit out towards the mechanical arm. The mechanical arm accepted the Zero Suit, and C.A.I.N used the mechanical arm to place the Zero Suit onto a table that had risen out of the floor. C.A.I.N laid the Zero Suit flat on the table, and after a brief scan of the Zero Suit, several mechanical arms extended from beneath the table and began repairing the Zero Suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile C.A.I.N was altering the Zero Suit, Samus decided to get a better look at her new Naga physique now that she was naked. Her tongue flicked in and out of her mouth lazily as she looked herself over. She found that her jade green scales, which had previously stopped at her hips, now continued up her hips and ended at her waist, leaving her belly and breasts uncovered. She ran a hand over her rear, but found no sign of her butt. Looking down at where her crotch used to be, she could see that she still had a vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC.A.I.N?\u201d Samus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Samus Aran?\u201d said the AI.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWere there any other changes made to my body when you permanently installed the Naga Upgrade?\u201d asked Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAffirmative,\u201d said C.A.I.N. \u201cYou now have a cloaca, rather than a vagina. Your cloaca is used for sexual reproduction and waste excretion. Additionally, you will now lay eggs, rather than give birth to live young.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Samus slowly. \u201cAnd why were these changes made?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese changes were made to maintain biological functionality, and were created during the early stages of the development of the Naga Upgrade,\u201d said C.A.I.N. \u201cAs the Naga Upgrade was never intended to be permanently installed, these changes were not implemented in the final design. However, when you expressed your desire for permanent installation, I implemented these changes during the DNA Infusion Sequence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Samus. \u201cSo am I more reptilian, or am I still a mammal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDue to having both mammalian and reptilian traits, you would be classified as a reptomammal,\u201d said C.A.I.N. \u201cYou are also the first and only member of the Naga species, unless you choose to reproduce.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, if I had any children, would they be Nagas as well?\u201d Samus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAffirmative,\u201d said C.A.I.N. \u201cDuring the DNA Infusion Sequence, I forced your genome to become dominant, meaning your offspring will always be female Nagas. However, if you wish to lay fertile eggs, you will need to mate with a male human first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand,\u201d said Samus. \u201cThanks, C.A.I.N.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are welcome, Samus Aran,\u201d said C.A.I.N. \u201cZero Suit modifications are complete. Beginning Varia Suit modifications.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus nodded, and slithered over to the table where her modified Zero Suit was. She picked it up, and noticed that the changes were minor, relatively speaking. The Zero Suit\u2019s colour was unchanged, and there was still a belt at her hips, which contained the Upgrade Slot. However, the Zero Suit continued down as a single sleeve to about where her knees would\u2019ve been if she was still human. She pulled the Zero Suit on over her head, and pushed her arms into the sleeves. Once she was dressed, she turned to see that C.A.I.N had removed the legs of her Varia Suit and was manufacturing armour plating for her serpentine body and tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVaria Suit modifications will be complete in approximately thirty minutes,\u201d said C.A.I.N.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus nodded. She was quite comfortable with her Naga physique, so she didn\u2019t see any need to explore her new body further. On the other hand, her ship had not been designed with her current body in mind, so she\u2019d need to renovate the interior. She was also curious about the other upgrades that were available in the Hall of Upgrades. There were presumably some upgrades compatible with the Naga Upgrade, as well as some that could be modified to work with her new form...</span></div></div>",

After about ten minutes of slithering, Samus reached the Hall of Upgrades. As she entered, she made her way over to the terminal.

The list on the left was much shorter, and Samus could only see six upgrades that would work with her new Naga form. The rest were incompatible, but Samus could use the new Human Upgrade first, then use a second upgrade with the Human Upgrade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Samus decide?</span></div></div>",

Once the chip was inserted, Samus felt a tingling throughout her tail. She looked over her shoulder, and saw the tip of her tail growing shorter as her tail was reduced in length. The fabric of her Zero Suit stretched down over her scales, covering her tail, which was growing shorter by the second. Samus felt a tugging sensation as her tail was pulled apart, splitting into two tails. Samus\u2019 two fabric-covered tails continued to grow shorter, until they were the length of her old legs. The bones in her tails began to change, as did the muscles and structure of her tails as they slowly transition into legs. The tips of her tails formed into feet, while the length of her tail straightened into proper legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her tails finished forming into legs, Samus took a few hesitant steps forward, getting used to walking again. She picked at the fabric of her Zero Suit, and she would swear that she could still feel scales underneath her Zero Suit. Samus walked over to the nearby mirror and looked herself over. At first glance, she looked like she had when she had first arrived, but Samus noticed that the Human Upgrade hadn\u2019t gotten rid of all the changes to Samus\u2019 body that had occurred when Samus had genetically altered herself into a Naga. Samus still had her reptilian eyes, and her fangs were still present, poking out of her mouth and resting on her lower lip. Not only that, but she had retained her forked tongue, which she noticed when it poked out of her mouth and tasted the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh,\u201d said Samus to herself. While she still preferred her new Naga body, the Human Upgrade wasn\u2019t too bad, especially if she found herself in a situation where a human body was more advantageous than a Naga body. Of course, she couldn\u2019t remove the Zero Suit while she was using the Human Upgrade. After all, that had been why she had the Naga Upgrade permanently installed in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus briefly pondered her next move. While there were plenty of upgrades that were compatible with the Human Upgrade, she wasn\u2019t all that interested in testing them, though that might change if she browsed the list. Still, maybe it would be best if she removed the Human Upgrade and tried a different upgrade that was compatible with her Naga form...</span></div></div>",

The upgrade chip popped out easily, and Samus began transforming back into a Naga. The fabric of her Zero Suit receded, pulling up her legs to about her knees, exposing the green scales on her legs. The legs of her Zero Suit formed into a single sleeve, pulling her legs together. As her legs touched, they merged together, forming a tail, which soon began growing. Samus\u2019 tail stretched out behind her as it grew, finally stopping when it was about eleven feet long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus hissed happily once her tail had finished forming, causing her forked tongue to flick out of her mouth.

The fabric on her arms parted from the shoulders, darkening into dark blue opera gloves, flaring slightly at the tips. The shoulders puffed up, and resembled a smaller version of her power suit's shoulders, while her neck went from skin-tight to a slightly ruffled collar. It became looser, and at her hips it grew outward, billowing into a skirt, and then into a floor-touching, circular dress, elaborately patterned and white on the tips with a darker layer of cloth at her hips. Under the dress, it filled with white fabric, while the material on her legs thinned into dark stocking as her shoes become high-heels, Samus unconsciously adjusting delicately. A large red brooch appeared on her chest, and her ears itched slightly as it was pierced, two large red ball earrings hanging off. Finally, a small gold, red jewel encrusted crown appeared on her head, giving her the final look of a princess. What happens next?</span></div></div>",

Her facial features softened as well, her nose shrinking slightly as her eyes widened, a bright and innocent look running through them as the changes finished.

She still had her Royalty upgrade activated, and had just spent the better part of an hour cheerfully examining herself and looking around the ship, too ditzy to remember what she should have been doing. After that, she had finally remembered the upgrades, and had decided it was a better idea to find something she thought would make her prettier. But as she had accessed the computer, still selected on the Royalty upgrade, she saw something called the Queen upgrade attached, listed as an expansion on the original. As such, she had clicked it without any second thought, and was currently taking the chip and trying to remember where to put it. After she finally found it, giving an shout of \"Yay!\" and a rush of giggling, she waited for the upgrade to take place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, Samus began to age , her face going from extremely youthful like a teenager, the wide-eyed, empty-headed and innocent look changing to one of experience and intelligence, while still being no older than her early thirties at best. Her hair began to gain volume, lengthening and widening down her back until it reached her hips. Her lips plumped up considerably, a heavy layer of red lipstick being applied, her eyelashes growing longer as heavy makeup was applied to the rest of her face. The resulting look was that while she would have been called a girl before, she could only be described as a woman, and treated with the dignity the term carried. Her breasts grew another size, while her hips widened considerably, her rear ballooning behind her, becoming obvious even under her dress. Her posture changed from an exited one to a relaxed and dignified one, clearly holding herself with respect and the expectation to be treated as such. Finally, her dress was given the least of the changes, merely growing to match her figure, and gaining more elaborate stitching and frills, as her tiny crown became much larger, taking up much of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe elegantly carried herself over to the mirror, swaying as she approached the reflective glass and appraised her new figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\u2026\" She said, observing herself. \"This would appear to far superior to that previous configuration.\" She gave a slight sigh as she remembered the air-headed actions of herself a few minutes ago.</span></div></div>",

While she was going to revert her upgrade previously, she found one last expansion to the Royalty series of upgrades, similar to how the Queen upgrade had applied to the original upgrade. She had been too curious as to how she could be improved even more, and her vanity would not give up the prospect of becoming even more perfect in her own eyes. As such, she took the upgrade from the machine and inserted it into her dresses hidden upgrade port, waiting patiently for the upgrade to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus began to age once again, although this time only a year or two, entering her early to mid-thirties at the peak of her beauty, while an arrogant and extremely confident light filled her eyes. Her breasts began to swell to even greater sizes, each one approaching the size of her head, straining through the perfectly tailored dress as it struggled to contain them. Her hips and rear ballooned outwards, pressing against her circular dress as she commanded an even larger amount of space in the room, while her much thicker thighs almost tore her stocking under her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to contain her at the sizes she had increased to, her dress began to grow outwards, fitting her breasts comfortably as the dress became much wider and back-heavy, her behind and hips visibly pressing against the mountainous fabric, even with the extensions to the material. With her new proportions contained, the dress began to change further to fit her new upgrade. The patterns on the dress became more elaborate and detailed, ribbons and folds appearing all over it as the frills on her dress became more detailed to match. Underneath her dress and just visible from outside, her high heels gained an inch in height, sharpening to stiletto heels as they merged with her stockings, becoming a pair of thigh-high boots made from an extremely soft material, the same dark blue as her stockings, widening to fit her considerably wide thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front of her high-neckline began to drop, receding down to bare the top half of her breasts, the deep cleavage being emphasized as the poofs on her shoulders became even larger, and the flared tips of her opera gloves growing longer to match. In the middle where her cleavage finally ended, the large round red broach that had previously adorned the top of her chest was placed, before morphing into a large and pointed red diamond broach. To fit this, the two similar round earrings she was wearing changed into diamond shapes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair of gold bracelets on her arms were joined by several more bracelets running up her arms, while the rings she was wearing were similarly joined by more rings, at least one on each finger and multiple of some, each encrusted with precious jewels that glittered on her hands. Her crown grew larger, higher, and much sharper, encrusted with more jewels as it comfortably sat there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair began to grow even longer, becoming thicker as her massive ponytail trailed down until it brushed the back of her dress at her feet, almost touching the ground as her bangs lowered slightly, the two locks of hair at its sides growing longer and thicker as well, while her hair as a whole took on a slightly shinier, softer, and more illustrious appearance to it. The band holding it became more solid, becoming a gold band with once again another large diamond attached to it. The mascara on her face became thicker, the eyeshadow darkening as her lipstick became a darker shade of red, her large lips plumping up even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her transformation finally complete, Samus strode confidently forward to the mirror, her hips swinging widely under her dress as she inspected herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm absolutely perfect!\" She declared, an arrogant tone to her voice. \"While my previous form was suitable enough, I find this to be much more fitting for my perfection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over to the computer, remembering that she still had to change back. She quickly ignored this thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I ever want to reduce myself to the level of that common sort?\" </span></div></div>",

While she had previously thought her body to be the pinnacle of beauty, it seemed that the Empress upgrade was compatible with the Balloon upgrade, and she figured that since the computer had made her even more perfect the last time, surely it would serve her another time, like all things should. She took the upgrade from the machine and inserted it into her upgrade slot, waiting for it to apply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen nothing immediately happened, Samus began to stride towards the mirror to examine herself, feeling her face begin to tingle. When she got to the mirror, she wasn't disappointed, as she watched her face begin to change, becoming even more beautiful in the process. Her lips once again plumped and puckered into the best size they could be, red lipstick once again layering it to emphasize their size, while her eyelashes gained another layer of mascara and grew long and fan-like, delicate in their added length. Her makeup piled on even more heavily, removing every faint trace of blemishes and correcting every mistake, looking like she spent hours in front of a mirror, carefully working at it until she was absolutely perfect. Her hair grew even longer, her luxurious mane draping almost to the floor as it became shinier and thicker, shining behind her in a smooth wave whenever she moved. A moment later, Samus' breasts grew even more, growing from their already massive size at bigger than her head to even larger, each one threatening each moment to burst out of her dress as her cleavage heaved even more. Her hips grew as well, each side pressing into the wide sides of her dress, leaving no room left over and emphasizing them even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus smiled at her reflection, and even more confident look going over her face. Her change had perfected her, and had stopped at the greatest possible time. Except, after a moment, she realized they hadn't, and that they were still going. Samus watched in horror as her changes went from beautiful to ridiculously overdone, going too far in every way. Her makeup applied layer after layer, becoming clownishly thick and garish, her eyelashes growing to almost an inch long and sticking straight out, Samus looking like she had twin black eyes from all the eye shadow and mascara being put on. Her breasts kept swelling, until she simply couldn't hold their weight anymore, almost falling over as they reached the size of watermelons, pitching her forward and bouncing wildly as the bra underneath her dress burst, while her hips began to for her dress upwards, Samus swinging wildly as she turned and stepped, her stiletto heels robbing her of any easy movement as each hip reached to be as wide as her body was before her changes. Samus fell to the floor, her enormous ass holding her up as she struggled to get to her feet, barely able to support the weight of her own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips ballooned out, her lower lip dropping from its sheer weight, making it difficult for Samus to move her mouth properly or talk at all, while the lipstick almost dripped from it, red as a clown's and twice as thick. The thin gold band holding her ponytail together snapped, Samus' hair dragging several feet along the floor behind her, almost as wide as she was. She looked at her reflection, all composure lost as she looked completely ridiculous, horrified at what she had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someboby geb dis ob me!\" Samus shrieked through her drooping lips, scrambling for the computer. </span></div></div>",

While she had managed to reverse the damage done by the Balloon combination, her ego hadn't quite recovered, and when she found that it was compatible with the Succubus upgrade she decided to try again, and took the upgrade from the machine, inserting it into the upgrade slot and waiting for the changes to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the wide and self-supporting circle of her dress collapsed, becoming thinner and losing the inner layers of white fabric inside, falling onto her legs as the material changed into a thinner, shinier silk, flowing down her legs as the upper half of her dress changed to match, the elaborate stitching and patterns becoming flatter to fit the new design. Her dress grew longer at the back, trailing on the floor behind her as on the front, a long slit along her dress from her hip down on the right opened up, parting to expose her thigh-high boot clad leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her shoulders, the huge spheres on her shoulders disappeared entirely, along with all of the material from her cleavage up, the dress supporting itself as her back was left exposed, while a large, gold, jewel encrusted choker appeared around her neck, a large purple diamond on display at the front. The flared tips of her opera gloves disappeared, leaving them flat where they ended, while the rest of her jewelry remained mostly intact, other than all of the blues gems flashing as they changed color to a dark purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the changes to her clothes complete, Samus patiently waited as her body began to change, a seductive and slightly malicious look going over her face as she stood. To start, Samus' hips began to become slightly thinner, still retaining her extremely bottom heavy look and huge thighs, but bringing her figure to a slightly more hourglassed one. On her waist and torso, aside from her breasts, her body began to become thinner, the slightly bulky dress at her previous proportions becoming much sleeker and thinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus' lips then began to shrink, reducing from the huge pout to a more refined slight smirk, a layer of black lipstick being placed over the previous red. The blue of her eyeshadow and makeup was replaced by the dark purple of her jewels, as the blue of her dress followed suit, darkening into purple. Her ankle-length hair gained and extra level of shine, flowing down her dress as Samus began to walk towards the mirror, her hips shaking seductively as she moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus reached the mirror, taking a look over herself as she adjusted her pose to emphasize her chest a little more. Her bulky dress had been replaced with a smoother, sleeker more evening gown-like dress, flowing along the floor behind her, having changed colors to purple, matching her darker makeup and jewelry, her dress showing off her legs and her particularly sharp stiletto heels. Up top she showed off much more of her chest than before, something she relished in her slightly adjusted mindset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\u2026 This is perfect! I can get anyone I want to do anything I want with this kind of body, just as I deserve\u2026\" Samus said, planning just how to use her new body to get everything she wanted, even more than she could get as an Empress\u2026 </span></div></div>",

She approached her ship and raised her hand, a small platform lowering to let her on. She stepped on, and the platform raised her into her ship, as a gentle female voice played from the intercom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back, my queen.\" It said as Samus began to walk down the ship's hallway. To fit her new queenly body, her ship had been remodel led to match. The floor was covered in an extremely fine and high-quality velvet-like fabric, while the walls were adorned by fine works of art, many of Samus herself, among the golden lights that kept the ship at an optimal lighting. Her dress brushing the floor slightly as her huge hips shook, Samus passed what was once a small and utilitarian room, now a large and finely detailed room, with a massive and elaborately detailed bed, many dressers and cupboards carrying a multitude of clothing, jewellery and makeup, the exercise room and gym having been removed to make room for her personal quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe medical bay and weapons rooms had been cleared for equally fancy personal dining room s and bathrooms, both of which Samus passed on her way to the bridge, which was rather now a room with a large and painstakingly decorated and patterned throne, which Samus carefully set herself down on, specially made to fit her generous dimensions. She set herself back comfortably while never dropping her regal and in control air, as she called for her computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Computer, set a course for K-2L.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, my queen.\"  The gentle voice of the AI responded as her ship began to undock from the satellite, still just as fast and heavily equipped as before, quickly leaving the satellite behind, along with her old life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, Samus was notified that she was approaching her home planet of K-2L, and the capitol of her empire. It was a highly populated and busy planet, generally regarded as the center of the galaxy for anyone in it. But more importantly for her right now, the place of her home, the futuristic castle she called home. She walked to the exiting platform as the ship brought itself into the heavily shielded docking bay, a small squadron of guards waiting for her as she landed and disembarked, elegantly walking up to the captain of the guards, each one of them being clad in orange power armor, the sign of her personal guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back, Queen Aran.\" The captain said, dropping to his knees and bowing to her. She motioned for him to rise, and kept walking, him and the rest of the guards following her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What events have occurred since my departure?\" Samus asked the captain, who quickly responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little, but the Jigradian ambassador has requested a meeting with you in three days to resume negotiations.\" Samus raised an eyebrow at the news, having thought that she had dealt with this weeks ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what news is there of the Space Pirates?\" She asked. It was a well-known fact in the new Galactic Empire that the queen had a deep hatred of the Space Pirates, and spent a great deal of her military power attempting to eradicate them.<br>\r\n\"We've managed to destroy their base on Zebes, but we haven't completely eliminated their Metroid weapon.\" The guard replied. Samus nodded, before the guard decided to voice his own concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My queen, as your personal guard, we would prefer it if you would not go off on your own like this again, or at least take a guard with you when you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My personal doings are none of your concern, captain.\" Samus said sternly. \"I am more than capable of handling myself.\" And with that, Samus left her guards, walking down the hallway to retire to her personal bedroom, content with her new position in life. </span></div></div>",

She'd never heard of something called that before, but she supposed that was the result of having the thing on random. She still couldn't get the thing off random, but she had found that there might be some kind of voice command system, and she was currently trying to get that working. But first, the upgrade. She took the chip, and inserted it into her zero suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first change came rather quickly, rather than gradually, and that was Samus' zero suit turning a dark red, and the legs fusing together. Samus slid down, leaning against a wall before her legs fully fused together, feeling the sensation of only one limb come back to her, as a wide fin appeared at the end, two small fins growing at her hips. Next was parts of her suit disappearing, such as over most of her front torso, and on the outside half of her arms, while her back remained mostly covered, patches here and there missing. Her modesty was protected by two strips running over the breasts, but she wished her suit had remained whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, her suit glittered into red scales, and the slight sensation of her suit was replaced by the strange sensation of having scales, the glittering material growing on her tail, merging with her arms as more fins sprouted along it, mostly clear webbing, which formed between Samus' fingers. Samus' fingers slipped on the floor, as she flopped onto her back, noticing that the floor was slick for some reason. In fact, most of the room was getting slightly steamy, whatever liquid there was in the air beginning to perspire on the walls. Samus then realized that the room was in fact very hot, and yet she felt completely normal despite the heat. She felt a piercing sensation as a set of small gills appeared on her neck, opening and closing as she breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the transformation complete and Samus laying there on the floor, she took a look at her scales and fins, running her hand along one of her arms. As such, she was somewhat surprised when the fins on her arms burst into flames. After a moment of panicked flailing, she realized that while her arm was on fire, she wasn't being hurt by it. She looked at her other arm and concentrated, willing it to ignite, which it quickly complied to.  She attempted this with the rest of the fins on her body, and she was quickly ablaze, not fearing the fire like she normally would.  She was pleasantly surprised that her hair didn't ignite as well, and when she ran her hand through it, it had a different, rougher texture to it, presumably the source of its fireproofing. How did she react?</span></div></div>",

The rest of her shirt loosened similarly, gaining a set of buttons running up the front, as it detached from her legs, lengthening slightly into a very short miniskirt, almost showing off the white underwear she had gained underneath. The fabric on her legs changed into a slightly transparent light blue pair of stocking, held up by a garter belt, while her shoes became blue high heels. A stethoscope appeared and wrapped itself around her neck as her mini-skirted dress faded to a pale blue, finishing the change with a identically colored nurses cap appeared on her hair, a red cross on the front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she change mentally?</span></div></div>",

She looked down at her arm, and gave it a quick flex, and was surprised by how much her muscle bulged back. In fact, her arm seemed thicker somehow. She turned it, and saw that her arm was indeed thicker, her biceps and triceps extremely muscular, instead of toned and slender as they normally were.  At this stage, the musculature was beginning to show through her suit, and walked over to the mirror, finding herself both much heavier and much stronger when she walked. She looked into the mirror, and saw that it wasn't just her arms that were bulking up, but the rest of her as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer abs were a rock-hard slab of muscle, and her thighs and calves were huge as well. Her breasts had grown a little to match the scale, but it wasn't what Samus was focusing on as she gave her arm and experimental squeeze, rock hard and refusing to give at all, with not a trace of loose fat.  She gave a quick look around the room, random crates and canisters lying around, and noticed that everything seemed smaller for some reason, looking back into the mirror to see that she was quickly growing taller! Normally standing at more than six feet, Samus was already tall, but she was quickly reaching nine feet, towering above any regular human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid she change mentally?</span></div></div>",

She spent another minute lifting more crates, eagerly showing off her strength unusually aggressively for her, if only to herself. Samus made a note to hold onto this one when she was done trying upgrades. Sure, it might be hard to get back into her power suit, but she was sure she could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could definitely get used to this kind of power!\" Samus said, her voice lower and in more of a growl as she began to search the station for something heavier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do now?</span></div></div>",

I'll be even stronger!\" she gloated in a voice that was already growing slightly deeper as the changes gradually took hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the Amazon upgrade, Samus' muscles were growing larger and more powerful, but at the same time, were losing their cut, toned shape, becoming bulkier and less defined. Even her impressive abs were hidden behind a round but firm belly that formed around her midsection. Despite her rapidly increasing strength, Samus was starting to feel burdened and sluggish, as if the weight of her own muscles was slowing her down, leaving her clumsy and graceless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her body wasn't the only thing becoming slower. Her mind began to change as well, becoming not only more aggressive but less intelligent, as not only information but capacity for reason and thought fled her mind. Samus groaned as her head began to hurt, her skull compressing in a few key spots, causing enough brain damage to leave her a simple minded specimen with no hope of regaining her former intellect. The upgrade also took the liberty of making the suit completely incompatible with any weapon more sophisticated than a club, its owner no longer intelligent or dexterous enough to operate advanced energy weaponry. As a final touch, the upgrade ramped up her libido to a ridiculous extent, making it difficult for her to focus on anything except her desires for sex and violence. \"I have to stop this...I...me...need a gud fuckin',\" Samus spat out in what was now a very deep, inarticulate voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth seemed to stop as Samus approached becoming twice as muscular as the Amazon upgrade had made her, but the changes in her body didn't stop there. She shot up another three feet in height, but instinctively adopted a sloppy, hunched over posture that brought her back down to about nine feet. Her shoulders grew wider, quickly becoming the defining feature of her already very broad frame, while her breasts vanished, her chest now dominated by bulging pecs. Her hands and feet swelled out of proportion as well, becoming huge and clumsy, her balled fists looking like wrecking balls. Her brow ridge lowered dramatically as her eyes dimmed and her nose and ears began to swell, giving her a brutish, animalistic appearance. Samus' skin became rougher, marked with countless scars, and her hair fell out of its ponytail, becoming messy and greasy, then shortening up to a very roughly cut chin length style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final changes hit the Zero Suit itself, causing it to lose most of its fabric, shortening into what resembled a wife beater and shorts combo. The new style fully exposed her monstrously large limbs, which were now coated in thick body hair along with Samus' armpits. It was clear now why this upgrade wasn't considered part of the Amazon series, having turned its user into more of a monster than a muscular beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe newly \"upgraded\" brute snorted, discarded her now useless paralyzer, and began wandering aimlessly.</span></div></div>",

Her feet pounded against the floor with each step she took, lightly shaking the discarded objects strewn about the facility. Her back hunched forward and her arms hung downwards in a neanderthal-like nature. Her hands were balled up into fists instinctively. The monstrous being had little sense of direction or care for where it was going. It simply kept walking. An idle hand reached towards one of her armpits as she continued down the hall. The armpit was covered in a tufted jungle of messy blonde hair, not unlike the patches of hair covering her arms and legs. Her rough, unkempt fingernails scratched the pit unhurriedly. She brought the hand to her face after a minute of scratching. Her hairy nostrils flared as she smelled the stinking scent coating her fingers. She stuck the two fingers into her mouth and continued unabashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hours of stomping around the facility aimlessly, the beast came across a room full of rows upon rows of small, unfamiliar objects. If the brute was intelligent enough, it would've realized it had just walked in a circle around the station and had returned to the upgrade area. It, of course, didn't realize this. As it began to return to walking, a loud noise echoed in the room. A glowing net wrapped itself quickly around the beast. Its gigantic body was sent plummeting to the floor with a deafening boom. A strange, green creature revealed itself, speaking in an alien tongue. (not that Samus understood English at this point anyhow) The monster struggled with its bindings, its muscles bulging as it strained itself to break free. The net covering the beast produced an electric shock as it continued to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother shock of electricity jolted through its body. Then another. The creature's struggles subsided as its genitals flared with a pleasurable sensation. Its hand desperately reached for its vagina, held back by constraints. The messy haired woman rubbed her legs together as she reached her climax. She became soaked in her own juices before finally losing consciousness. Dark smoke billowed from her shocked body. The alien hauled her unconscious body back to its ship.</span></div></div>",

A million thought ran through her head at once. She thought of mathmatical equations and scientific formulas, engineering feets and battle stratigies. Her brain continued to inflate like a balloon as her mind raced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually it ended. Samus looked in the mirror in amazement. Her facial area was still normal sized, but brain had grown, leaving her with a bald dome the size of a beach ball.

Since she hadn't found many yet, Samus was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be a power suit upgrade, and quickly inserted it into her suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus waited a moment, and her suit glowed brilliantly, turning almost white in a brilliant shine, before ending abruptly, leaving Samus without any armor, and for some reason completely naked, missing her zero suit. Samus looked around her bare body for what had happened to her suit, feeling a strange weight in her chest, much heavier than usual. After a quick inspection of her body turning up clean, Samus noticed that her skin had a very shiny, almost rubber-like quality to it. She also felt strangely light for some reason, and saw a blue tinge go over her skin, spreading quickly over the rest of her body, her skin becoming smoother and even shinier. Samus held up her arm to see what had happened, and gasped in surprise as she saw through her hand! Her arm had gone transparent, the blue color turning deeper and richer as it took on a goo-like appearance, the rest of her body following suit. Samus began to run towards the mirror, but found her steps short, and the room seemed to get larger every time. Samus looked down, and saw that her legs were melting into a puddle of slime! The melting reached her waist, and Samus flailed about, trying to move as she slowly melted into just a puddle of slime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, after Samus had calmed down from the process of melting and realized that she could still see, tried to move her eyes around, her field of vision sliding around the puddle. She realized that she still had control over what was now her body, and imagined herself as she was before, fully human and normal. Her body began to from together, rising up to form one mass, shaped like on Samus Aran. Having regained the use of her limbs, Samus took a wavering step forward, her foot slipping apart as she desperately willed it to stay together, and took another, slowly getting used to the odd feeling of her slime body, and made it over to the mirror, her body becoming more and more cohesive with each passing moment. She looked at herself in the mirror, and examined her changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was made of a bright blue shiny gel, slightly transparent, and every one of her features was smooth and blue. Her face was arranged and looked the same as before, but when she opened her mouth she lacked a throat past her mouth, and her eyes were simply an indentation that looked like them, despite still being where she could see. Her genitalia were gone, smooth orbs and lines where they used to be, making her appearance naked, but not indecent. On the back of her head her gel had arranged itself to look like her hair, one blob that acted like a very stuck together form of her ponytail.  But in her chest, she found the source of her heavy feeling. A small glowing orange core shone from her chest, seeming to be where her armor went, and what kept her cohesive and together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus tried to manipulate her body, sprouting an extra arm and controlling it perfectly, reducing herself to a puddle and back, stretching and compressing into various shapes, manipulating the general shape of her body. The only limitation seemed to be that her core needed to remain in contact with the rest of her, and she was unable to move it out of her slime anyway. She also found that she didn't need to concentrate to hold her human shape, it seeming to have set itself as her default shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026\" Samus said, what was her mouth flapping uselessly. \"\u2026!\" Samus attempted to yell, still entirely silent, lacking any vocal chords or anything to form the sound.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026!\" She attempted to yell again, trying to figure out how to form vocal chords and lungs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hmm\u2026\" Samus thought to herself. She would have said it to herself, but she couldn't talk ever since she got stuck in that Gel upgrade. She was currently trying to figure out a way to get off the satellite, and since it didn't look like she was going to change back any time soon, get a hold of her new slime body. Rather than walking, she melted the bottom half of her legs and flowed across the floor in the puddle over to a room with a bunch of empty canisters and containers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing she had had problems with was holding onto things, which had been a problem with controlling her ship, hence why she was still stuck on the abandoned satellite. Most of the time, anything she tried to pick up just fell through her, but she was holding onto them for longer and longer each time, and she had hope that she could hold things properly soon. She slid over to the pile of cans that she had amassed, shoving them over into a pile using brute force. They ranged from the size of her hand to the size of buckets, and there were plenty to make a clattering sound when she dropped them. Samus brought herself back into her humanoid form, bending over to pick one up. The can began to sink through her hands, but she quickly pulled it close to her chest to keep it steady, holding it there for just a second, almost holding it\u2026 Before silently cursing as it slid through her grasp and into the area that appeared to be her stomach, floating there for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus wordlessly sighed, preparing to expel it from her body, when she found that it seemed to be dissolving quickly in her body, her orange core glowing brighter than usual. Normally she would have removed it anyway, but she found that the tingling feeling that she got from it was\u2026 Kind of nice. The tingling feeling disappeared quickly as the can dissolved completely, and Samus found herself wanting to experience it again. She picked up another small can and shoved it into herself before she dropped it, the dissolving and tingling starting up again, and ending as quickly as it started. Samus was beginning to enjoy herself, and wondered what she looked like when her body was removing the cans from her. She decided to find out, and formed her body into an indistinct mass, pushing the pile of cans rather loudly over to the mirror, not minding the one or two that fell into the thick gel and disappeared quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus reached the mirror, forming herself back into her human form and picking up another canister, pushing it into herself and watching her reflection as her core glowed and it disappeared. She noticed at the back of her mind that the small can seemed to be a little smaller than usual, but she put it out of her mind as she shoved another can into her, ignoring the thoughts that this might be a little addicting. Samus found that when she put more into her, the tingling of the removal process got stronger, and quickly started to pile the can into her, disregarding the shape and size of them as she wordlessly sighed and moaned in pleasure, not noticing an additional effect of the removal process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Samus' high finally ended as she found that she was out of metal to consume, and gave herself a minute to recover. While that had been wonderful, maybe it had been a bit overboard\u2026 Wait, what was that in the mirror? Samus turned herself around somewhat slower than usual to look at herself in the mirror, and her mouth opened in a gasp at what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it was possible for a heap of slime to look like an obese woman, Samus had managed it. Apparently, the removal process converted the materials into gel and added it to Samus' body, and with her mind focused on keeping her human form, she had grown\u2026 Outwards. Her belly was huge and rolled with waves of slime, while her breasts were huge and her hips impossibly wide, with thighs to match. Her face had rounded with a second chin and wide face, and Samus was very surprised by the whole look. After she had gotten over her shock at her bigger body, she remembered that she had complete control over her body, and could just restore herself to her regular state. She reduced herself to a puddle, and built herself back up to her regular human shaped body. This time, she also found a slightly different change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the excess gel having to go somewhere, she was now almost double her normal size, towering over the room, approaching the roof, even at its high altitude. Samus was shocked at the change, her orange core appearing tiny around her huge body. She didn't know how to deal with it, until she remembered the wonderful feeling she got from the process that got her bigger. And besides, it wasn't like she really had anything to lose, did she? She didn't bother pretending to rationalize herself any further as she walked over a large metal crate, oozing over it with little regard for whatever could have been inside, her body growing as it dissolved inside her. Now even bigger than before, Samus realized that she just couldn't get enough of the feeling, and that she was going to run out of things to consume soon. She decided to focus her efforts on regaining control of her ship. After all, it was a big galaxy, and there was plenty of unwanted things for her to eat\u2026 </span></div></div>",

Samus silently sighed before she noticed how filthy her ship was, empty ammo canisters and broken armor relics everywhere. Her gel mind slipping off, Samus made her way to the cans and 'chowed down' so to speak. Her body began to grow and grow even more with the intake until a part of her dripped inside her ship. From this, Samus' pleasure addled mind formed a plan and kept eating. Her body began to seep into the ship and all over it. By the time Samus was done, her body had a hold on the entire ship.

There was another reason for the decision as well, one Samus wasn't even conscious of at the time. But as she sped off towards the planet, she read more about it in her computer systems. The planet was named Chysak, a recently settled world on the boundaries of Galactic Federation control. The settlers had build a single colony, and the environment was varied around the planet, not unlike Earth. The area around the colony, that was named the same thing as the planet it was on, was dry and desert-like, with the settlers farming all the things they needed. They were a self-sufficient, stoic bunch, apparently, who chose this planet for the freedom it would give them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, Samus send them a message once in-orbit, so as not to surprise them.

Samus wasted no time in that either, happy to finally be able to indulge in this body\u2019s specific needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Samus hadn\u2019t really noticed was that, at the time she left the ship, she\u2019d absorbed enough matter to be a giant gel glob big enough to barely fit inside a swimming pool. In no time at all, she started growing past that, absorbing the boulders and rocks around her. It felt different than Samus had expected, as everything else she\u2019d absorbed before had been artificial things from a ship, but the resulting dissolving as the mass become more of her, more goo, felt just as good. Mindlessly, Samus roamed the canyon doing what she\u2019d come to this planet to do: eat.</span></div></div>",

It was a native form of life, a local herbivore not unlike one of Earth\u2019s squirrels, and it found the large blue creature very interesting, something totally new to this planet. Sadly for the animal, Samus shifted her body to move in a different direction, and in the process the creature was brought into her body, where it quickly dissolved and was added to her mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis event immediately caught Samus\u2019s attention: this feeling was something new. What had she just absorbed? It had been small, but it had tasted...better, somehow. The feeling it gave her upon assimilation more rich and textural. Then, she felt new memories in her mind: that of the entire little animal\u2019s life, from birth to sudden unexpected death. It didn\u2019t quite feel like Samus had lived it all herself, but she could view any potion as an outside observer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe...had eaten a living thing, swallowed it whole and killed it. The thought was a little disconcerting. It made her new body feel more monstrous. But she had to ask herself, was this really any different? After all, it was just a small, non-sapient animal. Samus had eaten meat when she\u2019d had to, killed for it even when necessary to survive. Of course, she hadn\u2019t needed that to survive in this case, but who really cared? Plus, she could use the animal\u2019s memories to find the location of where more of them lived.

Seeing what was coming, the small animals went into the deepest part of their home, hoping it would protect them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did not. Samus was easily able to seep that far underground, and within minutes she\u2019d absorbed and digested every single one of the animals in the nest, more than three dozen of the creatures. They didn\u2019t add much mass to Samus, but they did bring her that extra-special sensation she\u2019d had before, and give her access to their combined memories. Samus knew now how much she enjoyed absorbing living things, and she wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through their memories, she quickly found something more exciting to try eating: another local herbivore, but one that was more than twenty feet tall, a mammalian creature with scaled flesh and a bulky body. Even with her immense size, something like that would be a challenge, but Samus couldn\u2019t deny that the idea of how much larger she\u2019d become from eating them was exciting. But then, she saw something else in a memory: a human colonist lived nearby, in a small shack, all on his lonesome.

Eventually, they designated doomed planets, ones set to slowly fall into their stars, as places to store all the trash. It was a lot safer than going close to the stars themselves, after all.

Even now, she had a feeling she'd have trouble piloting her ship as big as she was. Perhaps there was a way for her to become smaller?

As her core slowly rose up out of the puddle, cloaked in a mass of gel, it seemed she might have succeeded. \"Perfect,\" Samus thought to herself, looking over her body and finding it to look exactly like it did when she had first activated the upgrade, before absorbing all those cans. Well, almost exactly. The extra mass she had gained was still there, just not on her body at the moment. Instead, she was standing in the middle of a large puddle of slime, the slime that formed the rest of her body. There was enough slime still in the puddle to form a second copy of her, and maybe even a little more after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, the big question,\" Samus thought, her mouth flapping open and closed uselessly as she did so, \"Can I separate myself from the puddle?\" If she could separate herself from the puddle, then Samus could essentially get rid off the excess mass she had gained from the things she absorbed, leaving her back at her normal size, and able to get on with trying to get back in control of her ship. She slowly moved towards the edge of the puddle, feeling the gel of her feet connecting with and separating from the puddle with every step she made. She eventually got to the edge of the puddle, one foot standing on dry ground, the other still on the puddle. \"Here goes nothing.\" Samus lifted her foot, hoping it would separate from the puddle, leaving her excess mass behind.</span></div></div>",

Perhaps it was the lack of a core? That was where her consciousness seemed to be, so perhaps the lack of one prevented her clone from doing anything. Although if that was the case, she wasn't really sure what she could do about that, seeing as she didn't have a second core to give the clone. Or perhaps it wasn't a separate being at all? The gel that made up the clone had come from her own body, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to test her theory, Samus thought about raising the clone's arm, as if it were her own. Much to her surprise, the clone complied with her thought, holding its arm up in the air. Samus thought about lowering the arm, and the clone let its arm drop to its side again. That settled it. Despite it no longer being attached to her main body, it was clear the excess gel, and the clone it had created, was still a part of her. It had probably reshaped into a copy of her because of how hard she'd focused on trying to keep her normal shape and size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of experimentation, Samus found that although she could control her clone, she couldn't give it vague commands like \"walk\" or \"follow\" and had to explicitly control it like controlling a limb, making it difficult to control her clone and herself at the same time. In addition, while she could shift her point of view to anywhere on her body, she couldn't see through her clone's eyes unless she was actually touching it. She'd also tried shifting her core from her own body into the clone, and back again, finding that whichever body the core was in was easiest to control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was sure that with enough practice, she'd be able to get the hang to controlling two bodies at once, and it would be a great help if/when she managed to leave, but that would also require getting better at actually holding things, what she'd been practicing when this whole mess with absorbing the cans started.</span></div></div>",

That done, she focused on once again making herself form into her original human form, without being morbidly obese or a giantess. Her core quickly rose up, pulling slime with it that soon formed into her humanoid body. However, she was still standing within a large puddle of slime that she needed to use somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm,\u201d Samus thought as she looked over her shoulder at the light blue slime that spread out from her feet, then looked back at her reflection. A few ideas came to mind on how she could use up some of the excess gel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was to use the gel to increase her height. She knew it was possible, since she\u2019d done it before, but that had caused her to grow over twelve feet tall. She had no desire to be that big, but maybe growing to seven or eight feet in height wouldn\u2019t be too bad. That would still leave a lot of excess gel, but it would hopefully be easier to move the excess around if she used some of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second idea was to increase her musculature. That would essentially be the same as taking on her obese form, but by converting the excess slime into muscles instead of fat, it would be more useful. At least, she hoped so. Maybe being a muscular slime would make it easier to manipulate things... or it might simply alter her appearance, leaving her just as unable to move objects as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third idea was to turn the slime into extra body parts. Maybe she could add an extra pair of arms, or a second head. She could even try something truly bizarre, like a pair of wings, or a tail. However, if she did that, she\u2019d need to figure out how to adjust to her new body plan. There was also no way of telling how much slime she\u2019d need to use to form the additional body parts, or how many body parts she\u2019d need to create to use up all the excess slime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Samus decide to do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While she considered her options, Samus realised that she could potentially try all her ideas at once. After all, there was enough slime to essentially create herself a second body, so she had plenty of material to work with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus focused, and felt gel flowing up through her legs and into her sides. She held her arms out as lumps began to form under her armpits. The lumps elongated into tentacles, slowly growing out to the length of her original arms. Once the tentacles had finished growing, Samus focused on the shape of the tentacles. The appearance of muscles formed as the tentacles were shaped into arms, and five little nubs on the end of the tentacle grew out into fingers. Soon, Samus had a second pair of arms, directly below her original pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus spent a few moments moving her lower arms around, adjusting to the new sensations. She raised and lowered her new pair of arms, holding them out in front of her, then moving them from side to side. It didn\u2019t take her long to get used to her second pair of arms, although she did notice that her upper and lower arms could occasionally stick together if she wasn\u2019t careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was satisfied with how her lower arms felt, Samus looked down at the puddle of herself that she was still standing in. While she had used a surprising amount to give herself a second pair of arms, Samus could still feel a lot more gel spreading out from her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus folded her lower arms across her chest as she placed her upper hands on her hips and looked up at her reflection. She then began pulling more gel into her body, making sure to keep her proportions the same as she grew. Samus slowly felt herself rising as she felt slime flowing into her feet and up into her body. She watched as her reflection slowly grew taller and taller, soon reaching seven feet. Samus pulled more gel into herself, shooting up a few more inches, finally stopping when she was about eight feet tall. She had grown almost two feet in height, but had used up a significant amount of slime to do so. However, Samus knew that she still had about a quarter of her slime still floating around her feet, so it was time to use that up as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus pulled the remaining slime into herself, and watched as her body immediately plumped out. While her new height and extra arms meant that she didn\u2019t look morbidly obese, she still clearly appeared overweight, so it was time to fix that. Samus began moving the excess slime around her body, evening out her appearance. All four of her arms grew thicker with muscle, as did her legs. Her shoulders bulged out, and her abs grew hard and defined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she had used up all of the excess slime, Samus took stock of herself. She was now a four-armed Amazon, eight feet tall with muscles a bodybuilder would kill for. However, she was still made of slime, and Samus could tell that she was still going to have trouble manipulating objects. After all that effort, she was still stuck here, and she still needed to practise holding objects without absorbing them. That was what had gotten her into this mess to begin with, though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Samus stared at her new reflection, her eyes travelled down to her chest. Her core was visible through the slime, the orange glow muted by the blue gel that composed her body. That core was the central part of her being now, and simply couldn\u2019t be removed from her slime. After all, the core was all that remained of her Power Suit... the Power Suit she\u2019d inserted the Gel Upgrade into...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, I\u2019m such an idiot,\u201d Samus groaned, smacking her forehead with her upper right hand, causing her surface to ripple where she hit herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe core contained the Gel Upgrade! If she could somehow use her core to shut off the Gel Upgrade and reactivate her Power Suit, she should be able to get out of her current predicament!</span></div></div>",

She could feel her core floating inside her, pulsing with life as it maintained her gelatinous form. Samus moved her slime over the core, trying to get a feel for the surface of the object that sustained her. As she did so, she ran her gel over some sort of small ridge. Curious, Samus pushed a small bit of slime into the ridge. As she did so, Samus felt the slime she pushed into the ridge being sucked into the core!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes snapped wide open as she gasped. Her core started glowing brightly as the sucking sensation inside her chest grew stronger and stronger. Her body started to twist and distort as more and more gel was pulled into the core. Samus\u2019 vision twisted wildly as her head started being sucked in, her slime being pulled in faster and faster with each passing second. Everything went dark as the core quickly sucked in the last few drops of slime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all of Samus\u2019 slime inside the core, the metal ball hovered in the air for a few seconds, then beeped once. The bright glow faded, and the orange metal ball fell to the floor, lifeless. After resting on the floor for a few seconds, the core rolled over to one side, then began glowing again. The core expanded in size, growing arms and legs as it transformed back into Samus\u2019 Power Suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, the core had finished changing back into the Power Suit. The Power Suit lay motionless for several seconds, then shook with a full-body twitch as Samus regained awareness. She breathed heavily as her eyes darted around wildly, trying to figure out what the hell just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she calmed down, Samus quickly took stock of herself. She was lying on the floor, staring up at the ceiling. However, instead of being a puddle of slime, she was now back in her human form, dressed in her Power Suit. Something didn\u2019t quite feel right, though. Maybe that was just because she was solid again. After all, she\u2019d been using the Gel Upgrade for some time, and the shift back to solidity had been quite sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus groaned, and sat up. As she lifted her helmeted head, she caught sight of her reflection in the mirror and saw...</span></div></div>",

Once she had gained enough control to very slowly use the computer without collapsing the appropriate limb into a blob, she had discovered that the Gel upgrade was apparently compatible with the Balloon upgrade. It wasn't like she had anything to lose, and she was curious as to how it would turn out. She took the upgrade chip from the machine, and let it float through her body towards her core, activating the upgrade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Samus felt\u2026 Strange. Like she was lighter, which was particularly strange considering she was a mass of gel formed into the shape of a human. She looked down to see her core floating down from her chest to where her stomach would normally be, and noticed that she seemed a little more transparent than usual. Then, once the core settled, she began to feel odd. Normally she could feel where all of her gel was, but her gel seemed to be moving, even when she wasn't using it. She looked back down to see that the gel that formed her breasts seemed to be getting a little larger. She tried to reduce the size, but found herself unable to, and saw that her breasts seemed to be hollow, rather than solid slime. She poked it, and found that her hand went straight through, some kind of air pocket inside pushing her gel outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her slime breasts kept growing, she felt a pressure in her abdominal area, and saw what she would call her belly being pushed out at an even faster rate! At the size of looking pregnant at full term, she was beginning to feel lighter, and also noticed that what she had formed into her rear end also had two pockets of air growing, although even slower than her breasts. Samus tried forming back into a puddle of slime, but found herself just formed into an inflated ball, unable to move, and formed back into her human shape. She tried to take a few steps, but by then her breasts were almost the size of her head, and her belly was approaching a half-meter long!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe again tried to take another step, but this time her feet didn't reach the ground, as she started to float up into the air, pulled up by her breasts and belly. She flailed around, trying to bring herself back down, but she didn't have enough cohesion in her slime to gain any kind of movement, and was reduced to hanging back as she floated towards the room at an increased speed, her expanding areas swelling even more. After almost a minute, she bumped into the roof, her arms and legs unable to reach it themselves past the expanse of her air-filled belly, and she felt an increasing amount of pressure on the roof as she squeezed against it, until she felt ready to burst. And then her belly grew too big to support her increasingly thin layer of gel, and she did, splattering onto the floor in a puddle of slime, her core bouncing a couple of times before settling into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus slowly pulled herself together, forming herself back into her human form, her human features slowly being defined as she concentrated. Her core settled back in her belly, and she silently sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm glad that's over.\" She thought to herself, before she looked down and saw her belly poke past her breasts. </span></div></div>",

Her chest area pushed up her breasts as the material disappeared in a V-shape down her breasts, exposing her cleavage and pushing it up, emphasizing it and putting it on display. Her arms were left bare, except for two white cuffs that appeared on her wrists, a part sticking out the side, with a button adorning each. Samus rubbed her wrists together at the sensation of them forming, before unconsciously falling back into a pose that pushed her chest out. The fabric around her legs darkened to a darker shade of blue, before becoming slightly transparent as they became fishnet stockings, riding up to and covering her ass, while the fabric of her suit softened to a silky material. Around her neck a white collar formed,  a blue bow tie around it. On her feet, her heeled tapered out into stilettos, Samus adjusting her footing to match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before Samus began to walk to the mirror to inspect her changes, her hips began to expand out, while her breasts swelled a size, her clothes only growing just enough to contain them, looking ready to burst out and bouncing as she moved. A small hole was made in her suit as a fluffy white ball tail poked out, growing bigger until it was plainly noticeable. On her head, a pair of thin white ears poked out of her scalp, growing larger until they flopped over, now full sized bunny ears adorning her head. Samus went deaf for a moment as her hearing left her human ears, now cosmetic as her hearing was relocated to her new bunny ears. Her lips grew fuller and went into a slight pout as a layer of light blue lipstick was applied, identically colored makeup going over her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she change mentally?</span></div></div>",

The boot on her feet disappeared, her toes tingling as the fabric wrapped around them. The tingling grew more intense as her toes grew longer,  her toes merging together into three large ones, equal in size and long in length.  The heel of her feet lengthened as her foot re-jointed itself, making it had to stand on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hips were massive as Samus almost fell forward, holding her hands upright to maintain her balance as she looked down at her lower body, almost disproportionally sized on her otherwise slim frame, Samus struggling to remain upright as it seemed to favor a posture on all fours. She felt a familiar tingling on her hands, turning her head to look at them as her fingers grew slightly longer, her fingers merging together to form three large ones and an equally sized thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus made the mistake of moving her hands to look at them, and toppled over, unable to keep herself up on her oddly jointed feet.

The most natural-feeling position for her right now was down on all fours, with her rear stuck up in the air. It was honestly a little embarrassing, not helped by her behind having increased in size. She couldn't really go around doing missions on all fours. Not to mention, since the upgrade was for the Zero Suit, her Power suit hadn't changed to accomodate her larger legs, hands and feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, th-\" Samus started saying, before her tongue spilled out of her mouth again. That was another problem she had with this upgrade. She could hardly speak without her incredibly long tongue getting in the way. How would that be helpful to her? Real frogs frogs could use their tongues to catch insects to eat, but she certainly didn't want to go eating bugs. Perhaps she could use it as an alternative to her grapple beam, but she could only imagine how terrible some of the things she'd be grappling would taste. She decided to just shove it back into her mouth, not liking having it flopping about everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, the only real upside Samus saw from this upgrade were teh same things that would make it difficult to put on her Power Suit; her legs. Although they now prevented her from standing upright, they seemed to be a lot stronger now, strong enough to let you leap several feet into the air. Still, it was a pretty measly upside considering it meant she was stuck walking on all fours and having a tongue that practically prevented her from speaking. Although it had been interesting to try out, Samus knew didn't like this upgrade, and wouldn't be keeping it. She walked over to the main computer again, ready to take out the chip and turn back to normal.</span></div></div>",

A pair of blue cat ears grew from the top of her head, strangely the same blue as her suit.

Nothing really new to Samus, who gave an experimental flick to her new tail. She looked over her striped suit, not really surprised by any of her changes. Until her suit began to turn invisible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus began to turn invisible, seeing through herself as she looked down at her rapidly disappearing arms, bringing them together, feeling them even if she couldn't see them. Her torso disappeared as she ran to the mirror, just a floating head by the time she got there. Her head faded away as well, her lips the last to go. She imagined herself as visible again, quickly fading back into sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she change mentally?</span></div></div>",

She took the chip from the machine and plugged it into her zero suit, and waited for the change to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Samus' chest began to swell up, growing a few sizes while her hips widened out, her waist becoming thinner, giving her the hourglass figure that the name suggested. Samus was used to something like this by now, and walked over to the mirror, hips swaying and breasts jiggling on her frame. She looked over herself, noticing that her hips and breasts, while not huge, her breasts still smaller than her head, they were also equally wide, matching the width of each other perfectly when she stood straight. Nothing too notable, and Samus gave a quick sigh. She wished they could go back a minute and pick something a little different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Samus' view went completely white, a strange sound of sand sifting going through her ears as she felt the sensation of falling, and as quickly as it started, it ended. Samus swayed as she regained her footing, and looked around, wondering what had happened. When she looked around, she had to stifle a gasp as she saw herself, looking through the upgrades to choose one! Samus wondered what was going on, and remembered what she had wished for before. She thought for a moment, and experimentally wished it were a couple of hours ago. Her vision went white again and the sound of sand and the feeling of falling began, lasting a second longer this time, before she fell back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus shook her head to dispel the tingling in her head, and heard distant snoring coming from another room. It looked like her theory was correct, and she had traveled back in time! It appeared to be during her nap. Samus wondered if she should go and mess with the computer or wake herself up, although she quickly put those down as a bad idea. She didn't want to end up causing a time paradox over her curiosity. She decided to try to go back further, and wished it were a day ago. The feelings quickly began, and Samus felt like it was going much longer this time, before she came back down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly walked over to the black screen of the computer, displaying only a readout of the date, which Samus quickly confirmed to be the day before. She caught a glimpse of her reflection on the screen, and noticed that her breasts seemed to be a little bigger. She quickly walked over to the mirror, noting that her breasts definitely seemed to be jiggling a little more, and examined herself. Her suspicion was confirmed as she saw that her breasts were a bit bigger, each nearly the size of her head now. She looked at her lower half, and also saw that her hips were a little thinner now, still generously wide, but not quite as much as before. Samus supposed it was like an hourglass, with time going into the top half as she went back, apparently represented by her mammary glands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus thought about what she could do with her new power, getting slightly giddy at the possibilities, and wished that it were a year ago, long before she had ever even heard of the satellite. She fell into the white void of before, falling for what seemed like an eternity, but was only a couple of minutes, before she hit reality once again. She quickly rushed over to the computer, and was slightly disappointed to see that she had only traveled back a month. She supposed she had to have limited, and noticed in her peripheral vision that her chest seemed to be heaving, even when she looking slightly upwards. She looked down, and was completely unable to see the ground below her, massive breasts the size of melons obstructing her view. They heaved and jiggled just from her breathing, and bounced up and down as she walked over the mirror. After she had gotten over how huge her breasts were, she saw that her hips were basically non-existent, completely flat and devoid of any curves. She hadn't had hips like that since she was a little girl, and it made her exaggeratedly thin waist harder to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus decided to try the future, and wished she was back in the present, as far as she could go into the future. When she got there, she had a quick look around, and she couldn't find herself, of course. She had to leave at some point, after all. She noticed that while the place had to have been empty for days or weeks, the place definitely seemed a bit cleaner than before. Things shined and the air had less dust in it, but she didn't dwell on that for long, focusing more on her reflection on the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike her travel  into the past, one part had grown, and one part had shrinked, only in reverse this time. Her chest was as flat as a board, but her hips were absolutely massive, Samus having to hold out her arms diagonally just to lay them on them, and she'd have some difficulties getting through doors with them. She also noted that while her hips were huge, they still weren't as huge as the Pear upgrade. Nothing seemed to get as extreme as that one. Samus jumped back to the present, maybe a few minutes or twenty off, but back in the present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this one's going to be a lot of fun\u2026\" Samus said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do?</span></div></div>",

Her suit billowed out, material receding up her arms as the fabric on her legs fell of her legs, joining together to form a loose fitting sleeve, settling around her angles as a long dress. From her neck to her chest became bare, thin strips over her shoulders holding the dress up, baring much of her breasts. Samus' shoes disappeared, leaving her barefoot under the dress, wearing nothing underneath the loose hanging robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelieving her changes to be done, Samus began to walk over to the mirror, but partway there, her walk became an elegant glide, carrying herself lightly and with grace. As she looked over herself in the mirror, the second part of her changes began. Her breasts began to expand out, growing a few sizes until they bulged at the loose garment, Samus' posture allowing one of the strips holding her dress up to slip down her arm, almost exposing one of her breasts. From her back, two nubs began to grow, before speeding up as two large angelic wings burst out, pure white with an almost glowing quality to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she change mentally?</span></div></div>",

It looked like a ... perfection.  Her body emitted no glow in the darkness, but she was as visible now as if she were standing in broad daylight, reaching her right hand out, a blade of pure silver appeared.  And then the pirate knew no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One down.\"  Samus said as she pulled her sword from the dead pirate, rather than being covered in blood, it emerged from the body still untainted or stained.  \"More to go.\"  She unleashed a choral cry as she flew into the midst of the foul pirate camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo call it a fight would be a horrible misuse of the word, so to would a rout, for the former implied that both sides stood a chance of winning, and the latter implied that the losing side had a chance to escape.  This was a cleansing, and it was glorious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding atop the pile of dead space pirates, the newly Divine Samus remained clean and untouched by the dirt and blood of battle.  Her golden blonde hair was still perfectly arranged, and her wings of white, though they stopped her blooded prey from escaping, remained pure and her feathers unmatted.  Her skin too, was clean, despite being barefoot and wearing no armor, her bare form remained clean, her skin a perfect shade of bronze that both contrasted and complimented her golden hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who ... who are you?\"  One of the prisoners asked as their savior approached the cages, easily freeing them with a single swipe of her sword.

She took the chip from the machine and inserted it into her suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, her suit began to glow, and Samus's skin felt strange, like something was being pressed over it. She couldn't see past the glowing, and walked over to the mirror to get a better look at herself. By the time she got there, the glowing had stopped, and everything below her neck was a solid blue color, with no indication that she was wearing anything other than a smooth layer of paint. Samus noticed that like another of the upgrades, her nipples and genitals had disappeared, as well as her belly button and any skin definition, now completely smooth. She brought her hands up to her waist, and touched her body to find that her suit was no longer there, having merged with her skin. And her skin, on the other hand, couldn't really be defined as skin, or at least not feeling like it. It felt more like touching an extremely soft silk, and as she wondered what had happened to it, she saw the color changing to a dark purple color, the color spreading from her neck to the rest of her head, Samus now looking slightly comical, completely purple from head to toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could think any more, Samus' feet pushed themselves together of their own accord, Samus pressing her hand against the mirror to keep herself upright. Slowly, her feet began to merge together into a single sleeve up to her waist. Her feet began to become smaller and thinner, until they were a thin point that looked like they were barely touching the ground. From her ankles up they remained almost as thin, until the thinning reached halfway up her thighs, which remained just as curvy as ever, giving her new tail a wispy look. Samus brought her hand off the mirror as she realized that she could balance perfectly well, finding herself able to glide on the slight point, more like floating than holding herself up, the tip of her tail sometimes leaving the floor altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought herself back in front of the mirror, just in time for the rest of the changes. The features on Samus' face began to disappear, her nose flattening until the area was smooth, her eyebrows fading away as her eyelids closed and seemed to just disappear, leaving her face blank apart from her lips, Samus still finding herself able to see despite the lack of eyes. Seemingly to make up for the lack of other features, Samus' lips plumped up a bit, becoming slightly bigger and fuller, making them stand out more, as well as turning a light purple color, almost a dark pink. Two small circles of the same pink color appeared on her cheeks, giving Samus a slightly friendly look. Her ears receded back, leaving smooth skin in their place, covered by Samus' hair. And as for her hair itself, her fringe began to grow in length, until it covered where her eyes used to be, brushing where her nose once was. All in all, Samus thought, it gave her a rather wispish look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, a pair of white gloves formed over Samus' hands, and a dark blue and white striped wizard's had appeared on her head, the tip flopping over. Her transformation complete, Samus took a good look at herself in the mirror, not quite sure what to think of the transformation. When she looked at herself, she had a very intangible look to her, like she could fade away if she wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\u2026 I wonder if I can walk through walls or something?\" Samus asked herself, before proceeding to find out. </span></div></div>",

She took the chip and inserted it into her zero suit, waiting as always for it to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, Samus's zero suit separated the top and bottom halves of her suit, the leg part darkening as the top half began to pale into an almost white blue. The material began to change from the latex like one to a softer one, almost slightly transparent as buttons were placed up the middle. The shirt loosened, the sleeves gaining a cuff at the end as her collar curved out and parted at the front, as it became held together by the buttons down the middle, becoming a slightly loose blouse.  The material on her legs turned black and transparent, showing off her legs at it became a pair of pantyhose, the remaining material gathered into a dark blue miniskirt that flared up at the sides, long enough to just clear her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Samus shifted slightly at the change of clothing, she felt a rush, and held still as information poured into her brain, her knowledge increasing tenfold. But while this was happening, her changes weren't over. Her feet gained a pair of three inch high heels to match her pantyhose, and her ass began to swell, filling out any lose space in her miniskirt and squeezing against it, indenting clearly onto it. Her breasts gained a size, a lacy black push-up bra pushing it up into plain sight, her blouse unbuttoning a few buttons to show the top of the bra, the rest clearly visible through her thin blouse. Finally, her ponytail was pulled back into a tight bun, and a thin pair of glasses appeared on her face, giving her an extra knowledgeable appearance just from their presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus' brain finished filling with knowledge, an understanding of protocol and courtesy being pushed to the front of her attitude as well, as she stood blinking for a moment. She had so much to tell, so much to teach\u2026 She could name a million chemical combinations, tell details of planets on the other side of the galaxy\u2026 And she realized she had nobody to tell it to. Nobody to teach. Samus began to panic. She had to tell someone, get her teachings out <i>somehow</i>\u2026</span></div></div>",

After filling up the entire wall with writing, she had tried to use the computer to type up some documents, and had instead found that her Teacher upgrade was compatible with the Succubus upgrade. Since this was a part of her vast library of knowledge that was empty, Samus decided to try it out, taking the chip from the computer and inserting it into the upgrade slot, waiting for the changes to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery quickly, Samus' healthy pink skin began to fade, changing into the blue skin of the Succubus upgrade, her legs tingling slightly as the thorny black tattoos of the same upgrade were traced up her skin. The whites of her eyes turned black and her irises turned red, while she once again adjusted her glasses, scratching her itching skin as two black horns sprouted, curving at the ends.  A long, thin, spade-tipped tail was pushed through a hole cut in the back of her skirt and blouse, a similar area being cut to allow the bat-wings that sprouted from her back, flexing and completing her demonic appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after the few seconds this took, Samus adjusted her pose slightly to emphasize her chest more as her second set of changes took place. Her blue high heels darkened to an almost black navy color, gaining an extra couple of inches in heel size as it sharpened into a stiletto heel, her stocking taking on a lacier appearance at where they ended. Her flared mini-skirted stayed the same miniscule size, but also darkened to the same blue as a dark blue blazer began to grow around her blouse, thickening and splitting off from it as a hole formed for her tail to poke through and slits for her wings, while the chest of her blazer parted enough to let her barely restrained cleavage present itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rims of Samus' glasses changed to a dark red color, while the light blue of her lipstick and mascara darkened to the same almost black navy, matching the rest of her darker look at actually being visible on her blue skin. With her changes complete, Samus confidently sauntered over to the mirror, posing a few times as she took in her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure this will give me a definite advantage in court\u2026\" Samus said to herself, planning a theoretical court case in her head, one that ended with her getting most of the money. </span></div></div>",

Before she could react to the feeling of the cold floor on her feet, she was thrown off balance by a painful crack in her shins, pushing it backwards as her bones grinded, lengthening and changing as they became digitigrade, Samus holding herself awkwardly on feet that couldn't support her properly, and thin legs from the knee down that made it painful to stand on. She stumbled over to a wall, just in time to grimace for another change to her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thin former shins changed from skin to a harder material, turning yellow as they gained bumps and ridges, while her feet grew shorter, her big toes moving to stick out slightly like a small thumb, while her four toes merged into three on each foot, each growing as long as her foot was, resembling birds feet. Black talons grew out from her toenails, touching the floor as Samus pushed herself off the wall, realizing she could support herself naturally now, walking experimentally, her pacing odd but efficient. She was roughly the same height when she stood normally, but when she straightened her feet when she walked, she was a little taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to walk over to the mirror, noticing that the skin of her bare arms had changed to a light greyish brown, and as she saw herself in the mirror, saw that the rest of her skin matched. She also saw that her hair color had changed from its usual blonde to a deep red, suiting the grey pallor of her skin much better. She also noticed that her nose had extended, hooking at the end, and felt it tingle as it began to change further. Her noses skin hardened into a tough orange shell, becoming pointier and more triangular, looking just like a bird's beak, the shell ending just at her eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, Samus thought, she looked very much like a strange bird woman. And, she wondered, if she was some bird person, where were her wings? Could she fly somehow? At these thoughts, Samus yelped and swung her arms up as a huge layer of feathers emerged from each one, the same grey-brown of her skin, and certainly big enough to serve as wings. Her hands were still under there, but they were buried and not particularly useful with the feathers out. Hoping it worked the same way as her previous upgrades, Samus willed her arms to lose the feathers, which thankfully complied, the feathers receding back into her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does she react?</span></div></div>",

The metal seems to expand outwards, growing into a large, meter round circle around Samus, before splitting into individual sheets, resembling petals, many layers of them growing up around her thighs until she appeared to be standing in a large orange rose, the metal changing from metal into a soft material, like the petals they looked like.  Huge green leaves formed below the petals, thick tendril-like roots sprouting from under the rose, supporting the massive flower that Samus stood in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout this, Samus tried to step out of the flower, but she found that she couldn't move her legs at all! When she looked down, it looked like she was standing in the petals, but below her upper thighs, she was actually connected to the plant, her legs gone! Samus stopped moving as she realized that she could feel the ground beneath the roots of the flower, feeling the petals move slightly as she lay her hands on one. As she began to feel the sensations of the flower, her skin began to pale, taking on a green tone as her hair turned a darker shade of the same green, Samus managing to not look sickly with the green tones of her skin. Thorny green vines began to emerge from the flower, wrapping around Samus' body, the thorns not hurting her as they grew, leaves growing from them as they encompassed her. Samus felt the sensation of both the vines touching her skin and the vines themselves, moving as she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the transformation complete, Samus stood, looking like a woman with green skin wrapped in vines, standing in a huge orange rose, supported by large roots on the ground, lumbering slowly across the ground when she tried to move.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how I'm supposed to defend myself in this thing. I'm such a huge target\u2026\" Samus said to herself, getting slightly startled as the petals of the rose closed up, forming a tight rosebud around her that Samus guessed was stronger than regular rose petals.

The flower was directly held by a series of tendrils, suspended off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus watched her skin turn green, her hair following as she gained the sensations of the roots. A few vines grew up and wrapped around her, laced with spikes and leaves, tipped with the same blue rose as her base at the ends.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Samus was standing at the beginning of a long, partially lit hallway, the walls lined with suit upgrades of every shape and size. Samus activated her scanning visor. The locator targeted the first upgrade on her right. The scanning visor identified it as a Raptor Upgrade. It looked like some kind of reptilian scale, dark green in color with red slashes through it. The visor noted that it was compatible with her Varia suit, but that it's function was currently unknown. Samus raised an eyebrow at that. It seemed as though she would have to activate the upgrade in order to see what it did...which was...a problem. But, shaking herself out of her thoughts, she decided to scan the rest of the upgrades. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, scanning all of the upgrades one by one seemed an almost impossible task given the sheer amount of them. To make matters worse, according to her map, this hallway was one of several, each with their own rows of upgrades. Samus let out a disappointed sigh. That was a <i>lot</i> of scanning, even for her. The hallway she was currently in held up to approximately twenty different upgrades...maybe more! Her scanning visor could only do so much. Then it hit her. If she could program her scanning visor to scan multiple objects at once, she could get through each hallway in a matter of minutes! Then, when she had scanned them all, she could choose one based on its name. Now, they say not to judge a book by its cover, but in this instance, it was all Samus could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Let's hope this works...</i> Samus immediately got to work reprogramming her scanning visor. She always managed to keep an eye on her motion tracker and radar while she was working, just in case an enemy decided to attack her while her back was turned. After several minutes, she achieved her goal; now her scanner had a multi-scan function able to scan up to ten targets at a time. Mission accomplished. Now to get to work.  However, as Samus activated her new and improved scanning visor, she realized a huge problem with it: it could only scan things within her visual range. Seeing as most of the lights that lit up the research station were either dim, dimmer, or out completely, that was a very bad thing. Then Samus realized the solution. Her highbeams would light up the hallway, but even so, she could probably only get five or six upgrades scanned at a time. Oh well. Better than nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus turned on her highbeams, the light forming a large semicircle directly in front of her. It actually worked better than she had hoped. She could <i>almost</i> see the end of the hall...but saying she could <i>almost</i> see it was a stretch. Even so, Samus saw no more reason to dilly-dally. She quickly went about scanning the upgrades. As she scanned them, she noticed that some of them had odd names. Take the Succubus Upgrade, for instance. Samus raised an eyebrow at that one, for sure. Another thing she noticed was that some of the upgrades were actually designed to augment her Zero Suit instead of her Varia suit. There were also upgrades for her morph ball, but that was no surprise. Eventually, she managed to get through them all. Turning around, she looked back at all of the upgrades she had just scanned. Now all that Samus had left to do was to pick one and use it. But which one?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her Heads-Up Display and went to the Upgrades file for her suit. Now she had a large list of upgrades to choose from. <i>Hm...Raptor? No...Shark? No...Armadillo...that's for the morph ball, isn't it? I'll keep that one in mind...Gel?</i> She went through the entire inventory, keeping a mental list of the ones she was considering for actual use. Then she came to the Medieval Upgrade. <i>What is this?</i> It resembled a small badge with a red cross on it. The badge was shaped like a shield, and was a sky blue in color with a silver outline. Her visor added that it was compatible with her Varia suit as a whole. Like the other upgrades, its function and purpose were unknown. Samus thought about it for a moment...a shield badge? Maybe it was some kind of weapon augmentation. Maybe it was a shield. Samus couldn't say for sure. But, in the end, it was a safe bet. A safer bet than some of the other upgrades, at least. After a few minutes, Samus eventually decided to use the Medieval Upgrade. If it worked, she might even be able to pick another one from the same hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked down to where the Medieval upgrade was. It wasn't too far from the end of the hall. When she found it, Samus stopped and got a good look at it. The upgrade itself wasn't that big. In fact, it could fit in the palm of her hand it was so small. Some of the other upgrades were the size of her morph ball, some of them were even bigger. Samus decided that the smaller her upgrades were, the better. Especially when she considered that she didn't truly know what any of the upgrades did. She let out another sigh. <i>Let's do this...before I change my mind...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she picked up the miniature shield. She held it up in front of her visor and gave it another scan. The readout explained that the upgrade had to be placed on the right side of her chest plate in order to take effect. It also said that the upgrade would add to her arsenal, as well as slightly change the look of her Varia suit. After thinking it over, Samus placed the upgrade, and looked down to see what it changed. The badge seemed loose at first, almost like it was a refrigerator magnet. But suddenly, the badge began to transform, molding to fit her chest plate. Once it was done, the badge began to vibrate, and Samus watched as sky blue lines seemed to magically draw themselves across the surface of her suit. When the lines reached her arm cannon, it began to change its shape. The barrel seemed to fold into itself, as the chamber and charger began to shift into different positions. Then, without warning, a neon blue blade shot out where the barrel used to be, the rest of her cannon folding around it until Samus could feel her right hand holding onto some sort of handle underneath the cover of the cannon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the blue lines reached her left arm. Samus watched as her left gauntlet began to change.It started glowing the same blue color her new blade was, and the armor on her arm began to shift. Once the armor pieces finished moving, a large, blue shield shaped almost exactly like the badge itself appeared, along with two energy-based ties and a handle for Samus to grab onto. As this was happening, the blue lines continued to snake around her suit, changing the color of some parts of her armor, while completely modifying other parts. Sometimes, the blue lines were followed by silver outlines, which only served to make the suit look even cooler. In other places, the armor was modified to stick out farther from her body, giving the Varia suit a new, sharper, rougher exterior. The familiar green lights of the Varia suit became neon blue. As a finishing touch, her visor became a similar hue. Once this was all done, the blade slid back inside her arm cannon, the normal barrel folded back over her arm, the shield disappeared, and her left gauntlet folded all of the moved armor chinks back into place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus stared down at her new suit. It was totally different that what she had expected. But, considering what she had just seen, that wasn't necessarily a bad thing. She quickly opened her HUD and went to her Upgrades tab. Now her Medieval Upgrade file had a complete description. She was just about to read it, when she noticed something moving on her motion tracker...slowly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is this mysterious thing that has managed to sneak up on Samus? An enemy of some kind? Or is it...the station itself, activating its defenses?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Samus froze. Something was behind her...and moving closer every second. She couldn't believe she had let something sneak up on her like that. Still, whatever it was, it appeared to be moving slowly. And it was...above her? <i>The vents!</i> Before she could move, one of the grates in the ventilation shaft running across the ceiling opened, and something came out of it...but it didn't land on the floor. She heard a clicking sound as something metal poked her in the back of the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there, Sammy,\" the thing hanging out of the grate said. \"Looks like I gotcha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dammit!</i> Samus thought, <i>How did I let him sneak up on me like that?</i> Time seemed to stop as Samus began to think of a way out of her plight. <i>Based on the tone of his voice, I'd say he's a reptilian life form. The sound I heard was the hammer of a red shell revolver being pulled back. That weapon in particular is popular among reptilian species for some reason. It's powerful...and illegal. A point blank shot can put a hole through the toughest of metals. I can't let him hit me...not in the head. I have to take him out without letting him get a round off on me. The first thing to do is get his weapon away from him. Based on what I heard, he's holding the red shell with both hands. Based on that, I can do two things from this position. I could go into morph ball mode and roll under him, but if he shot me while I was morphing, it would cause serious damage. The only other option is to turn and use my forearm to knock his weapon out of his hands. Then I'll pull him out of the vent and incapacitate him accordingly. I have to time this just right. He's taunting me, which means he's arrogant enough to try and humiliate me before I die. Typical tough-guy bravado. He'll make his own opening, and when he does, I'll take him down.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know...it's really a shame,\" the thing continued, \"I thought you would be more of a challenge.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus tensed up a bit. <i>This is it...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, I guess I should be glad. After all, if I had to face you head-on, I'd probably lose.\" That was when Samus struck. She whirled around in an instant, using her arm cannon to smack his revolver right out of his hands. Samus was now face-to-face with her assassin. It was some kind of reptilian creature, with green scales and brown leather. He was hanging upside-down out of the vent, probably by means of an extremely strong tail. His yellow eyes were wide with surprise, his mouth hanging open. Samus acted quickly, grabbing her foe's upper jaw with her left hand and slamming his head into the ground. She then picked him up by the tail and threw him over her shoulder, charging up her arm cannon simultaneously. Before the creature even hit the ground, Samus turned and let her charge shot fly. The large energy ball slammed into his shoulder, sending him spinning through the air. He hit the ground hard, rolling several times before he crashed into the wall at the end of the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing hardly had the chance to move an inch before Samus appeared in front of him. He opened his mouth, but before he could say anything, Samus put her arm cannon into it. The green reptile quickly put his hands up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fffo't fffoot! On't fhoot!!!\" The thing cried, his voice muffled by the arm cannon lodged in his mouth. Samus knew what that meant. She quickly pulled her arm cannon out and shook the spittle off of it. The reptile coughed a bit, wiping his mouth with his left hand. \"Holy...motha...of shit...\" the thing said, panting. \"Oach...that was...wow...agh...\" Samus immediately pointed her cannon at his head. The creature put his hands up again. \"Woah, woah, take it easy, aight?\" it said nervously. \"Look, I don't want no trouble...I mean, yeah, I did try and kill ya, but I mean, come on...it's all part of the job, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus raised an eyebrow. He wasn't exactly doing a good job convincing her not to kill him. She opened her scanning visor and gave her adversary a good look. He was a green reptile-looking thing with a short snout, a long tail, and bright yellow eyes that had black slashes for pupils. He was a small little thing, probably only about three feet tall at the most. He was dressed from head to toe in leather: leather boots, leather chaps, a leather vest with leather straps...even leather gloves. He had a hat, too, but it had fallen off when he popped out of the vent. His entire outfit was a soft brown, though every once in a while you might find a gold button or two. He was wearing two hip holsters as well, one empty, one holding a second red shell. His scales were quite thick, almost a centimeter thick each. They jutted out from his body like the teeth of a chainsaw. He had four long fingers on each hand, and long black claws to go with them. Oddly, enough, his feet had five toes, each one with a black claw of its own. He had glistening white fangs, two long fangs poking at at the corners of his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe visor identified him as a Kaldranian. That made sense. Kaldra was covered with reptilian creatures just like this one. Surely no one would miss him. Samus began to charge up her arm cannon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, wait, wait a minute! Don't shoot me! Please, I'm beggin' ya! I didn't want to kill ya, honest! I just needed the dough! That's all, I swear to God!\" He closed his eyes tight and looked away as he talked, expecting to lose his head at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus blinked. <i>Someone put a bounty on me? Who?</i> She deactivated her cannon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green lizard opened an eye and sighed with relief. \"Jeez louisus, man. You scared the everlovin' fuck outta me, ya know that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus shook her head. <i>Who taught you your manners?</i> There was a brief moment of silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man...you don't talk much, do ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should Samus do now? Tie up her prisoner and continue to explore the station, or bring him to the Galactic Federation for questioning?</span></div></div>",

It began to fade to a lighter blue, while it became looser and gained frills on the edges as it began to grow longer, loosening and falling down to just below her hips, fading again, this time to white, looping around her waist into a ribbon and in two thin strips over her shoulder to hold up what was now an apron. Underneath the apron, her zero suit began to darken to a dark navy blue, as it began to lose fabric on her arms up to her shoulders, and began to loosen similarly to her apron, losing its skin-tight quality as the material changed to a softer fabric. Up on the shoulders, it poofed up slightly gaining frills over the top, the tiny t-shirt like sleeve ended by a white band, leaving the rest of her arms bare. From the apron up to her neck, material disappeared, leaving her neck down to her cleavage bare, held in by the apron, but just barely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre there mental changes as well?</span></div></div>",

She began to concentrate hard enough on it that she didn't notice the next set of changes begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her hips down, the fabric loosened and detached from her legs, growing down into a short skirt, reaching half way down to her knees and widening out, gaining white frills along the end all around, frills also appearing to line the edges of her apron. The material on her legs thinned and changed into a fishnet garterbelt, leaving her legs quite exposed, ending in a black pair of high heels,  Samus not noticing as she readjusted her feet to fit the four inch heels. Absorbed in her examination of the room, Samus bent over to take a look at the floor, exposing her new pair of lacy white underwear to anyone who could have been behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Samus's breasts started to grow, threatening to fall out of her tightly pressed apron, straining against it as it hung low enough to only barely cover her breasts, a mountain of cleavage heaving out. Finally, a pair of elbow length white gloves appeared on her hands, and a frilly white maid's headband adorned her head, as Samus took a final quick look around the room, and began to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zis place\u2026\" Samus said, not noticing the accent that had entered her voice. \"Is so filthy!\"  She said, appalled at the layer of dust from the abandonment of the satellite. \"And ze condition of these walls,\" She said, looking at the writing she had made earlier on them, \"Is unacceptable! I must rem\u00e8de zis imm\u00e9diatement!\" Samus said, once again not noticing her switch in language as she rushed to her ship, gathering all the cleaning supplies she could find. She immediately set to work, humming happily to herself as she began to clean the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

She took the upgrade from the machine and inserted it into her zero suit, waiting for the changes to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Samus' suit began to glow, before ceasing quickly. The material of her suit began to change, changing from the latex-like material to a soft, but cheaper looking shiny fabric, losing the slightly hard quality to it. While it was still tight, it was even thinner than her normal suit, and rather than the flawless second-skin nature of before, it creased and folded as she moved,  matching the fabric it had changed to. The blue of her suit was slightly lighter than normal, and the black lines of her suit were slightly raised, sewn onto her suit and not completely smooth on its curves. The dark blue sections on her arms and legs were also sewn on, the symbol on her back having a thin black outline from where it was similarly sewn on. Her shoes separated from her suit, looking more like regular thick heeled shoes redesigned to match her suit. Finally, a zipper appeared on her back, running clearly down it, completing the effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the change affecting her whole suit, it only took a few seconds, and the overall effect was of someone making a costume of her zero suit, rather than the actual suit itself. But before Samus could take a look at herself, the second set of changes began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, Samus' hair took on a brighter blonde, looking artificial and bleached, rather than her natural colour. Her hairstyle rearranged itself, appearing to be carefully combed to be like her normal hairstyle, rather than falling naturally into it. Next, her breasts shrank a size, filling out her suit a bit less as her hips narrowed a bit as well, while the muscular tone of her body softened to that of someone who was fit, rather than strong, and more slender than anything tough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her changes complete, Samus walked over to the mirror to take a look at herself, her changed zero suit feeling odd on her. When she took a look at herself, she thought that she looked more like someone dressing up as her, rather than actually being her. She was wondering what the point of the upgrade was when she froze for a second, the final part of the upgrade modifying her brain. She unfroze, and took a look at herself in the mirror, pulling a pose as a wide smile went over her face. She walked back to the computer, and took a look at her armor and ship, eyes widening like she'd never seen them before. She gave out a yelp of excitement, before yelling out,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so cool!\" She rushed over to her power suit, taking a good look over it, before rushing onto her ship, practically squealing at getting to look over what was still technically her ship, something that she had previously seen thousands of times, before remembering what she was here for and running over to the computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be so much fun!\" Samus said, as she looked over the list of upgrades for what would be the most fun to try. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she use?</span></div></div>",

She took the upgrade from the machine and inserted it into her zero suit, waiting for the upgrade to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus' zero suit began to glow, and its color changed to purple, losing its patterns and becoming a solid color, before beginning to harden. The material changed from its soft rubber-like material to a hard scale-like one, and Samus found it difficult to move inside the unyielding shell. Her suit began to glow again and her skin tingled as her suit began to merge with her skin, the purple scale-like shell replacing her soft skin, the heels of her shoes disappearing as her feet were left bare. After a moment, her suit stopped glowing and Samus walked over to the mirror to take a look at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was now completely naked, with her skin having taken a purple color to her new hard skin, but softened around her neck and face, which had a much softer look to it, although it was still purple like the rest of her body. Samus had an uncomfortable feeling about the meaning of the name of the upgrade, but before she could ponder it any further, she began to feel strange, and hear cracking coming from her body as the upgrade continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feet began to become longer and thinner, her bones cracking as her toes formed together into two long toes, each becoming as long as her foot and spreading in a v-shape, a long and sharp talon at the end of each one, while being bumpy and having ridges along it. A third toe sprouted from the back of each of her heels, much like a birds, a similar talon at the end helping her keep her balance. Her legs thinned out as the joints reformed, her legs becoming digitigrade to keep her balance on her new feet. Her arms became thinner as well, her fingers reforming and losing one on each hand, the fingers getting a bumpy shape to them as well as the fingernail growing longer and sharper into a set of white claws. Samus looked at her new claws, and felt her back cracking as the next set of changes set in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer back gained a series of ridges going up it, a series of spikes sprouting from the top of her spine, Samus bending forward from the sensation of them coming out. Her abdominals sunk in a bit, while her ribcage became more pronounced and obvious on her frame, her breasts shrinking slightly and losing her nipples. She felt a stretching sensation coming from her back, and turned around to see two small nubs coming from her shoulder blades, another two spikes sticking out and growing longer and longer as a tough membrane grew between, becoming two long and almost bat-like wings. As she flexed her new wings, just above her rear another bump appeared, growing into a short tail tipped with a sharp spade, growing longer and longer until it touched the ground, bumped all the way along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of everything her face seemed mostly untouched, apart from her nose and mouth seeming a little pointier and elongated than before, and her ears had grown longer and pointed.. Her hair was even still there, even if it looked slightly odd on the purple skin. But overall, she still looked mostly human. Well, at least until Samus' mouth began to feel strange, and she opened it to see rows and rows of razor sharp teeth, far more than her human set, and a long and pointy lizard-like tongue that flickered out. She also found her mouth stretching wider and higher, the teeth glistening as it stretched inhumanly high. She quickly shut her mouth again, her face returning to normal as her tongue tucked back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid her mind change?</span></div></div>",

Just thinking that her body now, in any way, was like his filled Samus with so much anger she didn't know what to do with it. That monster had killed her parents, eaten them too, and no matter how many times she killed him, he always came back. Pushing that rage deep inside her, Samus left the room she was in to head to a nearby bathroom, and observe her new body in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing aside the similarities between her scaly, purple body and that of her arch-nemesis, there was definitely things to like. After all, she'd seen Ridley in action, and with these wings, claws, and sharp-pointed tail, she could probably learn to do just as much as him, if not more. Suddenly, the image of her savagely attacking a Space Pirate with her bare claws came into her head, tearing through the exoskeleton like it was tissue paper. Her first reaction to that thought was to give a predator's smile, showing off her new sharp teeth. Yes, this body would be perfect for bounty hunting, wouldn't it?</span></div></div>",

Any disappointment was quickly swept aside, however, as it quickly became clear that she was getting a message from her contact with the Galactic Federation. They had a new bounty for her, and it was one they recommended to her personally. She could immediately see why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaston LaRouge was a human diplomat working with the Federation, specifically involved in directing coordination between the Federation's legislative branch and arms dealers. What had only been recently discovered, through the work of several private investigations, was that Gaston was not only corrupt, purposefully changing communications rather than giving them faithfully, but he'd been a plan working with the Space Pirates, making sure they were well armed whenever possible, giving them access to technology from the Galactic Federation. He was on the run now, last seen on a luxury borderworld outside the Federation's jurisdiction. He was wanted dead or alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was all too happy to test out her new body in taking in this monster. The best way to get this done, she immediately thought, would be to use her new form to her advantage, pose as someone working with Ridley, with the Space Pirates. Then, once they'd had a chance to meet, Samus could take him with ease. Of course, there were also risks with that plan. And wouldn't it be easier, more simple, to just go in full-force? After all, she still got paid if he was dead.</span></div></div>",

Part of the reason scum like LaRouge felt so comfortable going there was that, aside from laying outside the regular bounds of Federation law enforcement, Bliss had a private army, and they made damn sure that no one did the exact kind of thing Samus had been thinking of. She was tougher than usual like this, to be sure, but she wasn\u2019t foolish enough to test it on a suicide mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting in to Bliss was easy, Samus had more than enough credits in her account to pay for a weekend stay, even at the exorbitant prices they demanded. No, her larger issue was transportation. While Bliss wouldn\u2019t likely care about Samus\u2019s ship, if the target found out about it, he\u2019d run. After all, Samus Aran was known throughout the galaxy as the number one enemy of the Space Pirates. So, Samus stored her ship with someone she trusted and rented a refurbished scout ship that once belonged to the Space Pirates, and still largely retained that design. It took some time for Samus to get used to the different controls, but by the time she\u2019d reached her destination, she felt like her little scheme was coming together beautifully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hadn\u2019t taken much greasing of palms to find out where LaRouge was spending his time and money, and Samus entered that particular casino looking how she felt: the strongest, most badass woman in the goddamn galaxy. Quite a few eyes were on her, and as she approached LaRouge, she could tell his were among them. Whether the bastard was looking at her in fear or in lust, Samus was satisfied. \u201cYou\u2019re LaRouge, right?\u201d she asked, her voice a rumbling growl as she managed to show off quite a few razor-sharp teeth with her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe target would likely be considered handsome, Samus supposed. He was a human, pale with a well-groomed beard and slicked back hair. His clothes were tailored to perfectly fit his athletic build, and a buxom Castranian woman was hanging on his arm, who looked even more scared of Samus than LaRouge did. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a female space dragon before,\u201d he said, looking as though he was trying to recover his \u2018rich man of power\u2019 persona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe look like this,\u201d Samus told him, enjoying seeing the worm squirm as she spoke. \u201cMy cousin Ridley sent me to see you. Since you were so sloppy that you ended up being a wanted man by the Federation, you\u2019re going to need my protection. We want to...make sure you don\u2019t talk.\u201d The threat in her words was barely even concealed, and that\u2019s the way Samus wanted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaRouge took in her words, clearly thinking them over a little before giving any sort of answer. \u201cWell, I suppose that makes sense. Though I never realized Ridley had a cousin...or that he was even still alive. Well then, I leave my protection in your care.\u201d This had been so simple, Samus was astounded. This empty-headed buffoon had just led himself to the woman most ready to turn him in for the money. But that led to a new question...should she end the charade so early? Maybe she could take her time, squeeze more information out of him first, so she could go wreak havoc on more of the Space Pirate menace...</span></div></div>",

Getting leads on how to put an even larger wrench into their plans? It was perfect. So Samus took stance a few feet behind LaRouge, and let him continue his gambling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while for the snake to get back into the good mood he\u2019d been in before Samus had intruded, but once he was, the laughter and seducing of women only interested in his credits was back. It was dull, really, but Samus was well used to tedium. After a few hours of following the criminal, he turned to look at Samus, only the slightest hint of fear in his eyes as he met hers. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to enjoy yourself too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Samus immediately wanted to do was snap at him that crushing his windpipe between her teeth would be very enjoyable, but let the comment slide down her throat without being spoken. Instead, she just growled, \u201cI\u2019m working.\u201d LaRouge rolled his eyes, but before he turned back to the game of Quasar he\u2019d been playing, Samus asked him something back. \u201cWhy?\u201d When it became clear he wasn\u2019t sure what she meant, Samus clarified. \u201cWhy\u2019d you betray the Federation for the Space Pirates?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question had eaten away at her, ever since reading his file. For all her time fighting them, Samus didn\u2019t know why anyone worked with, or joined, the alien villains. There may have been another, hidden motive to the query as well. One Samus still couldn\u2019t see within herself. For the first time, Samus saw defiance on the beaurocrat\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m no coward. I support the Space Pirates because of what they are: strength. Unrelenting, indomitable strength. No complex court structure, no votes...they just get things done.\u201d That gave Samus something to think on later, but Samus became immediately alert: she noticed someone approaching, from LaRouge\u2019s back, another bounty hunter. She had to move quickly: would she protect LaRouge or help the bounty hunter?</span></div></div>",

The normal part of her skin tingled for a moment as well, still soft, but tougher than before, while a series of spikes began to grow up her back, from just above her rear to her neck, white and sharp enough to impale something on. Just above her bikini bottom, a large nub began to protrude through her skin, growing longer and wider into a thick tail, Samus readjusting her position as it slid across the ground behind her, covered in the same bumpy scales as the rest of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her now bare feet, her toes merge into three large ones on each foot, the toenails growing rounder and longer into large claws, scraping the ground as Samus adjusted her footing. Her fingers grew thicker and gained similar long, raking talons on the ends, perfectly ready for attacking. Her face was left mostly unchanged, although her teeth sharpened and her tongue lengthened into a reptilian one, and both her upper and lower canines grew long enough to not fit completely in her mouth and rested on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her abdominals, Samus felt a slight amount of pain and looked down to see her belly button growing bigger, forming a large hole, while two more were opening up, one below her rips, and the other right below her breasts. Samus figured this was the reason for the skimpier zero suit, as well as the spikes on her back and the tail. She felt a pressure coming from the holes, and looked back down to see three spikes pushing their way through the holes, the distinctive two pronged spikes that Kraid had used against her. They remained stationary and didn't move around as she moved, and retracted in as Samus bent over, thankfully not impaling herself by accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre there mental changes?</span></div></div>",

While she wasn't a big fan of the bikini design, she thought she definitely looked much like her old foe, and wondered if she could fire her abdominal spikes like he could. She turned around to face an empty wall, and attempted to force some pressure onto her belly, a moment of straining rewarded by the spike shooting out, an odd sensation, but not a painful one, that resulted in the spike hurtling towards the steel wall, and penetrating it, sticking out of the solid steel, quivering slightly. Samus felt another spike sliding out to replace it, another odd feeling.

From her transformation Samus' appetite had worked up to gluttonous levels and she needed food badly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question for her was what did she want to get...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith target practice session paused for now, Samus began to aimlessly wander around the station to find if there was any food in the place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There haaasss to be food sssoomewhere?\" she said to herself, waddling at a slow pace, not gotten used to her new size yet. Several minutes of exploring the station, Samus soon made a breakthrough with her search, as she had managed to find some sort of food court in the station. \"Whatsss thiissss?\" Intrigued at what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe AI of the station must have been experimenting with foods as well. Perhaps it was another way test upgrades and so forth? But Samus couldn't care less for the whys and reasons for the time being; all she wanted was some grub inside her fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere in the room she found large quantities of meals and snacks that ranged from burgers, pizzas and various desserts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus\u2019s eyes lit up greedily as she began her quest to consume everything in front of her. Slice after slice of the pizza disappeared into the blonde\u2019s mouth, each as greasy as the one before it. \"Mmm, thiisss iisss sssooo deliciouusss!\" Samus hissed in delight as she shoved another slice of pizza in her mouth. \"I can't believe how good thiiss isss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon crammed a handful of fries that were splattered in ketchup after finishing one whole enormous pizza by herself. Afterwards she moved onto some cheeseburgers and then eventually the chicken legs that quickly became chicken bones; as the meat was picked clean. It was clear this form had made Samus take eating as seriously as she would take a bounty; becoming very ravenous. Soon nothing was left but some crumbs on the floor, stains of the condiments, the small bones of chicken that fell onto the floor or on herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the consumed and inside her belly, unknown to Samus she had triggered another stage of her \tKraidian upgrade...</div></span></div></div>",

That same sensation that had come with the initial changes, tingling throughout her body and making her scaly skin crawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuuh?\u201d Samus muttered out in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere must have been a slight delay with the upgrade as Samus\u2019 body was once more changing and expanding. As the food she had wolfed down was causing her body to expand and fill out greatly. The already morphed bikini she wore was becoming tighter and harder to contain her growing mass, as the suit simply snapped off and fell onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly drooped further down towards the ground, while her breasts ballooned out more and sat nicely on her scaly belly apron. Her blubbery ass becoming fuller and thicker than before, while her arms and legs became not only fatter and wider but much brawnier too. Particularly her thighs, which grew thick with flab and muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was expanding, her skin slowly changed from the tainted green colour and started to fade into the same blue tone of her once proud zero-suit. Next, her vision grew blurrier before becoming much sharper and clearer, as a third eye was twitching behind the flesh of her forehead before it finally peeled free and revealed itself. And lastly, her human-like face suddenly began to bulge and stretch outward; reshaping into a reptilian snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the swelling lizard huntress had finished ballooning from her weight gain and was now an estimate of 800lbs of fat and muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the biggest change had yet to happen, as Samus let out a small moan, her voice sounding deeper than earlier, as she felt an unusual pressure from down below underneath her sagging belly. It was as if something new was growing there. Within seconds, she soon saw what that thing was and it took her by surprise completely once she saw the tip of it appear in her sight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA Cock\u2026?\u201d she mumbled in astonishment at what she saw, lifting her huge belly up high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a slightly darker shade of blue than her body, and though it did have some bumps, they were mostly on the tip, leaving her shaft much smoother. Underneath her 5ft long cock, it was accompanied by two large balls, the same shade as her fat prick, currently the size of jackfruits. She could smell the musk of her new package clouding her mind with thoughts of what could happen next.</div></span></div></div>",

The hard lump of food in her stomach that was making her waist protrude shrank a little as what was there was quickly digested, and what was left was softer, giving her a bit of flab to her stomach. Her breasts and butt had larger as well, and the fat settled all over her body in small ways, giving her an overall chubby look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the changes didn't stop there. While Samus was still looking at how the rest of her had changed, she felt like she was getting vertigo as her perspective started to shift, the room starting to look smaller. In reality, Samus's body was growing larger and larger, the chair quickly snapping from her weight, leaving Samus sitting on the floor.

But in the aftermath of the second transformation, new thoughts started appearing in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was so bad about this upgrade? Her skin was toughed, more resistant to attack. The spike projectiles were a new way to fight enemies. Her razor sharp teeth were a useful addition as well. Then, there was the fact that she'd grown so much larger and taller after eating. That just made her feel more powerful, almost invincible. What would happen if she gorged herself on food more? Really, the more she thoughts about it, Samus couldn't help but this this upgrade could be a long-term thing. Plus, she had to admit to herself, she enjoyed eating that much food, it was rare she could let herself go.

Just below her knees, the fabric began to recede, leaving her with a pair of boots as it shrank upwards, stopping at her rear as it curved upwards into a leotard design, leaving her legs bare. Her hands became uncovered as the neckline of her suit began to drop, lowering until it began to bare some of her cleavage.

She turned her head to confirm the odd fact, walking over to the mirror to take a better look at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a look at her changes, her suit having changed to look like a low-necked one-piece purple swimsuit, with matching boots, a green stripe over the front of them. Did her skin seem a bit pinker? Probably just the lighting, she thought. She was also wondering why her hair had changed styles and turned green when she began to feel a tingling from her hand as the final part of her upgrade began. Her hand glowed as metal formed over the bare skin, climbing up to her elbow as it began to form into what appeared to be her power suit's arm cannon.

Her corset gained some ruffles at its bottom where it attached to her dress, the flowing dress slitting up the left side up to her hips, the material underneath darkening to black and receding down her legs to her upper thighs, gaining holes as they became a fishnet garterbelt, shown on her leg up with slit on her dress. Her heels shifted into three inch high heels as usual, while a large blue ribbon formed over her behind, tied around her corset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the changes to her clothes complete, Samus began to walk over to the mirror, while the final changes began. Her chests naturally swelled a size, pressing harder again the tough corset, while her waist shrank inwards, the corset tightening to match the change to her figure. Her lips pouted up slightly and gained a layer of red lipstick, while her eyes gained a layer of mascara. Her ears were pierced with two large hoop earrings, Samus ignoring the slight moment of pain as her ears were pierced, and two blue  feathers were placed into Samus' hair band, finishing her changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus got over to the mirror, taking a look at herself and striking a few poses, eager to show off her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shame really.\" Samus said, a southern accent slipping into her voice. \"All this, and nobody 'round to see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly disappointed, Samus pulled a few more poses in the mirror, before wondering if there were any bars in this sector of the solar system. </span></div></div>",

It was a power suit upgrade, and she inserted the chip into her suit, waiting for the changes to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus' suit began to glow, before suddenly disappearing, leaving Samus naked. She had taken off her zero suit to not have it affected by any power suit upgrade, leaving being nude the downside when something like this happened. Wondering where her suit had gone, Samus looked down to see her feet glowing. She lifted her foot to get a better look at it, before she suddenly froze and sent her foot crashing back down, a loud thunk of a hard material on metal, rather than of skin. Samus tried to lift her foot, but found herself unable to move anything below her knee, and making any attempt at moving other than falling over impossible. Samus took another look down to find that the glowing on her feet had stopped, and instead was rising up her legs, reaching her knees as she looked. She realized that her feet were now some hard orange gem-like material, gleaming off the light as it sat there, the muscle and bone gone underneath, spreading up to the rest of her body, immobilizing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe diamond-like material slowly went up her thighs, reaching her hips and paralyzing her from the waist down, leaving her unable to move her lower torso at all, creeping up as Samus raised her arms up in an attempt to keep control of them for as long as possible. The glowing reached her abdominals, stopping Samus from moving her back, Samus desperately trying to move in any way as it reached her arms, freezing them in place, raised at her sides. Samus stuck her neck up as it finally reached her neck, her features freezing in stone as Samus stood there unmoving, a look of anguish frozen on her face, her mouth open slightly on the smooth orange material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA full minute later, of Samus panicking, unable to move in any way, frozen there as a statue, Samus suddenly regained control of her body, the sudden feeling making her lose her balance and fall heavily to the floor. Samus picked herself back up, chinking and scraping slightly as she pulled herself up, looking down at her new diamond hard body. Samus stretched, finding that she still had her full range of motion, and ran over to the mirror, falling heavily, but still as agile as her normal body. She looked at herself in the mirror, her orange body adorned with two solid blue gems on what were now her eyes, her facial expression shifting only in the material. She could move her face normally, and she discovered that like the Gel upgrade, her nipples and genitals had been erased, restoring some of her modesty. She opened her mouth and looked in, having full teeth but an unmovable tongue, merely mimicking her mouth and throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered just how hard the odd orange matter she was made out of was, and walked over to a metal container, slamming her fist into it as hard as she could. While she could feel the sensation of her hand hitting it, still retaining her sense of feeling, she felt no pain, and the steel of the container crumpled in where she hit it, Samus' fist completely undamaged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026\" Samus said, forgetting that like her Gel upgrade, her mouth was now useless.</span></div></div>",

She took the chip from the machine and inserted it into her zero suit, waiting for the upgrade to apply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of waiting, Samus realized that nothing had happened. She supposed it might be defective, and walked back over to the computer to remove the upgrade. She placed her hands onto the keyboard, only to find that her hands hit the wall rather than the keyboard, which was odd, seeing as how the keyboard was chest height with her. But when she looked at it, it seemed to be at head height with her! She realized that it seemed to be getting higher and larger, and it couldn't be getting bigger on its own\u2026 Samus looked down to find that the ground was moving towards her faster and faster, realizing that she was shrinking! She walked around the room, her steps getting shorter and shorter as the room began to get large and wider than before as she reduced in size, her hairband falling to the ground as her hair shrank out of it, her hair falling onto her now half-sized body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the shrinking getting faster and faster, Samus tried to run over to the mirror, now a third of her normal size, looking like a very young girl with an adult's body as she shrank even further, moving slowly towards the mirror, and by the time she reached it, she was too small to even reach the bottom of the mirror. Samus gave up trying to see herself after a few jumps, and finally reached the size of a small doll, the shrinking stopping. Now at her tiny size, Samus wondered just how this could possibly useful, when she felt a familiar tingling sensation coming from her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the material of her zero suit open up slightly as two gossamer thin butterfly wings erupted out, fluttering slightly as Samus felt a slight tearing sensation from the growth. Samus gave her wings a few experimental flaps, looking slightly more optimistic about the upgrade as she confirmed her thoughts about the name. Flying was something she enjoyed immensely, and after a moment of flapping, she gained enough control of her wings to rise up, fluttering quickly around the now huge to her room, all the space she wanted given to her in her tiny form, Samus allowing herself a minute to enjoy herself. After that minute, Samus stopped for a moment to see herself in the mirror, seeing only a glowing ball of blue light with wings, and looked down at herself to see her zero suit glowing brightly, flying towards the mirror to get a closer look at herself. At close range she looked normal, a tiny version of herself in her zero suit with wings, although glowing brightly enough to not appear that way to a casual onlooker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to remember to hold onto this one\u2026\" Samus said to herself, before going off to enjoy her flight some more. </span></div></div>",

She took the upgrade from the machine and inserted it into her zero suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus began to feel a swelling sensation in her breasts, and looked down to see them swelling before her eyes, each one almost reaching the size of her head. It felt odd, like it was filling with liquid, and underneath her suit, her aureola and nipples grew larger and darkened to a brown color, protruding visibly into her zero suit, ready for use. Her hips cracked as they widened out, and Samus spread her legs as she adjusted her posture and felt a small tail begin to sprout of from just above her rear, growing longer and becoming brown, thin, and leathery with a furred tip, flicking around her calves of its own free will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Samus looked down at her tail, she noticed her zero suit's material receding up her midriff, shrinking and losing material quickly, the material on her arms and shoulder disappearing completely as her midriff to her rips similarly shrank away to nothing, only a bikini being left to cover her enlarged breasts, and the two straps that held it up as her breasts strained against the fabric, doing nothing to hide the deep cleavage that she now possessed. Down at her waist, a bikini bottom covered her wide hips, a small hole cut for her tail to fit through, while on her feet, her shoes were intact, ending just below the knees as two perfectly functional boots. The only part of her new wardrobe that Samus was happy with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus brought herself back into a steady position and felt her head tingling, moving her hand up to brush her hair of the way of two horns growing up, curving at the ends, while her ears tingled as well as they began to grow longer and wider, pointing at the end as they gained a brown fur on the outside, while being bright pink on the inside, twitching slightly as Samus touched the soft texture of them. Finally, a large metal cowbell formed around her neck to her surprise and dismay, attached to a short but tough wire affixed a band around her neck, and jangled loudly as Samus walked over toward the mirror, jangling even louder as she unsuccessfully tried to pull it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus got to the mirror, her large breasts jiggling to a stop as her wider hips made her steps sway more, Samus slightly enjoying the sloshing sensation that she got when she moved, taking a look at herself. In the mirror, Samus discovered that her skin had paled to a more milky, very light tan colour, and that large brown spots ran up her body and face, two large brown spots on her cheeks.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Samus\u2019 eyes travelled up and down her reflection in the mirror, getting a good look at her swollen breasts, as well as her cow-like tail, ears and horns. Her ears twitched in annoyance as she hefted her much larger breasts, though to her surprise, she didn\u2019t feel any strain on her back, despite the fact that her breasts were so big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus sighed and let go of her breasts as her tail swished back and forth. She wasn\u2019t too upset with her new bovine tail, horns and ears, which was a little surprising to her. Even her enlarged breasts weren\u2019t that big of a deal. No, her real problem with this upgrade was the clothes it had given her. The bikini her Zero Suit had been transformed into was barely holding her breasts in as it was, and the fact that she was wearing a cowbell around her neck was mortifying. The only part of her outfit that was even remotely practical were the boots she was now wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI fail to see how this could be useful,\u201d said Samus to herself. She inhaled deeply, then tried to let out a sigh. Instead, a loud moo emerged from her mouth instead, causing Samus to start blushing in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid... did I just mooooo like a cow?\u201d Samus asked herself, and found herself mooing again when she tried to say the word \u2018moo\u2019. \u201cGuess I did. That could be an inconvenience.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus stepped back from the mirror and walked over to the upgrade terminal. Her breasts bounced up and down with each step, and Samus suspected that the sloshing sensation she could feel inside her breasts was milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she reached the terminal, Samus spotted a notification that had popped up. She tapped it, and information about a new upgrade appeared on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Ranch Upgrade Twooooo Point Oh,\u201d Samus read out loud. \u201cA secondary upgrade, designed tooooo improoooove upon the Ranch Upgrade.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus paused and sighed again, letting out another moo. \u201cWell, it can\u2019t be worse than this. I\u2019ll give it a gooooo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus tapped the screen again, and the terminal spat out another upgrade chip. After a few seconds searching, Samus found the upgrade slot attached to the left hip of her bikini bottoms, and slotted the Ranch Upgrade 2.0 in, next to the original Ranch Upgrade. Once the upgrade was in place, fabric started stretching over Samus\u2019 exposed skin as her Zero Suit formed over her body, and the cowbell around her neck disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this is already an improoooovement,\u201d said Samus, as her skin darkened slightly, returning to her original complexion as the brown spots on her body and cheeks faded. She looked over her shouler at her tail, and noticed that the skin on her tail was now the same colour as the skin on the rest of her body, and the fur tuft at the end of her tail was now the same shade of blonde as her regular hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, once her Zero Suit finished forming, Samus felt a swelling sensation under her breasts. Samus placed a hand under her breasts, and felt something growing under her hand. As the lump under her hand grew, Samus could feel a nipple forming under her hand, and she realised that she was growing a second pair of breasts, right below her original pair. Her second pair of breasts grew until they were the same size that her original pair had grown to, about the size of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her second pair of breasts had finished growing, Samus felt a swelling sensation in her buttocks, and found herself standing on her tiptoes as her feet slid apart. Samus looked down at her feet, and watched as her toes fused together into cloven hooves. Samus\u2019 ankles also shifted slightly, allowing her hooves to better support her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her hooves finished forming, Samus felt pressure building, just above her groin. She could feel something growing, pressing against her Zero Suit as she felt the large growth sloshing with milk. Samus ran her hand over the growth, and felt the outline of a teat under her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this... an udder?\u201d Samus asked herself as the growing sensation stopped. Samus waited a few seconds, to make sure that her transformation was complete. When nothing happened, Samus made her way back over to the mirror. Upon reaching the mirror, Samus looked herself up and down, taking in her new hooves, her second pair of breasts, and what was definitely an udder hanging between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://orig00.deviantart.net/34f0/f/2018/181/e/4/cmsn__space_cow_2__more_milk_by_elek_tronikz-dcfwtdf.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://orig00.deviantart.net/34f0/f/2018/181/e/4/cmsn__space_cow_2__more_milk_b...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Samus react to her new form?</span></div></div>",

As she did so, Samus felt a tight sensation within her breasts and udder. Samus tried to ignore it, but the tightness in her breasts and udder was starting to become painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is wrong with mooooo?\u201d Samus asked as she ran a hand over her udder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a hissing sound to her right, and Samus turned to see a panel opening in the floor. A strange machine rose up through the opening, and the floor sealed itself again once the machine had finished rising up. The machine was a large chair, one that Samus could sit comfortably in with her new form, as there was a small gap in the chair for her tail to go through. However, what caught Samus\u2019 attention was the eight suction cups that were attached to long rubber hoses. Her stomach sank into her udder as she realised what the machine actually was, causing her ears to droop and her tail to swish in anxiety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA milking machine,\u201d said Samus. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</span></div></div>",

However, with each passing second, Samus\u2019 breasts and udder started to feel tighter and swollen as her breasts and udder were filled with more and more milk. The pain Samus was experiencing in her breasts and udder was making it harder to concentrate, so she finally relented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus sighed, letting out a loud moo as she walked over to the milker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, let\u2019s get this ooooover with,\u201d she said as she carefully lowered herself into the chair. Once she was seated, with her tail poking through the gap in the chair, Samus felt around the front of her Zero Suit, and her hand found a zipper that started between her upper pair of breasts. She pulled down on the zipper, pulling it down through her two pairs of cleavage, then over her udder. Once the zipper was as far down as it would go, Samus pulled at her Zero Suit gently, and her four breasts and her udder practically sprang out of her Zero Suit. With her breasts and udder exposed, Samus examined herself again. Visually, there was nothing unusual about her breasts, save for the size and number of her breasts. Samus then examined her udder, and rather than being pink like she had suspected it to be, it was more of a dark tan shade, the same colour as the nipples and areolae on her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sharp pain in her breasts and udder forced Samus out of her self-examination, and reminded her of her current task. She leaned over the side of the chair and picked up one of the suction cups, then held it up so she could examine it carefully. After a few seconds of examination, Samus mooed out a sigh, then placed the suction cup on one of the four teats on her udder. She quickly set up the other seven suction cups on her teats and nipples. Once the suction cups were in place, Samus pressed a green button on the arm of the chair, turning the milker on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the milker was turned on, Samus felt a gentle tugging on her nipples and teats, and a wave of relief washed over her as the pressure in her breasts and udder was relieved. Samus mooed loudly as the machine worked, pulling the milk out of her breasts and udder and pumping it through the rubber hoses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about five minutes, the machine stopped, and Samus had been emptied of her milk. While it had certainly been a strange experience, it also wasn\u2019t an unpleasant one. Sitting up, Samus pulled the suction cups off her nipples and teats, then stood up and walked over to the mirror. She left her four breasts and her udder out of her Zero Suit as she walked, causing her breasts to bounce uncontrollably, and her udder to swing back and forth. When she looked at herself in the mirror, Samus noticed that her breasts were now back to the size they had been before she had used the Ranch Upgrades, and that her udder was now smaller as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy breasts and udder must grow bigger as they fill with milk,\u201d said Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus tucked her breasts and udder back into her Zero Suit and zipped the Suit back up. Once she was decent again, Samus thought about what she would do next.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The original Ranch Upgrade had not impressed Samus, mostly due to the skimpy bikini her Zero Suit had transformed into. However, to her surprise, she found that she actually really liked the changes the Ranch Upgrade 2.0 had made to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what?\u201d Samus said to herself. \u201cI think I\u2019ll keep this. At least for when I\u2019m not out in the field.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe extra breasts and the udder would still take some getting used to, as would her hooves. However, she also felt stronger than she did before. It seemed the Ranch Upgrade 2.0 had improved her muscles, most likely so she could still move when her breasts and udder were swollen with milk. Speaking of which...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus made her way back over to the computer, her tail swishing back and forth as she walked. Now that she\u2019d been emptied of milk, her breasts and udder no longer bounced uncomfortably as she walked, and were instead held snugly by her Zero Suit. Once she reached the terminal, she tapped the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComputer,\u201d Samus said, causing the terminal to chirp in response. \u201cWhat can you tell me about the Ranch Upgrades?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe terminal chirped again, and information began to fill the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Ranch Upgrade,\u201d the computer screen said. \u201cOriginally intended to increase the user\u2019s musculature using bovine genetic material, unexpected side effects occurred during development. These side effects included ear changes, horn and tail growth, breast expansion and increased lactation. The Ranch Upgrade was then redesigned to intentionally use these features. The Ranch Upgrade 2.0 was designed to further incorporate bovine genetic material into the user, including extra breasts, an udder, and hooves. Users of the Ranch Upgrade produce approximately 1 litre of milk per breast over a twenty-four hour period. Users of the Ranch Upgrade 2.0 produce approximately 2 litres of milk per breast or teat over a twenty-four hour period. Users of the Ranch Upgrade can store approximately 4 litres of milk per breast before experiencing discomfort. Users of the Ranch Upgrade 2.0 can store approximately 8 litres of milk per breast or teat before experiencing discomfort. Storing milk without being milked results in breast and/or udder expansion. The user\u2019s breasts and/or udders will return to their regular size after being milked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Samus. \u201cSo, how much milk did I produce today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c71.3284 litres of milk were produced by Samus Aran,\u201d the computer screen read. \u201cExtra milk was produced by Samus Aran during the initial activation of the Ranch Upgrade and the Ranch Upgrade 2.0.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm,\u201d said Samus. \u201cIs this milk safe to drink?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAffirmative,\u201d the computer screen read. \u201cMilk produced by the Ranch Upgrade and the Ranch Upgrade 2.0 is designed to be highly nutritious and disease-free.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d said Samus. \u201cCan I use the Ranch Upgrade 2.0 without using the original Ranch Upgrade?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNegative,\u201d said the computer screen. \u201cThe Ranch Upgrade 2.0 requires the Ranch Upgrade to function properly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn,\u201d muttered Samus. \u201cIs it safe to remove the Ranch Upgrades?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWarning!\u201d said the computer screen. \u201cOnly remove the Ranch Upgrades after milking is complete. Removing the Ranch Upgrades while milk is still stored in the user\u2019s breasts and udders can cause damage to the user\u2019s mammary glands. Other negative side effects are possible, but unknown at this time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood to know,\u201d said Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving finished reading the new information, Samus idly rubbed a hand on her udder as she thought about what to do next. Maybe there were upgrades that were compatible with the Ranch Upgrade. Or maybe she could try and find an upgrade for her Power Suit, something that might be useful in combat. As her hand massaged her udder, Samus idly wondered if permanently installing the Ranch Upgrades was possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Samus decide to do?</span></div></div>",

The terminal spat out a third Upgrade chip, and Samus slotted the chip into her Zero Suit\u2019s upgrade slot. As soon as she did so, the fabric of her Zero Suit started to shift. Her Zero Suit quickly retreated up her legs, exposing her udder and leaving her lower half naked. However, Samus soon felt her lower body starting to shift, similar to the changes she had experienced when she\u2019d installed the Ranch Upgrade 2.0.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus could feel a swelling sensation in her hips and butt, and Samus looked down to see a pair of lumps forming on the front of her hips, as her butt seemed to be getting bigger. However, after a few seconds, she realised that her butt wasn\u2019t actually growing. Rather, her body was moving forward as her hips split apart. The two lumps on the front of her body quickly into a second pair of cow\u2019s legs, complete with hooves. As Samus\u2019 new front hooves touched the ground, she felt her rear legs moving backwards as a cow\u2019s body filled the space between her legs. She could also feel her back legs changing position to more closely match those of a cow\u2019s. Her new body soon began growing blonde fur, the same colour as the hair on her head. Her Zero Suit then shifted slightly, forming a belt around her waist where her Suit now ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus\u2019 transformation stopped as suddenly as it had started. Her lower body was now that of a cow\u2019s, and her udder now hung between her rear pair of legs. Samus slowly lifted her front left leg off the ground, then set it down again. She did the same with her other three legs, getting a feel for having four legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, the Dairy Upgrade turns me into a dairy cow,\u201d said Samus as her tail swished back and forth. \u201cSomehow, I\u2019m not surprised.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Samus feel about the Dairy Upgrade?</span></div></div>",

The upgrade must come with milk pre-installed.\u201d <br>\r\nNo problem though. She would just remove the upgrade and be done with the milk too. Upon inspection of the terminal though, she was dismayed to see an error message. <br>\r\n<b>MAXIMUM NUMBER OF USES REACHED. TIME UNTIL FURTHER USE OF TERMINAL: 6 DAYS, 23 HOURS, 56 MINUTES</b><br>\r\n\u201cAn entire week I\u2019m stuck like this?!\u201d exclaimed Samus. Great, just great. Now she was going to be a cow for 7 days. She didn\u2019t have much time to think of the future right now though, as her attention was brought back to the present by the tingling in her udders. <br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I got this,\u201d she said. \u201cMilking myself can\u2019t be that hard.\u201d <br>\r\nSamus reached down to grab at her udders only to discover that they were beyond her reach no matter what angle she tried. After exhausting herself by contorting her upper body in every way imaginable, she realized that she would need some help, and idea which did not particularly appeal to her, but which she realized was the only possibly solution. <br>\r\nSamus clip clopped out of the upgrade terminal room in search of someone. Fortunately she stumbled across a janitor mopping the halls and decided that he was as good a milkmaid as any. <br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me sir,\u201d said she. \u201cThis is going to sound a little weird but, um, can you, uh... milk me?\u201d <br>\r\nThe janitor seemed to recover from his initial shock at seeing a cowtaur fairly quickly. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat, like, your udders?\u201d <br>\r\nSamus rolled her eyes. <br>\r\n\u201cYes of course my udders you idiot. I can\u2019t reach them myself so I need someone to milk me. Not just today either. I\u2019m stuck this way for at least a week.\u201d <br>\r\nThe janitor wasn\u2019t fond of being called an idiot, and a sly grin crept across his face as he considered his options. <br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d He said. \u201cI\u2019ll milk you. On one condition.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cAnd what would that be?\u201d said the newly-minted cowtaur. <br>\r\n\u201cI want to milk ALL of your udders. All six of them.\u201d <br>\r\nSamus, despite having felt the tingle in her, erm, human udders as well, was flabbergasted at the idea. Still, she did need help...</span></div></div>",

Another Upgrade chip was ejected from the slot next to the screen, and Samus picked it up. She slotted the Saloon Upgrade next to the two Ranch Upgrades, and waited for the transformation to kick in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t have to wait long. Samus\u2019 Zero Suit began to shift around, changing into a new form. A split formed at her hips, separating her Zero Suit into a top and a bottom. Buttons began forming along her Zero Suit as the fabric lightened slightly, and a dark blue plaid pattern formed. Samus could feel her skin itch slightly as the slick material of her Zero Suit loosened and billowed out into plain fabric, and her sleeves began to roll themselves up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the top of her Zero Suit transformed into a flannel shirt, Samus looked down at the bottoms of her Zero Suit. Much like the top half, the lower half of her Zero Suit also grew loose, and grew even darker. The fabric began to change, changing into denim as her Zero Suit\u2019s lower half changed into a pair of jeans. Finally, her boots began to change as well, changing back into the boots that Samus had gained when she had first used the original Ranch Upgrade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there was still one last change. Samus felt a weight forming on her head, and looked over at the nearby mirror. Samus could see a wide-brimmed hat had appeared on her head, and the left and right sides of the brim had been popped up, to avoid getting caught on her horns. Samus could also feel a shifting as her horns grew a little larger and a little wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the changes had stopped, Samus walked over to the mirror and began examining herself. Her new shirt covered up her four breasts and her udder, and Samus could also feel a bra holding up all four of her breasts. She could even feel something holding her udder in place as well, as if the Upgrade had also created a bra of sorts for her udder. Her new jeans fit nicely, and Samus could feel the tough leather boots on her feet. Once she finished looking herself over, Samus looked up at her reflection. Something about this outfit seemed vaguely familiar, but for the life of her, she couldn\u2019t figure out why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat \u2018n tarnation is up with this outfit?\u201d Samus said, then frowned. \u201cAn\u2019 what\u2019s with the southern drawl, y\u2019all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Samus feel about the Cowgirl Upgrade?</span></div></div>",

Samus picked up the chip and added it to the two Ranch Upgrades. As soon as she added the Elastic Upgrade, Samus felt a tingling sensation in her breasts and her udder. The tingling sensation only lasted for a few seconds, but after the tingling stopped, her breasts and udder still felt strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm,\u201d said Samus. She began gently massaging her upper right breast, and almost immediately noticed something strange. Samus was able to press her hands much further into her breasts than normal, and she didn\u2019t feel even an ounce of pain as she did so. She then grabbed her upper right breast with both hands and pulled on it. Samus watched as her breast stretched out like elastic, then let her breast go. Her extended breast flopped down, remaining at the length she had stretched it to. Samus focused on her upper right breast for a second, and the breast began shrinking back to its normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus quickly checked her other three breasts, then checked her udder. Her udder and all four of her breasts were now incredibly stretchy, as if they were made of elastic. Samus then imagined her breasts and udder growing. To her surprise, her breasts and udder began to stretch out, growing larger as she watched. With a bit of focus, Samus was able to bring her breasts and udder back to their normal sizes. Samus then tried to stretch her arms, the same way she had stretched her breasts and udder. However, her arms stubbornly refused to stretch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, the Volume Upgrade allows me to increase the size of my breasts and my udder,\u201d Samus mused. \u201cBut why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe computer terminal dinged, and Samus turned to read the notification.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVolume Upgrade analysis complete,\u201d said the computer screen. \u201cThe Volume Upgrade allows the user\u2019s breasts and udder to greatly increase in size, allowing for more milk to be stored before the user experiences discomfort.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Samus. \u201cAny limits on how big my breasts and udder can get?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnknown,\u201d said the computer screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said Samus sarcastically, shaking her head as her tail twitched in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Samus feel about the Volume Upgrade?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite how odd the changes it had made were, Samus found herself oddly enjoying the Ranch Upgrade 2.0. So much so that she wasn't sure she wanted to give it up. It was quite the contrast from her initial reaction to the original Ranch Upgrade, but with a more practical outfit, the bovine elements and extra breasts didn't really bother her. In fact, there was something about this new form that just seemed appealing to her, though she couldn't quite put her finger on what it was. The only part she could say she didn't like was the involuntary mooing, which she seemed to be getting the hang of now. However, requiring both chips to be inserted into her Zero Suit's upgrade slots was a little inconvenient. If there was a way to install the upgrade permanently, she wouldn't have to worry about that, though, and she more she thought about it, the more appealing of an option that sounded like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Computer,\" she asked aloud, \"Is there a way to permanently install the Ranch Upgrade 2.0?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Affirmative,\" the screen read. \"On request, a chip may be produced that will permanently integrate any currently installed upgrades into the user's DNA.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus hummed to herself, seriously considering accepting this chip. However, before she did so, she needed more information. \"If I permanently install the upgrade, is there any way to get my original body back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negative. Permanently installing an upgrade may grant access to the Human Upgrade, which can suppress added features to allow the user to be compatible with other upgrades, however these features will not be removed entirely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, so if I choose this, there's no going back,\" Samus mumbled to herself. It was a somewhat daunting thought to lose her original form forever, but considering she was beginning to like her new form better than her normal body, perhaps that wasn't really a bad thing. \"What about my Power Suit?\" she asked. She hadn't spotted any Power Suit upgrades in the list that were supposed to be used in tandem with either of the Ranch Upgrades, which unfortunately meant her suit probably didn't fit her anymore, considering the ways her body had been shifted about and the parts she'd grown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The facility is capable of altering your Power Suit or spaceship if you desire it,\" the screen displayed succinctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My ship?\" Samus understood why her Power Suit would need to be altered, but she wasn't sure why exactly her ship would need any altering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seating may be altered to accommodate the tail and wider stance of the Ranch Upgrade 2.0. In addition, a milking machine may be installed within your ship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, interesting,\" Samus mused, a slight smile on her face as she reflected on her first milking experience. The idea had seemed a bit off-putting at first, but it had actually been rather enjoyable all things said and done. She let out a contented moo that was really supposed to be a sigh. \"Alright, computer, I'd like to permanently install the Ranch Upgrades.\" It may leave her permanently part bovine, and it would certainly be difficult to explain to anyone who knew her, but she had decided that this was the body she wanted to keep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood.\" With a bit of a whirring noise, the computer spat out a new chip, which Samus promptly inserted into her upgrade slot, right next to the Ranch Upgrades. She waited for something to happen, but nothing seemed to change. That, of course, should have been expected, as it was simply making the change permanent, not changing her further. Before Samus had a chance to ask whether the chip was working or not, new text popped up on the screen once more. \"Installation complete. It is now safe to remove the upgrade chips.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slight amount of hesitation, Samus carefully reached down to her hip and began to pull the chips out. First was the one that had permanently installed the upgrades, followed by the Ranch Upgrade 2.0. She half expected for something to have gone wrong, and for her to revert to the original Ranch Upgrade's form upon pulling the 2.0 chip out, but that was simply not the case. Her body remained unchanging, breasts, udders, and hooves still intact, all properly clad in her Zero Suit. A smile graced her face as she pulled out the last remaining chip, the original Ranch Upgrade. And with that, it was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... this is me now,\" she said to herself, staring down at her body. It still seemed a bit strange to her, but she was happy with it, and in the end, that was what mattered. \"Hm, what to do now?\" she muttered, crossing her arms beneath her lower breasts. She obviously couldn't leave the space station yet. After all, she still needed to have her Power Suit and ship altered to suit her new form, but perhaps that could wait. After all, the computer had mentioned a Human Upgrade that could make her compatible with the upgrades that had previously been available to her. And even without the Human Upgrade, perhaps there were some upgrade that were just natively compatible with the Ranch Upgrades. Even as she was, standing there in the space station as a hybrid of human and cow, she had a feeling things were only just beginning.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cComputer?\u201d said Samus. \u201cYou mentioned a Human Upgrade? Can you tell me more about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAffirmative,\u201d said the computer screen. \u201cThe Human Upgrade can be applied to suppress additional features that were created by permanent installation of the Ranch Upgrades, allowing the user to activate other Upgrades that are incompatible with the Ranch Upgrades.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Samus. \u201cIf I use the Human Upgrade, can I use my Power Suit without modifying it to suit my new form?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAffirmative, however, using the Human Upgrade for extended periods could have unexpected side effects.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSide effects?\u201d said Samus. \u201cWhat sort of side effects?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Unknown at this time,\u201d said the terminal. \u201cApplying the Human Upgrade is required to determine potential side effects.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus mooed in annoyance. If she wanted to see what these potential side effects were, she\u2019d have to try the Human Upgrade in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d said Samus. \u201cGive me the Human Upgrade.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAffirmative,\u201d said the computer screen, and another upgrade chip popped out. Samus slotted the chip into her Zero Suit and waited. After a few seconds, she felt a strange pushing feeling in her feet. Samus felt her legs shifting as her heels settled onto the ground again. She was standing on flat feet, but Samus could tell that, under her Zero Suit, her toes were still fused together into a hoof. She also felt a pushing on her butt as her leg muscles were redistributed, making her legs look more human again. Samus then felt a tugging on her tail, and looked over her shoulder to see her tail being pulled back into her body. However, her tail wasn\u2019t pulled back in completely. A small tuft of blonde fur poked out of a small hole at the base of her spine, at the end of her now incredibly short tail. The tugging sensation then moved to her udder, and Samus could feel her Zero Suit pull her udder back up between her legs. She also felt the same sensation on her lower breasts. After a few seconds, her udder and her lower breasts were flush against her body, completely undetectable to an outside observer. However, as Samus noticed when she rubbed her hand over her belly, her lower breasts and udder were still present. She could feel the nipples of her lower breasts under her fingers, as well as the teats of her udder, despite their diminutive size. Finally, she felt a tugging on her ears and her horns. Her ears returned to a mostly human shape, though they were a little larger than normal, and were slightly pointed. Samus\u2019 horns also retracted into her head, but like her tail, they weren\u2019t completely hidden. Samus could feel two small bumps underneath her hair where her horns were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m human again,\u201d said Samus as she looked herself over. \u201cSort of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she examined herself, she frowned. Samus could still see the zipper on the front of her Zero Suit that had allowed her to expose her breasts and udder without actually taking the Zero Suit off. However, that zipper was actually a part of the Ranch Upgrade, not a normal feature of her suit. Why would the zipper still be there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComputer, I\u2019ve used the Human Upgrade,\u201d said Samus. \u201cCan you tell me more about it now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScanning... scan complete,\u201d said the terminal. \u201cThe Human Upgrade has reduced the natural size of the user\u2019s lower breasts and udder, and has lowered the milk production rate to approximately five hundred millilitres of milk in a twenty-four hour period. Users of the Human Upgrade can store approximately two litres of milk before experiencing discomfort. Storing milk without being milked will result in breast and udder growth. This will make the user\u2019s lower breasts and udders increasingly visible. Users of the Human Upgrade can store a maximum of four litres of milk per breast or teat. Once this limit has been reached, users of the Human Upgrade will lactate uncontrollably until milked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm,\u201d said Samus as she thought. It seemed that she could use the Human Upgrade for a few days before any potential side effects occurred. Not only that, but her lower breasts and udder would still grow as they filled with milk, which would make them more visible. Not only that, but using the Human Upgrade for more than a week would mean she\u2019d start lactating, and she wouldn\u2019t be able to stop until she milked herself. That could cause a problem if she was in the field for an extended period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus mooed in contemplation. The Human Upgrade hid her new bovine features well enough, which would make it useful if she had to interact with other people outside of her Power Suit, particularly the Galactic Federation. Speaking of which, the Human Upgrade would allow her to use the Power Suit, without modifying it to fit her new body. Not only that, but she could now use the other upgrades that weren\u2019t compatible with the Ranch Upgrades. However, she\u2019d still need to milk herself, even with the Human Upgrade. And if she went too long without milking, her breasts and udder would start leaking, which wouldn\u2019t happen if she wasn\u2019t using the Human Upgrade. Not only that, but it was possible that using another Upgrade could have unexpected side effects that she wouldn\u2019t know about until it was too late. After all, the computer hadn\u2019t been able to tell her what side effects the Human Upgrade might have until after she\u2019d already used it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Samus decide to do?</span></div></div>",

When she selected this one, it came up with a notice that said she needed to be wearing both the Power suit and her zero suit, and was interested by both its name and that extra fact. She took the chip from the machine and inserted it into her Power suit, waiting for it to apply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Samus' suit began to glow, becoming brighter and brighter until suddenly, it disappeared. Samus was left in her zero suit and looked around, wondering what had happened to her suit. She looked down, and saw a small orange lamp. She knew the whole genie part, but why had her suit turned into this? Before she could think any further, her zero suit began to glow, and she put down the lamp as her zero suit began to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus' suit's material began to change as usual, this time changing from the hard latex-like material to an extremely soft silk, before beginning to loosen up and recede as usual. It receded from her hips up, bearing her midriff, and up her arms and shoulders as usual, reducing her top half to a small cleavage bearing strapless bikini like top, the same blue as her regular suit. From her hips down, up her legs it became looser and looser, billowing out as it became thinner and started to become transparent, showing off her legs through the thin layer of silk. Her shoes became softer and flatter, the skin showing off as they became a pair of blue slippers, gold bands at her ankles stopping her loose pants from tripping her up. A bikini bottom remained underneath the transparent fabric, and Samus began to walk over to the mirror to take a look at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked, gold bracelets formed around her neck, on her wrists and upper arms, her hairband becoming one of gold as well, while a thin veil formed over her mouth and nose. Her skin began to darker, taking on a rich tan as she reached the mirror, taking a look at herself. She looked like some kind of harem dancer, and she wasn't sure that she approved. She still wondered where the Genie part came in. Maybe something to do with the lamp her suit had turned into\u2026 She went to pick the lamp up, when a thin trail of smoke emerged from it, Samus following the smoke with her eyes as she saw that it was connected to her! She began to feel strange at her legs, the feeling rising up her body to her hips as she discovered that her legs were changing into the same smoke that came out of the lamp! She began to get pulled closer to the lamp, before rushing suddenly towards it, everything going dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Samus woke up, she found herself on what appeared to be a giant bed, soft sheets and pillows lying around the place. The bed seemed to take up the entire floor, and she discovered that she was in a small room with golden walls and no exit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she change mentally?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Patiently, Samus still waited within her new home, eager to be released and see the world again. Of course, she knew she had to be patient as well; after all, whoever found her was to be her new owner. Even if the lamp, when she thought of it, was quite comfortable and beautiful, it still was basically a cage. After all, she could not freely leave it of her own volition--until someone could free her, she was doomed to be imprisoned in this beautiful room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it wasn't all bad; after all, she could change the interior to be whatever she wanted, adding in and taking away anything--even if, for the moment, she was content to simply back and relax, waiting for her savior. Moreover, it gave her plenty of time to practice her new powers. After all, what was a genie without magic powers. And if she was to serve her owner properly, she needed to make sure that she was experienced enough in her new abilities to do so!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt still amazed Samus that technology could have achieved this level of power; regardless of whether or not she was truly supernatural, Samus had to admit her powers were nearly-godlike. Yet, they came from a scientific source; a simple chip was all it took to turn her from a determined and skilled bounty hunter with a battlesuit into a being of myth. She still wasn't sure if her new powers were even mystical in origin--for all intents and purposes, her abilities came from a technology she did not understand yet. Perhaps Arthur C. Clarke said it perfectly, \"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven then, Samus wondered what was the point of making it a \"genie upgrade\". Why not share it with the galaxy, or let a person have the power freely? She supposed that, maybe, it would be better to put restrictions. After all, even if she intended to use the powers nobly, who was to say she wouldn't become corrupt with power? After all, that teenage spider-kid did say perhaps one of the most accurate and timeless proverbs ever, \"With great power comes great responsibility.\" Perhaps that was the price of being a genie; to contain all the power of a goddess, but only able to use it to serve others. As much as she desired to be free, Samus knew in her heart it was better to remain here. After all, despite her powers, she was, at the very end of the day, but a finite, flawed human. If the price of being granted ultimate power was to be shackled and made a willing slave, then Samus would wear her chains proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she finished her thoughts, she felt something new--her lamp was being picked up! Getting as giddy as a schoolgirl, she waited for the figure to rub the lamp and summon her. Somehow sensing that the lamp was being rubbed, Samus knew she had finally been freed. Rushing out as a column of smoke, she left her home out of the tip of the lamp, soon materializing her body above the waist as herself in her new garb. Pressing her hands together, as if in prayer, she bowed respectfully before her savior, saying, \"Greetings...\"</span></div></div>",

He was about her age, with pale skin, brown eyes, and scraggly black hair. His uniform was not of the Federation's military, so he was most likely something like a janitor or assistant, perhaps come to check to see where she was after her disappearance. Smiling warmly, she continued, \"I am Samus Aran, former Bounty Hunter of the Federation and Genie of the Lamp. I am yours to command; do as you wish with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Master looked at her strange, surprised by what he saw, \"Uhh... what just happened here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly amused by her Master's ignorance, Samus giggled lightly and responded, \"Why, it's quite simple, my Master. You see, I was here in the Hall of Upgrades, experimenting with the various new chips when I came upon the Genie Upgrade. Upon inserting it, it transformed me into the being you see before you.\" Looking towards the lamp, she solemnly continued, \"I was trapped in that lamp for so long... unable to do anything but wait until someone could find and free me again...\" Smiling again, she turned back to him. \"But now, you have freed me! As a show of gratitude, I have pledged myself to you as your humble and obedient genie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I get, like, three wishes or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking for a second, knowledge flooded into Samus's mind, helping her to understand a core concept about the Upgrade. \"Uhh... not exactly, Master. You see... you're the one who decides how many wishes you will get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, seriously?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... but there is a cost. The more wishes you desire, the more restrictions I have in regards to what I can grant you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I could just grant you one single wish, then return to my lamp to await either you or my new owner, but it could whatever you wanted. Next, I could grant you several wishes, with the minimum being three. But even then, I could not bring back the dead, kill someone directly, or control the emotions of others. Also, I could not exceed fifteen total wishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why fifteen? And aren't you supposed to only be unable to make people fall in love?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... love is an emotion.\" Her Master nodded understandingly, saying a quiet, \"Ohhh...\" Continuing on, she said, \"As for the limit, it's this; for every six extra wishes, I have one more restriction. One is that I cannot grant you wishes that would change the fundamentals of the universe. So, for instance, I couldn't have you control the Federation, be given power over your own planet, or destroy any planet or universe.\" She thought again for a second, \"Though now that I think about it, I think the upgrade prevents me from that as well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man, a bit confused at her reaction, asked, \"And the last restriction?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing she was getting distracted, Samus continued, \"Oh, uh, yes! The last restriction is that my powers cannot affect another genie. Technically speaking, I can still <i>create</i> other genies, if you desire to have a harem, my master...\" She gave him a wink, which made him blush. \"But even then, my powers could not do something like, say, negate a wish they have granted or personally harm them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... but that doesn't answer my question about the limit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's simple, Master; I can also offer you an infinite amount of wishes. However, in doing so, I will have to have all the restrictions I've mentioned. There might even be others I am unaware of, though I'm not sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Master looked to be in deep thought, but Samus waited patiently. She did not know what his plans were, but she hoped that she could please him nonetheless. In the end, he finally said, \"Alright, I want...\"</span></div></div>",

She recalled the Koi as being an obscure kind of fish, and decided that she might as well just pick something random. She took the chip from the machine and inserted it into her zero suit, waiting for the upgrade to apply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs usual her zero suit began to glow and began to loosen, but this time it actually began to get thicker, the material turning into a soft fabric as it became extremely thick, weighing heavily on Samus' body until it began to change. Her gloves disappeared, leaving her hands bare as a pair of long, large sleeves fell over them, as the heels of her shoes similarly vanished, the heel forming into the sole of a pair of wooden sandals to replace them. The material on her legs detached from her legs, forming together into a very long and thick dress, almost reaching the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was happening, Samus stood very still, her mind being altered by the upgrade as her clothes changed. Most of her aggressive tendencies were removed and replaced with a very quiet disposition, among other changes, and she waited patiently for the rest of the upgrade to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the fabric on her chest loosened further and began to droop down, a large sash and band tied itself around her, holding the kimono that Samus had suddenly recognized her dress to be up, a large ribbon being tied around the back. The kimono itself remained most the solid blues of her zero suit, high necked and showing very little skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAssuming her changes to be over, Samus began to quietly make her way over to the mirror when she noticed a lock of hair over her eyes, darkening as she watched. She grabbed her ponytail and moved it into her field of view, watching it as it darkened to a midnight black, surprised by the change, and not bothered. She let go as her sleeve rolled back to reveal that her skin was starting to pale, losing its healthy colour as it turned almost completely white, losing any roughness and imperfections along the way. Samus reached the mirror to take a look at herself, looking over her changes and newly acquired black hair and white skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked, a few orange and black spots began to form over her face, and her ears began to grow longer and thinner, turning scaly as they grew bigger as well, until they resembled a fish's fin, twitching slightly when she touched them. She felt a piercing sensation on her neck, and looked in the mirror to see a set of gills on her neck, flapping open and closed as she breathed. But just as she thought her changes were over, she began to feel a strange sensation coming from her rear, and felt a stretching sensation growing larger and larger until there was a rustling sound on the ground as a long, scaly, fishlike tail with a large fin on the end poked out from underneath her kimono. Samus found herself able to move it after a few tries, the tales curling and moving around as she experimented.</span></div></div>",

When her legs, arms, and shoulders were bare, the material began to thicken, while it also disappeared from the back, leaving Samus' back exposed. This was only momentary though, as Samus began to feel something growing on her back, something heavy and hard. She began to turn to see what it was, as the remaining material on her front began to harden, Samus looking at that, raising her arms to her sides as it began to stiffen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe material hardened to a tough, shell-like material, thickening to become at least an inch or two thick, Samus starting to become weighed down by the additional weight, the hard thing feeling strangely organic and natural on her, even it if was loose around her arms and legs. When it was finished changing, it resembled a very solid swimsuit or corset design, matching her figure tightly, showing off some of her cleavage at the top of it. The growth on her back seemed to connect to it, and Samus turned to see a large brown shell growing on her back, reaching from her shoulders to just above her ass, much wider than her and extremely heavy, making it difficult for her to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Samus struggled to keep upright, it began to feel lighter as Samus experienced a slightly stretching feeling on her skin as it began to change. Her arms and legs began to take on a much tougher and more hardened look to them, losing their slender appearance as they grew thicker, showing off some muscle as underneath her shell, Samus' abdominals took on a similarly hardened look. As she grew a bit thicker, she seemed to widen as well to match the thicker limbs, pressing more tightly into the shell she was wearing, her arms and legs snugly fitting into the holes around them, while her chest swelled as well, pressing against her shell and showing off more cleavage. The additional effect of this is that Samus' new muscles helped her support the weight of the massive shell on her back, Samus easily moving over towards the mirror to take a better look at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she moved, Samus noticed that she was much less flexible with the stiff shell, and couldn't move her head back quite as much anymore, but she managed to maintain her speed fairly well, if not her grace. She reached the mirror and took a look at herself, now clad in the large brown shell, a very light brown on the front, naked apart from it, noting her much bulkier figure on her arms and legs and, even more notably, the two large grey tubes sticking out from above both her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered just what they were for, and noticed that the shell seemed to be part of her body, and wondered if she could make them do anything. She began to feel a rumbling pressure from her shell at these thoughts, and focused it, turning to face away from the mirror as the pressure quickly grew, before being forced out in the form of a huge burst of water from the two apparent cannons, thundering out it a huge wave and slamming into the wall with a loud clang. Samus managed to keep her balance thanks to the large additional weight of the shell, and was surprised by the result of her efforts, which had amounted to a very wet floor and two huge dents in the wall, caved in by the immense power of the water.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"The Kangaroo upgrade.\" Samus said, selecting the upgrade. She took the chip from the computer and inserted it into her zero suit, waiting for the changes to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first effect started with her feet, her heeled shoes disappearing as her the fabric from her knees down disappeared. Samus readjusted her feet on the cold metal, but noticed a stretching feeling coming from her feet and looked down. Her foot remained the same width, but began to stretch longer and longer, her toes on each foot merging into three equally size larger ones, her toes bumping up into larger curved ridges, slightly stubby at the end, her toenails turning black and lengthening small and sharp claws, with thick black pads underneath the toes and her heels. She gasped slightly as her legs from her ankles down painfully cracked backwards, turning digitigrade and gaining an extra joint at the mid-ankle, lengthening and bending back forward at that joint to let her balance on her altered feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus reacted to her painful modifications by stumbling backwards into the nearest wall for balance, her posture turning bow-legged as she held herself up, naturally bending over slightly at her knees rather than standing up straight. She looked down at her new legs and noticed that her thighs seemed to be thickening as her new legs from the knee down thinner, muscle building as her thighs grew larger while the rest was less than half as thick as it was before. Samus leaned against the wall for support, and almost yelped slightly as her backside was pushed painfully away from it by a quickly growing large and thick tail, pink and naked but large and thick, curving as it dropped to her ankles and waved as she moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus felt slightly colder at her waist and looked down to see the fabric over her abdominals receding, leaving her midriff bared and her zero suit separated into pants and a top.  Her skin began to tingle, and she saw thin, light brown fur start to sprout from her skin, growing thicker as the sleeves of her zero suit disappeared up to her shoulders, leaving two small fingerless gloves behind as her arms were left bare. She blinked a few times as the fur also sprouted on her face, and began to walk over to the mirror to take a better look at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Samus walked, she found that on her new legs, she couldn't move very well traditionally, and found small hops to be much faster and more natural, if slightly strange looking. She kept to her slower normal walk as she reached the mirror, now covered in light brown fur, and took a look at herself. Apart from her wardrobe changes and new legs, tail, and fur, which she noticed to turn much lighter, and almost white along the backside of her legs, arms, tail, and the front of her chest and face up to her nose, the top of which was of the darker brown fur, she seemed to be otherwise untouched, Until she felt her ears tingle and watched them start to flatten as another pair sprouted higher up, Samus parting her hair around the large, round and slightly floppy new ears, twitching slightly as they were touched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could stop to think that her changes were over, her nose flattened, a black bit tipping the flat end with her nostrils shrinking to match it, and felt and watched her mouth and nose elongate out a bit, becoming more of a short snout than a normal face. Finally, Samus felt a tickling sensation on her belly, and looked down to see a furry pouch there, Samus puzzled as to the possible use of it. Her changes finally over, Samus opened and closed her new mouth a few times as she got used to it, before stepping away from the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting used to her new method of movement, she decided try out an experimental leap, and pushed herself up into a jump. She underestimated her legs power and almost fell on her face when she leaped high enough to touch the roof, luckily landing safely on her legs, able to take the fall easily. She wondered just what she could do with leg power like that if she were to kick someone. She also found her hands naturally raising into a position that she normally reserved for practicing boxing, and wondered if she'd be any good at using that in combination with her legs.</span></div></div>",

She recalled that there were a few alien species named after the original human term, and that involved snakes. She took the chip from the machine and inserted it into her zero suit, waiting for the changes to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Samus felt her scalp begin to tingle, and immediately felt it with her hand, running it through her hair to see what was happening. However, she couldn't find any immediate change, and decided to give it a minute. After half a minute, she noticed a rather thick lock of hair drop down over her eyes. She brushed it out of the way, only to have another drop down. And another. Which was odd, since she kept the front half of her hair specifically cut to keep out of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to walk towards the mirror to take a look at herself, and stopped suddenly as the band holding her ponytail snapped, sending her hair cascading down her back, reaching more than halfway down and continuing. Well, Samus thought, at least she knew what was happening now. And what was happening was that her hair just kept growing and growing, until her bangs draped over her eyes, her side-bangs had grown longer enough to fall from the sides of her neck all the way down past her breasts, and her hair at the back reached her feet, as wide as she was, almost draping along the ground as she stood there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrushing more hair out of her eyes, Samus decided that she might as well go have a proper look at herself in the mirror, and started to walk towards it. Started being the key word, as she quickly stepped on her huge hair, getting it tangled underneath her feet and legs as she walked, almost tripping over as she quickly stopped, unable to see from all the hair in her eyes, wishing that her hair would just get out of her eyes so she could at least see where she was going.  And to her surprise, her hair suddenly parted away from her eyes, and staying that way, even when she shook it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised at the development, she wished that her hair would move away from her legs, her long tresses quickly moving away from her legs. Feeling that she'd grasped what was going on, she wished it to wrap around her torso to test what she could do, her hair quickly wrapping around said torso to comply. As she tightened the grip slightly, she began to feel a slight sensation of pressure coming from her hair, like a very muffled version of the feeling she'd get from grasping something in her own hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to test out her new control, Samus walked towards a few crates lying around, filled with miscellaneous bits of electronics and materials, a smaller canister lying on top. She willed her hair to form into multiple tendrils, attempting to grab the canister. Her attempts were clumsy at first and just knocked over the can, but she concentrated and quickly got used to it, grabbing the can and bringing it back to her.  From how easily she held it, she figured that her hair must be at least as strong as her arms were, although she wouldn't trust it to pull herself up anything.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"The Naga/Medusa upgrade.\" Samus said, selecting the upgrade using a thin lock of hair. All in all, she had found the Medusa upgrade fairly useful, despite the extra bulk of hair, and when she had found out that it was compatible with the Naga upgrade, she figured it might be interesting to see what it meant. She also couldn't help but feel like there was some connection between the word Medusa and snakes, but she couldn't quite remember what\u2026 She took the upgrade from the machine and inserted it into her zero suit, waiting for the changes to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Samus felt her hair become a bit lighter, and there was some light rustling as she looked down to see huge swathes of her hair falling apart, leaving her feet covered in hair as her hair's length was left at halfway down her back. Samus stepped out of the hair, and noticed that her hair seemed to be getting thicker, and tying itself into ponytail-like tendrils as it swung close to her vision as she watched her step. She grabbed one that fell past her eyes,  brushing the rest to the sides of her head to join the others, leaving her forehead bare, and took a look at it, the texture of her hair seeming to be rougher, Samus looking like she had long and thick dreadlocks, although ones almost as wide as her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was about to head over to the mirror to take a better look at herself, when her hair started to feel heavier in her hand and on her back, and she took another look at it, the material of her hair changing before her eyes. The hairs merged together, forming a round and mostly smooth surface that began to become\u2026 Scaly? Samus watched in confusion at her hair, looking like she had snakes hanging from her head, turning from blonde to blue, and lighter on the bottom.  Just as she thought her bizarre change was over, the tip of the snake-tail of her former hair that she was holding began to change shape, becoming less smooth, two small holes forming at the tips, as a line went along the side, and a two things poked out from it that appeared to be\u2026 Fangs?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus felt it begin to move slightly, and became uneasy as she felt the rest of her hair begin to shift as well, until she saw the one she was hold open its mouth, a forked snake tongue slipped out between its fangs! Samus gasped as it turned to face her, Samus letting go in surprise as it opened its eyes and looked slightly curiously at her, before turning away and shifting around idly. Samus' heart started beating heavily, Samus beginning to panic at the realization that she had a mass of snakes hanging off her head, until for some reason, she began to calm down. The shifting of the snakes stopped making her uneasy, and the idea of having snakes for hair didn't seem like such a distressing one anymore for some reason. Samus figured it must have been the upgrade, and it was a welcome change too, as she ran her hand through the mass of snakes that was her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus walked over to the mirror, and despite her relative ease at the snakes, she still grew slightly uneasy at the independent motion of the snakes, and wished they'd stop. On cue, the snakes grew limp, laying down and hanging from her back, Samus realizing that she must have been able to control them like her Medusa enhanced hair previously. She couldn't seem to control them like a third limb like her hair, but she could command them to move, each moving at its own speed independently, each snake seeming to have a mind of its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus watched them move in the mirror, and wondered just what possible use a head full of snakes could be. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"The Luck upgrade.\" Samus said, selecting the upgrade. Like some of the other upgrades, the name of this one had intrigued her. After all, it wasn't like luck was something that you could measure or increase using some kind of device or upgrade. Could you? Either way, she decided to find out, even if it was a zero suit upgrade. She took the upgrade from the machine and inserted it into her zero suit, waiting for it to apply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo begin, her zero suit began to sparkle, Samus looking down to see why it had started doing so, and watched as the material of the zero suit start to change into thousands of shiny sequins, each the same light blue of her zero suit, glittering as she moved. While she felt slightly odd in her glittering suit, it quickly began to change to match the material. The material began to loosen, hanging off her body rather than clinging to it, but remaining tight on her body, while the material on her legs merged into one sleeve, moving off her legs and into a dress, while leaving a thin layer behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dress began to gain slightly length, almost touching the ground as it grew, while a slit ran up the side of her left leg, showing off her thighs and the layer underneath, which quickly changed into a pair of very thin, slightly transparent black stockings, showing off her legs, and occasionally the pair of lacy underwear that had also formed  underneath above her stockings.  On her feet, Samus quickly changed her posture to account for the pair of blue high-heels that her boots changed into, the heel reaching four inches as her pose switched into a more casual, alluring one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp top, Samus patiently watched her changes unfold, a smile growing as she grew pleased with the changes to her attire. After all, a dress like that would easily show off her body, get some looks while also distracting them\u2026 Samus walked over to the mirror, gracefully carrying herself as she reached it, moving around slightly to get the best look at herself as her changes continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe material on her arms receded from her shoulders and upper arms, leaving Samus with a pair of gloves, which grew thicker and looser, lightening into a pair of white, shiny silk opera gloves. The fabric continued to recede down her chest, leaving her chest down to her cleavage, the dress pushing up and emphasizing that section, her breasts swelling slightly to match. The dress continued to recede down her back, leaving the dress backless as well, Samus turning around slightly to appraise herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp on her face, Samus' lips plumped up slightly, a layer of deep red lipstick being applied, while her eyelashes grew longer and darker, a layer of mascara and light-blue eye shadow being placed upon them. On her ears, a pair of sapphire earrings were pierced through, hanging slightly from her ears in a diamond shape, while the band holding her hair in a ponytail disappeared, letting her hair spill down her shoulders, growing slightly smoother and shinier, completing her changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus took a good look at herself, pleased with her changes. \"Perfect.\" She said to herself, her mind turning to the things she could do with her body. But first, she'd have to find somewhere to use it. She believed she knew a casino that wasn't too far away, and her mind turned to a few strategies she could use in some of the games there\u2026 </span></div></div>",

Win here, or lose half her winnings for the night, and possibly a chunk of her reputation. Keeping her perfect face? Easy. Suppressing the urge to show signs of pressure in body language, at even the most subtle gestures? Somewhat harder.  Either way, she just had to get this one right. She hoped she had this, at least. Right now, it was down to her luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in.\" Samus said, deliberately oozing confidence, her opponent good, but not quite as good, his silent treatment betraying him slightly as he concentrated on his cards, eventually discarding and drawing one of them. The final hand went down, they lay their cards out, and\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like I win again. Better luck next time.\" Samus said, giving off another smile as her opponent fumed. Perhaps she'd gone a little too far in presentation, Samus thought to herself. The man looked ready to attack her over the huge sum of money she'd just won from him. Luckily for her, even if he had tried, and she had been unable to fight him off, which she was perfectly capable of doing, the incredibly burly bouncer, a rock-like species and a lot smarter than he looked, had been watching carefully to make sure neither of them had been cheating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus smoothed off her dress and took her chips, and headed to cash them in, deciding that she figured she had done enough for the night. She didn't want to make too big of a haul for herself, seeing as her reputation for single-handedly cleaning out casinos had gotten her quite as few extra looks, in addition to the regular sort, which Samus appreciated equally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt like she hadn't gone quite as far out as she could have, but she had decided to pull out of the roulette after her continual string of victories after the last time she had done a little too well at roulette at another casino. It was all down to her good luck, really, but the other gamblers hadn't quite seen it that way. She'd dealt with it, of course, but they had almost ruined her perfectly put together appearance, and she'd had to retire for the night that time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment, Samus had more than enough money to give her a life of riches, but she wasn't really in it for the money. She was in it for the life, for the thrill of it all\u2026 She had considered playing in the big leagues for some of the card games, but there was something about the casino that drew her to it, and made it worth coming back every night\u2026 But she was getting a bit too reflective, and focused on getting her winnings and getting out. She cashed in her chips, and was rewarded with a chip of her own, a sum of credits on a chip that some of rivaled some of the richest people in the galaxy's earnings, and a few icy  looks from the employees of the casino. She tucked it into her cleavage and headed of, already thinking of where she was going to go the next night. </span></div></div>",

She did, however, start to feel very unpleasant, like she was sick, but somehow not quite to the level of feeling nauseated or that any part of her body wasn't working properly. Her skin was also starting to feel strange, and she quickly walked over to the mirror to take a look at herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mirror, Samus initially didn't notice anything different about herself. But she had looked at her body first, and when she looked more closely at her face, she noticed that the color seemed to be draining out of her skin, going from a healthy tan to a sickly pale color, and then went beyond, into a inhumanly grey, not one that could be caused by any natural means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus also felt her eyes start to hurt slightly, like if she hadn't closed them for a long time. She tried blinking and closing her eyes briefly, but the slight burning feeling continued, and she squinted slightly as she noticed that a similar process to what had happened to her skin was happening to her hair, the color draining out of it into a grey, while her hair became more ragged, becoming rougher and the shine going out of it. Her eyes widened at her now somewhat inhuman appearance, and she noticed that her irises had faded to grey, rather than their usual bright blue. However, the pain from having her eyes widened got to her quickly, and she went back to squinting, everything seeming to be far too bright for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Samus tried to shut out the light by keeping her eyes shut as much as possible, for some reason, she started to feel depressed, like something was deeply upsetting and continued to be upsetting, but she couldn't figure out just what was bothering her. Combined with the lighting of the room hurting her and her feelings, she felt like she would just lash out at the first person to bother her, and this wasn't helped by her hands starting to hurt as they began to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands began to ache, particularly around her digits, and Samus looked down to see her fingers growing at the first knuckles, growing four or five times as long, the fingernails at the ends growing out into sharp and extremely dangerous looking claws, easily able to tear someone apart. The fabric of her zero suit around her hands shredded at the growth, letting Samus see that her skin was just as grey around the rest of her body.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Samus continuously scrolled through the list of upgrades displayed on the terminal. She had seen so many strangely named upgrades so far, like the Pear Upgrade, the Balloon Upgrade, the Succubus Upgrade, the Gel Upgrade, the Genie Upgrade, and the Medusa Upgrade. With names like those, it was hard to figure out exactly what the uprages would do, and a surprisingly large number of those upgrades had been for her Zero Suit, rather than her Power Suit, meaning they probably wouldn\u2019t be very useful in combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of searching, Samus found something that caught her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Data Upgrade,\u201d said Samus. It was one of the many upgrades for her Zero Suit, but this one sounded like it might actually be useful, and she hoped it would provide a data bank or computer interface for her Zero Suit. A few button presses later, and the terminal presented the Data Upgrade. She picked up the upgrade chip and looked it over. It looked like any other upgrade chip, but it had a logo Samus had never seen before on it. There was a blue circle on one side, and inside the circle were four blue squares, arranged in a T shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus pressed the Data Upgrade into her Zero Suit\u2019s upgrade slot and waited for the upgrade to take effect. Almost immediately, her Zero Suit started to change colour. Black squares appeared on her Zero Suit, spreading out from the upgrade slot until the Zero Suit had completely changed colour from blue to black. Glowing lines of purple light began to appear on her black Zero Suit, first forming on the back of her fingers. The glowing purple lines met in the centre of her hand, and a single line traced its way up her arms, stopping at her shoulders. Similar lines formed on her chest, running down the outside of her breasts, then trailing down to outline her hips. The glowing purple lines went down to her knees, where they split and formed the outline of her boots, and Samus noticed that her Zero Suit\u2019s heels were now glowing purple as well. Finally, the logo that normally appeared on the back of her Zero Suit appeared on the centre of her chest, flashing bright purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the logo on her chest appeared, Samus felt a strange weight on her back. It certainly wasn\u2019t heavy, whatever it was, but it was unexpected. She reached behind her back, and her hand closed around something. She pulled it off her back, and held it out in front of her. It looked like some sort of disc, or maybe a chakram, with a hollow inside, and there a faded purple line around the disc. Samus tightened her grip on the disc, and with a snapping sound the outer edge of the disc flared to life, glowing the same shade of purple as the lines on her Zero Suit, and the line on the disc itself also started to glow. Samus reached behind her back with her free hand, and felt some sort of dock, which must have been what her new disc had been attached to. Samus shut the disc off and returned it to the dock on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus also felt a weight on her thigh, and she reached down and grabbed the item that had appeared on her leg. It looked like some sort of baton, with three circular purple lights on one side. Samus twirled the baton in her hands a few times, then took the baton in both hands and pulled. The baton split into two halves, and glowing purple lines of light began to form, spreading out from the baton and forming a wire-frame. Squares of black metal began to form, spreading out from the wire-frame and quickly forming a ground vehicle, a motorcycle of some sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d Samus said to herself as she looked the motorcycle over. She reached out to the baton, which had formed the handles of the motorcycle, and with a quick push, was able to make the motorcycle collapse back into the baton. Once the motorcycle had finished being disassembled, the two halves of the baton connected, and Samus attached it back to her thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that upgrade gave me a motorcycle and some sort of disc,\u201d Samus said to herself. The motorcycle would at least give her a decent form of transportation when she was out of her Power Suit for whatever reason, but she wasn\u2019t sure what the point of the disc was. Maybe she could use it as a throwing weapon, or possibly in melee combat? While useful, she certainly didn\u2019t see why it was called the Data Upgrade. Still, it would certainly be useful if she ever had to go somewhere and didn\u2019t have access to her Power Suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus turned her attention to the terminal that had given her the Data Upgrade. Maybe the computer could tell her more about the Data Upgrade, or possibly find compatible upgrades to further improve the Data Upgrade. Or she could explore the station, and try to find some sort of training area. She wanted to try out the disc the upgrade had given her, and see if it could be used as a weapon. She also wanted to see how the motorcycle handled, and whether it had any other functions she was unaware of.</span></div></div>",

What aperture? She looked around carefully, but she couldn\u2019t see anything that could even remotely qualify as an aperture. And why would this aperture, whatever it was, require the Data Upgrade? There was clearly more to the Data Upgrade than she had first thought. The question was, would it be worth finding out how this aperture figured into it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat option did Samus select?</span></div></div>",

Still, she wanted to find out more about the Data Upgrade, and this seemed like it might be the fastest way to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged, and tapped the button that said <b>&lt;Yes&gt;</b>. When she did, she heard a whirring sound from above her. Samus immediately realised that the aperture, whatever it was, had been above her this whole time, and kicked herself for not realising that. She looked up, and saw a device had emerged from the ceiling. The device fired a blue laser at her, and before she could move, the laser hit her, immobilising her. A glowing blue grid formed on Samus\u2019 body, and the device fired the laser again, hitting one of the sections, causing that part of Samus to disappear. The device fired the laser rapidly, hitting each of the grid sections that had appeared on Samus, until her entire body had disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus felt a sudden rush, and fell backwards, landing on her butt. She closed her eyes and shook her head, feeling slightly nauseous from whatever the laser had done to her. When she opened her eyes, she immediately realised she wasn\u2019t on the space station any more. She was in what seemed to be a circular room, and something seemed to be wrong with her eyesight, considering everything seemed to look washed out and grey. As she watched, glowing lights in various colours began to light up on the walls and floor around her. She looked down at herself, and she noticed that she was still dressed in the altered Zero Suit that the Data Upgrade had given her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere am I?\u201d Samus asked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreetings, User,\u201d said a voice coming from her left. Samus looked over at the voice, and saw a doorway, with a figure standing in that doorway. As the figure got closer, Samus was able to get a better look at the person approaching.</span></div></div>",

She was even wearing the same form of the Zero Suit as Samus herself, complete with the disc attached to her back and the baton on her right leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh... who are you?\u201d Samus asked. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo answer your second question, I\u2019m a computer program that was created when you activated the Data Upgrade,\u201d the woman said. As she spoke, Samus noticed that her voice had some barely audible digital modulation. As the woman got closer, Samus noticed that her pupils weren\u2019t round. Rather, they were hexagonal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs for who I am... well, I don\u2019t have a name yet,\u201d said the woman with a shrug. \u201cI was hoping you would give me one. After all, you are my User.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, am I inside the space station\u2019s computer?\u201d Samus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said the program. \u201cWelcome to cyberspace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe program stepped in front of Samus and held out her hand. Samus took it, and the program helped Samus to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou called me a User,\u201d said Samus. \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll programs have a User,\u201d said the program. \u201cThe Users are the ones who created us. Programs never get to meet their Users, since they never end up in cyberspace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Samus. \u201cWhich means you\u2019re a computer program?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the program. \u201cLike I said, I was created when you first used the Data Upgrade. I\u2019m programmed to teach you how to use the Data Upgrade, and to protect you when you\u2019re in cyberspace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus nodded. \u201cYou said you didn\u2019t have a name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said the program. \u201cDid... did you have anything in mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus paused as she thought for a few seconds. \u201cHow about Virginia? It was my mother\u2019s name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I like it,\u201d said the program with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m Virginia, nice to meet you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad to meet you,\u201d said Samus. \u201cMy name is Samus Aran. You said you were programmed to teach me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Virginia. She reached behind her back, and drew the disc that was attached to her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you activated the Data Upgrade, you received an Identity Disc,\u201d said Viriginia. \u201cEverything you do or learn will be imprinted on this disc.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s a data bank?\u201d Samus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor Users? Yes,\u201d said Virginia. \u201cFor a program, it\u2019s our whole identity. If I were to lose my disc, my memory would glitch. Eventually, the memory glitches would get so bad, I\u2019d completely forget who I used to be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, you can also use your Identity Disc as a weapon,\u201d said Virginia. She tightened her grip on her Disc, and the edge flared to life with a snapping sound. \u201cWhen it\u2019s powered up like this, you can use it in melee combat, or throw it at your opponents to derez them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDerez?\u201d Samus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShort for deresolution,\u201d said Viriginia. \u201cIt\u2019s what happens to programs when they\u2019re badly damaged and can\u2019t survive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt means they\u2019re dead,\u201d said Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the User term for it, yes,\u201d said Virginia, powering her Disc down and returning it to her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what about this?\u201d Samus asked, grabbing the baton on her leg and holding it up for Virginia to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a Baton,\u201d said Virginia. \u201cYou can install subroutines on it. Those subroutines allow the Baton to create weapons and vehicles, like the Light Cycle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that the motorcycle it created earlier?\u201d Samus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s the default subroutine,\u201d said Virginia. \u201cYou can also install things like a Light Jet, a Light Staff, or a Light Cable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Samus. \u201cIs that everything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the basics, yes,\u201d said Viriginia. \u201cIf you want to leave, the Portal is currently active.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Portal?\u201d Samus asked. She looked behind her, and saw a stream of light reaching up into the sky originating from a platform a few metres away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s how you got in here from the User World, and it\u2019s how you get back out,\u201d said Virginia. \u201cThe Portal will stay open while you\u2019re in cyberspace, and will close as soon as you leave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus nodded. She was glad to hear that there wasn\u2019t a time limit to how long she could stay in cyberspace. That said, she wasn\u2019t sure how long she wanted to spend in here with her digital copy.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"The Elastic upgrade,\" Samus said, selecting the upgrade from the machine. She wasn't exactly sure what the name meant, but all the other names were equally as vague, and it at least sounded like it had the potential to be interesting. Complying with her selection, the machine spat out a chip, which was apparently meant to be inserted into her zero suit. Exiting her power suit, Samus inserted the chip, and waited for the upgrade to take effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, nothing seemed to happen. Nothing about her suit seemed to have changed, even after ensuring the chip was inserted correctly. \"Maybe it was a dud,\" Samus mumbled, wondering if some of the upgrades simply didn't do anything. Maybe it just wasn't applicable to her. Her zero suit was already rather stretchy and elastic, after all, so perhaps it would have more use for other types of clothing. Although if that was the case, she wondered why it was made for her zero suit and not her power suit, as she could certainly see a case for why making her power suit more flexible would be useful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there was always the possibility that the upgrade had indeed done something, and she just couldn't see it clearly. She could only see herself so well without the aid of a mirror, after all. Luckily, there was a mirror hanging from a nearby wall, presumably so that those testing the upgrades could observe whatever was happening. Deciding to see if the upgrade really had done anything, Samus walked over to the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr more accurately, she tried to walk over to the mirror, upon taking her first step, her leg suddenly extended out far further than it should, stretching across the room. Caught off guard by this sudden impossible feat, Samus lost lost her balance, and fell face-down on the ground. Instead of feeling any pain, however, she felt her face squish and press flat against the ground, like a cartoon character crashing into a window. She slowly pushed herself up, her face regaining its original shape, realising what had happened; the upgrade didn't change her suit, it changed her body. Somehow, inserting the chip into her zero suit had altered her body to become stretchy and elastic. She wasn't entirely sure how the upgrade had managed to do such a thing, but she supposed that explained why there were so many upgrades for the zero suit within the archives of the research station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising her foot was still halfway across the room, Samus attempted to reel it back in, returning her leg to its original length. She stood up, and tried to walk over to the mirror again, this time slower as she focused on keeping her limbs at their proper length. Eventually reaching the mirror, Samus carefully looked over her reflection, but found that, just as in her earlier examination, nothing seemed to be out of place. Even her skin seemed to be as normal as ever, despite the earlier evidence to the contrary. Putting her hands on her waist, Samus slowly pushed inwards. Instead of any sort of resistance that one would normally expect, her waist squished and compressed beneath her hands as if it were nothing. Similarly, it pulled and stretched outward when Samus grabbed at her sides and pulled. Throughout all of it, she didn't feel a single shred of pain, as if her bones were now rubber and couldn't be hurt. She had a feeling she could still experience pain, but crushing or stretching would no longer hurt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her body stretch in cartoonish ways was more than a little unsettling, but Samus couldn't deny the usefulness the upgrade had. She could reach things that would be too far away or too high, she could avoid damage from certain kinds of attacks, etc. Of course, she realised she could only put this stretchiness to use outside of her power suit, which limited its usefulness, but this didn't change the fact that this opened up new options for her. In the small time she'd been experimenting with the upgrade, she'd already managed to get the hang of only stretching when she wanted to, and not accidentally stretching like her leg first had. By all accounts, it seemed this first upgrade was a success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over at the terminal she'd gotten the upgrade, her body still facing the mirror while her neck stretched to allow her to look behind her. There were several other upgrades the research station held, which she could try out next, or perhaps even try in tandem with the Elastic Upgrade. There was also more of the station to explore if she so chose, and her newfound stretchiness would probably aid in that exploration. Of course, she could always just test the limits of the upgrade, and see exactly what she could do with her new stretchy body, there were plenty of options.</span></div></div>",

She took the upgrade from the machine and inserted it into her zero suit, waiting for the changes to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus' zero suit glowed briefly, before Samus' legs began to feel strange and the material from her upper thighs to her hips disappeared, leaving her thighs exposed and her zero suit resembling a leotard. Her legs froze up, and Samus tried to stay upright as her legs cracked painfully as bones and muscle changed, the fabric of her zero suit merging with her legs, the heel of her shoe joining with her foot as it began to harden into a pitch black chitin, a toughened carapace looking much like thigh-high boots now a part of her leg. Samus regained her balance and ran her finger down it, a very faint sensation following it, her sense of touch there greatly reduced. As she did this, the untouched areas of her thighs began to itch as a thick yellow and black fuzz grew from it, running up her thighs and swaying slightly as she moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Samus got used to her new lack of toes, her zero suit began to change again, the blue patterns of it changing color to a striped yellow and black to match her fur. It shrank from her shoulders and chest, leaving her with a cleavage bearing yellow and black leotard, left with two opera gloves on her arms, strangely untouched. The back of her suit lowered, leaving her back down to her hips uncovered. Just before she began to walk back over to the mirror to get a look at herself, Samus felt the same strange sensation from her legs on her arms, and held them out to see changing similarly, each joint on her arms and fingers cracking painfully as it hardened to a black carapace ending at her upper arms, looking like and opera glove, and segmented at her fingers to allow movement and matching the look set by her legs. Samus waggled her fingers a bit, bringing her hands together with a slight crack at the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a second, she felt a slight pain and stretching felling just below her breasts on her sides, one that intensified and become slightly painful as two holes were cut into her suit, while two black hands pushed themselves out, growing into two shorter extra arms, the black chitin hardening and ending at her upper arm like her regular set, flopping uselessly as Samus tried to get used to the feeling of having two fully functional sets of arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did this, her back began to tingle as two transparent wings sprouted, starting short but quickly growing into two slightly glittering bee's wings, twitching quickly as Samus got used to them, adapting quickly. She felt an itching on her head, and two floppy antennae sprouted from beneath her hair, a few strange sensations coming through the sensitive antennae.  Just above her rear end, she felt a tingling and stretching sensation as a bud sprouted, growing larger and larger into a bee-like abdominal, large, round, furry, and surprisingly light for its immense more than half-meter long size. A stinger flicked out of the end, and with her changes done, Samus walked over to the mirror to have a look at herself, her stinger bouncing very slightly as she moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked, her eyes suddenly stung, and Samus immediately shut them, trying to get it to stop stinging, which, after a few seconds, it did. When Samus opened them, she was immediately disoriented, everything extremely blurry. She stumbled over to the mirror, focused on the extremely blurry reflection of herself, able to focus properly after a minute, bringing herself back to her normal eyesight when she looked at a certain spot, although it was quickly improving. She looked at her face, ignoring the floppy antennae and saw that her eyes had turned completely black, with no pupil or iris to speak of. She could still see perfectly well, but it would take some getting used to whenever she looked at herself in the mirror. The second set of arms as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus looked at herself, trying to control her second set of arms, but only finding herself only able to control one set at a time, the unused one dropping down uselessly. If she concentrated extremely hard, she could clumsily use three arms, but couldn't control her fingers properly and decided that she'd need to get a lot of practice to use them properly. Deciding to move on to something more productive, Samus tried out her wings, them quickly flitting until she was able to hover off the ground, moving around and controlling herself fairly well, thanks to her previous experiences with flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, these are going to take some getting used to\u2026\" Samus said, trying to make sure her other arms didn't wave around and hit herself. </span></div></div>",

Still in her Drone upgrade form, she had discovered that the Drone upgrade was compatible with the Queen upgrade, and was curious as to what would happen. She also for some reason felt like it would be an improvement, like what she was meant to do\u2026 She took the upgrade from the machine and inserted it into the upgrade slot, waiting for the changes to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Samus' hips and rear began to widen, the fuzz on her thighs thickening as she nearly doubled in width, her breasts growing a few sizes to match. There was a cracking sound as her carapaced feet changed, the flat heel changing into a natural high heel, giving Samus a few extra inches of height as she adjusted her footing, walking on it perfectly naturally. The black chitin itself on her arms and legs few shinier and glossier, as the antennae on her head grew a bit longer, while her clothes began to change as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leotard of her suit began to become thicker, going from skin-tight to a silky fabric, material growing at the hips to drop down into a dress, reaching her ankles as it took on the same black and yellow striped pattern as the rest of her dress. The stitching on her dress grew more elaborate as a hole was opened to allow her stinger to be exposed from the back, the stinger itself growing larger and longer. The dress became high-necked, her exposed cleavage being covered up as a large, octagonal yellow broach was placed on her breasts, two smaller versions being pierced through her ears as earrings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Samus patiently waited for her changes to end, her face began to change as well, her lips plumping up as they gained a similar layer of lipstick to the queen upgrade, light yellow makeup and mascara adorning her eyes as her eyelashes grew longer and more appealing. Her hair grew as well, trailing down to just below her stinger.  On her head, a pointed crown formed, encrusted with the same jewels as her earrings and broach, her symbol as a queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelieving her changes to be complete, Samus began to walk towards the mirror, her hips shaking through the dress, when she stopped suddenly, a rumbling coming from her belly, as the final stage of her transformation into a queen bee began. Her belly began to swell outwards, the dress growing to match, filling with hundreds of eggs, ready to populate a colony of her own. As she reached the size of full term with twins, the size of an early stage in her pregnancy as a queen, inside the eggs were actually artificial, the upgrade still being reversible keeping the eggs that way. Were she to keep the upgrade for long enough, they would be made natural. Cradling her belly in her rigid hands, she continued her walk over to the mirror as her mind was altered, a confident smile going over her face as she realized her duty as a queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a look at herself, going over the changes that had been made. She was much wider, with a large belly under a yellow and black striped dress, her stinger and antennae much larger and longer. Her wings could no longer support her weight in flight, but she realized that she didn't need it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A perfect body for my role, far better than that common worker's body.\" Samus said, appreciating her new body for her new role. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cThe Koopa upgrade\u201d Samus said, confirming the upgrade. As for this upgrade, it was a zero suit upgrade, with those seeming to outweigh the Power suit ones by a considerable degree. Thanks to their more biological bent, she supposed it allowed for greater variety, considering the A.I. that made the upgrades had been churning them out for who knows how long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it wasn\u2019t like she would need most of them for a serious combat role, since when she had her Power suit, what was the point of going in without it? She inserted the upgrade into her zero suit, and waited for the changes to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, her suit began to recede yet again, he suit withdrawing until it left all but most of her back from the ass-up uncovered, the remaining material clinging to her back somehow, Samus not even feeling put-off by her sudden nudity.  Her skin began to tingle yet again, and Samus looked down to see most of her skin turning a goldenrod yellow tan, quickly turning to scales, Samus suppressing a slight shiver as the sensation ran up her body, her skin\u2019s sense of touch altering to accommodate her rougher skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also noticed that while her arms, legs, and most of her body had turned to scales, from the groin upwards in a leotard-like fashion her skin had turned a more pale yellow, changing into a tougher shell-like material, lined ridges running up it to allow her to bend and flex naturally. Her breasts were completely  covered by it, her nipples having smoothed out and disappeared entirely, preserving her modesty to some degree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus had stayed mostly still during this, occasionally bending over or moving an arm to get a better look at herself, finding that her flexibility had been unaltered by her new skin and chest. She remained still, waiting for the changes to continue, only to find that they seemed to have either stopped or paused, which was odd, considering that usually they kept going until they were done. Was this it? Just scales? Well, that was a bit boring, all things considered. Still, if it meant she didn\u2019t turn into a dragon or something, she supposed she didn\u2019t mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran her hands over her new skin, feeling the difference in texture and toughness between the different parts of her torso.  <i>With skin like this</i>, Samus thought to herself, giving a tap to her shell-like chest,<i> I feel like nothing could break through it</i>. She then immediately chastised herself for a thought like that. A well placed energy bolt could tear through any skin like this, as Ridley had found out in his fights with her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But that hasn\u2019t been proved yet, has it?</i> Samus thought, before wondering why she had thought that. Of course that would be how it would go. Continuing her probing, she touched her face, finding that above her nose and cheeks was the scales that made up most of her body, but from her nose down, it felt more leathery and soft. The soft part of her face continued down her neck, until it ended at her collarbone, becoming the tougher shell that her chest had. She quickly strode towards the mirror to take a better look at herself, the new skin of her feet making a heavier thump on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe examined her face, having been able to get a fairly good look at her body before, finding that it indeed seemed to be separated into two different areas. Except instead of the normal yellow scales, it was a deep green color, clashing with her blonde hair. It was odd, seeing herself like this, particularly since it was an odd sight to see her normal blonde hair on her scaled skin. She spun around, getting a good look at her naked back, finding that the large patch of zero suit still seemed to be there. So the upgrade wasn\u2019t done yet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she ponder the thought any longer, she began to get a stretching feeling going over her body, and turned back into the mirror to face forward, calmly waiting for the changes to continue. The mirror slowly seemed to become lower, Samus looking down to see that she was growing, her legs becoming longer, her arms cracking as they proportionately changed to match, Samus feeling very tight in her chest and abdomen as they grew as well. Her breasts swelled out to match her increasing height, but while they were much larger, they were more proportionate, and simply matched her body\u2019s increase in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held up an arm as she felt it tightening, her obvious muscle definition that barely showed through the scales growing more obvious, her arms thickening and growing stronger, Samus feeling like she could take on an entire army like this. The increased muscle definition showed in her legs as well, her thighs fully taking on a thick-muscled appearance, and the only reason her abs weren\u2019t completely and thickly chiseled was thanks to the rigid material in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also noticed, once she stopped appreciating her thicker muscles, that her hips were growing outwards, giving her a more heavyset frame, and her waist wasn\u2019t cinching in, instead widening with it, giving very little curve to her form in that regard. From her hips to her shoulders there wasn\u2019t much of a curve, and it served to make her look much stronger, and she didn\u2019t feel like she\u2019d be getting knocked down any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the changes seeming to stop again, Samus walked a few steps away from the mirror to allow her full body to be shown, giving a few appreciative flexes. With how tall and strong she was, feeling like she could snap a normal person in half easily, crushing their bones with a single blow\u2026 Samus stopped her flexing for a second, slightly concerned at her violent thoughts. While she was obviously not bothered in the slightest by combat, she rarely actively entertained the thought of violently breaking someone, showing her obvious dominance over them\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head, trying to calm down her faster and more excited breathing. These upgrades were getting to her. The sooner this one was over, the better. And speaking of getting it over with, judging by the fact that her nails seemed to be digging into her unconsciously tightly clenched hands, they seemed to be starting up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe uncurled her fingers to see that her fingernails were growing outward into almost inch-long claws, and in addition, seemed to be growing into the rest of her fingers, the ends of her fingers ending in pure claw, rather like a talon. A similar thing seemed to be happening to her feet, her toes merging into three large ones tipped with deadly looking talons, her feet growing slightly larger to accommodate the new balancing her altered foot shape had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile looking down to watch her feet changing, Samus noticed that her face was starting to stretch and change as well, quickly looking herself in the mirror and watching herself change. Her nose flattened out, upturning slightly as it widened, while Samus grimaced as her mouth and chin stretched and extended outwards into a sort of snout-like shape, her mouth widening to run down it, her lips oddly staying their normal size and shape and not moving at all, looking slightly strange at the end of her new mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside of her mouth, other than aching briefly from its change in size, felt strange, and Samus opened it to find two wide rows of sharp teeth, Samus giving a dangerous looking grin as she imagined how easily they could tear through meat, or anything else for that matter. She knew she should be trying to avoid thoughts like that, but it just felt right for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to feel pressure just above her rear end, and correctly predicted that she appeared to be growing a tail, a long, scaly one that quickly reached the floor, thicker than a leg with large spikes quickly growing out of it and running down it a foot apart. She quickly gave it an experiment wag, before taking a scratch at an uncomfortable itch on her scalp, finding that, instead of rough scales, there appeared to be two short curved horns growing up and out of her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her changes apparently complete, Samus took another look at herself in the mirror, gingerly touching her new horns, noticing that her ears seemed to have taken on a point, although mostly unnoticeably so, still hidden under her hair. She also felt like she had something stuck in her throat, coughing in an attempt to clear it, seeing a short burst of flame come out. Unable to stop herself from coughing more violently, she spun away from the mirror, before hacking out a fireball that flew across the room and into the opposing wall, leaving a scorch mark on the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly cautious of her own breath now, but elated by her new ability, Samus attempted to replicate her fire breath, managing to first get out a few jets, before a short burst of flame, which quickly devolved into slightly pained coughing from her inability to use it properly. She felt like her throat should at least be burnt from such an act, but if her throat was fireproof, what was to say that the rest of her body wasn\u2019t? Just another thing to add to her already impressive body, which she couldn\u2019t believe she had missed out on before. Just perfect for a fight, and she wished she had somebody to break, just to try it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even noticing her own violent thoughts this time, she noticed when she turned back towards the mirror that something seemed to be happening to the patch of zero-suit left on her back, which seemed to be growing outward and larger into what appeared to be a large green shell, Samus easily carrying the new weight as it grew larger and larger, until it was almost twice as wide as she was, spikes sprouting from it all over, Samus eagerly thinking of just how much damage she could do if it collided with something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer changes finally complete, Samus finished examining her new shell, which felt weightless to her new, powerful body, taking a few heavy steps away from the mirror to admire herself, thinking of her previous fights outside of her suit.</span></div></div>",

Why not show off her power to the universe, and take a piece of it for her own? She had a ship, and she had a reputation, and it was time to make use of it.

Soon, she'd be the ruler of the greatest empire in the galaxy, a queen instead of some petty bounty hunter. \"Queen?\" she growled. That didn't seem right. The feeling of the change started again, back down towards her crotch. Samus smiled with her sharp teeth. This was much better. Her clitoris started to grow, widening and lengthening, pulsing with heat, until she had a seven inch penis growing out of her vagina, one that was thick enough for her new size. \"That's better.

It was going from the golden blonde locks he has once known into a thick red. Not red hair that's really orange, but real red hair, the color of fire. The color of blood. The idea put a smile on Samus's face. Speaking of which, he felt his face start to change as well, growing in size and becoming much bulkier. His jaw muscles stretched and grew, turning what was once a beautifully feminine face into one belonging to a dangerous creature. Part of Samus felt remorse over the loss of his femininity, his once beautiful face. That was quickly overwhelmed by his joy. Why would he want to remain a weak woman, trapped in that fleshy human skin? Now he was strong, virile, tough! As a woman Samus had stopped bad things from happening. It was high <i>fucking</i> time Samus started happening to other people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could dwell more on how amazing a thing this upgrade really was, he felt his shoulders start to shift. They widened, and with them so did his waist. Soon he had the large frame needed to truly through his weight around. Speaking of weight, it seemed he'd put some on, considering the state of his stomach. Who cared about keeping trim, though, when the extra pounds meant extra pain for his enemies? His arms and legs stretched and grew, matching his larger body, and getting thicker with muscle. Samus grinned toothily, there was only one thing left to change. It was then that his remaining internal female organs descended and changed into a scaly pair of testicles. He let out a roar of triumph, finally complete. But what to do now?</span></div></div>",

They were just like the others except they are made of metal and are immortal.  She always wonders what it would be like to them, they seem so peaceful with themselves. She took the chip from the machine and inserted it into her zero suit, waiting for the changes to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment she installed the chip, her zero suit changed from blue to silver and took on a hard metal tone.  The suit then started to liquefy itself and spread around her body, covering her completely.  As her head was completely covered, the liquid went right into her mouth and was inside her body as well.  She could feel everything changing, expanding, and rearranging as the metal spread in and out of her.  She would\u2019ve been afraid, but for some reason, she was calm about the whole change and was enjoying herself.  In a matter of minutes and changes have stopped.  She opened her eyes for the first time after the change and could see things from a different perspective.  She could see data coming down her eyes and her vision was all too clear for her to understand.  When Samus looked into the mirror, she was completely stunned at what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding before her is a cybernetic android with a chrome like body head and toe.  She had gears into her arms and legs as they move smoothly.  She could even turn them to 306 degrees, something a regular human wouldn\u2019t do.  Her chest place was a size C-cup and smoothed around her chest.  Her hips had an hourglass figure to it as there's been an indent in the middle, making her turn around in a circle.  Her face was different as well.  It looked human from the nose and mouth, but there were some things that were cybernetic.  For one, she had not blonde hair that has a style of a ponytail; it was completely bald with a shiny dome on it.  Her ears were audio receptors with antennae sticking out on the side.  And her eyes were now a visor to see things much clearer then originally before.  Samus looked on and cannot believe that her latest upgrade would turn her into a cybernetic babe.  But that was the physical change.  Did she change mentally?</span></div></div>",

Samus recognized a great deal of them, but could hardly pin any one image down as they changed so frequently. \"How do I even navigate something like that though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it Sammie,\" Millie giggled at the awestruck look that had formed on Samus' face, \"since I've been holed up in here I've done enough research to at least be able to guide you to your objective.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Objective?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it seems that your mind has put barriers in place that are holding back your memories of me.\" At this, Samus sighed and crossed her arms as she thought for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would explain why I could hardly remember you...\" The blonde bounty hunter looked down sadly as she studied the fabric of her ballgown intently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey chin up...\" Millie said reassuringly as she took Samus' hands into her own, \"you're here now, and you've at least started to remember, so it should get easier from here on out!\" For a moment, Samus didn't respond, but after a few seconds of silence she met the other woman's gaze and returned it with a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right. Though I guess I'd better get going...\" Samus relented, pulling away from Millie with a look of hesitation, but steeled herself as she turned to face what she assumed was the exit to the room. \"I'll be back soon, don't worry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you sweetie.\" Millie smiled, waving a farewell before she remember one more thing, \"oh and Sammie, be careful! Once you access a barrier your mind my try to stop you from reaching it with a mental construct.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like some sort of guardian?\" Samus inquired with a confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly, and it may try to faze you with those constructs by shaping them to look like you or some other version of you.\" At this, Millie's look of warning turned into an unflinching stare that haunted Samus, \"don't let it dissuade you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I...I won't Millie, don't worry!\" Samus stuttered, caught off guard by the sudden change in tone, but shrugged it off since the gravity of her mission was quite clear at this point. With a final nod of acknowledgement she exited the room and was suddenly thrust into the ever changing void the second she got past the door. Whirling her head in surprise, she was shocked to see that the room Millie was in had completely vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay...\" Samus sighed, trying to regain her bearings as she glanced around. Her feet seemed to be on solid enough ground despite seeing no visible surface to stand on beneath her. <i>Well, Millie said she would guide me...</i> Taking a deep breath, Samus tentatively placed a foot forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*clack*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank goodness,\" Samus exhaled in relief as she slowly began walking now that she'd determined she actually had a path to follow despite not being able to actually view it. Looking around as she marched her way through the area, she realized that she couldn't actually tell if she was making progress or not, the lack of tangible or permanent landmarks messing with her perception of distance and space. \"Guess I just keep walking until I come across something then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Samus caught a glimpse of what looked like a constant light that shined through the void ahead of her. <i>That must be the place...</i> Once she arrived, she pressed a hand against it. Feeling resistance, she pushed with all of her might against it, but still felt no give to it as she stepped back. Huffing in frustration, she pondered upon what her options were until she suddenly felt a weight enter her hand. Looking down in surprise she found her hand wrapped around the weapon she normally carried when not in her power suit, the Paralyzer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odd...when did I-\" Samus paused, looking from the gun to the doorway of light. Smirking, she pulled the trigger on the energy weapon, feeling the familiar hum of it sound out as a ball of energy began charging. Once the ball grew large enough, Samus took the gun in both hands and steadied it in her grip, aiming it directly at the door. With one last moment to brace herself, Samus fired the gun, and Samus was met with an explosion of light that completely enveloped her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReeling from the sensation and shutting her eyes, Samus placed an arm over them and grit her teeth as the light kept intensifying more and more, until finally she felt it begin to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling her arm away from her vision, Samus looked around, disoriented briefly, but quickly regained her bearings as she realized she was in a very familiar place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My ship...\" Samus breathed, \"but...why am I back here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...I got word of an intruder trying to access this region...\" A voice snapped Samus out of her stupor as she whirled around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait you're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You?\" The owner stepped out of the shadows to reveal what seemed to be a perfect mirror image of Samus herself. The only difference between the two was the fact that Samus herself was dressed in her gown and had her hair down, while her doppelganger wore a form fitting bodysuit and had her hair up in a ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be the guardian of the mental barrier then...\" Samus said, tensing up as she glared at the other Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'<i>Mental barrier</i>?'\" The zero-suit Samus scoffed, \"I think you mean the memories of your real self.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Samus growled, aiming the Paralyzer at the other her, who raised an eyebrow at the gun leveled at her, but was otherwise unfazed by the escalation of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm saying there is no 'Millie.' There never was.\" The Zero Suit Samus sighed, \"she's playing you for a fool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Millie said you'd probably say something like that.\" Samus hissed, now more determined than ever to get this decidedly fake version of her out of the way, \"you're nothing more than a construct my mind made up to block my memories of her off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say...\" The other Samus shook her head in resignation. \"Fine, I won't stop you, if <i>this</i> is what you actually want then go ahead and take the shot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like that?\" Samus looked at her mirror image incredulously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem like you have your mind pretty well made up, and anyways I have no weapon to even the playing field so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus searched the doppelganger for any sign of deceit she could. After all, in her experience nothing was <i>ever</i> this easy to accomplish, or perhaps she'd become too jaded over the years? Whatever the case, she finally decided that her other self was being honest with her and charged the Paralyzer up. \"For what it's worth...\" she paused as she aimed the fully charged beam up at the other Samus' head, the bright light from the gun's energy illuminating both of their faces. \"Thanks for making it easy on me I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't expect the others to be the same way now that they know what Millie is up to.\" The other Samus warned ominously, before Samus released the trigger and saw her other self phased out of existence. Almost immediately Samus saw the world around her begin to fade. It was slow, almost unnoticeable, but it was happening. Looking around, Samus searched for a way out, but could find none, and so simply sat in the pilot seat of her gunship while the world around her disappeared permanently. Once the image of the gunship was completely gone Samus stood up and saw that she was back in the void once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess when I defeat a guardian the mental barrier just- <b>AH.</b>\" Samus cried out, falling to her side as stabbing sensation suddenly erupted in her brain. \"What's...happening...\" Samus clutched her head, feeling the world spin around her as she felt herself slipping into unconsciousness from the pain itself. <i>Millie...</i> was the last thought Samus had before she lay still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she lay unconscious she felt more and more of her previous \"memories\" return to her. They weren't much, but the memories of meeting Millie in her childhood around the royal palace were much clearer, and Samus smiled at the sight. Outside however, while she was unconscious her body had been summoned back to Millie's room, the brunette watching over her with a cold smile as her girlfriend slept. \"Excellent...\" Millie giggled darkly, \"guess you'll be of utmost use to me 'Sammie.' Even more so now that the transfer has started...\" Millie looked over to the full length mirror. At first glance, nothing had changed about her, but upon closer inspection, the woman's previously full mane of brown hair now had a few strands of blonde in it. \"Hm hm... Once she takes down enough barriers I'll have enough influence to do the rest myself...but for now...rest up Sammie.\" She smiled malevolently at Samus, who remined blissfully unaware of Millie's plot as she slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waking...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"The Anthro rabbit upgrade\" Samus said aloud. The machine began whirring and soon from the bottom slot came a chip which Samus grabbed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus inserted the chip into the slot on her hip on her zero suit and waited for the effects to take effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus suit began to glow. Soon, different effects began to take place. Her suit's boots began to disintegrate and recede. It rode up to her knees, leaving her feet bare as she wiggled her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer suit's arm sleeves began to recede upwards, leaving the soft skin of her arms and hands bare.<br>\r\nThe suit's arm sleeves receded until they reached her shoulder, giving her suit a sleeveless, legless suit look. Instantly she felt some strange, shaking, tingling feeling throughout her whole body. Her stomach was rumbling and her legs shook. She held her stomach with both hands as she was standing in place. Almost automatically small white hairs began poofing out of her body. The hair poofed out of her face and covered her face. Soon fur covered her entire head and face. The fur traveled down her arms and covered her hands giving her some furry hands. Fur was growing out of Samus' body. The hair enveloped her entire form as it covered her body from head to toe, the hair travelling from her head and face to her arms and torso to her legs and feet. She was completely covered in poofy white fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to look over herself, staring at the white fluffy hands of hers in shock. It wasn't over yet however. Samus felt a tingling in her white haired hands. Her thumbs soon receded in to her hands. After that her fingers began to merge together as on each hand her pointer and middle finger formed into one stubby looking finger and her middle and ring finger merged into another finger. Her hands were now stubby little paws. No thumbs or coordination like an animal's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her face there were more changes. Her nose receded and flattened into a button nose. Her mouth formed a line above itself and linked with her nose, giving her the nose a mouth of a rabbit. Her face felt a strain and was being stretched out forward, giving her a muzzle. Finally, whiskers grew out of her white furry cheeks and a big pair of buck teeth grew out of her mouth. <br>\r\nInstantly, her ears receded into her head and disappeared. Samus hearing was temporarily disabled. She felt a pushing feeling on top of her head as two nubs poked out of her hair. They soon sprouted into two large bunny ears, each as white as her fur. Like that, Samus hearing returned and it seemed it was better than before. She could hear the hum of the spacecraft she was in and the machine with the upgrades power much more clearly and detailed than normal. Samus put her thumbless new paws on her bunny ears, feeling their softness and fuzziness. She was certain this was how the rest of her body felt.<br>\r\nSamus then felt something on the back of her zero suit. She turned around, her new ears flopping slightly as she did. The blue fabric where her butt was began to tear as a new appendage began to grow. Soon enough, her zero suit tore a hole in her butt area and out came a big bushy round ball of fluff.  Samus had grown a cotton tail. Suddenly Samus felt a new sensation in her brain, like a connection to the tail.  She shook her behind and wiggled it and it responded. It was a part of her. \u201cOh great\u201d Samus said as she felt the cotton tail with her paw, it was soft and fluffy, like the rest of her.<br>\r\nJust when Samus thought it was over, her feet began tingling. Her furry feet suddenly grew longer and longer, stretching to about 3 feet. On each foot her toes began to merge together. Her big toe became a large long rabbit toe while her pointer and middle toes, and ring and pinky toes merged into one stub respectively for each pair. Samus had grown a pair of rabbit\u2019s feet. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of upgrade is this\u201d Samus said loudly to no one. She looked at her stubby paws. They weren\u2019t beneficial at all. She probably could still grab objects but with no thumbs it was really gonna be annoying. And her feet, how was she supposed to walk with such huge feet, never mind the fact that she can never wear footwear again, despite the fact that she never wore socks for she liked being barefoot in her suit, it was just a girl thing. <br>\r\nAs a surprising extra effect, she felt something on her chest. Her breasts grew, the fleshy, or now furry orbs expanding as they grew bigger and bigger and pushed against her zero suit. Her breasts soon became jiggly orbs of flesh and fur. Samus had turned into a barefooted, big breasted, furry, bushy anthropomorphic rabbit girl with a string urge to eat carrots. <br>\r\nShe looked down at herself and saw her bare feet all long and rabbitized. She felt her arm and how soft her fur was. Rolling her eyes, she felt like she was the victim to some sort of sick minded prank that messed with her biology to see her as an animal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do now\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Since she was already in her Power Suit, Samus decided to try that version first. She tapped the screen to confirm her selection, and the terminal spat out the upgrade chip. Samus picked up the chip and slotted into her Power Suit, waiting for the Upgrade to kick in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t have to wait long. Samus felt herself her lower body being forcibly remoulded inside her armour, similar to what she felt when she used the Morph Ball. She looked down, and watched as her boots were transformed into a hoof. She also felt her feet elongating inside her armour as her upper and lower legs grew shorter, with the end result being that Samus felt as if she was standing on her tiptoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her legs had finished changing, she felt a strange pulling sensation on her butt. She looked behind her, and saw her backside stretching out behind her as new armour plates formed. Samus could feel her flesh stretching to fill the new extension, and she felt new bones forming to support the new muscles and organs that were forming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her new body filled in, Samus could see more armour forming at the end of the extension. The armour stretched down to the ground, forming a pair of empty legs. Her body continued to shift and fill the empty armour. Samus felt her new rear legs forming inside the new armour. She felt as if she was tiptoeing with her rear legs, just like she did with her front legs, and Samus noticed that her rear legs also had a hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her new legs had finished forming, Samus tentatively raised her front left leg. It felt almost the same as it normally did, so she set it back down again. She did the same with her front right leg, then tried to lift her rear left leg. To her surprise, her new leg lifted up easily. She set it back down again, and tested her rear right leg. With all four feet back on the ground, she slowly tried to walk forward. Samus was half-expecting her new back legs to stumble, but she found it incredibly easy to walk in this new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Upgrade must\u2019ve rewired my brain so I can move like this,\u201d Samus mused. That shouldn\u2019t have been too surprising, since the Morph Ball did the same thing. After all, human minds weren\u2019t exactly designed to handle rolling around as a featureless ball of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she was confident that she could walk, Samus walked over to the mirror that was nearby and examined her reflection. While her upper body was unchanged, her lower body was incredibly different. For one thing, she now had four legs, and her rear legs were connected to her by a second torso, stretching out from her butt. Not only that, but her legs had been shifted around so that she was walking on her tiptoes, and her boots had transformed into hooves. She looked like someone had attached her upper body to the body of an old Earth animal called a horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Samus feel about the upgrade?</span></div></div>",

As she grew comfortable with walking, she slowly increased her speed. Samus could hear her hooves clicking against the metal floor as she sped up to a trot. She felt like she was performing a light jog, but Samus also felt as if she was moving much faster than she would if she was jogging as a human. She decided to see just how fast she could go, and sped up into a gallop. Her hooves thudded against the floor as she instinctively crouched her human upper body down to reduce her air resistance. Samus was definitely moving much faster than any regular human could, and even faster than she could as a Morph Ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with her speed test, Samus slowed back down again as she caught her breath, panting lightly. She felt her lungs heaving in her chest, and also felt the same feeling in her equine lower body. Samus could feel her horse torso expanding and contracting in time with her breathing, as a second pair of lungs worked to pull more air into her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess I need more oxygen with this form,\u201d Samus said once she stopped panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her breathing steadied, Samus found that she\u2019d found her new speed to be exhilarating. Not only that, but the more she thought, the more advantages she could see to having four legs. The enhanced speed was fantastic, and having an extra pair of legs meant Samus could gain a better footing on uneven terrain. The only problem was that she took up more space like this, but that could easily be remedied by removing the Centaur Upgrade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely keeping this one,\u201d said Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow all she needed to do was figure out what to do next. Samus remembered that there was a Zero Suit version of the Centaur Upgrade, and she was somewhat curious as to what that Upgrade would do to her. Of course, she also wanted to see how the Power Suit version handled in combat. Maybe there was some sort of training area on the space station? There were still plenty of other upgrades available for her to test, though. Maybe she could find something compatible with the Centaur Upgrade?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Samus decide to do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the push of a button, Samus deactivated the Centaur Upgrade. With the Centaur Upgrade turned off, the changes made to her body began to reverse. Her rear legs were pulled up out of her armour, and her equine body started to pull back as well, pushing into her rear. The extra armour began to disappear as well, and her front legs began shifting back into a human form. Soon, it was all over, and she was back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus pulled her helmet off, and set it down on the terminal. She then pressed another button, and her Power Suit opened up. With the Power Suit opened, Samus stepped out of the set of armour, her heeled Jet Boots clicking against the metal floor. Once she was standing in front of the terminal, she tapped the screen to select the Zero Suit version of the Centaur Upgrade. A slot on the terminal opened up, and the chip slid out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I liked the Power Suit version,\u201d Samus said as she picked up the chip. \u201cLet\u2019s see how the Zero Suit version goes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus pressed the chip into the Zero Suit\u2019s upgrade slot, and the changes began almost immediately. The fabric of her Zero Suit quickly retracted up her body, exposing her legs and hips. With the Zero Suit out of the way, Samus felt her legs shifting again. Her upper and lower legs grew shorter as her feet grew longer, and her toes fused together and hardened into a hoof. As her hoof formed, her Jet Boots formed into horseshoes, protecting the bottom of her hooves. She then felt her backside stretching out again, forming a horse body as her rear legs grew again. Once her back legs had formed, she felt a new pair of horseshoes forming on her rear hooves as well. Just as she thought her changes were done, she felt a tingling all over her equine body as short brown fur began to grow, covering her skin. Once her fur coat had grown in, she felt a tingling in her butt, and looked over her shoulder to see a tail of blonde horse hair forming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA tail?\u201d Samus said. \u201cThat\u2019s new.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her transformation was complete, Samus slowly walked herself around the room. She didn\u2019t feel all that different from how she\u2019d felt when she used the Power Suit Centaur Upgrade. The only real difference was the addition of a tail. For some reason, the Power Suit version didn\u2019t have a tail, or if it did, it was hidden by her armour. That did make sense, as having an exposed tail left something for an enemy to grab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Samus had finished trotting around the room, she came to a stop in front of a full-body mirror and took a few minutes to examine her reflection. While both versions of the Centaur Upgrade had essentially done the same thing, the Zero Suit version gave her a much better look at her new equine body. Samus could see the new muscles rippling beneath the skin as she moved her new horse legs, and could see the rib-cage expand and contract in time with her breathing. She ran a hand over her flank, and felt the soft brown fur beneath her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus lifted up one of her front legs and looked down, trying to get a better look at the bottom of her hoof. She could just barely see the horseshoe that her Jet Boot had transformed into, and she could still see the glowing pattern that had decorated her Jet Boots. Had her Jet Boots been transformed into Jet Horseshoes? And if that was the case, would she still be able to use them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm,\u201d said Samus said as she lowered her leg back down. Samus decided to see if her new horseshoes had retained the function of her Jet Boots, so she began to trot, slowly building her speed up. Once she was satisfied she was moving fast enough, she leapt into the air, jumping much higher than she could as a human. Once she was in the air, she kicked her legs down, like she normally did to activate her Jet Boots. As she did so, she felt the thrust under her four hooves as the jets activated, lifting her even higher into the air. Samus landed with a grunt, and trotted forward a few steps to slow herself down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh,\u201d said Samus, breathing heavily. \u201cGuess I really do have Jet Horseshoes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with her test, Samus slowly walked back over to the mirror, taking another look at herself. She examined her reflection again, then lifted her head up to meet her reflection\u2019s eyes as she formed her opinion of the Zero Suit version of the Centaur Upgrade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Samus feel about the upgrade?</span></div></div>",

Her newfound speed and strength were exhilarating, and her new tail swished back and forth happily as she trotted around the room again, just enjoying the sensation of moving with four legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Samus continued to run laps around the room, she wondered what she should do now. There were still plenty of other Upgrades available, and maybe she could find some that were compatible with either version of the Centaur Upgrade. But, she still wanted to see exactly what she could do as a centaur, so she could maybe look for some sort of gym or training area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nListening to the sound of her hooves clicking against the metal floor made another, much stranger idea come to mind. Perhaps there would be a way to permanently install the Zero Suit Centaur Upgrade, and transform herself into a real centaur. Of course, doing so would be a huge commitment, and would mean that she\u2019d have to rebuild her Power Suit and completely renovate her ship. Not only that, but most places were obviously not suited to a centaur body. There would also be no going back. If she permanently installed the Centaur Upgrade, she would never be human again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Samus decide to do?</span></div></div>",

That was an upgrade she had passed over earlier, but apparently, when the Angelic and Zero Suit Centaur Upgrades were combined, it would create the Pegasus Upgrade. Unfortunately, there was no information available regarding the Pegasus Upgrade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third upgrade was another one she had dismissed earlier. The Ranch Upgrade was apparently compatible with the Zero Suit Centaur Upgrade, but only if she installed the Ranch Upgrade and the Ranch Upgrade 2.0. Doing so would apparently create the Dairy Upgrade, which also had no information available.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth upgrade on the list was the Centaur Upgrade 2.0. It was apparently an enhancement to the Centaur Upgrade that only worked with the Zero Suit version.

While she still had no idea why it would only upgrade the Zero Suit version of the Centaur Upgrade, she was still curious. Besides, she was still using the Zero Suit Centaur Upgrade, so it wouldn\u2019t take all that long for it to take effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she\u2019d selected the upgrade, the terminal popped out the relevant chip. Samus picked it up and slotted it next to the Centaur Upgrade. Once the new upgrade was in place, Samus once again felt a tingling on her skin. She looked down and saw the fur on her equine body begin to disappear, leaving her horse body exposed. However, her blonde horse tail remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the fur had disappeared, Samus felt a shifting in her legs and horse body. The proportions of her body were shifting, and Samus watched in curiosity. Her horse body slimmed down, becoming the size of a human torso, and her four legs changed shape as well. Her hooves disappeared as her feet returned to normal, and her upper and lower legs lengthened back out. Samus raised an eyebrow as she realised her legs were now human again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her body had finished shifting, Samus felt the fabric of the Zero Suit moving. The fabric stretched out, covering her front legs. The fabric then stretched over the human-like torso that was sticking out of her butt, then covered up her back legs as well. Once the Zero Suit had finished covering her up, her Jet Horseshoes began to change as well, becoming Jet Boots once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her changes finished, Samus walked over to the mirror and looked herself over. Thankfully, walking with four human legs was just as easy as walking with four horse legs, so it didn\u2019t take long for her to reach the mirror. As she examined her reflection, Samus realised that she still had a centaur body, but the horse body parts had been replaced with human body parts. What would that be called? A humantaur? Samus sighed, and shook her head. The name wasn't really important. What really mattered was whether she wanted to keep this upgrade or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Samus feel about the upgrade?</span></div></div>",

Samus could run much faster now, but she wasn\u2019t sure for how long, or if she\u2019d be able to outrun Sylux\u2019s Lockjaw form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she considered her options, another thought entered her mind. She could always try to escape later, when he let down his guard. Who knows? She might even enjoy letting Sylux ride her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus\u2019 eyes went wide as she realised what she was thinking, and she shook her head with a growl of frustration. Sylux\u2019s fake upgrade was messing with her mind! She didn\u2019t have time to wait. She had to act now, before any more traitorous thoughts wormed their way into her head.</span></div></div>",

The first was that the Chozo had built this facility and there was nothing she had to fear from them. The second was that she wouldn't be alive if she didn't the the curiosity to investigate. Shedding her Power Suit, Samus looked to the port on her Zero Suit. Without hesitation, she plugged the drive in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few moments, nothing seemed to happen. Samus was about to pull the drive out before her whole body was wracked by immense pain. She tried to withstand it but fell to the floor in seconds. Her skin began to itch and her head felt like someone jammed a rock into it. The pain continued for a minute, but began to subside as the itching stopped. Taking a breath, Samus looked down at herself only to be distracted by a beeping from her Power suit. Seamus jerked her head around, knowing the beeping was the signal for a nearby metroid. Looking around, Samus stopped when her eyes came to a reflective surface. Her entire body was now a distinct shade of green and see through at that. Looking to her head, Samus noted the red ball she often saw metroids had and a few of her theeth had grown. \"Hmm....a metroid appearance....\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Samus didn't know where to begin. There were so many upgrades to choose from that she was having trouble deciding which one to try out. It didn't exactly help that most of the names were incredibly vague, making it difficult to tell which upgrades would actually be useful. She sighed, before deciding to just select one at random.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The... Squid Upgrade?\" she said to herself. It was apparently an upgrade for her Zero Suit. The name didn't provide much of a hint of what it would do. Would it let her breathe underwater? Would it help her swim better? Would it let her spray ink? Would she grow tentacles? She guessed there was really only one way to find out, and plugged the chip the computer had ejected into the upgrade slot on her hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe upgrade started to take effect, changing Samus' clothing. Her Zero Suit split apart at the waist, separating the top half and the bottom half, and the boots split off from the legs as well. The pants of the Zero Suit began to recede up her legs, stopping at about mid-thigh. They turned black, but kept a stripe of light blue down the side of each side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe top part of the Zero Suit receded as well, slipping away from her hands and crawling up her arms. They stopped just below her shoulders, as the material on her neck sank down as well. Now looking for like a t-shirt, the top of the Zero Suit loosened considerably, and changed its texture to become a softer cloth rather than being shiny and elastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heels of Samus' boots sunk down as the labric began to feel looser around her feet, while simultaneously becoming thicker. Laces stitched their way through the fabric, tying themselves in bows to hold the boots, which were now a pair of sneakers, on Samus' feet. She felt a weight on her back, and looking behind her, she found a large glass tank, with green casing at the top and bottom, which seemed to be filled with a strange blue liquid. It was hanging from her back by a pair of straps over her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is... odd.\" Samus had no idea what part of this outfit could be considered an upgrade. It seemed to have just turned her Zero Suit into a more casual attire, albeit with a tank of strange liquid on her back. It didn't even seem to have anything to do with squids, as the name of the upgrade would have suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus turned back towards the computer, only to find that the upgrade wasn't quite done with her. As she reached for the keyboard, she suddenly felt somewhat cold. The cause, it seemed, was her skin, which had started to take on a slightly slicker texture, feeling almost slimy. \"Huh?\" She held up a hand to her face to get a better look at her skin. It was still about the same colour, but felt smoother and slipperier. Was this why it was called the Squid Upgrade?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" As she held her hand up, Samus noticed that her fingernails seemed to be disappearing, and a similar feeling coming from her feet told her she was probably losing her toesnails as well. \"What purpose does that serve?\" she wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she felt her facial structure begin to change. She wasn't able to see the changes, but quickly noticed a mirror on the other side of the room, which she runed over to look at. By the time she was able to get a look at herself, her nose seemed to have gotten pointier, and curved upwards. She felt a bit of pain inside her mouth, and after opening up, she soon found the cause. Her top incisors had gotten sharper, and the two middle teeth on the bottom row had, somewhat painfully, merged together into a single tooth, that was equally as sharp as her incisors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, sharper teeth as well, huh?\" Samus mused. The next things to be affected were her ears, which started to grow much larger. \"Oh my,\" Samus muttered as she watched them grow, each becoming a triangle about as big as her hand. \"That's... interesting?\" It didn't seem to have affected her hearing at all, so it was mainly just an aesthetic change, looking rather silly attatched to the sides of her head. Her eyes were next, the skin around them, and in the space between them, becoming thicker and rougher, turning black in the process. It made it look as if she were wearing a mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, her hair began to feel strange. It seemed to be clumping together into one large mass, turning as smooth and slick as her skin, save for her ponytail, which seemed to have split into two separate masses. Most of it turned the same light blue as her Zero Suit, and the liquid inside the tank, but the underside of her ponytail turned white instead, and what seemed to be a pair of suckers formed on thw two parts of her ponytail. \"So, my ponytail is tentacles now?...\" Samus' voice trailed off as she suddenly started to gain new feelings. She started to gain feeling in the tentacles her hair was now made of, as if they were extra body parts instead of just hair. It was almost like having two extra arms sticking out of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This... is <i>woomy</i>.\" Samus jumped as her throat emitted an unfamiliar sound, her organs felt like they were squishing around, rearranging to fit whatever species she now was. \"<i>Oooh, my stomach.</i>\" Samus could tell she no longer seemed to be speaking anything that resembled English, but was still somehow able to understand what she was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her insides finally stopped sloshing around, Samus stood up straight and looked at herself in the mirror. She had to admit that she could kind of see the resemblance to a squid. \"<i>Still, what's the point of the upgrade?</i>\" she wondered aloud. She seemed to be some sort of human-like squid person dressed in civilian clothing, but it didn't seem like much of an upgrade. The only thing that seemed to have any sort of combat or exploration potential were the sharp teeth, and the mysterious tank on her back. Perhaps she'd be able to use it somehow? But as for how, she wasn't exactly sure.</span></div></div>",

And out came the chip from the module as it landed in her palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then inserted the chip into the slot on her hip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, it seemed as though nothing was happening. \"Hmph, must be defective\" Samus said, flicking her long hair upwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    All of a sudden, she felt as if she was getting colder. The cold began getting more and more severe as she felt mind numingly frozen. Samus folded her arms together in a desperate attempt to warm up, but she was still feeling cold. \"brrrrrrrrr....\" she tried to say something but all that came out were shivers. She lay down on the floor as the cold overwhelmed her. Suddenly something began to change.<br>\r\nHer zero suit began changing shape. The parts of her zero suit that were on her thighs began receding down to her knees and revealed her bare thighs, giving her suit the appearance of a sleeved leotard. The parts of her zero suit on her feet and lower legs began becoming less rubbery and latex like and more soft and fluffy. The leg holes on the top gained fluffy fabric on it and her boots became dark blue and thicker. Finally, a sharp heel had sprung from both her boots\u2019 soles. She had gained fluffy blue heeled boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As with her arms, the fabric began receding from her arms all the way back to her shoulders from her hands. She was now sleeveless and her dainty bare hands and arms were revealed. The shoulders of her zero suit began gaining fluff. Samus soon had big puffy white shoulder sleeves. The suit itself had then changed from its usual latex tight suit look to a more dress like look. The stripes on her suit had reshaped themselves into a V across the dress. The collar of her dress also widened and was no longer strapped tightly on her neck. Instead, it widened to a V like collar, giving her a low cut dress, exposing much of her chest from her upper breasts and showing cleavage. From the V, large fluff also circled her collar. Her suit had become a winter like dress. To finish it off, the dress created a veil which sprouted all the way down to her legs, glistening crystals shined from the veil like snow. A second veil had sprouted from the back of her dress\u2019s collar, giving her a queen like look. <br>\r\nThe upgrade had one more thing to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As Samus was shivering on the ground her skin began to turn a tinge of blue. the blue spread from her nose to her face to her arms and legs. Her hair had turned into a snow white color. The iris\u2019 in her eyes turned from green to blue, but the shine was not present like in normal eyes. <br>\r\nAll of a sudden Samus had begun feeling less cold, or rather the cold felt warm to her. She slowly got up. \u201cWha- What is this\u201d she said. Looking at her hand she was shocked to see it pure light blue. She looked around and saw her outfit was different. She examined herself and her dress. It was puffy and not so flexible, although it did look beautiful, she thought as she stretched her puffy sleeves. Samus wasn\u2019t one who was fond of dresses but she made due with what she had. She suddenly felt a sneeze come over her. \u201cChoo\u201d she went as she wiped her nose. She was surprised to see however, that where she sneezed there was a solid patch of ice. She poked the ice patch and it was indeed frozen solid. She was also surprised that despite being lightly dressed she was not cold at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Looking around herself, she was dispensing cold vapor all around her, the ground freezing under her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Samus figured she must have ice powers. she experimented a bit more. She slowly blew her breath in the air. She could see her breath and how cold it was, the area where she breathed dripping snowflakes. She then took an even deeper breath and blew an ever more powerful ice breath and aimed at a wall. Instantly, ice covered the wall solid. Samus wondered about the limits of her new powers. She concentrated and the air around her became more frigid, the walls covering with ice and snow as snow formed from the air and lined the ground. She let out a big breath and blasted it at the same wall she blew at before. The area was covering with ice spikes jutting out of the wall. She then concentrated on her left hand. Ice formed on her wrist and went up to her hand. It formed a large ice mace around her hand. Spikes jutted out of it like the wall. Turning around Samus charged at a nearby crate. \u201cHaaaaAAAAAAIIIYAAAH\u201d she went as she smashed the ice mace into a crate, blowing it to pieces, but the mace remained unscratched. Looking at her hand, she willed the mace away and the ice disappeared from her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Finally Samus was curious about whether she had beam powers. She stood up and aimed at the wall, trying not to fall on her new heels. She opened her mouth and in it formed a ball of light, the same was with her hands. She charged up the lightball and in an instant, blasted it at the last remaining wall in the room. It shot like a laser out of her mouth as the same energy formed and shot from her hands. Ice spikes covered the lines and cold air could be felt from being near the wall. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n     Samus had turned the room into a winter wonderland. She was now an automatic ice maker. She swung her hair and it swished to her left side. From it she saw snow coming out of it. She figured it wasn\u2019t so bad being a snow queen so to speak, even if she didn\u2019t quite like the white hair. She looked at her power suit sitting on the other side of the room next to the upgrade console, covered in snow. <br>\r\nShe decided to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking at the orb, she noticed with was glowing a light blue color, but has a writing that looks radical that says, <i>'Tracer' </i> on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tracer...?\" she asked with curiosity, \"Wonder what this upgrade does?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe used her visor to scan the upgrade to dig up some information.  That's when the scan was complete and the information window came to the side for her to read it.  It states...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Tracer Upgrade is a very rare upgrade in honor of a noble soldier a long time ago.  Once applied, the user will gain great speed and will help the user to zip back, around, and threw enemy lines without getting detected.  The user will also have weaponry that will make quick work on the target and will feature a special bomb ability that will stick to an enemy and explode, if timed right.  The special feature is a recall function where if the user are seriously injured of in a bit of a spot, the user will activate it to both get out of trouble and regain the amount of health the user has lost.  Whether it be a small battle or a full out war, the Tracer Upgrade is the best offensive weapon against any enemy that stands in the user's way.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through the info, Samus was very intrigued by it.  \"Hmm...\" she started, \"And upgrade that can me get by enemies rather quickly and help me get out of situations I can't control.  Seems like something for me to use.  And not a moment too soon.  The Space Pirates in the system are getting more aggressive then before and I in desperate need of something to help me get by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to the upgrade, she took a deep breath and decided to give this upgrade a go.  Slowly guiding the orb to it, it absorb into her armor and waited for something to happen.  What she didn't know is that this upgrade is starting to make some physical changes on Samus.  What was the first thing that changes?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Samus waited until the upgrade started, wondering what the Tracer Upgrade will look like.  Just then, she could feel her armor shifting around to accommodate her upgrade with a message on her visor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Begin Armor Modification...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first are her orange metal boots and legs as they thin and smoothed over with indents on her knees and feet.  Even the boots formed into metallic slip on sneakers for enhanced running ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext come her arms as the round shoulder pads flatten and smoothed perfectly on her shoulders.  Her arms near her wrists changed next as the one on her left grew a lump and multiple gears and equipment was added into it.  Pieces of metal fell off her fingers, leaving them exposed.  Samus soon look to her cannon arm to the right and was shocked to see it breaking apart and falling to the floor.  She soon see the same armors arm with the bulk inside and fingerless armored hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown on her chest, she noticed it slimming down to her actual bust size as a round hole opened up.  That hole grew out a red border and was glowing a light blue like energy.  She could feel another hole coming out of her back as the same light blue energy as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she could feel air air coming from her face as her helmet broke off and scattered on the floor in pieces.  This caused her blonde ponytail hair bursting out and cascaded down her back.  The only thing that she had was her green visor, which shifted into wrap around shades that go around her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the modifications were over, Samus looked to herself and was shocked by this.  \"This is the upgrade?!\" she said in horror.  \"Weakening my armor and removing my cannon?!  This has got to be some sort of joke!  I mean, how am I suppose to fight with my weapons?\"  She shook her arms and was frustrated by this upgrade.  By the time she did that, something strange happened.  The moment she shook her arms, the bulges opened up and two objects came out of them and wrapped around her hands.  Samus blinked and noticed that they look like semi automatic pistols in an orange and red color with a round part with a light blue outline around it.  She examined each pistol and started to be impressed by it.  \"Okay...  So I have aquired some new weapons.  Maybe it's not bad.  Wonder what else I have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, her visor glowed lowly and she noticed a stream of data scanning her modified armor.  It did a scan to show off her abilities and weapons as it said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Armor Modifications: Complete<br>\r\nBegin weapons and abilities diagnostics...<br>\r\nChronal Accelerator: Online<br>\r\nPulse Pistols: Online<br>\r\nPulse Bomb: Online<br>\r\nBlink Ability: Operational<br>\r\nRecall Ability: Operational<br>\r\nWeapons and Abilities Diagnostics: Complete'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked to the data on her visor and sighed in defeat.  \"Looks like whatever this upgrade is pretty much delete all of my old abilities and give me these new ones.\" she said in defeat, \"Oh well...  Must be a sacrifice to optain this upgrade.  I just need to figure out how to operate them.  Just then, another message appeared on her visor as she took a good look at it.  It reads...</span></div></div>",

She braced herself for whatever was about to happen to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tiny spot of Samus' hair turning a shade of brown went unnoticed as she eyed her lower body. She lifted her hand to her face. It was turning slightly smaller, and the changes were moving up her arm. The muscle on her arms faded, turning weaker. She looked down at her legs. Her hard, muscly thighs were melting away into fleshy, athletic runner's legs. She looked down at her chest. Her breasts had become a perky C cup. Her waist and stomach were growing thinner. She felt like her normal hands could have fit around her entire waist. She turned back, looking at her now plump backside. Thankfully, it still had its athletic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus placed a hand on her face. It felt thinner. Her lips had shrunken. Her nose was larger and stuck out further. Her eyes felt larger. At the top of her head, her hair had turned a dark brunette. Her ponytail was gone and her hair felt much shorter. It was gelled into a stylish hairdo that Samus couldn't comprehend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus turned to a reflective window. A perplexed expression grew on her face. She looked like a completely different person. She frowned, having difficulty understanding what help this upgrade could be. It had made her significantly weaker, albeit nimble. A thought came to her as she looked down at her legs. She jumped in the air. Although it wouldn't be obvious to any bystander, Samus felt incredibly light. Maybe it was because she had changed so much, but there really was a difference. She jogged in place, feeling surprisingly athletic. She performed a quick exercise, touching her feet. Maybe this upgrade wasn't half bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother message appeared on her goggles as she tested her new body. It read:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Samus looked at her goggles. She thought she had seen a new message, but there was nothing. \"Strange.\" Samus' eyebrows rose as she noticed her new voice. She decided to put that thought in the back of her head, shrugging her shoulders and putting her focus back on her upgrade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly broke into jog, exiting the upgrade room. Her legs lifted high in the air propelling her further and further ahead. Samus looked ahead, seeing a discarded pipe on the floor threatening to block her path. As her run took her towards it, she stamped both of her feet on the ground. Her legs curled downwards, and she jumped into the air. She landed several feet ahead, a proud grin on her face. Her jog came to a slow stop as she noticed a reflective surface on the metallic wall by her side. She turned to face it, deciding to observe her changes further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing she noticed were the light freckles lining her face. She lifted her orange goggles off her eyes and onto her forehead, looking at her face more closely. She ran a finger across her brunette eyebrows. They were sharp and narrow. Her ears slightly stuck out on the side of her head. Two silver rings hung off her left ear's helix. She ran her hand down side of her head, to her chin. Overall, she'd describe her face as 'petite'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus turned her attention to her clothing. A small brown bomber jacket was worn on her torso. The wool inside of it made her feel warm. Its collar was stuck up high. Its sleeves were folded up to her elbows. A strange, unfamiliar flag sat on the right arm of the jacket. Try as she might, Samus couldn't recognize the flag at all. Perhaps it indicated the place this woman was from? She'd attempt to search for its meaning later. On the left arm of the jacket was an insignia. Underneath it read \"Tracer\". Looking down, Samus gazed at the tight orange spandex that clung to her legs. There were slits running down the sides of each leg, but neither exposed her skin. She noted that the pants appeared to be made for running. Labelled on the left leg was the word \"TRACER\" in white. Clearly, that was the name of the woman she had changed into. She had to have been a powerful being to have her appearance and abilities placed in the upgrade station. But other than athleticism, Samus wasn't sure what made this upgrade notable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her focus to her two pistols. She lifted them up, aiming them at a nearby wall. She fired forward, tactically stepping side to side and moving around. The guns fired rapidly. Blue bolts of energy flew from their barrels. Suddenly, the weapons stopped. Samus looked to them, already knowing what to do. To her surprise however, the weapons had no apparent magazines. Suddenly two cylinders popped from the sides of each pistol. They glowed in a blue light, then slid back inside. Samus quickly deduced what this was for. She fired the pistols again, shooting down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus spent several more minutes shooting before she stopped. She put the weapons away and thought to herself. This upgrade was nice, but she'd like to return to normal. As she looked around the room she realized she wasn't sure where she was. How would she return to the upgrade station? A blue light on her chest caught her attention. Suddenly, the light overtook her, and in what felt like seconds, she was standing back in the upgrade room. She shook her head, her legs wobbling weakly. She collapsed to the ground, groaning. \"What just happened?!\" She muttered weakly, hearing her odd accent once again. She rose to her feet. Her head turned back, seeing a fading blue light leading out of the room. Had the upgrade given her the ability to move backwards? She took a few steps forward, looking down at the chestpiece. She focused on moving back, and just as before, she was engulfed in light. Samus observed her surroundings. She had moved backwards! Did this effect time at all? She had so many questions to answer, but her thoughts were interrupted.</span></div></div>",

'Command not understood.' Samus frowned, unamused. Her plush lips pursed and she clenched her teeth, speaking carefully. \"Abort upgrade.\" A small sense of pride grew within her as she spoke comprehensibly. A third message blipped on her visor. 'Unable to abort upgrade.' She groaned in anger. The newly-minted brunette attempted to remove the upgrade chip manually, reaching desperately behind her back. It proved fruitless as she prepared herself for the coming changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing she noticed was a feeling of heroicness. The upgrade may change her mind, but she would pull through. She had never been defeated, and wouldn't lose now. She had someone to protect. Or was there more than one person? The athletic woman yelled in frustration, realizing what was happening. She protected people as a bounty hunter. That wasn't going to change. She was determined to get herself out of this. But how? Her teal eyes turned to the object on her chest. She remembered it. Her chronal accelerator. But what was it for, and how did she use it? The woman had a feeling it could help her. She remembered being a pilot for a test craft made by the Galactic Federation... no, that was wrong. Her hair lightly waved around as she shook her head. That didn't matter. The accelerator was given to her after an accident. It was given to her by a large creature. She remembered that well. She killed creatures like that often. Evil ones. They worked for an organization.. so did she. Her brow furrowed, not being able to recall the names of either. Names! That's how she could stop this. Remember her name..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer name was Tracer.. no, that wasn't her name. It was her nickname.. her real name was.. something starting with A. Or was it something with A in it? Sam? No, that wasn't right either. Her hands gripped the sides of her head, rubbing against her short brown hair. She wanted to scream. Her head shook several times. Tracer attempted to remain calm, and it eventually became natural. She was confident. Or was that the upgrade changing her? No. She knew it was true. Her nickname was Tracer. She worked for Overwatch. That's where she had gotten her chronal accelerator, after an accident with a malfunctioning high-tech fighter jet. It allowed her to manipulate time around her. She needed to use it, now. But why? Everything seemed fine to her as more memories flooded her mind. She fought an organization called Talon. She had been contacted by Winston, a large intelligent ape, to reform the old Overwatch team. A bright smile grew on her face. That was all right. And her name? Lena Oxton. Lena's eyes blinked. When they opened, her pupils had turned a golden yellow. A feeling of wooziness washed over her and she wasn't sure why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's all the fuss about, luv?\" Tracer asked with concern. The British woman blinked again and shook her head. Who was she talking to? Right, there was another person in the room just moment ago. A woman. With blonde hair. She had blue clothing on. Sort of like her pants, but it stretched all over her body. Where had that woman gone off to? \"'Ello? You out there?\" Lena called out. Her voice echoed in the empty facility. She huffed, placing a hand on her hip. \"Now where'd she run off to?\" She shrugged her shoulders, looking around the large room. There were large rows of small chips filling the room. How had she gotten here? The Overwatch agent decided to save that thought for later, beginning to explore the facility.</span></div></div>",

The information she got after scanning was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Prototype MECHA Upgrade<br>\r\nNot fully tested yet.<br>\r\nInstall at your own risk.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus looked to this and was a little cautious.  \"A none tested upgrade?\" she asked herself, \"Didn't these creatures work on it and didn't test it?  How should I know that this upgrade would work if it is a prototype.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to the upgrade, she sighed and said, \"I guess I better start installing it anyways.  Better to try it out in the field then leave it here to do nothing.\"  So she placed it into her armor and waited for the upgrade to begin.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Samus waited to see how this upgrade work once she installed it.  That was when she felt a tingle from head to toe.  Her initial thought is that the upgrade is working, and it has been integrated with her armor.  So she decided to return to her ship and wonder what the upgrade can do.  But just as she was about to leave, she realized that that she wasn't moving at all.  Looking down, she noticed that her legs weren't functioning and wouldn't register any thought to walk.  She pushed herself so much, but she didn't budge an inch since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the world?\" she asked herself in confusion, \"Why can't I move my legs?  Don't tell me that the upgrade has disable my walking ability.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at the leg and noticed something quite right.  Looking to the tips of her boots, she spotted them shaking, as if something was happening.  \"Huh...\" she said as the saw something that she didn't expect.  The tips of her boots started to split apart in two and looked jagged while her heels started to rise from the floor and grew out by over two feet.  She looked to her deformed feet and was in a state a shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Fuck?!?\" she screamed in completely terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel the changes spread up to her legs as her thighs bulk up and make her body feel disproportionate.  The weight of her growing thighs caused her knees to bend forward heel rising up with her armor shifting around.  She would've felt any pain from her legs cracking and shifting, but she didn't.  What she didn't know is that her real body merged with her armor, making it look like her armor is her actual skin.  Even her insides changed as her bones became exoskeleton framing, gears growing into her joints, muscles turning into carbon fibers, and blood becoming coolant and oil.  Looking down, Samus could see that she now has a pair of metallic hind legs of an animal and she was scared of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" she yelled in surprise.  \"What is this upgrade doing to me?  I can't go out in the field like this!  I cannot even walk!!  I have to remove it from my armor fast before any further changes happens!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she said that, she could feel a tingle coming from her right cannon arm.  Looking to her arm, she realized that the changes are continuing on her.  Watching in fascination, she could see her arm shortening and contorting, bending into a straight position.  She then looked to her cannon and saw it growing and shifting with three circles in the cannon and shrinking into machine gun/chain gun like holes.  Seeing this, Samus tries to move it, but couldn't as it was frozen in place just like her legs.  Knowing that the changes aren't stopping, she has to remove the upgrade fast, otherwise the changes would be completed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Sumus Aran, ordering the immediate removal of the MECHA Upgrade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waited to see if the upgrade has been removed from her system and that she would go back to normal.  But unfortunately, there was an opposite of what she was expecting.  She could feel the tingling coming from her other arm as she looked to the left and saw the changes worsening.  Her arm changed like the previous one and got into the same position as the other one.  She soon saw her hand making the biggest of changes as the metal four of her fingers merged into two and the thumb reorganized to the bottom, the three digits just got sucked in and became three holes of a gun.  The rest of her arm became cylinder and the green orb migrated to her arm and grew to a power source with a tube connected to the gun.  Lastly, her orange paint job lighten to a metallic light blue color like her former cannon.  Seeing both her arms have become duel machine guns and she can't move both of them, Samus realized that the removal didn't work and tried to do it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, this is Sumus Aran, ordering the immediate removal of the MECHA Upgrade!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hoped that the order was responded this time.  But then she could feel the rest of her body tingling and growing, registering that it didn't work.  Her body began to expand and grew wide as if she was gaining weight.  At the same time, her body slouched forward and her head lowered to the front, forcing her to look down without her moving.  Her body kept getting bigger and wider until her body was unrecognizable.  As the sides and top, four small wings popped out and extended for aerial dynamics.  Two small headlights popped out and a ventilation system appeared next to them.  Finally four rocket boosters grew out of her back and remained on the side for enhanced speed.  Even her organs, from her lungs, liver, and heart, shifted and turned into a power core, ventilation system, and coolant fluid.  Samus now looked like a strange looking mech body suit with a human head and helmet.  She was getting frustrated and demanded the removal by force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remove the MECHA Upgrade this instant!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer visor sparked and knew that this is what she was waiting for.  A message appeared in front of her face and instead of what she wanted, she got a message that says...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'System Error...<br>\r\nCannot remove upgrade...<br>\r\nInstallation is perminant...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus eyes grew wide and feared the worse.  \"Installation is permanent?\" she said with a scared voice, \"No, no, no...  This can't be happening!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she could feel her head tingling and knew that the changes aren't finished yet.  In one ditch effort, she cried out for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help!  Somebody help me!  This upgrade is stuck in my power suit and it won't be removed!  Please!  I can't get it out and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, her mouth stopped working and forced open as she could feel the rest of her humanity slipping away.  Her mouth started to get wider as her face was being absorbed by her mouth.  As the same time, her visor grew wide to follow her mother and and was translucent.  The rest of her body hollowed out grew into it was big enough to fit a person inside, while two joysticks and handlebars grew inside.  To top it all off, two decals appeared on the top and has the title that says, <i>'S.MECHA'</i> as in it is a Samus Mech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a short amount of time, what was Samus standing there is just an inanimate MECHA suit without a pilot, waiting to be used.  Now what's the future for this former bounty hunter.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the changes complete, the room suddenly fell silent. Sitting where a once powerful bounty hunter had stood was a large, peculiar-looking mech. To be more specific, it was a type of mech produced by MEKA, the Mobile Exo-Force of the Korean Army, designed specifically for a human pilot. If put in the proper hands, this fat little mech could be quite powerful. However, for the moment, the blue mech sat there like any other shut-down mech would, not a single thought or movement running through its robotic \"body\". It was an inanimate object after all, and like any other object, it did not think. And sadly, without someone to pilot it, this mech would remain completely useless. So it sat in silence, doing nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil suddenly, a light began to engulf the powerful mech. If there had been any bystanders in the room to witness this beautiful light (which there were not), they would be blinded by the sight of it. It exploded across the entire mech suit until it was completely engulfed. Then, in a matter of milliseconds, it shrunk down until it completely disappeared, taking the mech with it and leaving the room empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what's taking so long?! This is getting boring!\" A small Korean girl in a futuristic jumpsuit spoke. She stood in the docking bay for spacecraft carriers. Long, brown hair which flew in the wind extended past her shoulders. She sported a pair of strange looking headphones atop her head, and two pink make up markings on both of her cheeks. The woman tapped her foot impatiently as she chewed a wad of bubblegum. \"Hmph! They were supposed to be here hours ago!\" She crossed her arms. \"Eh-hyu! I can't even play any games here with this crappy internet!\" She shouted angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, as if her prayers had been answered, a large ship designed to carry heavy cargo flew into the bay and parked. As the door to its cargo opened, the girl ran up excitedly. Standing before her was a shiny new mech! She ran to it in glee, a large smile strewn across her face. \"Finally, it's here!\" She rubbed her gloved hand against the mech's left turret. She practically drooled in awe before the shiny mech. \"I've been waiting to get this one forever! It's perfect!\" She squealed in delight. The Korean rubbed her face against the mech's arm, pressing her lips against the side of its turret and giving it a smooch. \"Ah, I think I'm gonna faint! You're so.. epic!!!\" She spoke to the mech, knowing fully well it wouldn't say anything back. The small girl entered the suit with haste, sitting down in its leather chair. She squirmed her tight butt around in the seat, getting as comfortable as possible. \"So comfy!.. I could.. almost.. fall asleep..\" She yawned jokingly before leaning forward and grabbing its joysticks. \"Now let's see what you can do!\" The mech suddenly turned on, its control board flashing and its visor filling with several GUIs full of Korean. The mech suddenly stomped forward as its pilot commanded it. The mech's jets activated as it flew forward, further and further from the boring old docking bay.</span></div></div>",

She bobbed and weaved through the tight confines of the urban location, another city under threat from the seemingly endless Omnic threat. Waves of the battle droids fell before her as she jetted around making overrated one liners and geekbait catchphrases as the battle was streamed to hundreds of thousands of easily impressed people all over the globe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah, D.VA, LOVED this mecha. It was so smooth and responsive, almost like it was anticipating her commands, though countless maintenance checks and program diagnostics found nothing to be out of the ordinary. Clearly D.VA was just as good as she thought she was. That had to be the only explanation and Hannah, in her overbearing egotism, quickly ignored the uptick in the suit's performance. After all, who had time to actually care about all that nerd stuff? All those pathetic losers out there that followed her every move could try to figure it out on their own. Right now, she had more battles to win, and more corporate sponsorships to enjoy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, she was the perfect geekbait right now, and she had to milk this for as long as she could before she actually got old and her reaction times started going. D.VA knew that once that happened, she'd quickly lose everything and even *gasp* have to actually work!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheer thought of having to go back to being a 'normal' person disgusted the 'pro gamer girl' and she devoted even more time and energy to combat, seeking out bigger and badder fights to boost her subscription numbers and thus, her bank account. That was all that mattered anyway.<br>\r\n___<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIT had been months since D.VA had acquired her now favorite MECHA, though clearly the gamer girl turned soldier had bitten off more than she could chew this time. Omnics swarmed all around her and despite her lightning fast reflexes she just could not keep up with the amount of firepower that was being hurled at her. The screen in her cockpit began to flash warning signs and intone ominously in Korean that the mecha was taking critical damage and that it would soon be destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, no fair!\" D.VA squeaked, her clearly forcibly accented American voice whiny and high pitched as she hopped and jumped out of the range of enemy fire, finding a very temporary respite being a concrete wall that had once been a bank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like there's only one thing to do\" She growled, even in this deadly situation she was still playing the camera for her mindless fans and followers. \"You've been a good ride but I guess it's time to trade up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nD.VA grabbed the joysticks dramatically as her livestream chat went wild with 'NERF THIS NERF THIS NERF THIS' memes and Hannah prepared to sacrifice the mindless robotic shell in a massive explosion that was sure to save the day and get her even more followers and corporate endorsements. Those mindless pleebs lived for this kind of stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah gripped the controls to her suffering mech and readied herself for her signature move...</span></div></div>",

She lined up the target; the center of the Omnic horde and initiated the self destruct countdown. She readied herself to eject, still playing up the cameras by giving a sad look around her cockpit and, in a moment of what she considered improv genius, gave the mecha's screen a quick kiss before winking to the camera. She pulled the eject lever and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened. Confused, Hannah pulled the lever again and yet again, nothing happened. Panic filled her veins as she began crying out, kicking at the mecha's back hatch with her feet, twisting around in the cockpit to beat on it with her fists, but it was to no avail. The terrible, terrible battle had left the former bounty hunter turned mindless machine too damaged for the South Korea celebrity to escape, and D.VA began openly weeping to the camera, crying out for someone, anyone to help her, that she didn't want to die a pathetic cam girl weeb bait, that she was just an actor and not a soldier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer livestream's comments ranged the full spectrum of Internet emotion, from terrified concern to anger and disdain as her viewerbase found themselves at the end of her insults. And at least one person, singing on to watch the Livestream for the first time, took the time to type a long 'hello' comment and about how much they loved watched D.VA's youtube highlights, and then complaining about not knowing what was happening and why D.VA wasn't saying hello or immediately visiting their own youtube channel to watch some dumb clip montage they had created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, D.VA trapped in her MECHA, and with a final squeak of fear she cried out for her mother right as the mindless machine that had been a sentient bounty hunter in another universe exploded in a ball of fire and shrapnel. But all of her flailing had driven the MECHA off course, and instead of becoming a massive hero, even in death, D.VA has simply direct the Samus MECHA into a isolated wall away from the frontlines of the battle. Only one Omnic was destroyed in her wasted sacrifice, and if Samus had been anything more than a bunch of reprogrammed code, she would have welcomed the sweet release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she wasn't, and D.VA's sacrifice amounted to that of her life: A zero sum. The livestream was pulled down immediately, and soon almost all trace of Hannah/D.VA was removed from the world, with some new geek bait cam girl being propped up by corporate sponsors, spouting off the same tired catch phrases and appealing to the same mindless, easily entertained crowds of viewers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the universe lost a great hero, though that had been months ago when Samus had picked up the Upgrade chip that had sealed her fate. No one mourned for her, and soon, no one mourned for her overrated owner.</span></div></div>",

The pirates around the system are more fierce then before and I'm always having trouble with protecting innocent people and the lives of the soldiers fighting the good fight.  Perhaps this could be my chance in saving this galaxy with this upgrade.  I mean, what can I afford to loose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with confidence, she placed the orb to her body armor and watched as it absorbed into her.  Once she did that, she waited to see what changes will this upgrade do.</span></div></div>",

Looking around, one caught her eye.  All the orbs are the came with different colors, but this one is in the shape of an octagon sphere and was glowing in a light blue color.  She soon picked it up and examined it closely, intrigued by this particular orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a strange upgrade.\" she said in interest, \"I never seen one such as this.  Wonder what it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did a quick scan of this unique upgrade to see what it's all about. When the scan was complete, the information of the upgrade appeared of her visor.  Looking to it, she saw the title that says, <i>Symmetry Upgrade</i> and checked the rest of it.  The information states...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'This upgrade is about bringing order and perfection out of a world or universe in chaos.  By applying this upgrade, you can bring forth peace to those that bring war to worlds.  In short, this upgrade will help save the universe and you will be a peacekeeper to all worlds.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus finished reading it and was curious of it.  \"A peacekeeper...\" she said to herself, \"I'm more of a bounty hunter and fighter then making the peace.  Still, maybe this upgrade can help stop all the in fighting of some colonies and the pirates making things difficult for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starred at this upgrade and was hesitant at first.  But giving that this is a new upgrade that she needed to protect this universe.  And she always want to try new things.  So taking a deep breath, she said to herself, \"Well, here goes nothing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed the octagon into her body armor and it was absorbed into her.  Now all she has to do is wait to see what happens.  It was then that she felt her body changing, but what is the question.</span></div></div>",

But looking around, there was one she spotted that brings a key interest in her.  It was an orb, just like any other, but it was a blue color and had a symbol on it that looks like an eye, but in a intriguing design.  From what she knows of it, it was an ancient glyph that belonged to a civilization that was lost for eons ago.  Ancient Egyptian she believes it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...  This looks like a promising upgrade.  Let's see what this is about.\" she said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did a quick scan to see what this upgrade contains.  Finishing the scan, she saw the information on her visor and read through it.  From what she saw, it said that it was called <i>Pharah Upgrade</i> and shows a detail information about it.  It reads...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'This upgrade is the most valuable and important one of them all.  Once installed, it will turn the owner into the ultimate protector complete with the weapons needed annihilate any enemy in sight.  Just remember, when installing this upgrade, you are fully obligate to bring justice to the universe and nothing more.  So choose this upgrade wisely.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus read through the upgrade and was a little hesitant about it.  \"Bring Justice to the universe.  That sounds like a something a soldier would follow.  I mean, I was a soldier once, and it didn't work out for me.  Don't feel like doing it all over again.\" she said with a bit of annoyance.  But starring at the upgrade, she then remembered what the information just said about the upgrade.  \"On second thought...\" she then said, \"They said this upgrade has to most powerful arsenal and could be of some use with all those pirates getting in the way.  Maybe I'll give this one a go and see how it feels.  After all, I can unintall it if I don't like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with that said, she placed the orb to her armor and it was immediately absorbed.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Samus was rummaging through the various chip upgrades, not sure which one to pick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly one caught her eye. An unnamed chip. She picked it up and looked it over. From front, back and sides she saw no name. She normally wouldn't use an upgrade she didn't know about but against her better judgement she decided to try this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw that it could only be used with her zero suit so she stepped out of her power suit, leaving the armor standing in place. <br>\r\n     She opened a compartment in the hip of her blue zero suit and placed the chip within. Registering it, the suit sent a signal to the cyber fibers of her suit to start the upgrade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Samus felt a tingling throughout her body. She looked down to see if anything changed. So far there was nothing. Then she saw something unexpected. The front of her zero suit began changing color. It looked like a shade of pink was coming over her blue suit. No, not just any pink, a bright pink that screamed girly girl. It covered her whole suit including her jet heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....what\" Samus said in disbelief. She then felt something tingling on her torso to groin area. \"Uhh aagh\" she went in a bit of pain, as it felt like her entire body was shifting. She felt bones crack as her hips widened and her wait was squeezed into her body. The chip was altering her bone structure into one that had perfect child birthing hips, as they became large and wide. \"What is this\" she said as the changes continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext her legs began to elongate. They grew into big beautiful dancer legs that raised Samus' height by a foot and a half. <br>\r\n    Samus then felt a tingling in her behind. Turning around she saw why. Her butt was growing. It fattened and rounded behind her as it grew and swelled. Sticking out like a shelf behind her into a big, firm, jiggly bubble butt pressing against the pink fabric of her zero suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this? Computer, what kind of upgrade is this\" Samus asked, seeing the consequences of her own curiosity. \"Scanning through database...\" The computer searched the various upgrade files for info on the nameless chip that was modifying Samus' body into a even more well endowed woman's.<br>\r\n    \"Upgrade found. Bimbo upgrade currently uploading into suit and altering genetic code\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus couldn't believe it. \"Bimbo upgrade? Who would even make that and what purpose would- she asked out of anger when she felt more changes happening. \"Oooh' she began moaning suddenly as she felt great heat in her womanhood below. For some reason she felt greatly aroused as the next changes happened. Looking down she saw her breasts, already quite impressive, start growing even more. She was panting from pleasure as she felt her breasts expand and grow. They swelled like balloons as they surged forward and became huge and it looked like they weren't stopping. They get to E-cups, F-cups and even G-cups. Finally they settled down at H-cups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus tried to balance herself and her huge breasts that jiggled with every movement. \"Stop download, stop download now!\" She screamed. \"Error..cannot stop download, upgrade will continue to alter genetic code\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was shocked in fear at that but still persisted. \"Stop download, stoppuh mmmph- Samus felt a tingling in her lips. She tried to rub her lips but it didn't stop. She smacked them together before she realized they were swelling. They grew into bigger puffier redder lips, perfect for kissing. \"Muh mouff\" Samus tried saying but her large lips stopped her from getting out words right. <br>\r\n  She didn't know why but she couldn't stop herself from making smooching noises with her lips as well as touching her breast with one hand. Part of her however was in control as she reached down to the chip slot and tried pressing it to open. It didn't work as it would not open no matter how much she pressed. <br>\r\nFeeling overwhelmed by the arousing feeling of touching her breast, she gave into the pleasure and stopped resisting the change, allowing it to continue. <br>\r\nFrom her head she felt her hair itch. Reaching one hand to her scalp she began scratching. With every scratch her hair began growing longer and longer. It was also changing it's tone into a brighter yellow. Her hair soon burst out of her scalp in a waterfall, destroying her band that kept her ponytail in the process. More and more hair grew from her head. The front of her right eyes was blocked by a large waft of blonde hair. her hair grew down to the floor even going past her butt to knee level. This new hair was even shinier and brighter than her previous hair. Eventually her whole back was draped in her new long lush, bright, healthy, beautiful hair. There were no split ends or knots to be found, her hair was perfectly kempt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..uuooh\" Samus webt, the pleasure of her self fondling and the growth of her new hair ending enough for her to regain self awareness. \"Wh-wha\" she said as she looked at her right and saw the large waft of hair blocking her view. \"Ugh\" she said grabbing the waft of hair. Feeling behind her she felt even more hair coming from her head draping her back. \"This is too much\" she said complaining about her hair.<br>\r\nFinally, the computer spoke once again. \"Cosmetic changes must be applied to finish physical changes\" it said. \"What\" Samus said as her suit activated a certain new feature, a makeup kit within her suit collar attached to a robot arm. It had everything for the face from blush to eyeliner. <br>\r\n\"Sto-uuugmph\" Samus tried saying before a mini robot arm from the kit began caking her face with powder and then coloring her cheeks with heavy amounts of blush. It then applied blue eyeliner above her eyes. If one we're to look at Samus at the moment she would be considered \"beyond gorgeous\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Physical changes complete, beginning mental changes\" the computer said...</span></div></div>",

If this is what the upgrade did to her body she feared what it would do to her mind. The chip beeped and blooped from within her pink suit as it began sending a signal through her bloodstream which was travelling into her brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing what else to do Samus attempted to try and smash the chip out of her suit with her fist as she hit the slot on her wide hip over and over as the movements caused her huge softball sized breasts to jiggle and bounce against her torso, making her face turn red with pleasure. <br>\r\n \"get out of me, GET OUT\" Samus shouted. It was too late as the chip was already dissolving into her blood. <br>\r\n  Suddenly Samus dropped to the floor on her knees as her breasts bounced again from the movement. She clutched her head which was seething in pain, her hands on both sides of her head. She could suddenly feel her intelligence slipping away as well and her concentration weakening. \" Have to get...chip out..have...to...like..do my hair?\"Her mind was being drained of everything she knew about fighting as she also started having the urge to comb her hair and smear lipstick on her big beautiful puffy red lips. Her mind was being drawn more towards clothes shopping and putting makeup on herself. As well as boys..endless thoughts of kissing boys. \"Like....totally..I am..so hot\" she said in a very valley girl accent. Final thoughts entered her mind of simply pleasuring herself. She also became a bit vain as most of her thoughts went to her physical appearance. <br>\r\n Getting up as the pain subsided and her mind was completely bimbofied, Samus looked down at herself and at the large fleshy orbs she sported on her chest. <br>\r\n\"Like oh my gosh, my boobies are so like, huge\" she said as she shook her breasts left and right as they jiggled violently smacking into each other before settling in their resting spot on her chest calmly. \"Teeheehee\" she said giggling at her breasts' jigglyness. She squeezed one as it felt so soft and squishy as she continued to marvel at it. \"Oh that feels so gooooood\" she said, squeezing it repeatedly as it gave her immense pleasure and warmth. She loved having 2 huge softball sized pleasure machines on her. <br>\r\n Turning around she moved her long hair out of the way as she stared at her butt. \"And golly, my caboose is like mondo sized\" she said as she squeezed her large round buttocks, her fingers sinking into the squishy flesh. Turning around she noticed the computer in front of her and walked up to it. <br>\r\n Looking at the screen she said \"lookin' like, totally hot\" she said admiring her reflection in the screen as she posed seductively with her hand on her hip. <br>\r\n \"Upgrade complete\" the computer said.<br>\r\nSays, startled by the voice that came out of nowhere said \" Omg who said that? Are you like a ghost or something\"? <br>\r\n \"No Samus Aran, it is simply me, the computer console operating this station. Your upgrade was just completed. Do you have anymore questions\" the computer asked. <br>\r\nSamus put her hand on her hip. \"Yeah like, is there a mall around here\" she asked nonchalantly, the only things on her mind being clothes shopping, makeup and the color pink.<br>\r\n \" Your recent upgrade was one of unexpected results. Because of the intelligence drop you received you may be unsuitable for combat. As such, it is highly considerable to retire your bounty hunting career and live normally among civilians\".<br>\r\n Trying to understand what the computer .just said, Samus simply said. \"Like ok Mr ghost voice robot man\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe computer..</span></div></div>",

I recommend looking at these upgrades as they go well with your current bimbo upgrade\" it said as it flicked its screen and selected 5 chips shown on the screen. The 5 chips spit out of a slot of the large computer console and landed on the keyboard scattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh like, pretty cute little techy squares\" Samus said. The bimbo upgrade has apparently drained her intelligence more than anticipated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked one up and it said \"goth upgrade\". She did remember about how to insert chips into her suit by recent memory so she took the chip and inserted it into the chip slot on her hip on her suit. \"Like, I know it totes goes here right\" Samus asked the computer, trying to remember if ahe was doing this right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct Samus\" the computer said. To itself it thought that perhaps she wasn't that dumb now and had a good memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment nothing happened. Then thr tingling began.\"Like teehehehehe I am like so ticklish. I feel like, my insides are like, being touched with feathers\" she said as the chip began altering her DNA some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chip broke down and dissolved into her blood. It changed form into a dark substance that spread and multiplied inside her bloodstream, affecting her cells and eventually everything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like...golly I feel so tired\" Samus said as she sat down for a second on her big round jiggly butt. Outside physical changes began to occur. First her hair had a black tip of itself that began spreading.  More and more of her hair was becoming pitch black like night. Her skin lost its healthy peach color, turning into a pure white color as her eyes changed from blue irises to black and purple irises. Her eyelashes became pitch black too and longer. Her big red puffy bimbo lips changed into a pure black color, looking all natural. Finally her suit began to change as well. The bright pink was fading into a pitch black skintight zero suit with purple lines. Her heels had some of their fabric pulled back, revealing the top of her bare feet still concealed within fancy looking dress heels. As an added touch, her breasts began growing again, the orbs becoming more gigantic as they stretched the fabric of her zero suit. The suit however was adjusting and a boob window was opened up on top of Samus' pure goth white cleavage. Her breasts were now around K Cup and jiggled furiously up and down. On her eyes were purple eyeliner. Within her mind another change occurred as well. She became a bit smarter but not at the level she was before, and started gaining an affinity for the color black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, totes yeah I'm smokin' hot baby\" Samus said as she held her gigantic breasts. Somehow she had the back muscle to carry her heavy load. \"And this black suit, I feel like...its the color or my soul. Pure darkness...i love it\" she said fascinated with her newfound love of black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Upgrade complete\" the computer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like heck yeah it is, I love the new me. I think I found my idendity\" Samus said with her arms on her still huge hips.

The intelligence boost this upgrade provides is sustainable for bounty hunting\" the computer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like totes cool. I'm gonna go bust them pirates\" Samus said confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, but first an adjustment.

If it's gonna be the ship of a bangin' goth babe like me, it needs to, like, fit my soul and stuff. Make it sleek and sexy, but also dark and mysterious. But, could you keep any weapons on it? Don't want it totally defenseless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood.\" The computer said, the image of Samus's ship vanishing. \"The modifications may take some time, so feel free to explore the station.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK!\" Samus said, walking away.<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nAbout a minute later, Samus had located what she was looking for: a full length mirror. She had wanted to see the full extent of her change. And so far, she was liking what she saw. She loved her pale skin, her black-and-blonde hair, and her puffy black lips. And of course, she couldn't keep her hands off her now huge boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hot damn! I am, like, such a sex goddess!\" Samus said, doing numerous sexy poses. \"And all this black makes me look dark and dangerous. I LOVE IT! And hot damn, I love these titties! So big, bouncy, and soft. Maybe they'll, like, get even bigger! I want 'em so big that no one'll ignore them. Then again, don't think anyone'll ignore me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with the physical changes, the combination of the Bimbo and Goth upgrade had given Samus a new personality. She now loved anything related to the creepy and the disturbing, from horror movies to urban legends. She also gained a newfound fascination for the sadder side of things, like tragic songs, stories ending in death, and funerals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the flip-side, though, she also gained a love for fashion and shopping, wanting to hit the nearest galactic mall soon to get some new gothic clothing. She was also much more cheerful, an odd contrast to her love of spooky and sad things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she became much more proud and open of her beauty and sexuality. She couldn't wait to flaunt her giant boobs and bubble butt in the sexiest clothing possible. Interestingly, she was less interested in skimpy clothing that showed of skin. Instead, she wanted clothing that covered her fully, but was so skin-tight that it looked painted on. She also wanted latex. A lot of latex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, a rather odd addition was that thinks to the mixing of Bimbo and Goth, she could fully remember her old life before the upgrades. And she was not pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, I was such a bore before.\" Samus said, crossing her arms under her bust. \"I was so serious and stotic all the time. Never wanted any fun at all. Well, that was, like, the old me. The new me is gonna rock this galaxy. I'm gonna kick Space Pirate ass, look damn sexy while doing it, and have some gothic and/or bimbo fun! Look out galaxy, here's comes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then realized she needed a gothic name. She'd still answer to Samus, but she needed a nickname. Somthing dark, yet sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...that's it!\" Samus exclaimed. \"From now on, I'm Samus \"Morticia\" Aran!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Modifications to the ship have been completed.\" The voice of the computer rang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just in time!\" Samus, or rather, Raven, said. With a wink to the mirror and a playful smack to her ass, she sauntered back to the terminal.<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nAt the terminal, the computer greeted the smiling goth bimbo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back Samus.\" The computer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me Morticia now. A much more dark slash badass slash sexy name.\" Samus said. \"I'll still answer to Samus though. Or Sammy. Any of those three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, of course, miss Morticia.\" The computer said. \"I have finished modifying your ship, but I have one last thing to give you before I show you the ship. You're previous AI, Adam, no longer fits your current state, so he has been returned to the Federation. A new AI has been installed, and is ready to meet you. She has no name yet, so give her whatever name you desire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus watched as the computer screen changed, showing a pink and black background.

The screen was a pink square outline around a black center, a line moving like a heart monitor everytime the A.I. spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, totally likewise. You sound like so hot and a total dark and sexy babe\" the now gothic bimbo Samus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much my love, you aren't a slouch at being sexy yourself\" the A.I. said as a compliment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So like, we gotta like give you a name right\" Samus asked the A.i..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct...my name will be what you designate for me...I hope its something dark and alluring\" the machine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm...\" Samus wondered what she could name the new computer partner that would join her on her adventures. She crossed her arms under her huge breasts. \"I like, totally got it\" she said. \"We'll call you umbra, cause it's dark AND sexy\" Samus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umbra...I do love it so. Excellent choice Sammy\" Umbra said as the buzzline on the screen curled into a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like totes perfect. Let's get a move on and like, go show off my totes new sexy goth style to the galaxy\" Samus said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen flickered and the regular station A.I. reappeared. \"Umbra has been transported to your new ship. Do you wish to depart now\" the a.i. asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus said \"yeah I'm like totally done preparing. I can leave\" Samus said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Acknowledged, I shall ready your ship for departure\" the A.I. said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisappearing with a flicker of the screen, Samus flipped her hair and turned around to saunter back to fhe docking bay. She sashayed her hips back and forth and left and right, making her butt jiggle and huge boobs jostle up and down vigorously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the docking bay Samus saw her ship. It had been completely changed. The outside was now completely black and shaped more like a shuttle. The front had a gigantic skull masking the front with the window serving as a \"visor\" of sorts and the window was now purple. The back had a purple rudder shaped like a guitar axe, two purple triangular blades pointing towards the back of the ship and the large exhaust port on the back being a big gaping hole between the two axe blades. The sides were decorated with skull faces and violet roses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like woooow, I am totes in love with my hot sexy new ride\" Samus said enthusiastically as she ran up to her newly redesigned ship. She looked over every detail. The skulls with roses really spoke to her, representing her newfound love of darkness and the undead. She hugged the ship in a loving manner. \"I am like, in love with this baby. It represents my soul<br>\r\ncompletely\" Samus said hugging her ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked for the entrance and saw an \"open\" button. Pressing it, the bottom of the ship opened up, a door lowering down to become steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus walked up the steps, her suit boots clacking against the steps and into the ship interior. The inside was as expected, completely dark. The walls, ceiling and floors were a shiny black and purple color. They were illuminated only by the interior pink lights and windows. Decorating the walls were several skulls and surprisingly an axe guitar. Several orange lights lit up the room in the back. It showed a black fridge as well as a purple bed with black sheets. Samus figured there were more rooms but for now she would go to her cockpit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe terminal at the cockpit was a black console with a big purple screen above the window and purple and pink buttons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like totes nice\" Samus said sitting on her chair, which was a black soinning chair with a skull design on the front of the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the screen came to life. \"Hello Samus....how do you like your ship?\" Umbra said in a sultry voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like, love it lol\" she said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am glad you do my sweetie...but allow me to show you...its perks and what I....can do for you.

Beeping for a moment, it ejected another small chip. \"This is the genius upgrade. It should in all likely-hood counteract the mental regression effects of the bimbo upgrade\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um like, okay. It is totes cute and small\" she said, still not quite sure what most of what the computer was saying means. She did however figure it had to do with using that chip somehow. She walked up to the terminal, heels clacking, hips swaying with her large meaty butt and jiggling breasts bobbing up and down. She picked up the tiny chip, giggling slightly. \"Oooh its so cute\" she said holding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Insert the chip into your upgrade slot on your left hip\" the a.i. said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like okie dokie\" Samus said. She looked at her left hip, which was super wide thanks to her giant round butt. Looking at it she saw the small rectangle shaped hole on her pink suit. \"Hmm, square goes in....square! I am totes smart\" Samus said, praising her \"smartness\". She inserted the chip into her hip slot. Immediately the chip began digitizing itself into her suit and entered her bloodstream through contact with her skin. The electricity going into her brain began altering it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I feel mondo dizzy..all of a sudden\" Samus said as she sat down to rest. She then laid down as if to sleep as the pain in her head became more intense. Clutching her head in her arms she screamed \"Auuugh aaaagh\". The upgrade was fueling her with intelligence. Facts and figures all popped up in her mind one after the other. Equations, history, facts and figures all popped up in her vision and head. Hyperventilating from the pain her head swelled slightly and she jerked up with one final scream. Unknown to her her breasts also grew somewhat with her brain activity increasing, becoming a little over softball size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pant...pant, like...what happened\" Samus said, still using her valley girl accent but with a noticeably deeper voice. She looked down to see her large pink bosom. \"Oh right, i was like, bimbofied and my mind was altered\" she said. The last thing she remembered was crouching in pain from the bimbo upgrade dumbifying her mind. Then what happened next hit her and she remembered the embarrassing way she acted, touching her breasts and butt and saying childish things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with more self awareness she got up and processed her current state. She was still busty and sexy, but no longer low in intelligence. In fact she felt smarter than ever. \"Man, my totes large mammaries are huge\" she said cupping her large breasts the size of softballs, squishing them together. Mammaries. that wasn't a word she used often. She felt the urge to use her more vast vocabulary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to a wall and found a marker, writing down the e=mc2 formula on a wall with perfect accuracy. She then wrote down several math formulas, equations, order of operations and super complex math problems and solved them. The stress of knowledge she kept left her head after she let off a whole wall of writing, the wall covered in formulas and equations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering more she remembered the computer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Computer, what is like, with my body and mind\" Samus said. \"I am like, a walking dictionary and stripper\" she said with hands on her thick hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your body has recently gone through the change of the bimbo upgrade, enhancing your physical features but lowering your mental capacity. You have just been further upgraded with the genius upgrade\" the computer said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Genius upgrade? So i'm super smart\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Affirmative\" the a.i. said. \"Your intelligence has been enhanced beyond the average human level. You can learn and adapt new subjects quickly and you have knowledge of virtually all fields of study and science\" it said. \"While the upgrade is within you you will not succumb to the intelligence drop of the bimbo upgrade\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm ok\" Samus said. \"But then, why am I like, still talking like this. And i still want to like, really shop and buy like, lots and lots <br>\r\nof clothes. And why can't I stop thinking about boys!\" Samus said in a flurry of panic. Her mind was a flutter with visions of men with large abs, strong muscles and, to her shame, large manhoods. She couldn't help it however, thinking and talking like this was instinctively embedded into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately the bimbo upgraded has been fused with your DNA after the glitch in your suit caused it to be unable to eject. The upgrade has entered your system and infused with your genes on a subatomic level. Removal is impossible\" the computer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Samus supposed that she should accept her fate. At the very least she wasn't dumb as bricks and was smarter than the average person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking it through, she liked the intelligence and despite feeling repulsed somewhat by her new porn star looks, urges and thoughts, she would try and bear with the bimbo upgrade for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh, well, like i suppose this'll like, do for now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then..</span></div></div>",

Turning the laser towards her chest she shot at it, a single pink laser shot blasting out of it and hitting her chest. Immediately her chest started to vibrate, boobs jiggling in her pink suit by themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh yeah\" Samus said cupping her breasts. The vibrations got bigger as they shook more and more. The sensation was very warm feeling and was making Samus feel very flushed as her breasts started to feel warm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after her breasts started swelling, growing from their already impressive H cup to an I and then J. Her breasts swelled and swelled as they grew nore and more. All the while Samus was getting very aroused by the warm feeling making her face red as she breathed in and out, feeling very hot as her breasts grew and pushed at her pink zero suit. Thankfully her zero suit was designed to withstand any size change she would go through so her growing breasts wouldn't snap the fabric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey swelled like bread in an oven as they grew to the size of beach balls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the growth stopped. Samus panted from the extremely hot sensation of her boobs morphing into such a huge size. Looking down she saw her new bust. \"Like, wooooow look at me. I am busty incarnate\" she says heaving her gigantic breasts that now went down to above her knees. As she squished them from both sides they jiggled up and down heavily like freshly made jello, slapping and squishing her legs as they bounced up and down. They felt heavy but also felt extremely soft as Samus dug into her breast flesh as it squished easily like a sponge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this was like, a totally awesome success\" Samus said looking at her pink boob growing laser with pride. \"Totes keeping this one in my arsenal\" she said holstering it on a slot on her hip. She also made sure to make it so the ray modified her back muscles to support her giant breasts no matter their size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might I ask what the purpose of this invention is\" the computer asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, to make the galaxy hot of course. Every girl will want a pair of funbags. Well, maybe not as big as mine ahaha\" she said laughing, sending her giant jiggling breasts in a bouncing frenzy. The bimbo upgrade had truly taken over her mind and her sense of self down to her base DNA. Whatever was left of the original Samus was but a twinkle in a sea of pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus then decided she should be going soon but felt some more things needed to be done. Maybe another invention, or testing out more of her bimbo upgrade perks for her suit. Then again her ship was looking too \"drab\" for the new her she has become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decides to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once she entered the ship bay, she looked at her gunship.

It was also MUCH bigger, so Samus could move around much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the technical side, the ship had been fitted with a new warp engine and improved cloaking technology. It had also been given new ion cannons for combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, now this looks totes cute!\" Samus said. \"Hey computer, is the AI installed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct.\" The computer replied. \"Adam has been returned to Federation computers, and the new AI is installed. Her name is Eve. I decided to give you an AI that complimented your current personality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neat-o!\" Samus said. \"Can I, like, talk to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" The computer replied.

The screen went from the blue-ish green of the station computer to a bright bubbly pink, a white line similar to a heart monitor's line across the screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um like, hello ms. Samus. I'm Eve and I am like, your cute new a.i.\" she said, the line on the screen making zigzags as she talked. \" I hope you will like, accept my services to you\" she said politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O.m.g. you are sooooo totes adorbs\" Samus said to the a.i. \"I love your pink screen and your voice is totes cute\"  Samus said complimenting the machine personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-ooh um, thank you like, so much. You are very gorgeous as well, I totes love your hair, make up and love your boobs. I hope I wasn't overstepping there\" she said shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget about it, you are totally doing just fine, and thanks like so much for the compliments as well\" Samus said. The 2 valley girl pink bimbo personalities complimented each other so well. Both were very pink and bubbly that if it could manifest, pink bubbles of perpetual happiness would float around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, shall we get going\" Samus said, her hands on her hips as her breasts jiggled from the movement of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I'll transfer myself to your ship's monitor right away\" Eve said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Samus proceeded to walk down the hall to the deck where her ship was. Her movements were sultry as she moved her huge hips too and fro. Her bean bag sized breasts jiggled and bounced against her legs, the flubber of them moving and squishing against her legs with every small movement. Samus quite enjoyed the feeling as she rubbed her left breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hydraulic door opened and Samus viewed her ship in its entirety. She marvelled at its new size and decor as well as how pink it was. It could possibly be called a ship of love. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to her ship door, it lowered down for her to enter. As it was now tailor made to accommodate her new breast size the lift to the inside of her ship was much larger, the size of a space station entry door at best. Stepping onto the platform she waited as the ship lifted her into the inside of her new vessel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interior was the equivalent of a small palace. The walls, furniture and cockpit were all varying shades of pink and very fancy. Hearts lined every wall. Even the Tv and other cameras were heart shaped. The ship was so big that it even had a small indoor pool in it. Samus even went to check the kitchen, bathroom and even her bedroom. The kitchen was beautiful and spotless. The bathroom was even more so, several shampoos lined in front of a pretty bathtub and shower. Her bedroom was just as pretty with a vanity mirror that was heart shaped, a bed that was pink and also heart shaped and a closet full of dresses and pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wowowooooow I love it\" Samus said. Her new very girly self loved every change of the decor. She looked forward to enjoying it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her way to the cockpit Samus pressed the on button to the console. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello again Ms Samus. I hope you, like, enjoy your new ship\" said Eve as she appeared on the monitor above the holo screen of the cockpit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like it? I looooove it. It's so cute\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm like, so happy you like it\" Eve said, her shyness now beginning to fade as she became more friendly towards her new pilot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you like to do first?\" Eve asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well like, we should probably get going to the galactic federation HQ\" Samus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okie dokie teehee\" Eve said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Samus and Eve...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wanted them to at least be somewhat ready for the new her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commander was indeed shocked by Samus's change at first when she called him, but she was able to explain the situation as best as she could, including her newfound intelligence and AI.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is certainly quite bizarre.\" The commander said over the holocall. \"Thank you for informing me right away. I will inform the rest of the Federation of your... changes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Samus replied. \"Oh, BTW. I'm, like, probably not built for bounty hunting anymore, but with my super mind, I can probably help out in, like, labs and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look into setting you up in a laboratory as you arrive.\" The commander said, before hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, like, at least they won't be totes shocked.\" Samus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they won't.\" Eve replied. \"I just, like, hope they're nice to me.

As she expected, a few people were surprised at the change the great bounty hunter had gone through, and she did get more then a few lustful stares her direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she entered one of the hallways, she was informed by the station's AI that a laboratory had been set up for her in preperation for her arrival. Happy, Samus sauntered to the lab, her hips swinging and boobs bouncing the whole way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she found the lab. It looked like a typical lab on the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this looks, like, so drab.\" Samus said. \"I'll have to spruce it up later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Ms. Aran.\" A voice behind her said. \"I've been assigned as your lab assistant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning, Samus saw...</span></div></div>",

She was wearing a white lab coat with white pants and federation boots, her hair was long and brown and she had blue eyes. She had an excited look on her face and also blushing while looking at Samus' breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um Hi Mrs. Aran, I've been assigned as your, uh-lab assistant\" the woman said shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O.m.g. you are so cute, shy personalities always get me excited to open you up\" Samus said, putting her hands on the woman's cheeks, the woman blushing like mad. She rubbed her cheeks with her pink clad hands, surprising the woman even more when she leaned in for a kiss to her left cheek, her bosom pressing against her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, totally nice to meet you, I know you know who I am but, what's your name\" Samus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..uh I am, Denise\" she said with a huge blush on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Denise, that's such a nice name\" Samus said complimenting her new assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh um thank you\" she said holding her left cheek blushing. \"I just want you to know I am a huge fan, loved your bounty hunting work. You represent the potential of women everywhere\" Denise said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww thanks sweetie\" Samus said. \"But like, since going through a change, my bounty hunting days are like, gonzo. I much prefer trying to make the universe better through inventing and beautifying now\" Samus said, looking to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise looked at Samus with awe and glee. She was strong and beautiful, her skin flawless, hair grown and flowing down her back like a waterfall down to her knees, and breasts that dwarf pretty much ever woman's ever. She may not be a bounty hunter anymore but Denise wasn't too upset, for Samus was still a powerful female symbol despite her current look which she loved anyway. Curiosity overcame her however as she asked Samus something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um if you don't mind me asking, what was the reason for your recent change into, well, the new you\" Denise asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well like, after a certain visit somewhere I decided that the old me wasn't in tune with her inner woman enough, so i changed her into the beauty you see here\" Samus said posing with her hands on her hips and her breasts proudly standing on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise was admittedly slightly upset that Samus now looked like a typical bimbo and how men would objectify women as, but she couldn't stay mad. She loved Samus and the new her was very beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to bring beauty to the universe now\" Samus said. \"And you know what sweetie\"? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what\" Denise said nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna like, totally help me\" she said embracing Denise in a hug, her huge boobs squishing against the girl's own small chest like super soft pillows, her face feeling very hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may look like a bimbo but like, I got the brains\" she said. \"Together we will change the universe\" she continued. \"But first, we need to start with you sweetie\" Samus said looking over her new protege.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-me? Really?\" Denise asked happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh~\" Samus said. She looked her over up and down examining her federation scientist uniform and then to her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off honey, we need to give these-\" she said putting her hands on Samus's boobs \"an enhancement, to be almost as big as mine teehee\" Samus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise was flustered by her action and then said \"l-like yours\" asking about the prospect of having giant breasts like her idol's excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup yup~\" Samus replied. \"I have the invention ready for it\" she said mentioning to her holstered boob gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But perhaps we should start with a uniform upgrade\" Samus said. \"A lab assistant of mine's gotta dress to impress\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then...</span></div></div>",

Pointing it at Denise, she fired the pink beam. The effect was almost immediate, and Denise's boobs started growing. The effect was faster then when Samus used it on herself, and already Denise was three times her original size. The growth was over almost as soon as it began. Denise was now equal in size to Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! They blew up FAST!\" Samus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is... insane.\" Denise said.

She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, no i totally only used it once\" Samus said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost suddenly Samus' lips blew up to comical proportions, her lips bulging out into a huge pair of permanent duck lips half the size of her face, slightly blocking her nose even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, uh oh, looks like my new ray has an error as well ehehehe\" Samus said squishing her new comically oversized mouth. The lips felt very firm and were swollen so much she couldn't motion them so well. She tried smacking but they were too big to go in her mouth. Opening them worked but blocked her nose. She could however pucker well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise cracked a bit of laughter at her queen sized mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh i don't mind it, i'll fix it later\" Samus said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise was amazed at Samus' optimism.

Now everyone can see our big bazongas\" Samus said heaving her breasts with both hands with them jiggling afterwards. Not having gone in public yet, Denise was feeling self conscious. She looked down at her own giant breasts. She tried lifting them up but she didn't have the added strength Samus has, resolving to them flopping and jiggling back down to pinning her in place with their beach ball size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Samus, i'm not sure of everyone seeing me like this\" Denise said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus walked up to Denise, hips swaying and large boobs swinging. She bent down and cupped Denise's face in her hands, breasts squishing Denise's own due to their size. \"Denise honey, everyone will like, love you I promise\" Samus said with her giant clown sized lips smiling in Denise's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise blushed and smiled back, believing Samus's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n__________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the mess hall Samus walked in, walking in her sultry way seductively swinging her hips, butt and breasts. Every male eye among the federation was oogling the bimbo woman. She walked in stride, heels clacking against the floor. Thanks to her bimbo mindset she now loved all the attention and blew kisses with her oversized lips which made them even more endearing. Some of the men fainted from her good looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise strolled in her wheelchair, getting surprised looks from her cohorts. The men oogled her new giant breasts hanging down to her legs thanks to sitting, while other women either applauded her for her sudden change despite questioning it or looked with slight jealousy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully for Denise most of the attention went to Samus. Many soldiers and medics alike walked towards the sultry woman to be seen by the former bounty hunter, male and female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samus, Samus over here\" said a male<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you go out with me\" (M)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with your new look\"?

I love you all and like, i'll totally be happy to answer your questions soon but i gotta eat. A girl's gotta keep her beauty AND nutrition\" she said giving a wink to her crowd, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise tried keeping to herself but one of her friends came over to her. \"Denise? Is that you\" asked a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...yeah its me Penelope\" she said looking at her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to you? How'd you get that big\" Penelope asked? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Samus, well the way she is now, did an experiment that sort of went wrong\" Denise said. \"She was trying to grow my breasts to enhance my \"beauty\" but gave them too much if you know what i mean. I don't exactly have the back muscles to carry these things so i'm stuck moving in a chair until we can reverse it\",<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh well ok. I am sort of jealous of you to be honest haha\" Penelope said jokingly. She even went up to Denise and squished the front of her breast, sending a shiver down Denise's spine. They were very sensitive. \"Are they real\" Penelope asked. \"Y-yes so stop\" she said slapping her friend away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway you wouldn't want them this big at the cost of the rest of your body\" Denise said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well ok then, good luck working with Samus. I'm still so jealous of that haha\" she said <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack over at Samus she had dispersed her crowd. Walking back over to Denise several people made comments. Some were admiration over samus's change and her beauty, others berated her for changing into a stereotypical bimbo who shames women. One person even called her a slut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So like, ready ta eat\"? Samus asked Denise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah but, i think we are getting the wrong kind of attention\" Denise said looking over at the beraters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind them, they haven't experienced an awakening like me\" Samus said. She and Denise went over to a table and took our their own custom meals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 10 minutes they finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, next up we are like, totally heading to...\"</span></div></div>",

Finally they stopped just at her knees, jiggling as they settled. However she instantly felt their weight as she was forced to sit as they pinned her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh yeah, huge boobs\" she said heaving her breasts from below and lifting them up to hug them.

Its been like, a while since I used it though\" Samus said. She hasn't actually gotten to use her power suit since her transformation into her new self. She recalled seeing a containment closet for it in her ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, it's just simple recon\" the commander said. \"Now move out troops\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir\" the recon group said in unison. \"Yay my first mission as a totally hot scientist. I'll be back shortly\" Samus said. She ran out of the room in a hurry, heavy breasts jiggling and long hair flowing with her running. \"What in the cosmos happened to her\" Amanda wondered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the launching bay of the federation space station hq a small ship was ready to fly out into space. Everyone was wearing their traditional federation helmets and suits and wielding their laser guns. Samus however, stood out in bright pink in a ship of metal grey. Her new power suit was better fitted to suit her overall new appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer entire suit was now pink. Her helmet was bright pink with heart shaped audio receptors and a green heart shaped visor. Her torso was also slimmer and a dark pink on top and light pink on the bottom with 2 large dark pink capsule-like containers clearly meant to hold her breasts. They appeared to be adjustable so no matter her bust size she could fit her chest in her suit. Her lower area between her torso and legs was an oval like shape with her butt contained within. Her suit's legs had super curvy thighs and slender calves. The feet were sharp pink high heels. Additionally, since Samus's hair was so long it flowed out the back of her helmet outside of her suit from a compartment that was sealed enough so that no air leaked out. Her arm cannon was now interchangeable with a regular arm. It was also shaped like a hair dryer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the ship took off. Samus sat patiently kicking her feet and humming childishly. Everyone was staring at her either in infatuation or disbelief. Amanda herself looked upon the pink clad bounty hunter-turned scientist. Getting up she walked over to the woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what can I do for ya Amands\" Samus said giving her a nickname. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to know what happened to you. Why did you become like this? You used to be a proud warrior, a representation of the strength of women. Now you are just a sex symbol and stereotype\" Amanda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well like, that's your point of view Amands\" Samus said. \"I still totally have my strength and power suit\" she continued. \"I just awoke the real woman inside myself after a trip to where like, the ones who gave me strength were\". Amanda still stood looking her over and taking in her words. \"Hmph, I can't believe the Chozo would even indulge in whatever power they gave you\" Amanda retorted. \"Don't knock it till you try it Amanda\" Samus said. \"Yeah like that will ever happen\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough the group arrived at where the outpost was. A small uninhabited moon within a small planet's orbit. The ship flew there and landed swiftly. Exiting the ship the group put on their helmets. The gravity was low so they activated their gravity boots or in Samus' case, gravity heels. <br>\r\n  \"Stay alert. It was reported this outpost was deserted but there may be some sentries left by the pirates\" Amanda said. The other 6 recon members nodded as well as Samus who gave a thumbs up. Amanda rolled her eyes although it was unseen because of her helmet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked Samus' long blonde hair flowed into the open space because of the low gravity. Samus giggled at this revelation. The other recon members blushed at her beauty and laughter except Amanda who sighed. They entered the abandoned outpost. It was a small open area. Many computer terminals were there but some appear to have been smashed to bits, likely to make sure no intelligence would fall into the federation's hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Area secure from this end\" a recon member said. \"Good\" Amanda said. Samus, despite her new valley girl attitude, knew when to take caution, so she activated her arm cannon and stuck out the area. \"Yoohoooo pirates\" she said jokingly. Walking over to what looked like. a peculiar piece of tech she examined it. \"This'll like, totally be interesting for Amanda\" Samus said. Suddenly she heard a sound behind her. \"Aaaaah pirate! Kya!\" Samus said startled as she fired her arm cannon behind her. The blast however was set to her boobie booster ray. Looking closely the victim was...</span></div></div>",

In the few seconds it took Amanda to look down, her breasts had already swollen down to her lap, and within a few seconds after that, they swelled to Samus's size. But they still kept growing. After a few second, they finally stopped, but they now completely covered Captain Amanda's legs and reached up to her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was both worried and confused.

Amanda's breasts had exploded into jiggling soft bean bag chairs the size of her body. \"Uh commander, what...happened here\" said one male recon member, his blush hidden by his helmet. \"Don't mind it, just get me back to the ship NOW!!\" Amanda said extremely mad at the situation. \"Oh ok, well we would like to let you know that we obtained as much tech as we could find. No signs of pirates however\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, prepare to leave..\" Amanda said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving the ship near where Amanda was, they managed to all 7 of them heave Amanda into the ship's cargo bay. Samus and 3 male recon members pushed her from front while 1 male and 2 female members grabbed her from the back, lifting her into the bay. The male members felt good about getting to touch the largely enhanced bean bag sized boobs even if they were covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group had gotten their hands on several pieces of tech and some drives from the computers that worked. Even Samus brought the gizmo that she had found, thinking it would make for a good new invention remade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the ship...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her table began to float! Intrigued, she removed the sphere, and the table set back. She then took it to a data machine to run a specific test.

This sent the 2 jiggly orbs into a ripple that made them jiggle like a waterbed left and right. Amanda scowled at Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oopsy\" said Samus. \"Didn't realize just how jiggly your boobies are\" she said. \"Maaaan they are squishy like jello. Your boobie flesh came out great\" she said squishing the top of Amanda's breasts that now had their upper part exposed. She had to open her suit, revealing a huge line of cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you cut that out!\" Amanda said furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woopsie sorry, got caught up in the moment\" Samus responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hurry up and make the backbrace. If I'm going to be a laughingstock might as well get it over with and at least be able to walk\" Amanda said crossing her arms over her immense cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, okie dokie\" Samus said. She turned and made her way to the lab on the ship they were on, her own breasts jiggling up and down as her perfect dancer legs walked in a sultry manner and she swayed her hips and butt. Before entering the lab she turned to Amanda and said \"you know, you may think that every one will laugh at you but like, your real friends will love you no matter what\" she said as she entered the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda simply said \"hmph\" as she went over Samus' words that echoed in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay sweetie lets open you up\" Samus said. Using an advanced screwdriver she managed to open the orb. Inside its containment unit was a small rainbow colored round core the size of a small golf ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's my sweet little source\" Samus said. The ball however floated up on its own. \"Woah\" Samus said. She quickly grabbed a pair of prongs and managed to grab the core from flying off. \"That was a close one\" she said. She put the core inside a small glass vial. Looking it over it seemed like the orb was meant to be a control mechanism for the core, allowing the user to switch it on and off. Without the orb the core would project an anti gravity field with no way to turn it off. Samus figured if she could reverse engineer the core she could reproduce it and make multiple ones to make power sources for many backbraces for Denise and Penelope as well. The other option was to simply use the core to make a back brace that could lift Amanda's heavy breasts off the ground and only support her for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus decided to...</span></div></div>",

She had enough material for one at the moment, and once she had the martial for a control node, she could make more. Plus, she at least wanted to make sure the brace even worked first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with that, Samus got to work making the anti-gravity brace. She started with the circuitry of the brace, then made the casing around it. Once she did that, she included a compartment for the gravity core. With that done, she inserted the core into the brace, and closed the compartment. Overall, it took Samus about a half-hour to make the brace. She wanted to paint the brace pink and put hearts and flowers on it, but she guessed Amanda wouldn't like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All done!\" Samus said. \"Let's hope Captain Call likes this. And that, like, it doesn't blow up or do something else terrible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the brace, she returned to the bridge, where Amanda was speaking to the commander on a holocall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and that is where we stand now.\" Amanda said. \"In spite of my current... condition, I will continue to do what I can for the Federation. And Ms. Aran is working on something for me at the moment, and she has already apologized for her rash actions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood, Captain Call.\" The commander replied. \"We'll discuss this more once you return to the Federation flagship.\" With that, the commander ended the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Captain?\" Samus said. \"I, like, finished the brace. Didn't take long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Amanda replied. She leaned forward as far as she could. \"Please help me put the brace on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, but please know this'll be, like, a test run, so if things go bad, please don't yell at me.\" Samus said, before walking up to the captain. She helped put the brace on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once I know the brace works, I can work on braces for Denise and Penelope.\" Samus said. \"I really wanna make multiple cores, but I don't know enough about it yet. Makin' more cores without all the knowledge could be... bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understandable.\" Amanda replied. Once Samus got the brace fully on, she flicked a switch on the side of it.

The person sized pair of boobs lifted upwards into the air as the brace affected the selected area to be lighter. The breasts floated in the air slightly off the ground like 2 parade float balloons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like totes awesome, it really works\" Samus said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah now I look like a parade float\" Amanda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh these things are still heavy\" Amanda said as she tried to heave her bosom up only to let it go as it jiggled up and down furiously before they resumed their floating stance although slightly lower to the ground again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh golly. Your bodacious boobs are so big even the anti gravity can't make them all the way light\" Samus pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for pointing out the obvious\" Amanda said. \"How am I supposed to do my job like this\" she asked. Her breasts despite becoming lighter still felt heavy and she could only move at half the speed she normally could. She tried walking. Her breasts made a giant jiggle as her cleavage wobbled. Every step felt like jello moving on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we'll totally figure out how to manage\" Samus said slapping the commander's large right breast sending them into a jiggling frenzy left and right and a shiver down Amandas spine before they returned to their original position. They were still very much sensitive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look on the bright side, at least there more of ya to love\" Samus said jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Not funny\" Amanda said clearly not amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n__________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the galactic federation Hq and exiting the ship, the soldiers were quite surprised to see the gigantic mammaries of the commander. Amanda was quite self conscious at the moment putting her arm above her cleavage and turning her face away in shyness as she walked down the docking bay, titanic boobs jiggling the whole time, Samus's doing the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of laughing many of the men oogled her but composed themselves afterwards with blushes on their faces. Many of the women murmured different things to one another, some things about her being pretty to her looking like a slut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the captain arrives at the dock and says loudly \"Attention! Despite the commander's current, er, state you will show, her the same respect as always, is that clear\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir\" the group of federation troops said in unison. They weren't the most unmatched and disciplined legal force in the galaxy for nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like it's totes my bad guys, I got a bit spooked on the mission and accidentally fired my boobie ray at commander call. It like, went on the fritz and gave her the biggest boobies in the galaxy teehee\" Samus said. Amanda growled at Samus embarrassing her like this. Whatever change she went through made her a complete ditz, although not a dumb ditz considering her inventing prowess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well anyway Amanda, I'm sure you'll find a way to cope with your totes awesome new size\" Samus said as she walked off heels clacking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah sure..\" Amanda said. Somehow she had to find a way to reverse this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus figured it was time to get back to Denise for a check in with her assistant. After that the day was done and she could return to her ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door to her lab Samus entered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'm totes back in the house y'aaaall, Sammy the sexy scientist\" Samus said energetically. If one didn't know any better one would say her bimbo-ish valley girl personality was taking her over more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, hi Samus, welcome back\" Eve said shyly. \"Heya Evie\" Samus said. \"Its a nickname I came up with for ya cause you are the cutest A.I. ever\" she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh th-thanks Samus. Like, I love it\" Eve said. Her screen was bright pink but was glowing brighter for the moment to signal her blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totes glad that you do. You know I was thinking about it and I think i really like the nickname Sammy. What do you think?\" Samus asked Eve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its really cute, i like it\" Eve responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, super. I'd like you to call me Sammy from now on\" Samus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okie dokie Sammy\" Eve said. Samus already liked the name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing into the room was Denise, face to face with her boss. She rolled in with her wheelchair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, hello to my number one assistant gal\" Samus said. She came over and hugged her, her bosom squishing her slightly. Denise blushed a bit from the action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi Samus\" Denise said. \"How was the mission\"?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike, total success, although a tiny mishap with commander Amanda ehehehe\" Samus said scratching her cheek with her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I noticed\" Denise said as she got word of Amanda's condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So um curious, when can I get these giant boobs shrunk? I'd like to be able to walk again\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, funny that you mention that\" Samus said. \"I totally found a space pirate gizmo that helped Amanda be able to walk despite her new bosom size\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise widened her eyes. Perhaps Samus already found the answer. \"So you can help me walk too or shrink my chest\"?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well here's the thing little D. I can't exactly replicate the tech used to lift Amanda's boobs at the moment, and my ray is on the fritz so I have to repair it\" Samus said.<br>\r\nDenise's face lowered again as the hope in her faded away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh I see\" she said. She couldn't stand this giant pair of breasts anymore. They jiggled all the time and were too heavy to handle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But don't you fret I am gonna help you get mobile again\" Samus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut first...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That why, like, you'll slip outta there easy peasy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda looked at Samus for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... actually might work.\" Amanda said. \"And it could have some stealth uses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, just, ah... there's no reverse function.\" Samus said. \"Once you shrink, your stuck that small 'till I can work that part out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you EVER test your inventions?\" Amanda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really gotta, but this is an emergency.\" Samus said, before firing the shrink ray at Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Amanda felt her body get smaller. In fact, it was so instant that the shrinking stopped almost as soon as it started. Her boobs were no longer wedged in the door. So she walked out.

However she had an easier time moving due to her overall lighter body. The backbrace was still attached too so that helped.<br>\r\nNow the question was how small was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around she saw that surrounding her was an entire floor tile of the bathroom. It was as big as an elevator shaft floor to her. Looking back she saw that the toilet was the size of a large building compared to her. It couldn't be...she couldn't have shrunk that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to Samus she saw a gigantic pink heeled boot in front of her which led all the way up to a gigantically long toned dancer leg up to the large giantess woman it belonged too as well as the massive mammaries blocking Amanda's view of Samus' head .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up in fear and shock. Instantly she screamed but it came out as a high pitched squeak. \"What did you doooo!\" She screamed up at Samus. Instantly the large pink woman bent down, her giant breasts flopping downwards and hanging towards the floor right over Amanda, both nipples visibly poking against the suit. The large former bounty hunter's moist clown sized lips and single visible eye showing in great detail and bright golden hair draping down as she bent, a few strands touching Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. My. Golly you are sooo cute\" Samus said with a booming voice. Amanda had to cover her ears as the woman who was now a giant to her bent down and reached her hand out to grab the tiny commander. Noticing this Amanda panicked and said \"no no no don't pick me-\" and was interrupted as Samus grabbed her with her gloved hand, squishing Amanda's boobs against her as Amanda felt the softness of her own flesh squish upon her face.<br>\r\n \"Like, it totally works\" Samus said. Puckering her lips Samus prepared to kiss the tiny commander. \"Stop, don't you DARE-mmmph\" Amanda said but was cut off as Samus smooched her face. Amanda could see nothing but bright red as Samus' lips kept kissing her, feeling the skin of her lips sucking on her body with each smooch. Samus then used her fingers to squish her gigantic boobs. At this size Amanda's breasts felt like soft putty. The constant squeezing of her boobs as if they were chewing gum made Amanda fluster however. \"CAN YOU STOP THAT\" Amanda shouted. Instantly Samus removed her fingers but still smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you DO to me? I didn't want to be this small\" Amanda said still in Samus's grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm totes sorry about that, didn't check the setting\" Samus said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what am i supposed to do now! I can't live like this let alone do my job\" Amanda said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't fret its not so bad. You get to experience the life of a small bug\" Samus replied. \"Don't worry i'll fix up the shrink ray to reverse the change soon\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon? You mean NOW\" Amanda demanded yelling at the bimbo scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can try to work on it but i'm not sure if i can do it today\" Samus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean I'm stuck like this for WHO KNOWS how long!\" Amanda asked angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I'll like, keep you with me until we can fix this. We'll have a totes fun time on my ship and my lab teehee\" Samus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I stay with you\" Amanda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because its like, not too safe in this big space station for little old you to be alone\" Samus replied. Amanda simply huffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well time to make the trip back, and i have a perfect front seat for ya\" Samus said. Amanda's eyes widened as Samus moved her over her massive cleavage. Sticking the 1 foot tall commander in between her massive breasts she was wedged into the small opening, the soft flesh of the large squishy round hills pressing against her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding it was best to not let anyone see Amanda in her current state, Samus zipped up her zero suit cleavage. \"It's only for a bit\" Samus said to Amanda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the bathroom and heading back to her lab Samus made sure Amanda didn't fall from her breasts by not running. Inside her suit and cramped against the giant mammaries Amanda sulked. First she was turned into superboob woman now she was the size of a doll and being carried in someone else's boobs. How could things get any worse? She also noticed that inside her suit Samus was almost completely naked. She didn't appear to have a bra on and looking down from the small gap left in the large breasts of hers she saw Samus was only wearing a pair of panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wished she didn't have to see all this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting back to the lab Samus rushed to her lab table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Samus, so what happened\" Denise asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i fixed the Amanda stuck in the stall problem but um, i kind of had to make an new problem to do it\" she admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New..problem\"?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus unzipped her zero suit so it showed her cleavage.  She then pulled out a doll sized Amanda. She then gasped for breath \"Do you have any idea what it feels like in there\" she said complaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry hehe\" Samus said apologetically laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Commander Amanda?\" Denise said shocked at the commander being so small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaagh, don't look at me please\" she said. \"Thanks to your so called boss I'm a FREAK, a giant breasted tiny bodied freak\" Amanda said angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey don't worry about it I'll fix the shrink ray lickity split\" Samus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now however Samus decided the best course of action was to... </span></div></div>",

Right now, I just want to go home.\" On that, she walked off, hips swinging back and forth like a pendulum, making her ass bounce and shake with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got as far as the door before the computer chimed in again. \"Ms. Aran. I do so apologize for your current situation.\" The computer said. \"While many of the chips on this station were for combat or recon purposes, some were simply personal projects by the scientists either for research or recreation purposes. But, if it is any consolation, every chip here has a purpose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't make me feel much better.\" Samus said unhappily. \"Goodbye.\" She then opened the door and exited the main hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stomped down the hall, assets bouncing all the time and her hair continuing to get in her eyes, she began imagining a very possible and very upsetting scenario:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The instant she shows her new look anywhere, she gets laughed at or hit on. No one takes her seriously anymore, and her reputation as a fearless, badass bounty hunter is completely ruined. Leaving the business in shame, Samus ends up working at some strip joint in the ass end of nowhere, spending the rest of her life shaking her bloated tits and giant ass for money.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus shook the worrying daydream out of her head. She HAD to find some way to fix this. She'd track down Dr. Carlile, and make her reverse this transformation. There was no way Samus was spending the rest of her life looking like some cartoon parody of a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she managed to reach the docking bay where her ship was waiting. As she entered her ship, she began to plan out how she would locate Dr. Carlile. She soon, however, encountered a new problem: she no longer fit in her cockpit. Her ass was too round and massive to fit in the seat and her boobs blocked her view of the console. Furious, Samus exited her ship and found a new monitor in the docking bay. As she approached, it came to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello again, Ms. Aran.\" The computer said. \"How may I be of assistance again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Computer, I don't fit in my ship anymore. Do something! And before you suggest it, do NOT call anyone. I can't let ANYONE see me like this.\" She yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Ms. Aran. I will redesign your ship to fit your new look.\" The computer said. Samus's eyes widened when she realized what that meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, let me-\" Samus started to say, but it was too late. She heard the sounds of machinery changing her ship behind her. After only a minute, they were done. Dreading what she'd see, she turned and saw that her ship...</span></div></div>",

The front, which was yellow and resembled her power suit's helmet face, was now a bright magenta pink with red hearts decorating the front end of the ship. <br>\r\n  Two very large, bulbous, pink hearts stuck out from the bottom of the ship in front, making it look like the ship itself had breasts. The window in the cockpit was now a big heart shaped window with 2 smaller half heart windows attached to it for more to see on the sides while in the cockpit. The cone end of the front was now completely smoothed and rounded, no longer even a tiny bit pointy. The shape of the ship's body changed as well. The ship was no longer a small ship resembling Samus's helmet but now a very long cylinder shape extending to about twice as big as her original ship and completely bright pink. At the end of her ship a large heart shaped rudder was attached to the back and sticking out vertically between the rocket boosters on the back. More hearts decorated the sides and the words \"Girl power\" and \"Love\" were written in big red letters on both sides of her ship. The entrance was now a big heart shaped door on the side instead of the rooftop platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was mortified. She turned to the computer in anger. \"WHAT DID YOU DO!? I SAID MAKE IT SO I CAN FIT IN MY COCKPIT NOT CHANGE MY WHOLE SHIP\" Samus screamed, her breasts jiggling as she settled down from screaming. \"It looks like a cheerleader's dollhouse!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apologies Ms. Aran, but it was not possible to modify your cockpit size without remodelling your ship. It is now newly made to fit your new look\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't WANT IT TO MATCH MY NEW LOOK. I don't WANT this new look at ALL\" she said fuming, gesturing to her monster sized breasts and butt that jiggled and her pink jumpsuit that had that girly girl look along with her amazon length lemon blonde hair and puffy red lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apologies Ms.Aran but no alternative was found and as mentioned before, changes are irreversable\" the computer was annoyingly correct. \"I recommend examining your new ship. Several upgrades and features have been added. Additionally, further ship changes cannot be applied as it requires a lot of power from this station to perform task. Recharge time is 1 solar cycle\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus decided to just go along with it for now. \"..Ugggh, fine\" she said in great annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It annoyed her greatly, as well as the fact that she could not walk without shaking her breasts and butt sensually. Her body seemed to have a mind of its own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked up to the door trying to figure out how to open it. She walked up and as soon as she did the door opened, the heart shaped door splitting in half and going to both sides, steam escaping the newly made vehicle as it welcomed her inside. Apparently it was opened by motion sensors designed only to open for her, which is what she figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took one step in and was amazed. The interior looked like a fancy hotel room with a cockpit in the front. The walls were a bright pink while the floors were covered with soft carpetting, also colored pink. Between her new bimbofied zero suit, her ship and its interior she was getting sick of pink. It was everywhere however. Every shade of color in the ship was some sort of pink or red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked around she walked to the back. This ship was definitely more than twice the size of her regular ship. It had a fairly big living space inside it. She walked to the back and saw a small red chair with a red table that had a heart picture imprinted on the center and what looked like some sort of vanity's mirror. She saw that around it there were ornaments resembling hearts, flowers and bunnies. On the counter below the mirror was what looked like a cosmetics center. Eye shadow, mascara, lipstick ( in 12 different colors no less), a hairbrush, hair spray, pretty much what most women would have and then some. Samus was uninterested in things like that and so moved on. She also saw a sort of control panel. For now she didn't know what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next room was what appeared to be a small kitchen with a large fridge and some sort of unusual cooking mechanism. Across from it was a bathroom. It was especially decorated. In it were your standard toilet, sink and shower with the walls covered in pictures of flowers. In the shower though were different bath soaps, shampoos and conditioners. There was also a bright pink bathrobe on the door. <br>\r\n   She went to the very back of the ship and found a nice pink queen sized bed with one pillow and a red blanket specifically for her. In a door she found a closet full of clothes. They were all dresses and panties. She didn't find any socks however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides functioning as a living space, this ship seems less made for battling and more to keep Samus as dolled up and beautiful as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, this ship makes me want to puke with how pink it is\" Samus said. After finishing her inspection of her living space she decided to head to the one area she had interest in, the cockpit. She looked at the seat. It was large and deep, like it was meant to have something heavy in its cushion. She sat down her big butt in the seat. It was a perfect fit. The chair perfectly supported her butt's weight and comforted it like it was for her only. The cockpit was big enough to fit her and her breasts didn't obscure the screen, although they were still big enough to squish against the console. Her very long hair draped her chair and fell close to the floor \"Well that's good, at least I can fit...mostly\" she said. She swore the computer was secretly into putting her in sexual positions with her breasts squishing against the console and the less than modest clothing she had available. She hated looking like a sex object. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the controls. She found the switch to activate the internal energy of the ship. With a finger she presses a button.The lights began to whir. She sees the screen in the middle of the control board pop up with a heart \u2764 symbol. Raising an eyebrow Samus wondered what that meant. The ship began shaking. Samus was worried that something was wrong. All of a sudden she heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yyyyyyYYYYEEEAAAH, like, I am totally online\" the female voice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was shocked and said \" who said that!\" In surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship was still again and the voice spoke again. \"Like, hi there Sammy\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you the ship's A.i.?\" Samus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, rightamundo!\" The A.I. said. As she did the screen showed a picture of a thumbs up. \"My name is Eve and I am like your totes awesome highly advanced ship A.I.!!\". As she finished explaining Samus was getting annoyed with the A.i.'s valley girl accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve...</span></div></div>",

The image on the screen showing the heart and thumbs up changed into a pink girl smiley face with lipstick \ud83d\ude03.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to your totally fantastical beautilicious new ship Sammy. I was like, programmed with a valley girl accent to compliment your absolutely gorgeous bimbolicious look\" Eve said sounding chipper. Samus had great annoyance being called a bimbo and the nickname given to her by the A.I.. She made a mental note to absolutely punish that computer later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not a bimbo, this upgrade was a mistake! I chose it without knowing what it was and now I'm stuck with these\" she said using both hands to heave her giant jiggling breasts that were the size of softballs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you like, look like a goddess among women now. Nice pair of girls by the way, jigglicious and very healthy\" Eve said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care about looking better than others. I just want to find a way to reverse this and fast\" Samus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you want to like, get rid of your absolute goddess like appearance, You are potentially the most beautiful woman in the galaxy now\" Eve said trying to make Samus feel better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care about looks. I want to return to my old body fast and not this stripper/overinflated blow-up doll body\" Samus responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sammy, trust me, you'll learn to love how beautiful you are\" Eve countered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks\" Samus said. \"And my name is not Sammy its Samus\" she added with irritation at her nickname given by the bot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But like, Sammy is so much cuter and gives you that girly-girl feel\" Eve said, not once phased by Samus' anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care about girly girl feelings. My name is Samus!!\" she said with anger in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KK but, I'm still gonna call you Sammy, your just too cute for any other name\" Eve said happily. \"Ugh\" Samus said, realizing she wasn't going to win an arguement with this machine. \"By the by, pink its totes your color, brings out your feminine aura completely\" Eve added. \"I'm not interested in pink\" Samus replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Anyway what can you tell me about this ship\" Samus asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well first, this ship is like, programmed to be state of the art technology designed for the fastest travel, super totes awesome weapon systems and like, the best comforts a girl could ask for. Everything here is made to keep you beautiful like you naturally are and to make you feel at home\" Eve said, with Samus groaning in annoyance. \"I can give you the best breasts massages, back massages, even massage your butt a bit teehee\" as she said this the face on the screen winked \ud83d\ude09. A pair or robotic arms came from the sides of the cockpit, claws rotating demonstrating their flexibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, I'm programmed with the best medical care any A.I. can offer. Any poison or infection is no match for my skill. I can like, take care of you in a jiffy\" she said. Samus was content hearing that. \"I like, couldn't forgive myself if something terrible happened to that bootilicious body of yours\" and again Samus became annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus knew that eventually she would have to face people in her new look. She decided the best course of action was to head to the galactic federation and from there, find out some way to track down Professor Carlile. \"Alright...can you plot a course to the galactic federation base\" Samus asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve responded \"Like, totally. I have a GPS and map with radar and can fly manually. You like, don't even have to pilot\" Eve said. All of a sudden the ship moved on its own. The console lights flickered and the controls withdrew into the console and switched into a radar and map of space and planets. The back thrusters activated and ignited. The ship lifted off the ground and took off. Instantly it blasted off and quickly warped into hyperspace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

They were on their way to the federation space station. On the way Eve began explaining about Samus' upgrade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like bt-dubs, I got the notes of your bimbo upgrade's capabilities from the chozo station computer\" she said. Samus wasn't interested in what a form like this could do but decided to hear her out. \"Alright, tell me\" Samus said, crossing her arms beneath her huge breasts, not really comfortable with how massive they were now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well for one, you like are so totally hot that any man (and some women)-\" Eve said with a wink \ud83d\ude09 can't help but feel turned on by you\". Samus rolled her mascara clad eyes. Now shd had to deal with perverts stalking her.       <br>\r\n  \"You'll like, also be super into whoever has your heart at the time, so you can't hide your feelings~even if you want to\" she said mischievously. Again Samus hated everything this bimbo upgrade was about. \"Finally you'll have like tons of babies whenever you do tie the knot with your knight in shining armor\" she finished. Samus was infuriated. She was not a baby making machine! She was a fighter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also there's this adorable feature on your suit that let's you change it into any totally fetch outfit you want\" as a demonstration Eve manually activated Samus's suit changing feature. Instantly her outfit changed into a tight, hip hugging backless pink dress that squeezed her big round butt and breasts. Her legs and feet were bare except for a pair of very tall high heel pink pumps on her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Thanks\" Samus said not thrilled at this suit feature. The suit quickly turned back into a zero suit. \"Where is my power suit by the way\" Samus asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm like, so glad you asked Sammy\" Eve said. A compartment opened up in a wall in the living space behind the cockpit area. She walked to it, hips swaying and breasts jiggling. It looked just as it was when the space station computer changed it. Getting a closer look at it, she saw that the helmet was pink and rounder than before. The window was blue and heart shaped with hearts on the sides of the helmet and the oxygen tube running between them was light pink.<br>\r\nThe torso was pink, but also thinner and while still a bit bulky, was more rotund upwards with a thin waist below and the giant pink orb compartments meant for Samus' breasts on the upper part. The upper legs were huge and round at the thigh area, meant for her giant hips and thighs along with a big dome like butt compartment meant for Samus' giant bimbo booty. The legs were thinner and pink with red in the joints and the feet had pink platform heels. Her arm cannon was relatively unchanged, except that it looked like a pink hair dryer nozzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus sighed. She hoped to fix everything that happened to her as soon as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're like almost there Sammy\" Eve said happily. Samus walked back to the control console. The radar showed the space station just up ahead. She braced herself to the responses she'd get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she entered the galactic federation airspace territory she recieved a call on her communication grid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unidentified vessel, you are encroaching Galactic federation airspace. Identify yourself by image\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis surprised Samus. They didn't recognize her ship. Maybe..just maybe they wouldn't recognize her! This thought went through Samus's head. It was worth a shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Eve, follow my lead\" Samus said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha\" Eve said, again thumbing up on her screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned on her image screen and a GF trooper was seen. Likewise he saw Samus as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trooper...</span></div></div>",

Samus rolled her eyes, but decided it was best to play along for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, Candi.\" Samus said. She racked her brain for a reason why someone who looked like her would be at the Federation, then remembered that it was in need of a few new bridge personnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard you had some job openings on the bridge, so I was hoping to fill one of them.\" Samus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief moment of silence before the trooper spoke again. \"Acknowldged. I'll clear entry.\" He said, before closing the channel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus breathed a sigh of relief. So far so good. She then glanced down at the console screen, which had a smiley face on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Candi? Really?\" Samus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuppers! A totally hot name for a totally bangin' bod!\" Eve replied. \"And sounds like you'll need a super-cute outfit for your new job. I've, like, got just the thing!\" At that, Eve activated the clothes changing function on Samus's Zero Suit. Instantly, it transformed into what Samus could only describe as a \"bridge bunny\": a bright pink and red latex mini-dress designed to show off as much cleavage as possible, bright pink fishnet stockings, and bright pink stiletto shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O!M!G! That looks SO good on you, Sammy!\" Eve declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\" Samus deadpanned. \"Look, while I'm gone, can you do something for me? I need you to start a search for any information you can find on Dr. Carlile. Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Loud and clear!\" Eve replied. \"OH! And maybe after, I can give you a totally cute makeover! I know some eyeliner that will totally make your eyes sparkle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was beginning to wonder what deity she had wronged to have suffer such indignity.<br>\r\n------<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Samus was walking down the hall of the Federations flagship. She was definitely turning a few heads of both genders. Didn't help that no matter what she did, her boobs and butt jiggled with every step. She was following the trooper from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have been in need of bridge personnel for some time now. To be honest, we were expecting someone who looked a bit more... professional.\" The trooper said. \"No offense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken. I tend to get that a lot.\" Samus said, inwardly feeling a little insulted. \"I wanted to help the galaxy in away way I can, even if it's just on a bridge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trooper nodded. \"We'll start you as the personal secretary of one of our officers, and work your way up from there.\" He explained. The two of them then stopped in front of a door. The trooper activated an intercom on the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sergent Crane, there is a young woman by the name of Candi here.

Samus had heard the name before, but this was the first time she had ever met Crane. And Samus was not prepared for how beautiful Crane was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMellisa Crane looked to be in her late 20's. She was incredibly tall, probably around 6'3'', with raven black hair all the way down to her lower back and piercing grey-blue eyes. She was fairly curvy, with a somewhat large bust, a trim waist, and fairly wide hips, all in a uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what Samus really couldn't help but notice were Crane's legs. They must have made up most of Crane's height. Long and slender, Crane's legs were prominently on display in a mini-skirt and pantyhose, topped off with heeled boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus found herself briefly fantasizing about Crane wrapping those lovely legs around Samus's waist, only to shake those thoughts away. 'No, Samus, focus.' She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am Candi...\" Samus began racking her brain for a surname, but could only come up with one. \"...Kane.

Even her voice was beautiful, serious yet soft. \"I understand you wish to take on the position as my personal secretary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus nodded, her lucious hair shaking everywhere, yet somehow remaining perfect. \"I've wanted to join the Federation for some time, and I feel this is a good starting point for me.\" She lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMellisa looked her over for a moment, then turned to the trooper. \"You are dismissed.\" She said. \"I'd like to speak with Miss Kane privately.\" The trooper nodded, and walked off. Melissa then turned around to enter her office. \"Please, come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus followed Melissa into her office. It was then she noticed that Melissa had quite a bubble butt, and Samus couldn't help but stare. 'God, she's hot.' Samus thought to herself. 'Is this that attraction thing Eve mentioned? No, stay focused Samus. I need to play along until I can locate Dr. Carlile.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa's office was big, but sparsely decorated save for the large desk. Melissa took a seat behind the desk, and motioned for Samus to sit in the rather comfy looking chair near the desk. Samus did so, her huge butt sinking into the cushion. She then, unconciously, crossed her arms under her breasts, pushing them up and making her cleavage more obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Miss Kane, I know you said you wanted to join the Federation, but I must ask why.\" Melissa said. \"Surely there are other places in this sector you could find work in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus sighed. \"Sergent Crane, look at me.\" She said, refering to her ludicrious body. \"When people look at me, they automatically assume I'm some brainless bimbo. I want to prove that I'm more then just a set of tits. That's why I want to join the Federation, even if it's just as a secretary.\" Most of that was made up on the spot by Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Melissa replied. \"Being the secretary of a Federation officer is certainly more then just sitting around and looking pretty. You must be able to help plan out schedules, manage appointments, handle some finances that I myself won't have time to, and on occasion attend important events with me and log everything that occurs. Do you feel you are capable of doing all this, Miss Kane?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus nodded. \"Yes, Miss Crane. I will do my absolutely best to assist you.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa smiled. \"Alright, then I'm happy to bring you on as my personal secretary. We'll set up quarters for you here, and you can start tomorrow.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus suddenly jumped up, making her boobs bounce like crazy. \"Thank you!\" She yelled. She then realized what she did. \"Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine.\" Melissa said. \"I was rather excited my first day with the Federation too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa then got up and led Samus to the door. Samus was then...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was pretty easy for Melissa to return Samus to her ship. That fact that is was bright pink, covered in hearts, and literally twice the size of any other ship in the dock made it stand out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You certainly have an... interesting taste in ships, Candi.\" Melissa asked, stunned by just how girly the ship was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't exactly have a say in how the ship looks.\" Samus replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At any rate, you begin work tomorrow at 10. Be as prompt as you can.\" Melissa said. On that, she turned at walked away. Samus couldn't help but turn at stare at Melissa's butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus shook her head and made her way to her ship, boobs and butt still bouncing like jello. She really needed to ask Eve if there was any way to stop her body from doing that. Reaching the ship door, it opened and she entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the door shut, a screen on the wall lit up, showing a happy face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sammy, you're back! How'd everything go? Give me, like, ALL the deets.\" Eve said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am now the official personal secretary of Sergent Melissa Crane.\" Samus replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melissa Shield?! OMG! I saw pictures of her. She is a TOTAL babe!\" Eve happily said. \"Her legs are SUPER sexy and she's totally bootilicious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't say that again.\" Samus said, irritated by Eve's constant lingo. \"Did you find anything on Carlile?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen turned into a thumbs up. \"I sure did! She's won a whole buncha awards for her work in computers and other sciency stuff.\" Eve explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything on where she went after the Chozo station?\" Samus asked, hopeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" Eve replied. \"After the staton, she, like, completely vanishes. No one's seen her in years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus frowned. That was not exactly comforting news. \"All right, thanks anyway Eve.\" She said. She then thought of something. \"Eve, whenever I walk or do... anything, my body seems to automatically do so in an overly sexual way. Is there anyway to stop that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh uh.\" Eve replied. \"Part of your totally hot upgrade. No matter whatcha do, your body acts in a way that shows off your totally yummy curves. It's meant to, like, make sure people know your totes hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Every word in the sentence you just said makes me want to puke.\" Samus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, I know what'll make you feel better.\" Eve said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was already dreading the answer, but she had to ask anyway. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A SLUMBER PARTY!\" Eve cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in her life, Samus was wishing for a Space Pirate attack.<br>\r\n------<br>\r\nHours later, Samus was soaking in the tub of her new bathroom. The one good thing about this so far was that, for the first time in years, Samus could enjoy a proper bubble bath. Which she needed after what she had just been through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve had pretty much dragged Samus into the \"slumber party\", which Samus found to be just annoying. They had done everything from make-overs (Samus later learned that she couldn't wash of the make-up, no matter how hard she scrubbed), pillow fights (Samus didn't even bother trying to hit Eve, mainly because Samus didn't know WHAT to hit), and a movie marathon of Eve's favorite movie series (which turned out to be Friday the 13th, to Samus's surprise. That was the one thing Samus enjoyed). After a while, Samus finally convinced Eve to end the party, and Samus went to take a bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus got the feeling the Eve meant well, but just didn't seem to get that Samus was NOT happy with any of this. Samus didn't WANT a girly ship. Samus didn't WANT to wear sexy clothing. Samus didn't WANT to look like a porn star. She WANTED to go back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just deal with it for now, Samus, you'll find Carlile, and she'll turn you back to normal.\" Samus said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Samus finally finished her bath exited the bathroom, wearing the pink fluffy robe she was \"generously\" provided. Walking into the new bedroom, she made a beeline for the closet, expecting at least some normal pajamas. She instead got a walk in closet full of sexy lingerie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...when this is all over, I'm setting that damn Chozo computer on fire.\" Samus muttered, before sighing and entering the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, she stepped out wearing the first non-pink thing she found: a light blue, see-through nightgown with a bra and thong. Strolling over to the massive bed, she scowled when she saw it was covered in pink stuffed animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh joy. More pink. Just what I needed.' Samus sourly thought. As she got into the bed, she spotted a stuffed Metroid and picked it up. It was completely pink, with bright red hearts in place of its nucleus and tiny hearts instead of its outer claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'...ok, this thing is actually kind of cute.' Samus thought. Yawning, she set the stuffed Metroid down, laid down on the bed, and dozed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dreams that night were not fun, consisting of her going through her adventures with her bimbo body, everyone making fun of her. There was one dream where she was fighting Space Pirates with Jason Vorhees. That one she had no problem with.<br>\r\n------<br>\r\nThe next morning, Samus feeling refreshed, and dreading what the day would bring. As she fully awakened, she noticed something. To her shock...</span></div></div>",

She could feel them heavily and slowly undulate up and down with audible sloshing as they jiggled, as if they were filled with water. Her bra thankfully was stretchable enough to (barely) fit them. Their cleavage was even more visible in her bra though due to being even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..Why are they even BIGGER\" Samus yelled to herself as she cupped them from the sides, although now her hands were spread even more to her sides as she cupped her breasts because they were so big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon saw that her breasts were not the only thing changed. She felt something cushion like as she sat. Looking behind her she saw her butt was now 2 giant balls of fat on her backside, stretching her thong. Her growth spread to her thighs, which now looked like drumsticks and were super thick and squeezable as they and her now giant butt gave Samus an elevated feeling while sitting. She gave her butt a squeeze and it was definitely a part of her and real as she felt her blobby butt cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEEEEEEVVE\" Samus shouted in absolute anger and frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA screen opened up from the wall with a pink smiley face. \"Like, what is it Sammy\"? She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you explain THIS\" she said gesturing to her even bigger assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O.M.G. you look totally hotter than before\" Eve said, showing the exact opposite reaction Samus had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to me you bucket of bolts. I have work today to maintain my cover as 'Canxi', so explain what happened or I'll smash you\" Samus warned Eve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like totally\" Eve said, not phased by Samus's anger at all. \"Looks to me like your bimbo upgrade is working in overdrive and upgraded you even more by genetically enhancing your totes hot boobs and booty\" Eve explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I REVERSE IT\" Samus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'm not sure if you can\" Eve said. \"The upgrade works by modifying you down to your DNA. It like, rewrites your genetic code to be as hot as possible...and you are lookin' totally hot\" Eve said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate you\" Samus said, Eve not even registering the insult. \"Is it going to get worse\" Samus asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm like, not sure\" Eve said. \"But you still look smokin' though\" she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up\" Samus said. She decided to get up. As her feet touched the floor she felt her thighs brush up against one another. They were now so thick, wide and swollen that Samus couldn't keep them from touching each other. She groaned as she walked to the bathroom and felt her legs brushing up against each other, breasts heavily slosh and jiggle, and butt bounce and jiggle. Eve looked at her new form and giggled in amusement, thinking how hot Samus looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Samus looked at herself in the bathroom after washing her hands and face she saw her giant breasts with her face that still had the mascara clad eyes with luscious thick eyelashes and puffy red kissable lips along with her super long cascade of luscious bright blonde hair while still in her nightgown \"I hate this so much\" she said. All of a sudden she felt a tingle in her face and head. Her lips had swollen even more to exaggerated proportions and her hair grew ridiculously long, hitting the floor and constantly growing to where it spread to the whole floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAGH\" she screamed in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve then came in via extendable monitor screen. \"What's wrong Sammy\" Eve asked in concern. Samus turned around and showed her porn star lips and amazon hair spread all over the floor. \"DO SOMETHING\" Samus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve thought fast and from the bathroom wall summoned a claw. It changed into a razor as it shaved her hair down to its original length being only down her back. A vacuum came from a tile in the wall and sucked away all the discarded hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you like, weren't finished growing during the night teehee\" she said teasingly. \"There ya go\" Eve said as she cleaned the floor of Samus' hair. Samus was still not happy. \"What am I going to do now? I can't go out like this\" Samus said looking at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve suggested...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She returned to the walk-in closet in the bedroom. A minute later, she exited wearing her pink Zero Suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I changed. What-\" Samus started to say. She was cut off when Eve activated something in the Zero Suit. Looking down, Samus was surprised to see her boobs, butt, and thighs actually being to shrink. After a second, they had returned to the size they were the previous day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told ya it was super-good!\" Eve said. \"The Zero Suit can compress your curves down, make it easier to get around. It's only temporary, though. Gotta let the girls be big, ya know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve, this may be the first good thing that's happened to me through all this.\" Samus said, actually pleased for once. \"You think I could shrink down to the way I saw before I got the upgrade?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope!\" Eve replied. \"Can't go any smaller then you are right now. And besides, why would you want to be smaller? You are, like, totes yummy! Guys and gals'll be begging for a chance at those bodacious boobies and that bangin' badonkadonk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, the mood was ruined. \"Eve, do me a favor.\" Samus said. \"Never call me \"yummy\" again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KK.\" Eve replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus sighed and looked at the heart-shaped clock on the wall. It was 9:15. She needed to get ready for work. She activated the clothes changing feature on her Zero Suit. This time, she got what could only be described as \"sexy secretary\": a tight pink blouse with buttons undone to show off her cleavage and part of her pink bra, a tight pink mini-skirt, and a pair of stiletto heel. She also noted she wasn't wearing any kind of socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't what I wore yesterday.\" Samus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rule 1 of being the sexiest thing in the room: never wear the same thing two days in a row!\" Eve chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh.\" Samus replied, completely disinterested. \"Eve, while I'm working, do something for me. Every ship AI needs to be plugged into the bases mainframe while their operators are working. While you're plugged in, see if you can find any information on Janice Carlile. And please, for the love of whatever deity I angered to suffer this, DO NOT embarrass me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problemo, Sammy!\" Eve said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus sighed. It was time to face the music and start her new career.<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n\"You're very prompt, Miss Kane.\" Melissa said as Samus entered her office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I want to make a good first impression.\" Samus replied. \"And please, call me Candi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Candi.\" Melissa said, getting up from her seat. She then noticed something. \"Are your lips bigger? They look a bit bigger then yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus mentally screamed. She completely forgot her lips grew. \"Uh, probaby just my lipstick.\" She lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa raised an eyebrow. \"Well, it looks good on you.\" She said, before walking up to Samus. \"Alright, for your first official duty as my secretary, there is a conference I need to attend regarding an outbreak of Metorids on the planet Jaconda. I need you to accompany me to this conference.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Samus said. \"What do you need me to do at this conference.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa smiled. \"I need you to...\"</span></div></div>",

She felt as if she would be saying that a lot today and while she had this cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa motioned for \"Candi\" to follow her. Samus walked behind her, her high heels clacking on the floor as she looked down at her bare feet clad in her stilettos, wishing they wouldn't make so much noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Looking up she couldn't help but stare at Melissa's tight firm butt in her federation outfit, which was lighter than the usual uniform. She blushed a bit as they both exited the room and made their way to the conference hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus definitely got more stares at her than yesterday, probably due to her new big swollen succulent lips. Some of the men, despite being composed during duty, drooled a bit and start in awe when seeing Samus in all her bimbo beauty. Samus tried ignoring the prying eyes set on her as she held the notebook to her chest as she walked. Speaking of her chest, her breasts still jiggled and bounced up and down no matter how she walked. Her butt shook like a pendulum as her hips swayed seductively no matter how much she tried to control her body. She hated this body so much and was gonna give Professor Carlile a piece of her mind if she ever found her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally they made it to the conference room. The door opened and the seats were filled with many GF troopers and high official looking people, including the captain of the station. When seeing Melissa they had a look of expectancy but when seeing Samus most couldn't help but look at her buxom body a bit too long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa then said \" everyone, this is Ms. Candi Kane. She is my new secretary and you will treat her with respect..so no oogling\" she said sternly to the couple of men caught sneaking a peek at Samus' breasts and skirt clad butt that pressed against it tightly, showing its curves. The group of GF members greeted Samus happily. Samus waved, showing off her breasts that almost spilled from her blouse with their cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa took a seat near the middle edge of the table. Samus was to sit on the chair away from the table. She had her notebook ready for anythong important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, lets get started\" the captain said. \"The metroid population has been overflowing in Jaconda. We need to control it by..- the meeting went on as Melissa told Samus what to write down. There were notes about ways of incapacitating metroid and the like. Samus too found the information useful in case she gets back to her endeavors in defending the galaxy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't like her current position though. Being a servent girl to someone basically while also being a sex object with the body of a stripper forced to endure oogles from others at her body. She also found Melissa a tiny bit bossy when she asked her to bring her a coffee during the meeting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething strange happened though. Melissa dropped her cup and asked for Samus to pick it up. Samus bent down, showing her jiggling round posterior to Melissa. It seemed as if it was planned. Samus thought she was thinking too much of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the meeting. Everyone got up and left, some guys giving Samus some air kisses and certain looks, much to her disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa asked to see Samus' notes. She thought they were very impressive ans commended Samus for a job well done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good Ms Candi. Well done for your first day\" Melissa said. \"Thank you Ms Crane\" Samus said unconsciously bowing while holding her hands together, bending down and showing her jiggling breasts and cleavage again. Her breasts bounced as she bent back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa couldn't help feel flustered at Samus. While unprofessional in her opinion she decided to complimemt Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you don't mind me saying Ms Candi but you have one of the most beautiful and well developed figures and assets I've ever seen on a woman\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus couldn't help also feeling flustered and just a bit happy, although she didn't know why. She put a hand to her cheek and said \"Oh my um, thank you very much Ma'am. I do try to take care of myself\" Samus said, feigning actual liking of her body. One thing she wasn't feigning was her growing feelings toward Melissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Melissa allowed Samus to....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I would honestly like to know more about you? Perhaps... over coffee tomorrow after work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus blushed. \"Oh, well... alright.\" She replied, a little surprised.

What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus looked at the monitor. \"I think...\" She began. \"I think Melissa asked me on a date, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was cut off by a squeel of joy from Eve, the monitor now showing a heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O!M!G!\" Eve squeeled. \"Melissa must be, like, so totally crushing on you! I'm SO happy! We need to, like, get you a super-sexy outfit to wear, STAT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I can't use the Zero Suit function because...?\" Samus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could, but where's the fun in that?\" Eve replied. \"If you're gonna show Melissa you're totes available, you need to pick an outfit that just SCREAMS 'I am a total babe, and I want you'. That, and the Zero Suit compressing your girls and changing appearance drains a lot of energy. Speaking of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve then deactivated the compression function on the Zero Suit, returning her curves to their new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I was just getting used to being a little smaller.\" Samus muttered. \"So, if I can't just use the Zero Suit, then what-\" Her eyes suddenly widened as she realized what Eve had in mind. \"Oh, god, please no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right! We're going to the MALL!\" Eve happily cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus's brain completely shut down. That was the LAST place she wanted to go.<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\nThe Galatic Mall. Called THE premier shopping center in the galaxy. If you needed something bought, and you want quality, this was the place to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for Samus, it was Hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was standing near the directory, her Zero Suit changed into yet another embarrassing outfit: a pink tube top with \"girl power\" written on the front, a pair of tight pink jeans with \"juicy\" written on the back, and a pair of pink platform heels. Eve had also given her a pink, heartshaped handbag. Obviously, people were staring at her. Not helping was the fact that, for some bizarre reason, she had decided to bend over to look at the directory, causing her ass to stick out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is completely humiliating.' Samus thought. 'Of all the outfits, why did Eve stick me in THIS one? I'd rather face Kraid again then be here. Well, hopefully, I can just be in and out before anything-'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are totally hot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus's train of thought derailed as the voice called out. Confused, she turned to see the owner of the voice... and began wishing she hadn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her was woman who, like Samus, had a Bimbo look. She had long, platinum blonde hair in a ponytail, sparkling green eyes with bright pink eyeliner, a healthy tan, and full lips with pink lipstick. Just like Samus, she had an insane hourglass figure, with breasts equal in size to Samus's, a thin waist, wide hips, a bubble butt, and long legs, though she was shorter then Samus. She was wearing a pink sundress that didn't even TRY to hid her figure, and from the looks of it, shoes that fit in a strip club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Samus asked, bewildered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at you. You've got, like, a MEGA hourglass going on!\" The woman yelled. She then turned to her right. \"Don't you think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the womans gaze, Samus realized there was another woman there with her. And she was... something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis woman was TALL, perhaps an inch or two taller then Samus. She had straight, raven black reaching down to the back of her knees, bright red eyes with black eyeliner, skin as pale as snow, and full lips with black lipstick. Her hips and butt weren't nearly the size of her friends, and her waist was a bit wider, but her breasts were enormous, possibly twice Samus's size. She was wearing a black tee-shirt with a skull (which looked like it was on the verge of ripping), tight black jeans, and black platform heels. Samus also noticed she had skull earrings and a black spiked choker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah!\" The other woman said. \"Look at that badonkadonk. You could bounce a coffin lid off it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus just looked between the two, utterly perplexed. \"Uh, who are you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH! Totes forgot to introduce ourselves. I'm Mimi, and this is Raven. We work over at the Black Hole. It's, like, the BEST strip club in the galaxy. Been there since we finished college about 4 years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was about to say something, only to feel a smack. Turning, she saw that Raven had walked behind her and smacked her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at this baby jiggle.\" Raven said. \"Probably take, like, a full minute to stop. You'd fit right in at the Black Hole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! No, no, no.\" Samus yelled. \"I've already got a job as a secretary. Besides, there's no way in HELL I'm strip-dancing! You might like it, but there's no way your getting me on a pole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, like, think of all the crowds you'd draw in.\" Mimi said. \"What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Candi Kane.\" Samus replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, even her NAME is hot!\" Raven said. \"I would totally die happy if I saw you shaking this gorgeous ass on stage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about this.\" Mimi said. \"We'll take you on a totes fun shopping spree. Any stores you like, and we'll pay. In exchange, we want you to at least give the Black Hole a try. You might enjoy it! What'ya say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus looked between the two, and...</span></div></div>",

She didn't really want to but she figured not spending her own money on clothes she didn't want was good enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totes awesome. You are like, going to love it at the Black Hole Candi, i promise\" Mimi said happily as she ran up and hugged Samus' gigantic jiggling breasts that might as well be pillows as she buried her face in between them. Samus was a bit flustered by the action. Meanwhile from behind Raven grabbed and squeezed a handful of Samus' jiggling round rear end. \"Oh yeah you are definitely gonna fit in\" Raven said as she continued to squish Samus' giant jiggling butt. Samus inwardly sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them went together across the mall, Mimi holding affectionately to Samus' arm. Raven however, was trrailing behind the two of them, clearly wanting a view of Samus' round, jiggling badonkadonk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How did i get myself roped into this' Samus thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey entered the women's clothing section as Mimi and Raven asked Samus what she needed to get. Samus said she needed an outfit for an event, not mentioning it was for seeing Melissa. The two immediately squealed and assumed she had a boyfriend and encouraged her to get the best outfit she could find, or rather that they could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should like, definitely get something cute, sexy, flashy and super pink to show off your smokin' hot bod\" Mimi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or get sonething dark and plain to show off your inner black core, to show who you are inside\" Raven added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus couldn't believe how vastly different the two of them were in appearance and personality. To her they might as well have been light and darkness personified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them entered the women's clothing section. The walls and room were lined with dresses upon dresses, each of different types and color. Mimi and Raven searched high and low, examining the different dresses. Samus stayed by herself near the entrance. She had little interest in material things like fancy dresses. Her job was her dedication. As such she mostly wore her zero suit or a pair of jeans and a shirt. Not a womanly outfit but ambiguous enough to not just be a man's outfit. Right now though she couldn't exactly wear either....well one of them was edited at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi and Raven came back with two dresses and pairs of shoes that surprisingly looked her size: A bright pink latex mini dress and pink heels similar to her own giant stripper heels and a pitch black backless dress with dark regular heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be totes adorbs in this dress Candi\" Mimo said happily. \"She'll like this one more. It'll show off her badonkadonk real good\" Raven said. Samus only needed one but didn't know which one to pick. \"Ummm..\" Samus said confused on which one she should take. All of a sudden the two decided on something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Like, you can totes have em' both\" Mimi said. \"Yeah you could wear either one, and the other can be for some other occasion\" Raven said, sounding more suggestive with that statement.<br>\r\n  Samus didn't want two dresses. \"Um that's ok I'll just take the pink one\" she said not wanting and overload of clothes. \"Oh no like, no problemo Candi, you are just so hot and beautiful we like, would gladly give you all the clothes you need\" Mimi happily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was taken aback by that. She didn't want to be overloaded with clothes. \"Um that's ok I- but she was cut off by the two pushing the dresses and shoes into her arms. They then decided to go back into the store. Soon they came out with piles upon piles of clothes. Pink and black piles were put on Samus' arms. Shirts, pants, shoes, dozens of clothes picked out just for her. Samus was surprised these two would go out of their way for her and spend so much money on clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't need to spend so much money you know\" Samus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we like, totes want to help you out Candi\" Mimi said. \"We'd gladly spend all our cash on you, and now you like, have so much stuff to wear on that hot bod of yours\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say\" said Raven suggestively again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus rolled her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok a deal's a deal Candi. Now you like, totally have to come to the Black Hole with us\" Mimi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was not looking forward to going to a strip club, but she figured one trip wouldn't hurt. She would drop off her clothes at her ship. She wondered however, if she should take Mimi and Raven with her on her ship or take a space taxi...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Between the three of them, there would be absolutely no room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can take my ship there. Just a caution, my AI is rather... excitable.\" Samus said, mentally dreading how Eve would react to the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\" Mimi said. \"I, like, can't wait to meet her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope she's got at least some love for the creepy things.\" Raven said, not taking her eyes off of Samus's ass.<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n\"Like, you are SO HOT!\" Eve declared as she met Mimi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus led Mimi and Raven to her ship (with Mimi declaring how cute it was, annoying Samus), and let them onboard, introducing them to Eve. After spending nearly a half-hour putting away her new clothes, she then gave Eve the co-ordinates for the Black Hole strip club. And during the ride, Eve and Mimi hit it off almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, thanksies.\" Mimi replied happily. \"Your voice it totes hot too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Eve said. \"We should totally be besties!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed!\" Mimi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus and Raven watched all this play out, Samus being rather annoyed and Raven being amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those two are so alike, it's scary.\" Raven said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh.\" Samus replied. \"So, what's the Black Hole like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven smiled. \"One of the best joints in this quadrant.\" She said. \"Dancers are treated with respect and class. Caters to both genders. It also works on a strict 'look but don't touch' policy. Lap dances are fine, but straight up sleeping with patrons is strictly forbidden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that parts good at least.\" Samus said. \"How'd you and Mimi meet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd already been working at the club for about a year when Mimi joined up. We starting talking, and pretty soon, BAM! We were friends. I know we're pretty much opposites, but we don't let that get in the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus had to admit, that sounded nice. Despite their differences, the two really did care about each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what about you, Candi?\" Raven said. \"What's your backstory? More importantly, how'd you get that DELICIOUS badonkadonk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Samus said, hitting a mental brick wall. She had never even considered making a new story for Candi. \"Genetics and puberty hit me like a Dreadnaught. People thought I was just a airhead who got by on her looks, but I proved them wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven nodded. \"Nice.\" She said. She then stared longingly at Samus's behind. \"If you don't mind me saying, everything about you is so hot, but that ass... I've only ever seen ones like it in my DREAMS. I've always had a thing for girls with big, fat asses. The bigger the better. And it would SO make my day, no, my LIFE, if I could see shake and bounce that gorgeous ass on stage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus stared at Raven. She wanted to be annoyed, but something about Raven's forewardness was... attractive in a way. For some reason, Samus didn't want to disappoint her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, well, I'll do my best.\" Samus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're HERE~\" Eve called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus looked out the front window of the ship. The Black Hole was surprisingly big, and looked like a castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's not keep the boss waiting!\" Mimi said, grabbing Samus's arm and practically dragging her out of the ship.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nThe first thing Samus noticed when she entered the Black Hole was that Raven hadn't been kidding when she called it \"classy\". If it weren't for the stages with poles on them, Samus could have mistaken the place for a fancy, 5 star hotel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second thing was that the dancers were all girls of varying body shapes. Some were curvy, some were muscular, and some were quite fat. Samus even saw one or two dancers who were pregnant. And there were a number of alien species on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi led Samus to an office near the back of the club. Inside, pouring over some papers, was a tan-skinned woman with black hair and black eyes. She looked up to see Mimi and Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya, Tanya.\" Mimi said. \"I've got a potential new dancer for ya. Her name is Candi Kane. Just LOOK at her curves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my. You've got one hell of an hourglass figure.\" Tanya said. \"So, Mimi's thinks you'd fit in here, huh? Well, if we're going to judge that. I need proof. So...\"</span></div></div>",

So....get on the stage and show me how you can dance\" Tanya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus would have been surprised at how to the point this Tanya person was, but she was the head of a strip club and probably didn't care much for introductions, only for how useful her assets were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then\" Samus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya pointed her to a stage entrance, which was right outside her door. Samus proceeded to walk up onto the stage, high heels clacking on the floor and echoing throughout the main room. The girls who were there doing their makeup and what-not turned their attention to her, the looks in their eyes of either curiosity or jealousy of this \"new fish\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya walked out to the main room with Mimi and Raven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone, this is Candi Kane, and we are going to see if she has what it takes to be our new recruit\" Tanya said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly all the lights went out, and a single spotlight focused on Samus and the stage she was on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus looked towards Mimi and Raven. Mimi gave her a thumbs up reassuring her she will do great. Raven simply sat with a look of anticipation of something, licking her lips seductively. Samus found herself unnerved a bit by that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMusic then came on. Samus wasn't sure how she was going to dance on the spot. She had to think of something. She then grabbed onto the poll trying to formulate some sort of dance. All of a sudden as if by instinct, she began swinging around. She grasped the pole with her legs and squeezed it tight as she turned herself upside down on the pole, her super long blonde hair draping the floor while her giant breasts flopped down towards her head, threatening to spill out of her pink shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the strippers were amazed that she knew how to dance with such talent. It was as if she had always been a stripper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was surprised at her sudden drive and vigor dancing. It was as if her bimbo body knew how to strip pole dance instinctivwl, which didn't surprise her now that she remembered what kind of body she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her plump round butt while upside down for more appeal. This greatly stimulated Raven, as she was looking on at Samus with absolute desire.<br>\r\nSamus lowered herself to the floor and did a split as she flipped her giant hair back and held her arms out in an conclusive pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the girls cheered for her and applauded her. Samus stood back up and looked upon the many strippers giving her applause. She felt a bit proud, although not enthusiastic of getting it from a strip club. Still, she wondered how she could dance like that. She thought it must be part of the upgrade. It made sense as she thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was GREAT\" Mimi said clapping for her. \"I'm surprised you said you weren't a stripper before, you dance like a pro. The men will love you\". Samus didn't care much about appealing to some men, but she did appreciate the compliment. \"Thanks\" Samus replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven then walked up to her, but instead of saying anything she simply went up and grabbed Samus' jiggling plump rear and squeezed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This, this is a gift from above. I love you Candi\" the goth said, expressing a positive emotion to Samus. Samus sweatdropped and smiled. <br>\r\n 'When is this girl going to stop grabbing my butt' Samus thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other strippers all walked up to her and crowded around her. Several of them said things like \"you are so gorgeous\" \"how did you learn to dance like that\" \"are you single\". Samus felt overwhelmed by just how many there were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay ladies that's enough, give our new fish some space\" Tanya said. Samus felt a bit insulted by being called a \"new fish\" like she was in prison or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Candi your performance was most impressive. I don't I have ever seen an introductory dance that good before\" Tanya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for the compliment\" Samus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I gladly say welcome to the black hole\" Tanta said spreading her arms out in a welcoming fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus didn't plan on being here long and only came here at the request of Mimi and Raven, but something about dancing on that stage compelled her to actually stay longer at the strip club. Maybe there was something to strip dancing after all. Then again its not something she wanted other people knowing about, even if she is going by a different identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately she decided to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And it was a form of excerise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, when do it start?\" Samus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did so well on stage, why not come back tomorrow?\" Tanya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus frowned at that. Melissa would likely need her in for work tomorrow. She highly doubted a Federation official would change her schedule just so Samus could dance at a strip club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not totally sure about tomorrow.\" Samus replied. \"I've got another job, and I don't know if my boss would give me time to work here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Candi, after seeing that performance, of COURSE I would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreezing up, Samus turned around and saw Melissa standing behind her. She was now wearing a black mini-dress with nylons and black pumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Melissa?!\" Samus asked. \"You saw that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I did. I come here every day after work.\" Melissa said. \"Federation's important, but they're still open to time off and let officers do what they want as long as it's not illegal. Anyway, that was an incredible dance. I'd be more then happy to open up your schedule so you can keep dancing here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya beamed. \"Alright, it's settled then.\" She said. \"Come on back, and we'll set up a stage schedule for Candi here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi squeeled and hugged Samus tightly. \"Congrats, Candi!\" She yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven smiled and smacked Samus's ass again. \"Honey, this badonkadonk was MADE to be shown off, so it's a wonder to have you on the team.\" She said, watching Samus's ass jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus blushed heavily. What had she gotten herself into?<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nAn hour later, Samus was back in her ship, laying on her bed. She had just gotten out of the bath, and was in her fluffy pink robe. When she told Eve what had happened, the AI was overjoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sammy, I'm, like, SOOO happy for you!\" Eve squeeled. \"Not only are you gonna have hunks and babes totally drooling over your bodacious bod, but you'll be paid for it too! BONUS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.\" Samus said. \"Eve, when I got on the pole, my body started acting on it's own. It's almost like it KNEW what to do on stage. Is that part of the upgrade?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correctamundo!\" Eve said. \"Remember, your bod moves and acts in ways meant to put your delectable curves on display. So, of course, gettin' down and shaking your money-makers are obvs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Guess that helps with my new job.\" Samus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bee Tee Dubs, I've been doing my best to find the Doc.\" Eve said. \"Still nada on where she went. I DO, however, have where she was last seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was incredible news to Samus, who sat up almost immediately, making her boobs wobble. \"Really?\" She asked. \"Where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The spaceport in the Garren Nebula.\" Eve replied. \"She apparently rented a room in the local bar for the night, then left. That's all the deets I got on that.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, it's still a lead.\" Samus said, flopping back on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sammy, why do you wanna get rid of your smokin' sex appeal?\" Eve asked. \"You look drop dead gorgeous like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus sighed. \"Because this isn't who I am.\" She answered. \"I'm not Candi Kane, professional stripper and secretary to a Federation officer. I'm Samus Aran, intergalactic bounty hunter and survivor of the KL-2 massacre. I'm supposed to be a symbol of hope in the galaxy, the one who Space Pirates fear above all else. This-\" she gestured to her over-inflated body \"-isn't that. This look, this life, it feels... alien to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve was oddly quiet for a moment, before speaking again. \"Sammy, I'm so sorry to hear that.\" She said. \"But, like, here me out here for a sec. Bimbo body or not, deep down, your still Samm- ...your still Samus. And think of it this way. I've seen records of you, all the good you've done... and all the suffering you've endured. As Samus, you've seen death, destruction, and terror. As Candi? You've got two cool jobs, a ship meant for comfort instead of war, and an AI who truly wants to be your friend. At least give this life a chance for a little while. Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was a bit surprised. In the short time she knew here, Eve was peppy, energetic, and a valley girl. But here, she actually was serious. And not once did Samus hear her valley girl accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...alright. But I still want to find Carlile. But for now, I guess I'll accept this life.\" Samus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Eve replied, returning to her chipper personality. \"Now, there's, like, one thing I need to do. You'll probably get super annoyed, but it's, like, required to keep the upgrade in check. First, can you change back into your Zero Suit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus shrugged and walked into the bathroom. A minute later, she stepped out in her Zero Suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, what do you need?\" Samus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to install an upgrade. Not totally sure why, but my protocal's sceamin' at me to do it. So, this'll take, like, two seconds.\" Eve said, before a mechanical arm descended from the ceiling. It held an Upgrade chip. It placed the chip in the slot on Samus's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Eve, which upgrade is this?\" Samus asked, worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise you won't get mad?\" Eve asked. Upon seeing Samus nod, Eve relaxed a little. \"OK, it's the...\"</span></div></div>",

Samus asked with great confusion and also fear of what something with that name could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuperoony\" said Eve sounding as chipper as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what does that do\" Samus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you're about to see Sammy teehee\" Eve said giggling mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus didn't trust that giggle one bit. All of a sudden she felt a tingle throughout her whole body. The chip must have made its way into her bloodstream already and is beginning to alter her DNA. She then felt a strong tingle throughout her backside, mostly her super big, round, firm and jiggly butt. She placed her hands on her plump bottom. She felt as if it was..growing? She tried to convince herself she was just overthinking it, but come another touch and squeeze to her buttcheeks she definitely felt something moving and growing. Turning around she saw her butt literally rising like bread within her pink zero suit. Each second it swelled bigger and rounder, squishing together her expanding cheeks. As a side effect, the new fat was growing her thighs too. Soon they began touching each other as her butt grew with more fat and cellulite. Her butt was looking like two giant overinflated beach balls growing....and it showed no signs of stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn anger and shock Samus screamed \"WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME YOU BUCKET OF BOLTS\" to Eve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve expected the reaction and calmly and happily said \"Oh Sammy come on, you'll love it. The pear upgrade makes your butt like mondo sized. It's gonna be so big and jiggly and it'll slosh and shake with every move you make, not to mention be as squeezable as dough teehee\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery word Eve was saying was making Samus angrier and angrier. Her butt was not stopping at all. She tried pushing down the large sacks of fat behind her as they grew, but to no avail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh uh uh Sammy, you can't stop the pear upgrade with your hands silly\" she said still cheerful. \"The chip is dissolving in your DNA. It'll expand your butt cells and encode itself into your genome, so no matter how much you want to work off dat booty it ain't getting smaller\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you do this!!\" Samus screamed at the AI, feeling her butt begin to weigh her down and her front thighs begin to touch and squish as they were growing too. Looking back she saw her round pink covered booty grow and grow larger and rounder. The growing fat was spreading to her legs and hips, giving her a but of pudge and a muffin top along with thunder thighs. The growth however finally stopped and halted with a deep \"Booooing\" as the fat sloshed in her butt up and down. Samus found it a bit difficult to stand, she had no choice but to sit down, her giant rear end plopping down and causing a small tremor as she sat and it jiggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, my protocol was telling me you needed an upgrade to look even more bootylicious. You'll be the talk of the club now tee hee\" Eve explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus looked back at her butt, a giant useless sack of fat that was only meant to slosh and look good for onlookers. Looking down she saw that the aftereffects had caused her to gain thick thunder thighs that squashed each other no matter how she positioned them. They were just too full of fat. Looking down at her belly she saw she gained a slight bit of pudge as she saw a roll pressed against her zero suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear Eve i don't know how and i don't know when, but i will dismantle you\" Samus said. \"Oh Sammy, you say that now but i'm sure you will totes love it soon lol\" Eve said, not even phased by Samus' threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How am i supposed to go to work like this\" Samus asked the AI. \"Oh don't worry, i don't think they'll mind a girl with some more junk in her trunk\" Eve responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was beginning to hate the infernal machine in front of her. It just looked at her with its pink monitor and heart symbol with a smiley face on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus thought about what she would do now. Bad enough she got big breasts, butt, hair and lips and looked like a porn star, but now she has all that WITH a giant butt behind her. Perhaps the federation and the strip club wouldn't mind a girl with a big butt, but how would she explain the change?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Samus began to imagine ways to make Eve suffer, she felt a tingle in her scalp and lips. It took only half a second for her to realize what this meant. Sighing, she closed her eyes as more growth began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her already full lips begin to plump up again as she also felt her hair lengthen. It still felt weird to her, but she knew there was no way of stopping the changes once they started. Her enormous ass was proof of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, the growth was much quicker this time. After only a few seconds, the tingling stopped. Breathing a sigh of relief, Samus slowly got up to stand, causing her monumental booty to quiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she made her way over to the walk-in closet, where there was a full-length mirror. Every step made her ass wobble like jello in an earthquake, and forced her thighs to rub together, increasing her anger. The walking was also causing her ass to clap, which was just annoying to her. She also found that, when she entered the closet, her hips and buttcheeks came very close to touching the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she found the full-length mirror and checked the growth. Her hair was now reaching down to her ankles, and somehow had gotten even shinier. Part of her hair was covering her left eye in a sexy way. Her lips were about a quarter bigger then they were before, and had somehow become a deep, lustful red, even though Samus had no lipstick on at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch out universe, the goddess of hot is here to stay!\" Eve declared, appearing on a monitor in the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not call me that!\" Samus said. \"Just please cut this hair into something more manageable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okie Dokie!\" Eve replied. An electric razor appeared out of the wall and went for Samus's hair... only to immediatly break once it came into contact with Samus's locks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Eve asked, confused. She tried a pair of scissors, hedge clippers, even a sickle, but all of them broke, and Samus's hair was uncut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve, why is my hair still insane?\" Samus asked, irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, gimme a sec.\" Eve replied, before disappearing from the monitor. A few seconds later, she returned. \"This... this is mondo weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is?\" Samus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Bimbo upgrade is... adapting.\" Eve said, bewildered. \"Guessin' since I cut your hair last time, the upgrade didn't like that, so it reconfigured itself to make your hair indesctructable. But... it's not supposed to do that. It's only supposed to turn you into the sexiest of babes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adapting?\" Samus asked, shocked. \"Some upgrades can do that, but this one wasn't supposed to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. It was never programmed with that in mind. Either Janice hid it super deep in the code... or the upgrade ITSELF is alive and adapting. This'll be, like, so strange with you not aging.\" Eve said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Samus replied. Then she realized what Eve said. \"Wait, WHAT?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, slipped my mind.\" Eve said. \"Since the Bimbo upgrade is meant to make sure your the most sexilicious babe of all time, it's halted your aging. It also lets you heal faster and you can't get sick or poisoned. So, you're functionally immortal. Just, ah, don't get your head cut off or your heart smushed. Fatal injuries still kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus groaned. \"That'd make me feel better if MY ASS WASN'T THE SIZE OF A MOON!\" She yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve made an odd motion with the monitor that Samus assumed was shrugging. Then Eve noticed something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG! You've got, like, the CUTEST little muffin top!\" Eve said. \"It's so adorbs! Guess not all that growth went to your mondo booty. And it lets me do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Samus's Zero Suit sprang to life, and started compressing the muffin top. A second later, Samus had a flat tummy again. But her boobs grew a few inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat redisitribution. I can move any of your fat to another body part. So you could get an ass that would put asteroids to shame, tits you'd need a trolly to move, or make you a bangin' BBW.\" Eve chirped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...joy.\" Samus replied flatly. She then left the walk-in closet, her ass wobbling and clapping the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just look at that badonkadonk go!\" Eve said, as Samus walked to her bed. \"Shake what your upgrade mama gave ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve, shut up.\" Samus said. \"Make yourself useful and put on some music.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask, and ye shall recieve!\" Eve said, before selecting a song from the list. To Samus's irritation, the song was rap and about huge asses. She was about to scream when suddenly...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the music about big butts kept playing, Samus felt her body move on its own. Suddenly she bent down and put her hands on her knees and stuck her moon sized butt in the air. It then began shaking and jiggling left and right to the best of the music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve, w-what is happening? I can't control my body and i keep shaking my butt\" Samus said startled. She continued shaking her large badonkadonk left and right as her cheeks clapped together and jiggled heavily like jello, even making sloshing noises as it bounced left and right and up and down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like that's totally part of the pear upgrade. Everytime there is music about big butts playing, you'll shake that giant moneymaker till it stops\" Eve said chipperly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was absolutely livid by this. As if being bimboized and getting a asteroid sized butt behind her wasn't bad enough, she no longer even had control of her own body. It would dance and mingle as the upgrade wanted it to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe attempted to move her hands but her body would not budge. She simply kept on dancing and shaking her butt, feeling the jostling and jiggling of the fat in it as it bounced up and down. She hated this. She was prisoner to her own body. Her hair couldn't be cut, her breasts were huge to where it obscured her view of her feet, and she had a giant fat butt that could dance on its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve, turn the music OFF\" Samus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm no can do Sammy, I wanna see that bandokadonk jiggle and dance\" Eve replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was getting madder and madder. She was trapped helplessly dancing and didn't know what to do. Suddenly she felt more tingling in her butt. Hard as it was to believe it began growing again. She could feel it stretching and rounding out as it swelled bigger, her buttcheeks becoming more globular. The weight was becoming too much to handle. Looking down she saw her belly fattening up with more muffin top as her hips and thighs grew more with her growing rear end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...not more growth\" Samus said becoming desperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm that booty is totes yummy and squishy\" Eve said as she turned off the music. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus dropped to the floor exhausted, her butt even bigger than before as it now drooped to the ground while her hips now became huge, almost enough to not fit through the doorway. Her thighs were like chicken drumsticks, round and thick and full of meat. They were always rubbing against each other now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-why did I grow more\" Samus asked Eve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well like, everytime you twerk your bootilicious behind, it seems to grow bigger the more the music plays\" Eve said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God I hate you\" Samus said with anger and exhaustion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Sammy don't worry, you'll get used to your bod soon enough\" Eve said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus just looked down in defeat. She poked her tummy that was now flabby with her finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh\" she said hating her new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww don't feel bad Sammy, you've got a sexy pile of pudge there to go with all your new meatilicious booty and thighs\" Eve said in her way of 'cheering Samus up'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take....this....out of me NOW\" Samus demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No can do Sammy, it's fused with your genetic code now\" Eve responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was very much going to break Eve in two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve then said \"If you want I can redistribute your booty fat to the rest of your body. You'll have to deal with being a chunky girl though\" Eve said. \"OR I could transfer half the fat to your boobies teehee\" she added giddily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus didn't really seem to have much choice between staying like this or choosing those 2 options. She then chose...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Samus decided that for now, she would have the fat from her butt evenly distributed throughout her body. It would make her look fat but she hoped it wasn't that much. As much as she liked being fit and skinny (despite being a big breasted and huge butted bimbo at the moment) she needed to remove this huge butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve....transfer the fat from my butt to the rest of my body evenly\" Samus said. She had to force herself to say it in all honesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okie dokey, one fattening bbw look coming up\" Eve said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a shaking in her giant boulder sized butt. She could feel it shrinking in mass as she put her hands on it. For once something was going a bit right. The bad news that started to come however, was the feeling of warmth throughout her body. Immediately she felt like she was bread in an oven rising as she felt softness and warmth all around her. Looking to her right arm she saw it look like it was puffing up... Or rather swelling. The arm became thick and her upper arm became thick and meaty. Samus expected the fattening to inflate her arms but she didn't expect it to keep going. How fat was she going to get? <br>\r\nHer arms kept going until they became super wide, thick, and squishy with her fingers and palms swelling up to be like pillow palms and sausage fingers.<br>\r\n  Below her her once toned stomach, which already had flab on it thanks to her earlier butt growth, began bellowing out and growing bigger as it stretched her suit and pushed forward further away from her. It grew to a small round potbelly, then an overhang as her hips spilled out from her sides as her girth widened. <br>\r\n  She looked behind her and saw her butt was still round and sizable and still shrinking. She was sweating thinking about how fat she will get. She looked down at her breasts. They pushed forward as they swelled, but not in the way they did before. Her breasts grew bigger and settled on her fat stomach as they swelled with fat. They had actually become huge considering she was still a bimbo combined with her new fat.<br>\r\n  Her legs, already super thick and meaty like drumsticks, became even BIGGER, wider and rounder, making her lower body quite wide. She had some fat distributed to her lower legs until they became slightly flabby and chubby cankles.<br>\r\n  Samus felt a tingle in her face and chin. Her face was getting rounder as fat settled in it, a small double chin appearing on her, cheeks puffing up to be big and round.<br>\r\n  Finally her butt, despite shrinking down to moderately normal, was still about twice as big and round as before the pear upgrade was put in her. It shook and jiggled like a big mama's behind as it stuck out like a shapely but gelatinous blob behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O.M.G. Sammy...You are even HOTTER as a bbw big mama\" Eve said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus tried to ignore her and said \"let me see a mirror\". A mirror came down from the ceiling by a robotic arm. Samus could see her now round chubby face with her even puffier lips due to her fat. A giant bust with a fat round belly and giant round thunder thighs with a blobby behind that stuck out like a shelf and jiggled with thr suggest movement greatly. She was definitely close to the obese range, but still sort of skinny. All in all her figure was fat and wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot dignity girl, you got them belly and thighs goin' on. And dat butt is still to die for\" Eve says happily admiring Samus's new girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up...and this is only temporary until we get both of these stupid upgrades out of me\" Samus said poking her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well enjoy it while you have it Sammy, you gonna be a big mama\" Eve said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was getting irritated by Eve's cheeriness regarding this form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh btdubs, i know the perfect outfit for you\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus's zero suit suddenly changed into something very different. A giant bright pink plus size shirt that said \"mama\" on it with a pair of magenta sweatpants with no shoes, leaving her barefoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh\" Samus said not liking the new 'look' making her look like a middle age woman who eats ice cream from the container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...urgh\" Samus said as she clutched her fat belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sammy what is it? What's wrong\" Eve aaked worried about her partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..i don't know\" Samus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Weighing her options, Samus decided that explaining her boobs growing would be much easier to explain then how she became a BBW overnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve, take half of the fat from my ass and some from my stomach, and put it in my breasts.\" Samus said, feeling like she had to force out each word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it! One totally bangin' rack coming right up!\" Eve chirped happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus felt a tingle in her body, and took a look behind her. To her relief, her monstrous ass was beginning to shrink down. She guessed it would still be massive, but hopefully a little more managable. Placing her hand on her stomach, she felt the fat from her belly shrink too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, though, she felt her boobs begin to inflate. While she was very annoyed with it, she just had to bite the bullet, so to speak. It was either that, or try to create some story as to why she became a BBW.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, after a few seconds, the growth and shrinking stopped. Her ass had thankfully shrunken down quite a bit, but was still about beach ball size. And her stomach, while still haiving a little pudge, was much smaller. Conversely, her boobs had blown up to equal her ass in size, evening her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And done!\" Eve said. \"Look at those bodacious boobs. That cleavage could put most canyons to shame. And DAMN! You could bounce a DOOR off of dat ass! If I weren't stuck in this monitor, I'd be spankin' that booty 'till dawn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was annoyed, but also a bit confused. Why was everyone so obsessed with her ass? What made it so special, besides it sheer size? Samus shook her head of those thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I'm going to bed. And Eve, don't play anymore music for the rest of the night, OK?\" Samus said. \"I'd like to avoid sleep-twerking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem, Sammy!\" Eve said. \"'sides, I just had a super-duper idea! It'll take all night, so you won't hear from me! Night-night!\" On that, Eve vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was a little worried at what Eve had planned, but decided to deal with it tomorrow. Right now, she had another dilemma: how to lay in bed with her ridiculous body. Laying on her front or back was out of the question, and laying on her side meant her tits and ass would hang off the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm not getting much sleep tonight am I?\" Samus said, as she slowly climbed into bed.<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nSure enough, sleeping was a bit of an issue. No matter what Samus did, she couldn't get comfortable. Laying on her side did indeed cause her curves to go off the bed, pulling her down. Laying on her back made her boobs cover her face, and laying on her stomach meant her ass was sticking up in the air. So for the majority of the night, Samus was tossing and turning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dreams weren't much better. One dream had her curves growing non-stop until they nearly filled the galaxy. Another saw her chained to a stripper pole and unable to stop dancing. To her, they were nightmares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, morning came. As Samus dragged herself out of bed and into the shower stall, she tried to forget her dreams. As she showered, she realized that she hadn't heard a peep from Eve yet. But to her, that was bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stepped out of the shower and wrapped an extra-large towel around her, she heard footsteps enter the bathroom.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As she stepped out of the shower with a extra large towel over her giant breasts and jiggling beach ball butt, she turned around hearing footsteps. No one else but her was on this ship that could walk. She prepared herself for a fight, breasts wobbling as she prepared a battle stance. The footsteps she was hearing sounded very metallic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door and coming through was...a very pink robot with very big curves?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surpriiiiise Sammyyyyy\" said the happy robot as she raised her extendable robot arms upward with a smile on her..lips?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was confused for a moment until she realized who the robot was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Eve?!\" Samus asked the robot. \"Yuperoony Sammy, its like, me in all my sexiness\" Eve said making a pose with her pink robot form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus took a good look at Eve's robot body. From top to bottom it was completely light pink, similar to her current zero suit. Only her \"hair\" which were wires sticking out from behind her head, were yellow. It looked as though Eve was mimicking Samus's own blonde hair and pink clothes. Her face had no nose and the \"eyes\" she had was a yellow visor, only a line going across her face. She had what looked like a big pair of red lips, probably made of metal but very mallaeble as Eve was seen smooching at Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer torso was a curvy and busty robot body, a thin pink torso with super thin waist and large metal hips that flared out to the sides. The biggest feature on the torso were the giant pair of breasts she had, completely pink and exposed but with no nipples and about as big as Samus's currently. Her arms were connected to her torso through pink ball joints and extendo<br>\r\narms with dainty feminine pink robot hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs looked super thick and meaty, or thick steeled in this case as they were also attached by ball joints. Between them there was nothing but smoothness. A robot had no use for female parts there.<br>\r\nHer feet were a pair of magenta platform heels, clacking as she walked but also a part of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally her butt was massive, a large, pink, round, squishy pile of metal she could squeeze and kneed all she wanted. It was about the size of Samus' butt before she evened it out but a bit smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think Sammy, totes hot right?\" Eve asked chipperly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was a bit dumbfounded. She thought Eve was a ditz AI but she never expected her to create a body for herself.<br>\r\n\"So..you made yourself a robot body\" Samus asked knowing the answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure didsies\" she said answering in that valley girl bimbo way she usually talked in. \"I like, got so tired of just lazing around in a monitor all day so like, I decided to totally make myself a body and get mobile\" she said. <br>\r\n\"It feels like, super great. I can move and feel things like never before\" she said amazed at her movement as she experimented with herself by stretching her extendo arms as well as detaching her head from her body and flying it across the room attached to an extendable neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting herself back together she said \"and like, check out my totally awesome boobies\" she said rubbing her new breasts. They were artificial and she was still a robot but she still felt an imitation form of arousement touching them. \"And my absolutely bloated badonkadonk\" she said rubning her fake butt all over with her extendable hands. \"Ooooh yeeeeah\" she said feeling aroused squeezing and squishing her butt. She seemed to enjoy that the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving enough of watching Eve fondle her own robot body, Samus spoke up by asking \"Eve, how did you make your own body\"?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robot snapped out of her stupor and said \"it's totes easy. I just picked up robot construction by studying other databases as I browsed the web. I already had the parts teehee\". Samus was surprised by Eve's ability. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A.I.'s with awareness have the ability to evolve quickly. I gained a personality eventually and it became easier to learn\" said the robot girl. Samus was quite impressed, but still annoyed at the robot in general. This would mean she would get even closer to her and probably grope her butt and stuff like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should be totally happy Sammy. I modelled myself after you *giggle*\" the robot said. Samus didn't know whether to be honored or insulted that Eve made herself look like her by being more bimboey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we can be human and robot twinsies\" Eve said with the visor on her face going from a yellow line to a small heart in it's center. She grabbed Samus's hands with her own. Her touch was cold as she was made of metal, but still a bit warm in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then reached over with an extended arm and squeezed Samus' giant butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus slapped her hand away. \"What are you doing\" she asked furiously. Eve was a bit sad at her outburst. \"I'm sorry Sammy. I never told you this but I am head over heels with girls that have Big. Fat. Behinds. And yours Sammy is by far the biggest and hottest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus rolled her eyes, but she knew the A.I. meant well. She was also perplexed as to how an AI could develop on its own. Whoever created Eve was a genius thats for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Sammy, we got a busy day today~\" Eve said in a sing song tone. \"I'll be coming with you to your works\"! She said. Samus could not believer what she had heard. \"WHAT\" she screamed. Eve was already a pain to her but now she is going to follow her around? \"Well duh Sammy, like, I didn't make this body for nothing\" Eve pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus sighed and groaned as today was gonna seem long. She had to come up with an explanation to her bigger breasts, butt, hair and lips and also had to introduce Eve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was first headed to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bringing up her email, she noticed one from Melissa, and opened it. It read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey Candi. Federation base has to undergo routine maintenance, and the base itself is shut off until it's done, which'll take about a week. So, you've got a week off from being my secretary. Spend it how you want. Though I know you probably still have to go to work at the Black Hole, so... might see you there.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus sighed. At least she didn't have to explain her current situation to Melissa for a while, but that still left the issue with the Black Hole. She turned to Eve, who was still groping her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve, looks like we're heading to the Black Hole. Just... try not to humiliate me, alright?\" Samus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha, Sammy!\" Eve replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus dreaded how everyone there would respond.<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n\"Holy crap, Candi! You're even curvier then last time. What happened?\" Mimi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And whose your pink friend? Her ass is just as delicious as yours.\" Raven chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus and Eve had just arrived at the club, and Mimi and Raven almost immediately came up to them. Mimi was wearing a sexy nurses uniform, while Raven was wearing a skin-tight black cat-suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, it's me, Eve! From Candi's ship!\" Eve replied. \"I made myself a robot body! And I'm glad you like my donk, Raven. I made sure to be just as bootilicious as Candi.\" With that, Eve spanked her own ass, making it jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for me, well...\" Samus said. She quickly came up with an excuse. \"I have a genetic disorder. It causes my body to continue developing well after puberty. Now, if you don't mind me asking, what's with the outfits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven grinned. \"Theme Thursday. Every Thursday, all the dancers are given a theme to work with. Since you're new here, Tanya's gonna have you work with one of the other dancers to show you just what to do.\" She explained. \"Much as I'd love to help get that badonkadonk moving, I'm already doing a show as a sexy thief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm doing a doctor/nurse dance show with another girl.\" Mimi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Samus replied. \"And what's Eve going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi looked at Eve. \"Can you dance?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'course I can!\" Eve said. \"I downloaded, like, millions of dance moves. I can't wait to shake what my motherboard gave me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice! Candi, go see Tanya about parterning up. We'll show Eve around the club.\" Raven said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus nodded and walked into the club, while Mimi and Raven explained the club to Eve. As she walked through the club, Samus took not of several of the dancers. All of them were clearly happy, and like before, there were human and alien dancers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne worker who caught her attention wasn't even dancing. She was 7 foot alien covered in purple scales with solid black eyes, white hair, full black lips six arms, and large black horns. What Samus really noticed was the alien's gargantuan bust. It was so massive that even at her full height, the aliens boobs still almost touched the ground. They must have been extremely heavy, since Samus noticed some anti-gravity pads on the underside of the aliens boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alien was at the bar, serving drinks to a customer, when she happened to notice Samus. Smiling, the alien blew a kiss at her and used all six of her arms to jiggle her monstrous bust a little, making Samus blush. Quickly, Samus rushed to Tanya's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Tanya was again pouring over papers. She looked up and grinned at Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Candi! You made it for Theme Thursday! Great!\" Tanya said. \"Raven already filled you in, so let me call in another dancer, and we'll get a theme ready.\" She then pushed a button on the intercom. \"Zala, can you come to my office please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few second passed, and the door to the office opened again. Turning, Samus saw Zala. It was the alien she saw earlier. Zala looked at Samus, smiled, and walked up to Tanya. As she did, Samus saw that, aside from her boobs, Zala was quite slender, with a toned rear and long dancer legs. She also noticed Zala had a spiked tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey boss. Need me to show this gorgeous newbie the ropes?\" Zala asked, in a sultry, smokey voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. You two will be doing a double theme today. And that theme is...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You two will be doing a double theme today. And that theme is....cop and prisoner\" Tanya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was sort of nervous about what actions that theme could imply. \"Uhhh..cop and prisoner\" she asked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right Candi. During the theme Thursday show 2 girls perform on stage, in a sensual manner of course, as members of a certain pair. This pair will have one of you be the cop and the other the prisoner\" Tanya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since Zala here is an expert in the cop role, you'll have to be the prisoner Candi\" she added. This made Samus a bit more nervous for her role. She gulped a little bit and looked behind her. Zala was looking down from her overwhelming seven foot tall height at the busty pink bimbo. Her bust stood in all its giant glory as it dwarfed even Samus's enlarged bust. She took one of her six hands and groped Samus' huge jiggling round booty, giving her cheek a squeeze making the usually composed bounty hunter woman \"rep\" in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry boss, I'll make sure to work efficiently with my gorgeous partner and her beautiful assets, especially this lovely lovely butt\" Zala said squeezing Samus' pink zero suit covered big round butt repeatedly, almost like a massage. Samus couldn't help feeling warm and relaxed from her kneeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look forward to it. I hopr you do too Candi\" Tanya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus replied with a nervous \"yes ma'am\". In her mind she was thinking maybe this bimbo upgrade affected her more thsn she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on there were several ladies backstage. Many pairs in different outfits. A sexy pirate and sailor, Mimi and Raven in their nurse and thief outfits, and then there was Samus and Zala. Tanya had said that Candi's long blonde hair matched so well with her pink suit that she had a pink prisoner outfit dyed pink just for her.  It had light pink and magenta strips and was a low cut top that was squeezing her breasts, over a pair of sexy tight striped pants with a decorative pink prisoner hat and chain on her leg. Her feet were barefoot as to promote the 'hopeless prisoner' look more. Zala was wearing a blue woman officer's uniform. It absolutely could not cover her bust and looked close to breaking off. She wore high heels on her feet too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh this is ridiculous\" said Samus. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome now sugar, this is one of the most fun things to do at the black hole. Swing your partner round and round\" Zala said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Candi you'll do great\" Mimi said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember to shake that badonkadonk\" Raven added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus just sighed, looking down at her massive cleavage in her tight prisoner top. Her breasts were really feeling uncomfortable being as huge as they are now squeezed into a small top and honestly she just wanted to take off the top and let her giant girls breathe. But she was more dignified than that and held it together for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe show started and the lights dimmed everywhere except the stage in the center where a spotlight was focused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the first 2 dances concluded, with Samus taking mental notes on how it was done, it was her and Zala's turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked on stage, getting hollers from the audience below. As it was Samus' first time pair dancing Zala led and she followed. Zala grabbed Samus by her arm and swung her around, making the bimbo girl blush a bit. Zala took out her pretend baton and hit Samus in the butt with it sexually. Zala tossed her to the pole in the middle of the stage which she immediately grabbed onto and swung around as her hat fell to the ground as she danced on the pole hanging upside down, her breasts falling cleavage first and her gorgeous golden hair dropping to the floor. The crowd was cheering for her and how beautiful she was. Zala joined Samus as she too jumped on the pole but hung onto it right side up, giving the audience a view of her massive bust. They were both facing opposite directions, up and down, as they danced more on the pole, Samus' feet grabbing the pole as Zala's many arms hung onto it as well. Both jumped down onto the stage as the music finished playing. Cheers roared throughout the audience and black hole halls. Both put on a great performance, partially with the Bimbo upgrade making Samus dance super sensually like a pro. Samus was panting for breath after her dance. She turned to Zala who gave her a wink. Samus smiled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the dance...</span></div></div>",

And studies show the combination of blonde hair and pink clothes on a big busty babe like yourself, along with your Jessica Rabbit style hair covering your eye and lovely puffy red lips make for the absolute sexiest combo of traits. With that in mind, we have the absolute sexiest genie outfit for you my dear\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......Gee thanks\" Samus said with a deadpan look. She blew her hair covering her left eye up but it came back down over it. She felt worse knowing there was no way to cut it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zala will of course be playing the poor but beautiful peasant girl who finds the lamp housing the most beautiful wish granting creature to be seen\" Tanya added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus felt a presence behind her. Turning and looking she saw Zala's monstrous chest pushing against her back. Looking up she was a bit intimidated by Zala's height. Zala simply looked down at her with a sultry smile. She then put one of her hands on Samus's bigger rounder and squishes butt, earning an \"eep\" from Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry boss. I'll work hard to put on a show with this buxom beauty and her gorgeous booty\" Zala said seductively. Samus didn't want to do this at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheme Thursday's show went on as there were many pairs. A sexy pirate and sailor, Mimi and Raven's pair of nurse and thief, and Samus and Zala's pair of genie and peasant. Samus was dreading the outfit she was wearing. Zala assured her she look amazing. This didn't exactly make her feel better. The show went on as all the pairs performed and danced as well. The time came for Samus and Zala's act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curtain first closed and then opened, showing a desert background closer to an Arabian look. Zala first walked in wearing a tattered dress and headpiece. The dress barely covered her enourmous breasts which looked ready to pop out of the dress. In the middle of the stage was a golden genie lamp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh if only there were some gold for me to get around\" she said while jiggling her breasts to the audience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this\" she said curiously. \"A lamp. Perfect. This will give me some....mula. Let me just.....rub this dust off\" she said in a sultry way, knowing what the next part of the act is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she rubbed it with 3 of her hands, pink smoke emanated from the corners of the stage from smoke machines. Samus, knowing that was her cue, walked into the stage from the back and began to dance. Through the smoke the audience saw a dancing woman figure. Samus swung her giant hips to and fro as she shook her butt and breasts dancing in an Arabian fashion. Her outfit consisted of a bright pink bra-like top, encrusted with a gold top and bottom and pink jewels within their centers. Her midriff, arms and shoulders were bare, showing her soft skin with 3 golden armlets and bracelets on her arms, pink cloth attaching the armlets to the bracelets in a crescent shape. Her \"lower garment\" was a golden thong with many golden rings hanging from its sides. Her legs were bare besides a pair of anklets. Her feet were bare as well. On her head was a circled attached to her hair with a jewel in the middle of her forehead. Her long hair was unchanged, draped behind her with another bigger circlet jewel attached to it. The crowd cheered for how beautiful she looked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying her lines (and dreading saying them) she said \"I....am the genie of the lamp...what is your wish\" she said in a sultry way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only you my dear\" Zala said. She then grabbed Samus and lifted her bridal style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" She said reacting shocked to being lifted. This was clearly Zala 'improvising' her own thing into the act. She kissed Samus on her big puffy Iips, making cheers erupt from the crowd. Samus was blushing hard and was wide eyed. She didn't expect this amount of direct approching from Zala. Zala broke away and threw Samus onto the pole. Instinctively she grabbed it and swung on it, making her jewels jingle as she held herself upside down. Zala jumped as well and was right side up above Samus. Both danced on the pole as music played until they did their closing act of posing with Samus again upside down and Zala right side up on the pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheered loudly for the duo. Samus and Zala jumped down to the floor. Samus blushed as she looked at Zala. Zala returned her look with a wink, to which Samus quickly turned away from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was great Candi\" Mimi said as she walked up to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That butt of yours is phenomenal in that outfit\" Raven said lustfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was like, totally hot and awesome Candi. My head can't stop spinning from how hot you look in that genie outfit\" Eve said, literally spinning her head comically on her robot torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe thanks, but Zala was really the good one here\" she said modestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah don't sell yourself short newbie, you were pretty hot out there...and I mean hot\" she said also lustfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus again turned red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like Zala's taken a liking to you\" Mimi said happily. \"She usually isn't that direct with newbies, congrats\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She better stay away from that butt. It's mine\" Raven said defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, I'll see you later newbie\" she said blowing a kiss to genie Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok...see ya\" she said waving while internally wondering how insane that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly an outstretched robot head comes in front of Samus. \"You like, totes got a cute crush there Candi. Looks like all the ladies want a piece of you too *giggle*\" Eve said mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus just ignored the robot, used to her antics already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wanting another opinion on just how she did, Samus decided to swing by Tanya's office. Perhaps she had something else for Samus to do. Something that hopefully didn't involve more dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her way to the office proved problematic, as every dancer and patron in the club wanted to talk to her. Samus was used to fan clubs (her time as a bounty hunter had caused quite a few to spring up) but this amount of attention was still weird, especially for the reason why. She couldn't really make out everything said, but one thing she did notice was that every seemed to be REALLY focused on her butt. She'd have to question Eve about that later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she managed to make it into Tanya's office. Tanya herself must have been waiting for her, as she instantly started clapping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your first night on the job, and you NAILED it.\" Tanya said. \"Everyone is talking about you and Zala. I made the right choice hiring you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thanks.\" Samus said, blushing a bit. She wasn't really used to being praised. Mostly, she had just gotten a 'well done' and that was that. This... this was something new to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Candi, you've clearly got a future in this business.\" Tanya said. \"Keep this up, and you're name'll be know throughout the universe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus wasn't sure how to feel about that. She really did want to go back to normal. But at the same time, it seemed that Candi Kane was making people happy. So, she could probably go along with it for a little while longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the praise, boss.\" Samus said. \"I'm glad people liked my dance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, liked is too small a word. They ADORED it!\" Tanya replied. \"And it seems Zala's taking a liking to you. That's quite rare. Maybe I'll pair you two up more often. Anyway, you can head to the dressing room for a break. I'll set up another routine in a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus nodded and left the office. Thankfully, the crowd had disperesed, so Samus had a much easier time navigating. After a little bit, she managed to locate the dressing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dressing room was quite spacious, with several rows of mirrors, a snack bar, an impressive break area, and stairs leading up. Eve was chatting with a few dancers when she spotted Samus. Happily, she walked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, there's the star of the hour!\" Eve said. \"You looked totes yummy in that genie outfit. And watching that badonkadonk bounce was hypnotic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah it was!\" Raven replied, suddenly walking up to the two. \"Candi, that ass is a gift from above. You've probably figured it out by now, but I go wild for giant, fat, bouncy asses. And seeing that donk bounce on stage? It was heavenly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... thanks.\" Samus said. It was so weird, why was everyone obsessing over her ass?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Raven and Eve continued to praise Samus and her booty, something was happening regarding her butt. A little bonus of the Bimbo/Pear combo she was unaware of. Everytime somone praised her butt...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Samus looked behind her. The waterfall of blonde hair that draped her back and covered her left eye in a Jessica Rabbit fashion covered her whole behind. She however felt a strange urge to see the huge jiggling rump behind her. Seeing the protrusion of her round badonkadonk underneath her blond hair she pushed her locks away to see her fat round meaty rump in her now back on bubblegum pink zero suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe observed it and it was as it had been since last night, it was huge and round. Big round cheeks stuck out behind her largely contrasting thin frame. Her cheeks were so big fat and jiggly they even jiggled seperately with every twist of her hips. Curiously she shook her butt left and right. Her big round butt cheeks slapped each other as they wobbled left and right before settling back in their place nestled together. In her mind she thought of it as degrading and nothing more than to make her look like a sex object, although that was obviously the intention of the bimbo upgrade. When she had normal proportions and was a normal looking woman she was still annoyed about how a lot of men (and some women) gave her looks admiring her natural beauty. Now she had it 10x worse looking like (in her opinion) a pornstar with too much plastic surgery...although it was all real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus didn't know why but she had a strong urge to touch her butt. She pinched her left butt cheek. It was soft and malleable. Taut enough to keep a solid round shape but soft enough to be squishable and squeezable like a stress ball with the ability to automatically retain its default shape afterwards. Samus found herself fascinated with it. She then squeezed her butt cheek. She loved the softness of it. It satiated her with sexual satisfaction. She then squished her other cheek with her other hand.  She loved the feeling of groping her own butt. She couldn't seem to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh yeah\" Samus said. \"You were right Raven, I looooove this butt\" she said squishing and squeezing it more. It was like squishing 2 yoga balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven was surprised but also felt good for her friend. \"That's it, i knew you'd find your bandonkadonk good eventually\" she said hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve was also happy. \"Yeah Sammy, squish that rumparoony\" she said encouraging her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back of her mind Samus tried to stop herself and tell herself this was wrong. 'WHY AM I DOING THIS' she asked within her mind trapped in her own body. Her eyes were glazing over with pink hypnotic swirls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin her mind, represented as a blue empty room with Samus in the center, Samus was being overwhelmed with a feeling of pleasure from her butt represented by a glowing pink essence spreading through the room turning everything from blue to pink. \"Sooo goooood feeling\" she said within her mind as the pink covered the room and climbed up her blue zero suit covered body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere in her body her DNA strands became covered with hearts with pictures of hands on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Samus, being someone with a force of will stronger than most, snapped out of the trance with her last reasonable thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Samus jerked up from her groping session. She shook her head to snap out of whatever was urging her to feel her butt sexually. She could still feel a bit of the urge as it was growing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! W-why was I doing that\" Samus asked. Her eyes were still glazed over with pink swirls. The urge to squish her butt was growing faster and Samus fought with all her will to stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cause you're embracing your inner hotness\" Raven said, unaware of the strange phenomenon Samus was going through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling to keep her free will she didn't waste any time and grabbed Eve's robot arm aside. Raven stood confused and wondered where they were going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woops, gotta go Raven\" Eve said waving her metal hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya later\" Raven said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus ran with Eve behind a hallway where no one else was within the dressing room, her boobs jiggling up and down heavily as they ran because of their now more massive size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve\" Samus said whispering. \"What is HAPPENING to me\" Samus asked, emphasizing on happening while whispering. Eve could see the hypnotic swirls in Samus' eyes. \"I keep having the extremely strong urge to grope my own butt and i can't stop!!\" Samus said. Her free will was already starting to crack as her hand was starting to motion to her butt. Samus struggled to prevent it from moving as it shook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve looked on in slight confusion but then she realized the issue. \"OH\" she said with pictures of light bulbs flashing in her eyes. \"It's a part of the pear upgrade. You'll occasionally have the desire to feel your own butt. The desire will grow the more people praise it, which in turn may make your butt grow even more by the enhancement genes put into your DNA responding to the feeling you get from the praise\" Eve answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus grew just as angry as she recently did back in the ship when the pear upgrade was first installed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You KNEW ABOUT THIS AND YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING\" Samus shouted, grabbing the attention of a few fellow ladies in the dressing room. Samus' eyes were still glazed with hypnotic swirls as she was going crazy trying to not touch her butt, eyes twitching in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve tugged on her nonexistent collar. \"Ehehehe woopsies\" she said. \"But don't worry its only in short bursts. All you need to do is let yourself go and caress that bootilicious behind and squish it and bask in all the sexy feels you'll get and as soon as its done you'll be back to norms\" she said happily. Samus was anything but happy at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh i'd rather die than do that\" she said still struggling to control the everloving desire to squish her butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just try it Sammy. Come on give into the desire to squish that banonkadonk. You know you want to\" Eve said slyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus couldn't help it. She needed to caress her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As much as the urge to squish her butt was driving her crazy, Samus had no intention of doing so in front of dozens of people. She HAD to get back to her ship, pronto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, can someone let Tanya know I'm heading out for the day?\" Samus asked, not really caring about who answered. After someone in the dressing room agreed to, Samus left quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she made her way through the main floor, the desire was getting worse and worse. Her brain was screaming at her to grab her ass, to squeeze as much of it as she could, to grope it like there was no tomorrow. Not helping was the fact that with each step, her ass bounced around like an overinflated pool toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly halfway to the door, Samus unconciously reached her right hand behind her. While she really didn't want to make a fool of herself, she had to at least feel her butt. Once her hand touched her ass cheek, a little bit of the mental fog cleared. This only inspired her to move faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, she made her way out of the Black Hole and back to her ship. Once she was up to the door, it opened and she barged inside. The second the door shut, Samus grabbed her ass and started squeezing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next few second, Samus squeezed, prodded, rubbed, and even slapped her ass. As she did, the mental fog in her head cleared up. Finally, the mental fog completely vanished, and her eyes returned to their normal color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Samus looked behind her. Her butt had grown once again, but thankfully not by a whole lot, just an inch or two. Though it did feel a bit heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was awful. And it felt good. That makes it so much worse.\" Samus said to herself. Just then, the door opened, and Eve walked in. Samus turned to look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, guessin' from your eyes, you just gave your booty the squeezin' it needed.\" Eve replied. \"Now you're mind'll be clear as day... 'least until the next time you want to give your bodacious badonk some lovin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve, is there ANYTHING else I should know about this little... quirk?\" Samus asked, a little hopeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve stood still for a few seconds, the sounds of scanning coming from her head. Eventually, she had an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the urges come in bursts, so you won't have to stop working, like, every 5 minutes to have some ass squish time. Also, while people are praising or lovin' that donk, you'll want them to worship it. You're the goddess of badonkadonks, and everyone's your subject.\" Eve said. \"And that spankalicious tushie will grow more after each urge, but there is a limit. Eventually it will stop growin', but you're brain'll still be saying 'Yo, Sammy. Let's give that sexy ass a squishin'. Finally, once an urge kicks in, you've got about an hour to actually fufill the urge. If your ass gets no love in an hour, then you'll become totally obsessed with that yummy donk for the next 3 days. You'll still have your own mind, and you won't get stupid, but you'll just be totally in love with that big, fat ass. So, probably best not to put it off for too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... frightening.\" Samus said. \"Well, hopefully, once we find Carlile, she'll undo everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you don't wanna keep a FEW of your sexy traits?\" Eve asked. \"I mean, you're boobies are every girls dream, and your donk-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve, I'd rather not think about my ass anymore for the night.\" Samus said. \"Now, can you run some more searches while I go bath?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problemo, Sammy.\" Eve said, before heading off to the front of the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, now I have to worry about urges that have a time limit.\" Samus muttered. \"My life has become Hell.\"<br>\r\n------<br>\r\nThe next day, Samus recieved a call from Melissa. Despite having given time off, Melissa needed Samus's help right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turns out, there was a conference Melissa had completely forgotten about at one of the largest space hotels in the galaxy, and Melissa needed someone to keep track of everything that was going on. Hence why Samus was currently in a hotel lobby, her Zero Suit turned into a lovely black dress that compressed her curves down to a reasonable size, some fishnet stockings, and black stiletto heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa walked up to hear, wearing a green dress and heels. She looked a bit frazzled, but otherwise in good spirits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for doing this, Candi. Now, this place isn't completely formal, but still... try to be on your best behavior. Right now, you're Candi the assistant, not Candi the stripper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood.\" Samus said, a little worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Knowing my luck, I'll be hit with one of those stupid urges. 'least this dress keeps my curves down.' Samus though to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's the convention on?\" Samus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's sort of a historical celebration on the achievements of the Federation. From it's finest soldiers to it's most brilliant scientists. Strange thing is, Samus Aran's not attending this year. Probably on a mission.\" Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... probably.\" Samus glumly thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then walked to the conference hall, which was filled with Federation officials. Many took notice of Samus, or rather, Candi, but no one seemed to be put off by her. That at least made Samus a bit happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa started chatting with a nearby General, while Samus started taking notes. As she did, though...</span></div></div>",

It was female. Samus turned around and saw she was wearing a formal red dress. She had long brown hair and red heels. On her dress was the galactic federation emblem, so Samus assumed she was an officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hello\" Samus asked the officer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now, don't be shy. We're both federation employees\" she said to Samus, obviously not recognizing her through the long hair and ballooned lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Giorna, one of the few girl federation generals. Been here for years\" she introduced herself. \"You are Candi right? You are quite the talk among the staff and soldiers ya know. With that body that can rival a goddess and those humungous boulders on your chest\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus replied with \"well thank you...but now isn't really the time to talk about this\" she said as she moved her notebook above her large breasts and to her face as she sat the book on her boobs, not seeing another option since they were too big for her to look down on her lap at the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw come now. You know how sexy you are Candi? You are the talk of the town here. Your lips are freaking swollen and super kissable. Your boobs are huge and your butt- she says as she grabs a chunk of Samus' round plump bottom. \"Mmm so squeezable\" she says as she squeezes Samus' chunky bottom right cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus's first instinct would be to pound anyone who gropes her into the ground. However she didn't want to attract attention. As much as she hated it she had to take the groping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How lucky are you to get a body like this\" Giorna said. \"And these breasts\" she said squishing one of Samus' large boobs. She made sure not to let anyone notice she was doing it of course. \"Oh man you are so lucky. So many women would kill for boobs like this\" she said squishing more. She let go as Samus' boob jiggled up and down before settling back in place. \"Man look at that baby jiggle, it's huge. And your dress is super sexy as well. Digging the fishnet stockings\" she said as she felt up Samus' bare leg and moved her fingers down to touch the top of her bare foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was reluctantly getting aroused from Giorna still squeezing her butt and breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like that? We can do plenty more if you want to come to my room\" Giorna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus kept her cool and calmly said \"thanks, but I'm not really seeking relationships at the moment\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiorna was a bit upset. \"Aww, well if you change your mind, here's my number\" she said taking a blank paper from the notebook and writing her number down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned and walked, swaying her hips seductively and shaking her butt. She turned her head and winked at Samus before turning around again to go sit at the conference table. Samus blushed a bit at that.<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the conference (which was quite informative to Samus as she learned of other great federation heroes) Melissa walked up to Samus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work on the note taking Candi. These surprise conferences are so tedious and boring at times though\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well I did find it quite informative\" Samus said a bit cheerfully, trying to hide her frustration from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa then...</span></div></div>",

Once we get back to the Federation, I'll be issuing a formal complain with the higher ups about this.

At this moment, she was glad that she had someone like Melissa watching out for her.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nA little while later, Samus was back in her hotel room. It was quite roomy, and had a wonderful view. She had turned her Zero Suit into a pink nighty, and her curves had grown back to their current immense size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly how I was hoping today would go, but at least it's over.\" Samus said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got herself ready for bed, she heard a knock at the door. Hoping it wasn't Giorna, Samus got up and looked through the peephole. To her surprise, it was Eve. And she looked furious. Samus unlocked the door and opened it. She barely got it half-way open before Eve stormed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve? Why are you here? I thought I left my ship at Federation HQ. Melissa let me ride with her.\" Samus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to come to, so I brought it.\" Eve asked.

If I had actual blood, it would be boiling right now! If I ever see her, I'll-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EVE!\" Samus yelled, stopping the fuming robot. \"Melissa's going to take care of it. I'm angry too, but being violent won't make things better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve stared for a moment, then sighed. \"You're right Sammy.\" She said. \"It's just... stuff like that really pisses me off.

They are very soft and pliable and able to fit through certain areas although size may be an issue\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Form also comes with high pheromone levels. You may become more attracted to men in your sights who you harbor feelings for. This also works in reverse as all men will feel a great desire for you\". Samus hated that last part very much as she heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, form is capaple of unlimited stamina during sexual activity. Your chance of impregnation is very high during sexual activity, with chance of multiple offspring during one pregnancy being high\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus dreaded that part. This body seems as if it was designed as nothing but a baby making machine. She concluded she needed to be careful around men now, especially since she attracted attention even before changing into this form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh....ok , what about this zero suit, what can it do\" she asked pulling at the fabric, which felt very soft and smooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit is constructed of stronger fibers than the original zero suit. Suit is now more mallable and stretchable than before. It is capable of adjusting to any size and weight and thus can grow and shrink infinitely. Suit also comes with shifting ability. Over 500 different select outfits are within its database\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs an example the computer activated the shift program in the zero suit and suddenly Samus felt her suit began to change and squirm over her body. The suit had shrunk into a tight pink one piece swimsuit. She stood barefoot in the station with the tight swimwear over her body squeezing her jiggling round butt in such a way the cheeks were squished and were jutting out more and her breasts showed a large amount of cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh..\" Samus went as she hated how vulgar this suit was. The suit changed again into a maid outfit, a ballroom dress, a magician's assistant outfit (like Zatanna's from DC comics) and a chef's outfit before turning back to a zero suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright that's enough, thank you\" Samus said. Before she took her leave the computer said \"risk factors of this upgrade involve chance of having food cravings with increased chance of weight gain. You may experience a sudden desire to eat. During this time you will gain weight easier\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great...thanks\" Samus said. As she didn't have enough problems now she had to worry about getting fat, in this body of all things as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"The... Guillotine Upgrade?\" Samus mumbled, observing the list of available upgrades. It was a rather odd name. Many of the upgrades were named after creatures or occupations that Samus assumed had inspired them, but, as far as Samus was aware, a guillotine was a device made to cut off someone's head. What on earth could an upgrade named after it possibly do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough there were plenty of other upgrades that Samus was sure were useful, she couldn't help but be curious as to what this upgrade actually was. She selected it from the list, and had the terminal eject the upgrade chip. To her surprise, the chip was for her zero suit, rather than for her power suit. She had guessed that the upgrade might be a weapon capable of beheading her enemies, just like its namesake, but that didn't appear to be the case. After all, if it was a weapon, it would likely have been for her power suit instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, she had an upgrade slot in her zero suit, so she was was still able to try out the upgrade. She inserted the upgrade, and waited for it to take effect. After a few moments, nothing at all seemed to be happening. No obvious signs of an upgrade, no changes to her suit, nothing. She did feel a little itchy around her neck, but she passed it off as nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it a dud?\" she thought aloud. The terminal wouldn't just spit out a useless upgrade, would it? Surely it did something. She decided to head towards the mirror to see whether she was able to observe any changes with a closer look. She watched her reflection turn this way and that as she tried to get a better look at herself from every angle, but there seemed to be nothing out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, I guess it did nothing after all,\" Samus mused, tilting her head to the side in thought. As she did so, however, she noticed a strange feeling coming from her neck. It was if it was sliding along a surface, but the feeling was coming from inside her neck, rather than any part that would normally be exposed. Her eyes went wide as she saw what was happening in the mirror; her head appeared to be sliding off her neck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could react, her head had slid far enough for gravity to do its job, and her head to come toppling off. \"Wah!\" she exclaimed, feeling incredibly dizzy as her head tumbled through the air, her body scrambling to try and catch it without a clear view of where it was. The world stopped spinning around her as she felt her hands grip onto her cheeks. The sight she was greeted with was bizarre to say the least. She was looking up at her own body, a perspective she wouldn't be able to gain with a mirror, but her body was lacking a head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...How... How is this possible?\" she mumbled. She realised that she probably shouldn't be alive right now. Her head was detached from her body, separating her brain from her heart and lungs, and yet somehow, she was alive, and still had control over both. Somehow, the upgrade had made it possible for this to happen. She couldn't help but wonder what else it could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the time being, though, she decided she needed to see whether she could put herself back together or not. The upgrade was interesting, but it would be inconvenient if she needed to carry her head around everywhere. She slowly lifted her head back up to her neck stump, where she saw it was covered in smooth skin, rather than simply leaving the inside of her neck exposed. Carefully, she turned her head around in her hands, before lowering it into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she now looked completely normal in the mirror. She shook her head around a couple of times just to make sure it had reattached properly, and this time it didn't come off. She breathed a sigh of relief. \"Now, can I take it off again?\" she wondered aloud, placing her hands on the sides of her head again. With a bit of a tug, her head suddenly popped off again. \"Hm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was rather pleased with this upgrade. Although the alterations the upgrade had performed on her were rather bizarre, to say the least, she could still put herself back together and appear completely normal to anyone observing her. It was rather convenient, so Samus decided to keep the upgrade for the time being. Now it was a matter of deciding what to do next.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before she went anywhere, or considered trying out more upgrades, Samus decided it would be a good idea to try and see what else she could do with this upgrade. She knew she could attach and detach her head, but could she do more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she still had her head lifted in her hands, she decided to start there. She carefully turned it around to face back towards the terminal, before lowering it down to where it had previously been. Slowly moving her hands away, she moved her head around a bit experimentally. Just as before, her head did not fall off of her neck. This time, though, as she looked down, she saw her back and her butt, rather than her chest and stomach. She had successfully reattached her head back to front. It was a bit disorienting, but she managed to move into a position where she could see herself in the mirror again, noticing that despite how bizarre it looked for her head to be backwards, there didn't appear anything wrong the skin connecting her neck to the nest of her body. It was as if she'd simply been born with her head on back to front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs intriguing as it was, having her head on backwards was still a bit disorienting, so before she tried anything, she quickly put her head back the way it was meant to be. Next, she turned her attention to the rest of her body. She knew she could detach her head, but was she limited to just her head? Turning back towards the mirror again, she grabbed her left hand in her right, and tugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as with her head, her hand suddenly popped off, leaving smooth skin covering the area they'd once been joined at. She wriggled around the fingers of her detached hand, still finding it amusing how she could control it without it being attached to her. She set it down on the ground, and attempted to walk her hand around on her fingers. She let out a small chuckle as her hand scuttled around a little, although she hand very little control over where it went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she knew she could reattach parts at the incorrect orientation, and detach parts other than her head, there was one more thing she needed to test. Leaving her left hand on the ground, she carefully used her right hand to pluck her head off of her neck again. It was a little uncomfortable trying to keep a grip on it with one hand, but using the mirror as a guide, she moved her left arm so that the wrist stump pressed against the underside of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held it there for a moment, a little afraid to let go for fear of dropping her head, but eventually let go. Her head did not drop, however, and instead stayed attached to her wrist, giving her a head where her hand should be. That confirmed her last idea about what she could do with the upgrade; she could reattach parts in places where they weren't supposed to be. To complete the test, she crouched down again, holding her left arm up so as not to disorient herself, scooped up her left hand, and attached it to her neck stump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stood up again, Samus was greeted by a rather freakish reflection. She now had a hand for a head, and a head for a hand. Closer inspection revealed that along with her hand attaching to her neck stump, the parts of the zero suit that clothed the two parts had connected together as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, Samus decided that the upgrade was rather novel, but didn't seem to have much use for her job as a bounty hunter. Sure, she could separate and rearrange her body at will, but only while she was outside her power suit. That said, she was rather enjoying the upgrade, and didn't want to remove it just because it wasn't particularly useful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the Guillotine Upgrade was not the only upgrade available at the space station. Samus turned her head around on her wrist, looking back at the terminal, wondering what else might be hiding behind its vaguely named upgrades.</span></div></div>",

Finishing the scan, she saw the information on her visor and read through it. It stated...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Delta Red Upgrade: named in honor of the homonymous special force, this upgrade can guarantee more agility and speed in order to improve both the attack and the defense. Moreover, it is possible to execute several moves, primarily the \"Cannon Spike\".'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I never heard of this special force,\" she thought hesitantly, \"but it seems worth trying. I'm very curious about what this \"Cannon Spike\" could be.\" Once every doubt has been dispelled, she placed the orb near her armor which was absorbed by it and waited for the upgrade to take effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting for a few seconds, she noticed that her armor was changing in color, becoming green except for her metal glove and her boots which became respectively red and black with a thin red line to the top. However, she gasped when her arm cannon broke apart and fell to the floor, revealing another red glove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My cannon!\" she shouted, \"How am I supposed to do a \"Cannon Spike\" without a cannon?!\" Looking at her hand, she noticed that the metal glove was changing until it took the form of a fingerless red gauntlet in leather material, which also happened to the other glove. In fact, it seemed that the upgrade was affecting her zero suit as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next change happened to her metal boots, which changed into a pair of black leather boots with two red socks, giving her an uncomfortable sensation since they were combined to a metal armor. A sensation that became more strong when her armor began to change in material as well, losing all the metal equipment, especially the bulky shoulder pads, and getting the form of a tight leotard that highlights every detail of her body even more than the zero suit. After that, the leotard started to recede in order to leave uncovered her arms, her shoulders, her legs and, most of all, her buttocks, wedging itself deep into the crevice giving her a wedgie. An upside-down red triangle, the same symbol of the orb, was formed on one of her breasts, while green camouflage paint appeared on her uncovered legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could complain about it, her helmet began to shrink until the visor disappeared, leaving her face uncovered and causing her blonde ponytail hair to burst out and cascade down her back, then it reformed in order to get the appearance of a red beret with a small yellow and black symbol on it. Even her hair began to move, undoing her ponytail and giving her two braided pigtails with a forelock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing that the upgrade was finally complete, she slowly turned her gaze to the mirror in order to see her reflection, which offered her the image of a scantily clad blonde woman. She stared at herself in disbelief and with a flushed face for more than ten seconds, then she literally exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is this?!?!\" she screamed in anger, \"How could a special force managed to fight with such a skimpy outfit?!\" She still continued to blush in embarrassment by looking at her uncovered buttocks and her attire that left nothing to the imagination, then...</span></div></div>",

She wondered what it actually entailed. Would her suit become more robotic or would she actually become a robot? As silly as that last part sounded she decided it wouldn't hurt to try. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the upgrade chip from the chip library and inserted it into her Varia suit as the upgrade was shown to require it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she felt nothing, thinking the chip didn't work or was delayed in reaction. All of a sudden she felt as though her Varia suit was closing in on her. It pressed against her arms, legs, torso , and head. \"Ok this is getting tight\" she said as she found that she could not move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood in place as the suit continued squeezing her from inside. Her arms and legs were pressing against the suits interiors and soon her helmet was condensing and pressing against her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Itch choo chight\" she muffled from within her helmet, which was squeezing her face and head more and more. She couldn't believe she was being destroyed by her own suit. What kind of upgrade was this, she asked herself as she was being squeezed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more squeezing happened however, the less it felt like she was being squished. Strangely it felt like she could no longer tell where her regular arm was and where her Varia suit arm was.<br>\r\n Within the suit, Samus' body was being assimilated into the robot suit, her flesh disappearing into the interior walls of the suit. Not even her hair was left as her body and hair were squished and absorbed into the fibers of her suit and digitized into it's circuitry as data. Soon the suit closed up completely within, no space left for a human body to be fit in it. The suit stood still as it rearranged it's insides to be filled with gears and more metal. It shifted in shape as it became bulkier, the arm cannon growing bigger and the cannon part itself separating from the tip and reconfiguring into a Gatling gun.  The suit's left arm growing somewhat muscular as spikes protruded from the knuckles.<br>\r\nThe chest area had shifted as well. The red torso front split itself in half and the halves turned round into orb like protrusions, similar to breasts. Just below and between the new breasts a gap opened up showing a cannon nozzle sticking out before retracting back into the suit and a green triangle cover covering it. Her legs had stayed relatively the same although growing a bit longer as the feet changed to become more like Samus' feet, with a showing of high heels under the feet before they retracted into the bottoms of them, showing they were optional. Finally the helmet began altering drastically as it reshaped itself to resembles a more human head shape. The green visor part had widened into a small triangular screen like shape as the sides grew antenna for hearing. From the back, the helmet opened a slot and from it, a long thin bunch of yellow wires extended downward ending with a series of plugs attached to them. On the screen, static was displayed until a picture became clear, a digital version of Samus' face.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"...Maintenece complete. All systems operational\" a robotic voice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus felt as if she just woke up from some dream. \"Mmmm where am I\" she said as she woke up....only to find everything tinted green. At the top right of her eyes she saw a diagnostics list. It looked like a list of her different body parts and their percentage of functionality. <br>\r\n   For example: head: 100%<br>\r\n                           left arm unit 100%<br>\r\n                           right arm unit 100% etc<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-what happened to me\" Samus asked to herself. She noticed her voice had some sort of filter as if her voice was metallic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her right arm. It looked like she was still wearing her varia suit but she couldn't feel any trace of her regular human arm, but felt the metal fingers of her other hand and the metal of her robotic arm as if it was her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the varia suit really has become my body\" said Samus to herself as she looked down at herself. She looked and felt bulky as if the thick metal of her robotic varia suit body was muscle and saw extra features her varia suit didn't have before like spiked knuckles as well as the huge gatling gun her right arm had, although she didn't like the feeling of being single handed with a gun as her right hand. She felt her chest. It was thick and large. The big red orbs were obviously her breasts, to which she showed annoyance to for them being so huge and pronounced. The middle yellow part between them looked like some sort of opening. She pressed it and it slid open like a door as a cannon nozzle came out and protruded forward, surprising Samus. She saw that this robot body was very much combat oriented. She touched her face only to find a feeling of flatness. She guessed her face became a screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wonder what else this body can do\" Samus pondered to herself in her metallic voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I may assist Ms Aran\" a voice said. Samus was startled by the sudden voice from above. She looked forward and saw that it was only the terminal a.i. of fhe station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um alright, tell me about this upgrade. Am I really fully a robot\" she asked the a.i..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, your body was 100% reconfigured into metal. You now have the capabilities of a machine but still retain your free will, similar to a.i.\" said the terminal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You now no longer need food, water, sleep or oxygen. Your life source is a special internal energy that renews itself every minute. This means that your stamina is now infinite. For example you will not tire when running and can continue running for days on end. Your robot body is designed with all modern day weaponry and efficiency for maximum combat ability. It is also waterproof and soundproof. Additionally, your screen face acts as an HUD showing your available weapons and current status. Your head module however is reshapable so you may choose a screen or a normal human like face to be your head unit\". Samus was surprised by this information but also pleased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down and felt her chest. Her metal breasts and torso were real and a part of her. She also found that her breasts were detachable. \"Oh\" she said as she pulled a red orb out of her chest. \"Of course there would be something vulgar here...\" she said annoyed her metal boobs could come off. Looking closer she saw a pin on the orb. The red breast balls we're apparently grenades. Placing the bomb balls back into her she went back to examining herself. She soon found that even her entire torso could open. She pulled open her thick metal torso front of her varia suit robot body as it opened up like a flower blooming as her torso doors opened. There was no human body there... just multiple gears and circuits. The cannon from before sat idle in the middle of her chest. Around it there were multiple circuits, gears, wires, tubes and lots of metal with tiny robot claws squirming around. She guessed they were there most likely for maintenance. No skin, just metal. Any trace of her being organic was gone. <br>\r\n  She opened up her legs as well and found only wiring straightened into a leg shape. The wiring seemed to move and wriggle.<br>\r\n  Her robot arms inside were unique. She opened them up with a simple button push on her right elbow. Her left arm opened up by the hand splitting itself open and the fingers as well. Her arm split into multiple parts that opened and extended in different directions as it showed the insides of her arm. It was mostly circuits and turning gears as usual but also showed multiple blades and gun nozzles stored in the sides, suggesting this arm could shapeshift. Her other arm showed the gatling gun's nozzle's insides and the inside of her forearms that were more gears and wires. The one thing that stood out was that within the gatling gun were hand parts with robotic finger and palm parts that meant she could turn it into a hand. She was glad for that. The other thing she noticed was a small round module with nodes all around it in the middle of her arm's insides. She guessed this was for shapeshifting more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she finished inspecting her robot body she closed all her hatches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Samus looked up to the terminal a.i..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, if you wouldn't mind me asking, how do I change my gun back into a hand\" Samus asked holding up her large gatling gun with the bullet belt dangling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, a simple fix. Your robot body is currently in combat mode. You can change it to standard mode. Simply focus and say \"standard mode\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um alright. \"Standard mode\" \" she said. Immediately she felt her body changing. \"Woah!\" She went as her body began to rearrange and shapeshift. The gatling gun disassembled itself and transformed into a hand. Her arms and hands changed and became thin and dainty. Her legs became thin as the extra bulk retracted inwards. Her feet went from looking like her jump boots into looking like robotic human feet with metal toes. Her torso became less bulky and instead became a slim female frame, her red grenade breasts growing a bit. Even her head had shapeshifted as metal rearranged and Samus was blinded for a minute, she regained her sight as her head changed from her helmet with ponytail wires and a screen to resemble her human head and face. The head was yellow colored like part of her suit. The top had no hair aside from the wirey ponytail behind it. Her eyes were green like her visor and pupiless and shiny like glass. She had an orange metal nose. Her lips were orange. Inside her mouth however there was no tongue as she spoke with an electronic voice box inside her throat. After a minute of shapeshifting Sanus looked like a thin robotic version of her human form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She looked herself over. Her robot hands were yellow and orange. Testing their dexterity she moved her fingers. Robotic metal shifting sounds occurred with every flex of her fingers. She concentrated and her fingers popped out from their joints and hung from springs to show their ability to dislodge from their joints. She put them back in the joints. She then decided to try and shapeshift part of herself and felt her fingers and hand change as she shapeshifted her entire arm into her power beam cannon. With the other hand she felt it change into a large sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incredible\" she said with her electronic voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your standard mode is functioning at full capacity. You can transform and modify your robot body in different ways and change your shape to any that you desire as long as it is within your database and you can modify its size as well. Additionally you may scan multiple shapes into your new processor chip that is your new brain, which holds all your data. Your memories, available weapons, available transformations are in your processor chip brain. You may scan any object, weapon, or vehicle and copy it's function and look\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was quite impressed. More and more she liked being a robot. \"This is quite handy\" Samus said as she tested out more of her shapeshifting. She turned her arms into claws, retracted her head into her body, and sprung wires from ports in her torso. Then she returned to normal. She then decided to test her flexibility. She rotated her hand and spun it in place. Her right hand spun like it was a bottle cap being turned open. It spun and spun but Samus felt no discomfort. She then tried the same thing with her robotic head. She rotated it around so she was facing behind her body. Her neck didn't hurt at all. As She returned her head back to facing forward she then jumped and did a split with her thick robot legs and feet. What's more she lifted both legs up like levers at a 45 degree angle. A normal human couldn't bend their legs like that but a robot like Samus currently was could. She liked how flexible her body was. Each joint and limb felt nimble and could bend in any way. She then decided to detach some of her parts to see how it felt. She sat down and used both arms and tore her left metal leg off  \"Ow\" Samus said as she felt some pain removing the metal limb from its ball joint. She sat one legged and held her leg in her hand. The pain from her leg joint. quickly subsided though. She attached  her leg back as it was wired back in place instantly. \"Not doing that again\" she said as she rubbed her metal joint, recovering from the pain. She spun her robotic head around some more as it rotated like a helicopter rotor. It was amazing, she felt free and without pain since she was completely flexible as all her limbs were detachable parts. \"I do like this quite a lot\" said Samus as she tested out her spinning head and hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat cross-legged in the room, having tested out her new body. She could feel her metal toes flex, the wiring felt like her bones. She ran diagnostics on herself, checking her system status. Everything was normal. She held fascination about the life of a machine. She wondered if she should keep this body permanently, but maybe she shouldn't give up her humanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more thing Samus\" the a.i. said.Samus listened attentively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wish it I may offer you another upgrade. This will allow you to put human skin and tissue on your body for disguise.  However you must accept one important condition\" the a.i. said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To accept this the robot upgrade must become permanent. You will not be able to turn back into your human self again\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus thought long and hard about this decision. Should she give up her humanity just to keep being a robot while looking human? She would look like her old self but on the inside be a machine. Or perhaps is it not worth it and she should stay a human?...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The more she thought about it, she realized being human is more hindering. As a robot she was much more efficient, fast and versitle. She no longer needed to breathe and could go in space easily. No more needing to eat, no more need for sleeping and never out of stamina or need of recharging. The energy source within her, whatever it was, was designed to make her now artificial life force and armor ageproof. Needless to say she found out she was waterproof and fireproof too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo more hindrances...she was eternal. And the more she thought about it, she already lost her humanity when the K-2L incident happened. Being a robot would probably be the best thing to happen to her. She can explore everything life has to offer until the end of time. The realization hit her like a truck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes, I choose to permanently be a machine\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well Samus, installing upgrade chip now\" the a.i. said. Coming out of the terminal was a chip held by a claw. The claw stretched out more until it was next to her circular plated robot hip. A small slot opened. As soon as this chip was inserted into her system the deed would be done and her humanity would be gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing the chip into her plated hip it went inside and Samus began feeling a change. Her internal structure began rumbling, shaking her torso. In her processor chip her inner a.i. voice rang \"UPGRADE COMPLETE\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything felt relatively the same. Samus lifted her hand to her face. It was still robotic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your upgrade was successful, you now have the ability to generate flesh from your body Samus\" the a.i. confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus concentrated and her hand started seeping skin over itself. Her hand was exactly like a normal human woman's hand, long fingernails and all. She felt inside it was still metal but the flesh was genuine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe focused on her face. She grew back her human face as it had been before, pupiled eyes and pink lips. She also grew her foot skin back, giving her a human pair of feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe strangely didnt feel like growing other features back, leaving her with her yellow/orange robot body with only her face, hands and feet human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she could grow back outer features like skin and hair along with nerve endings, she found she could not grow back internal organs. She had no organs as she was a machine so it would complicate things if she could grow them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought for a moment. She was now a machine who was once a human and can blend in with them and understands the value of human life, and other species as well. On the other hand she was a full machine, a weapon of cold hard metal filled with power like never before, but is smart enough to know machines do not surpass people and understands free will as she was once an organic being with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about it, she was the perfect meld of man(or woman in this case) and machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at the A.I. and said with a blank look \"Thank you..\". She turned around, bare feet on the cold floor walking back towards her ship. She didn't mind the cold though. She welcomed it. Feeling cold on skin made her remember her humanity so she wouldn't forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of sight, the a.i. said to itself \"May you find peace Samus. May you find peace as a machine\".<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Without realizing it she was swaying her metal hips and shiny orange metal dome of a butt. Samus supposed there had to be some sexual gag about this form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She remembered something about being able to scan different shapes into her new processor chip brain. Looking around She saw a room and opened the door. Inside were boxes full of things, machine parts and all. She concentrated and from her eyes 2 very wide range green beams shot out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is how to scan things in this body eh\" she said. Her scan visor was now integrated into her eyes. She moved her eyes towards the boxes. The beams moved over several of them one at a time. The details of each item she scanned was shown to her in projected light and stored in her brain. Suddenly she knew how to transform into the shape of a box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe focused and felt her body shifting again. Her parts moved around as she became more square. She went blind for a second as her robot head shifted into her. Soon she found herself in the shape of the heavy metal crates she scanned. Only difference was she was an orange and yellow box while they were all blue. Her eye was the big green orb on the side of the box form. She looked around as it moved. She was really a box now. She didn't know why but she felt excited at the aspect of transforming. Plus this form is good for espionage. Only bad thing was that she couldn't seem to move at all. She supposed when it was said she copied all the functions and shape of the scanned item it also meant it being solitary if you were an inanimate object. She randomly focused on her weapons systems. Unexpectedly her crate cover opened and her gatling gun deployed. Her vision shifting to a green targeting eye on her gun as she moved it like her arm. She then tried firing bullets. The rapid fire was quite lethal and destructive as she blew up some crates and damaged the floor. \"Um oops\" she said as the gun stopped firing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 20 minutes experiencing the feeling of pure stillness she focused and transformed back to robot mode, stretching her metal arms and legs after staying stiff for a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think I have the hang of this now. Can turn into a box that shoots things. That's something I guess\" she said as she walked out of the storage room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then went to...</span></div></div>",

Perhaps her new robot form could interact with the ship in some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning, she left the upgrade hall, and started making her way back to her ship. As she did so, she could feel her breasts bobbing and jiggling like real ones. This confused her greatly. She was currently a machine, so what purpose was there for her body to be so... curvy? Then she started to thing of something: perhaps there were more tricks that her robot body was hiding that she had yet to discover, and her curves were somehow connected to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she returned to her ship. There didn't seem to be much different about it, but Samus was already thinking about whatever possibilites her new form had in connection to her ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have returned to your ship, I see.\" The AI suddenly said over the station intercoms. \"Would you like me to explain how the Robot Upgrade interfaces with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like that.\" Samus replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your ship has been modified with several connection ports. Using these ports, you can connect and upload your mind to the ship's main computers.\" The AI explained. \"This will allow your to take direct control of the ship, and allows you to access multiple mainframes and information networks. When on the ground, you can also remotely control your ship's navigation and weapons via the controls on your left arm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus nodded. \"That sounds incredibly useful.\" She said. She then looked over her body once again. \"Computer, if I may ask, why is my robot body so, for lack of a better term, curvacious? What is the purpose of that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're current form is partly based on your original human figure.\" The AI answered. \"Some parts have been inhanced to better contain the numerous weapons and systems your new body contains. For example, the red orbs that are currently acting as your breasts can be detached and used as explosives, and contain a specialized gatling gun for quick attacks, in conjunction with the plasma cannon in the center of your chest. They can also be used to spray water to put out fires, and absorb and hold electrical energy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds... bizarrely perverted.\" Samus said. \"What about my butt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your lower body contains jets for use of higher jumps and temporary flight. The area acting as your thighs are the fuel canisters, and expand the more fuel is in them.\" The AI explained. \"You also possess the ability to turn your lower body into tank treds to traverse rough terrain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was actually quite impressed. \"That sounds quite useful.\" She said. \"But are there any upgrades to this chip that are more... modest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Modest...\" The AI said, sounding a bit confused. \"I can provide you with specialized clothing to cover your body if you so wish. There is a wide selection of swimsuits, underwear-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I meant.\" Samus interrupted. \"Am I able to rest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are able to enter a powered down state to recharge equipment, but this requires your body to disassemble.\" The AI answered. \"Would you like to enter this state to recharge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus thought for a moment, and answered...</span></div></div>",

Thankfully, the room wasn't very far from where she was now, so it didn't take long to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she entered the room, the station AI chimed in again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Ms. Aran. Want to undergo some training?\" The AI asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would. I want to see all that my new form can do.\" Samus replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent.\" The AI said. \"So, which of your six main forms do you wish to test?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six?\" Samus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. In addition to your current default form and combat form, you have four other modes to cycle through, not counting any addition forms you scan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Explain those four to me.\" Samus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" The AI replied. \"First is your flight form. This form creates jet wings on your back, and activates the propulsion jets in your feet. This form will allow you to easily fly through air and space, with a top speed of nearly 60,000 miles per hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I might not even need my gunship in certain situations. Impressive.\" Samus said. \"What else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next is your stealth form. This thins out your body, and gives your much more flexibility and the ability to both flatten yourself and render yourself invisible. This form is meant for infiltration and sneak attacks on opponents.\" The AI explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stealth is important in my line of work.\" Samus said, now more impressed. \"What's next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The speed form.\" The AI answered. \"Like stealth, your body is streamlined to reduced wind resistance, and adds propulsion jets to your back. In this form, you can run at the same top speed as your flight form, and still be able to perform an instant stop. However, this form is much weaker then the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, so only use the speed form for escapes.\" Samus said. \"What is the final form?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The femme form.\" The AI explained. \"This form increases the size of your breast and buttocks, and streamlines your limbs to a more slender, feminine shape. This form is meant for distractive purposes, able to distract or seduce an opponent of either gender. Also, this forms allows for even faster switching to another form. For example, you could use the femme form to distract an opponent, then instantly switch to combat form to attack while they are distracted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... guess I could see how that's useful.\" Samus said, a little confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, which form would you like to begin testing?\" The AI asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus thought for a moment. \"I guess I would like to begin by testing the...\"</span></div></div>",

Samus thought), there was one oddly named upgrade that caught her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Acrofatic Upgrade?\" Samus asked, confused. \"What the hell does Acrofatic mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow intrigued by this odd sounding upgrade, she selected it, and the chip popped out of a slot near the computer. She noticed the upgrade was for her Zero Suit, so she opened and stepped out of her Power Suit. Taking the upgrade, she placed the chip in an upgrade slot on her right arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, so what's this chip supposed to do?\" Samus asked. Almost immediately, she felt a strange feeling in her stomach. She placed her hands on her stomach, only to feel a little... more of her stomach. It honestly felt like her stomach was expanding. Just then, the strange feeling spread to the rest of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Samus felt her stomach continue to bloat, she looked down and saw in shock that her breasts were beginning to inflate as well. Feeling her Zero Suit tighten around her back, she turned her head and saw her rear swelling up as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What this hell is going on?\" Samus asked, bewildered. \"Am I- Wait. Acrofatic. Oh, NOW I know what's going on.\" As she felt her Zero Suit tighten all over her body, she sighed. The upgrade was making her fat. \"Just great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down again, and saw that her usually modest bust had grown nearly 2 cup sizes. And she was shocked to see her stomach was beginning to peak out from under her bustline too. It felt... squishy. And for Samus, that was a weird feeling. She moved her hands to her bloating backside, and felt that her butt had already doubled in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe happened to glance at her arms, and noticed they had started to thicken with fat as well. She squeezed one of her arms. Just like her stomach, it was soft. Then she felt her thighs begin to touch, confirming that her legs were thickening as well. Finally, she evern felt the cheeks on her face begin to bloat slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a minute of this, the growth slowed, then stopped. Relieved that it ended, Samus noticed that there was a mirror nearby, possibly for checking to see what the upgrade had done. She walked over to it, and was surprised by the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cheeks had puffed up slightly, but not too much, and she had a second chin. Her breasts had blown up about 3 cup sizes. Her arms and legs had thickened considerably. And her stomach stuck out nearly two feet from her body, and was a perfect sphere of blubber. Turning, she saw that her butt was also sticking about two feet out from her body, and her hips were widened as well. She could even see slight back rolls. Overall, Samus looked to be about 400 pounds now. And a smack on the belly that sent it jiggling confirmed the size wasn't the suit, she really was that fat. She also noticed there was a number pad on the right arm of her Zero Suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus looked herself over again, and felt...</span></div></div>",

What purpose could that possibly serve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stomped over to the monitor, her entire body jiggling with each movement, making her more frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Computer, what is this upgrade, and who needs to be smacked for making it?\" Samus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Upgrade: Acrofatic. Upgrade causes increased amounts of adipose tissue in subject.\" The computer said. \"But increase in adipose tissue has a unique secondary effect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? It makes me more lazy?\" Samus asked sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As body fat increases, so does the subjects physical abilites.\" The computer replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat caught Samus off guard. \"Computer, explain.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Increase in body fat of subject also causes a substantial increase in physical strength, movement speed, stamina, physical endurace, and health.\" The computer explained. \"As an example, at your current size, your running speed is 56 miles per hour, double the average running speed of a human. You also could run for nearly 2 hours without feeling physical exhaustion. Your can also lift nearly twice your own body weight, most small arms and weapons cause minimal damage, and your body is in peak physical health.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Samus was amazed. Getting fatter actually made her faster, stronger, more resiliant, AND healthier? That was impressive, but she still wasn't happy with being fat. She then looked at the number pad on her right arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Computer, what is the purpose of the number pad?\" Samus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A secondary ability. As mentioned before, all of your physical abilites increase along with weight. The subject can also increase or decrease their weight at will. You can enter any number on the keypad, and your weight will change to that number. Do note, however, that there is a minimum and maximum weight. Minimum weight is 400 pounds, and maximum weight is 2000 pounds.\" The computer explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"2000 pounds?!\" Samus yelled, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct. At that size, your could potentially lift entire buildings, you would move so fast that time seems to slow around you, you could run infinitely without tiring, you are immune to all damage, and you're completely immune to all diseases.\" The computer said. \"However, any size above 1000 pounds can only be maintained for a maximum of 2 hours, after which the subject is returned to the default 400 pounds. Also, the subject will never weight less then 400 pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Samus didn't enjoy being so fat, the benefits were impressive. But there had to be other negatives to this. \"Are there any other downsides to this upgrade?\" She asked, a little worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Despite increases in physical abilites, the subjects weight is still increased. As such, anything that has a weight limit will create issues. For example, subject liking will not be able to use most elevators or weak platforms. Also, subjects appetite will also increase as weigh increases. Another is that the subject may develop an unconscious sexual attraction to their own body. Finally, changes made by upgrade are irreversable.\" The computer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus's heart sank at that. She's going to be fat for the rest of her life? That was NOT going to be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, thanks for the information.\" Samus said, rather upset. She then decided to...</span></div></div>",

Seeing that it was an upgrade for the Zero Suit, Samus removed her armor. That done, she popped the chip into her Zero Suit's upgrad slot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second, Samus did not feel anything, then suddenly, a jolt ran up through her entire body. Then, parts of her body starting feeling... cold. Confused, Samus raised a hand to one of the areas that felt cold... and came into contact with something hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused and a little worried, Samus raced over to a nearby mirror to see what was going on. To her surprise, her skin was quickly become a silvery-grey color. In fact, it was so quick that by the time she had reached the mirror, her entire face had changed color. It took Samus less then a second to realize what had happened: her skin had turned to metal. In less then a minute, her whole body was metal. However, her Zero Suit remained unchanged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow very worried, Samus turned back to the computer. She was about to say something when she caught a glance of her left arm. On it was what looked like a grid of 118 squares, covering the length between her elbow and hand. Groups of the squares were different colors, and there was a chart on top explaining each color. One of the squares, a light purple one (which Samus read on the chart meant it was a Transition Metal), was lit up. Taking a closer look, Samus saw what was on the square:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"26: Fe: Iron\"<br>\r\nReading that, Samus realized what this grid was: the Periodic Table of Elements. This finally told Samus what happened to her: her skin had specifically been turned into Iron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorry now replaced with curiosity, Samus finally addressed the computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Computer, what exactly is the function of the Periodic Upgrade.\" She asked. After a few seconds, the computer replied.<br>\r\n\"The Periodic Upgrade grants the user the ability to transmutate their body into any of the 118 elements on the periodic table. The general setup of the upgrade is based on the original table from Earth, so elements originating from other planets are not included. Changes are down to a molecular level, so your entire body becomes the element, even your organs and blood.\" The computer explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... quite freaky.\" Samus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The periodic table on your arm lets you select an element. Once your transmutation is complete, your body will gain all properties of that element, including melting points, conductivity to electricity, and more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about if I turn into a gaseous or radioactive element?\" Samus asked. \"Do I turn gaseous as well, and how will others be protected from any radiation I give off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Zero Suit has been modified to safely and properlly contain whatever element you transform into.\" The computer explained. \"As such, it will contain all radiation given off by your body, should you chose to become a radioactive element. Also, when you become a gaseous element, you can keep a humanoid shape, or turn into a cloud of that element, including the Zero Suit. You also will not be in danger of dissipation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus nodded. Out of all the upgrades she's seen so far, this one seemed extremely versitile, but also extremely dangerous. Looking over her iron body, Samus decided to...</span></div></div>",

Adrenaline was pumping through her and she was beginning to crave a fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Samus she came here with a small research group that consisted of a few Scouts/Soldiers, a Science Officer, and a Medic. It was a small party that was only intended research purposes, not combat. Samus knew this and smirked as the few Scouts/Soldiers surrounded her. From the information she was able to get from Alexi, Samus knew they were relatively new recruits. She had all of Alexi's knowledge, and with it she knew she had the edge over them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first couple of Scouts/Soldiers began to fire on her. Samus quickly dodged the barrage of bullets. These Soldiers were too easy to read, nothing like the Space Pirates she had faced in the past. She continued to swiftly dodge the barrage of bullets as she made her way to the closest soldier. With increased speed, she was quickly in front of them with her claws drawn. She was about to deliver the finishing blow when the soldiers face better came into view. It was a female soldier, one that Samus didn't recognize, but it seems like her host body did. Samus scanned through Alexi's memories and found her name to be Sasha. She was a recruit that joined the Federation Army the same time as him. They went through that hellish boot camp together, and grew closer. Alexi grew to love Sasha, and would never dream of hurting her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus' body then began to lock up and convulse. \"What was she doing,\" she wondered. She didn't want to kill anyone. These soldiers were innocent, plus she didn't need the Federation trying to hunt her down. Samus then started to feel pain throughout the shared body. It seems that Alexi wasn't a perfect host after all, as the were rejecting each other. Samus needed a new host fast, but she wasn't going to be able to take one with all these soldiers spraying bullets everywhere. Regaining control of her body, Samus quickly knocks out Sasha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then turns to face the few other soldiers. She quickly bobs and weaves through the group of them. With a few quick a decisive blows she quickly knocks the lot of them out. All that was left standing at this point were the Medic and Science Officer. Samus looks at the two women her with claws and fangs at the ready. She tells them to drop their weapons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter watching Samus quickly dispatch the other soldiers, the two women quickly complied. The Science Officer then asked her what she wanted. Samus began to grow weaker and convulsed slightly. She knew she was running out of time, if she didn't jump bodies soon then Alexi wouldn't likely survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks as the two and in an odd mix of a higher pitched Alexi, and an alien like voice says, <b>\"Look we don't have much time. This male's body is not compatible with us.\"</b> The Science Officer then asks what it means by that. Samus responds, <b>\"Look, we are Samus Aran. We used an odd upgrade and are stuck with this alien body for now. We are a symbiote race and need a host to survive.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Science Officer was following it so far, and it was the Medic that now chimed in. \"Well if Alexi wasn't compatible, why take him as a host?\" she asked. Samus grunts and shakes. She is grabbing at her sides as she says, <b>\"He was the closest person to us, and without a host we would die. Now we need a new one. Alexi is at his limit, and if we don't change fast, he won't make it.\" </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that, </span></div></div>",

Weird.\" She mused. \"Guess i'll go head to the gym to test this out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnnoticed by Samus was her internal physiology morphing due to her new 'upgrade'.On the outside her body was the same as always, but the inside had changed into drastically. Samus gave out harvestable energy like an engine. One could easily take in said with nothing more than conductive wiring. Unfortunately, this came with its own downsides in the form of energy absorption. Samus' body slowly bloated from any and all available sources, even from her own momentum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Samus' could feel the weight of each step on her back as her bosom blimped. Her belly slowly becoming a strange cross between flab and inflated.
