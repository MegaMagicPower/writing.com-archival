Growing up, the shop had dominated her life; her family were very good with such things. <i>Green thumbs and all that; don'cha know.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, since her mum had passed on she'd been quite lonely. You see, Evie, as she liked to be known, was well...not well; for she was cripplingly shy. Even when young and at school had she chosen to be on her own in the playground, reading; for she was really quite bright. Her mum had great expectations of her daughter; namely to attend University, but her untimely death had meant Evie needed to look after the shop. The shop wasn't ideal for meeting people, the main customers being: old people or taken men... <i>And there aren't very many of those anymore! Men just don't seem to try like they do in books...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I took her hand in mine, and we went out of the ruined place; and, as the morning mists had risen long ago when I first left the forge, so, the evening mists were rising now, and in all the broad expanse of tranquil light they showed to me, I saw no shadow of another parting from her.\" </i>Evie closed the book she was reading, satisfied; she liked Dickens, and looked outside <i>Another slow day...</i> She stretched...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'll just lock up\" she said through a yawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce this was done, she acquired a glass of water and, pausing at the foot of the stairs to admire her Tulips; as she did love her Tulips, <i>So pretty...</i> Evie then made her way upstairs to her flat. She did feel sad about her life of late. <i>Probably on my own too much</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie got into her pajamas, the cotton light and fluffy against her skin, like a warm hug. She turned for a cheeky look at her bum in the mirror before climbing into bed. Although she didn't quite \"measure up\" to other girls at school she'd always had a little guilty pride in her bottom, not that anyone ever took any interest, perhaps she was even self-conscious of that. <i>Oh that good looking guy outside the pub last week, \"like a fecking bell\".He had said, just a bit too loudly\u2026Is that a good thing!? </i>Evie smiled lightly, the attention was a quite nice though. As she was drifting off, she rolled onto her side, tucking her hand between her thighs for warmth, and sighed at the picture of her mum. With that she flicked the switch on the lamp...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, what causes her transformation?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She rolled over and glanced lazily at her the clock. <i>Fuck...</i> She had overslept, having forgotten to set her alarm. She jumped out of bed and tried to ready herself hurriedly. <i>Fuckedy Fuckedy Fuck!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stumbled down the stairs, trying to pull her jeans on over her shapely hips. She tripped; flailed and tumbled down the stairs. Unraveling herself at the foot of the stairs.\"Owch...\"Evie ran over to turn on the shop's lights, rubbing her head.<i> Soooo late!</i> She flicked the light switch; with a bang and a fizzle the lights blew out. <i>Oh come on!</i> she fumed from the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie fumbled her way to the cellar door; which was quite a feat in the dark. She never really had cause to go down there. Once again, whilst making her way downstairs, she tripped. Rolling down the stairs, she was eventually stopped by a pile of boxes and such junk at the bottom. The jolt caused the shelves above - old and rotting with age - to collapse; raining a pile of sticky old chemicals down on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie sat in the foul puddle, dripping, for some time, bubbling with fury. She got up slowly, but slipped and landed in the puddle again.<i> Fuck the shop!</i> She stormed, and slid, her way back upstairs. Passing through the shop she slid and fell into a plant display \"Well that's the fucking venus fly-traps ruined!\" She screamed loudly into the shrubbery. It was surprising she knew exactly were she'd fallen. Luckily the lights were still working in her flat upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing into her bathroom she stripped herself of her sopping clothing. The noxious fumes from the chemicals were making her feel dizzy and ill. <i>I think I deserve a day of relaxation</i>  She stepped delicately into the shower; slipping under the hot water. She tactically removed the excess plant from her hair, their little plant mouths trying to snap shut, and let them drain down the plug-hole, those that wouldn't go properly were forced down by her toe. <i>That looks a funny colour...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n After washing her glossy hair, she squeezed shower gel onto her bosom and lathered her body. She was really feeling quite strange; very light-headed. Her body seemed more sensitive to her touch. \"Mmmm\" she groaned, slowly slipping a hand between her legs. Maybe she's lucky she lived alone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe emerged from the shower and wrapped a towel around herself. It was quite odd, she didn't usually do things like that...She sat on the edge of her bed. Evie stretched out in front of herself; her fingertips appeared to be a greenish tint...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

She didn't sleep well, she was awake on and off unable to get more than a couple hours at most. She awoke at around five. \"Morning self...\" She mumbled quietly. Her fingers no longer had that odd tint to them, she smiled as she put on a short sleeve shirt and some light but long pants with some socks and sneakers. \"Mother...good morning.\" She heard. Evie jumped she didn't have any children. She looked around not hearing anything. \"Did our beauty frighten you mother?\" Again she looked around. Was she going crazy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hear us now mother? We are so happy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi, who're you?\" She asked looking around. \"'Where're you for that matter?\" She grabbed her head as she slumped against the wall. \"We are everywhere mother.\" The voices were so mixed that Evie had a hard time making out the words for a while. \"One at a time, please...\" She said getting a headache. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother...\" They sounded sad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, really I just uh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The shop mother...\" They said. Evie decided she was going nuts but why not? It was better than just sitting around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the shop she froze in shock, the plants had taken over, flowers bloomed everywhere along with various herbs and so much more. \"Mother!!\" She heard a yell as a plant wrapped itself around her, vines, so many vines embraced her. \"This form does not suit you mother.\" A sweet smelling gas emitted from another flower making her pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she woke she realized three things, First she was being bathed in sunlight, second, her body was covered in vines for clothing, and third...she felt GOOD! Not just her body but her mental state as well. \"What-?\" she stopped as her eyes lit up. Information came flooding in, she was Gaia, mother nature, she was the plants and the souls of the animals. \"Now I know...\" She whispered enjoying the sunlight. \"Well, first I must take back the planet...Humans have done so much but...\" She felt herself...growing, \"Feed me my children.\" She whispered as the vines came and wrapped themselves around her feeding her the sun itself was like a looooooong drink nourishing her body. Flowers bloomed in her hair as well. \"I've decided that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n((Since I couldn't fit all in Choice three I was going for Evie rewarding those who try to save the planet, and punishing those like litterbugs and those destroying the rainforest.))</span></div></div>",

If a small amount of spillage had made her look this good, how good would she look if she drank more of the stuff? She went downstairs and looked at the shelf where the chemicals had been. A few vials were still on the shelf. Without thinking, Evie grabbed them and drank them. The last vial burned a bit as it slid down her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is either going to kill me or...\" Evie stopped. She felt a gurgling coming from her stomach, and a series of warm, pulsing waves emanating through her body. She could feel herself begin to bulge. Elvie dashed up stairs, not wanting to miss a second of what was going to happen next. Her bosom and hips shook violently as the formula began to work its magic. She slid a hand down her pants and began to rub at herself, her eyes fixated on the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, her breasts seemed to double in size as they burst out of her clothing. Elvie thrust fingers into her now-dripping pussy as her endowments continued to swell. Her tits had grown to the size of her torso, her hips had grown wider than the doorframe she entered the room through, and her ass grew as thick as the rest of her body (sans breasts). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, yes!\" moaned Elvie as she continued to thrust her fingers inside of her. \"Don't stop! Keep goi--aaaaaagh!\" The growing of her tits and ass had slowed, and the rest of her body was beginning to follow suit. Her torso began to thicken, and her legs began to lengthen. More pleasure rushed into her body as her strengthened form began to push against the walls of the room. She could feel the ceiling pressing against her back like the massage of a lover, and her tits pressed into the ground, sending shockwaves of pleasure through her body. There was a loud crashing sound as the walls of the shop began to crumble. The pleasure in Elvie's body built to a fever pitch, her legs kicking small craters into the pavement around the shop. She could hear screams from the people around her, but she didn't care. Let them watch. God knows that they'd enjoy it.  Elvie began to scream in delight as the cold air of the outside world shocked her naked body. Every sensation that she felt dwarfed any sexual experience she had ever had previously. Her magnified voice echoed throughout the down as she flipped over, crushing a nearby parked car. \"Oh. <i>FUCK</i>! she screamed. Her back arched as she came, and she lay on the street, a massive satisfied grin on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god,\" said a voice from near her head, \"is that you, Elvie?\" She looked up. It  was Hazel; Elvie drew herself up to her full height. Her friend barely came up to her ankles. She said, in a booming voice, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hazel...\"</span></div></div>",

She moved through to her kitchen, toweling her hair; her dressing gown was a little snugger than usual. Looking into her fridge, Evie contemplated what she wanted. Her stomach gurgled. She needed something quick. After extracting a large packet of ham. Soon she'd eaten that.<i> Huh. Still hungry.</i> A block of cheese was soon to follow and a whole pack of yogurts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie repeated the process a couple of times; soon she'd emptied it. Finished gorging, Evie let out a womanly burp and excused herself. It was strange. She moved through to her living room, more sort of waddled; she'd eaten too much, and curled up in her armchair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrushing her hair, in the sun streaming in through the window, she began to feel very dizzy again; her limbs were also beginning to hurt. However, it passed after about five minutes.She picked up a book, she was very conscious of, for some reason, her hips were feeling awfully squashed in the chair. She turned a page and noticed the green tint had spread across her fingers. \"Must be the shampoo\" she muttered aloud. She pulled her gown across her breasts.<i>It must have come undone.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach rumbled loudly again....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her rather rude awakening had left her tired. Her eyes slowly close; lulled by the warm sun on her face, Evie dozed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight rubbery sound was beginning, to which the sleeping Evie was oblivious. Her legs slowly bulged and lengthened with minute creaks. The dressing gown parted a fraction as her boobs swelled from beneath. Evie's still damp hair uncoiled from the hair bobble as it gained length and luxurious volume<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStil asleep, she groaned and stretched out on the chair. As she grew more, her panties were starting to feel the strain. They dug into soft flesh of her nether regions causing a sleepy gasp of \"Oh!\" from recumbent girl. The more sunlight soaked into her skin, the faint greenness spread across her body- from the toes and fingers upwards. Soon, her whole left arm had succumbed to the green hue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden swell in Evie's hips was enough to jolt her awake as her panties dug tightly in and, with a loud \"Shrrip\", the larger Evie was lying on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She tossed the slightly sodden and torn pants into the bin with a little embarrassment, but it was okay she'd had them for years. <i>Must've put on a little weight.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie dressed herself in jeans, tighter than usual, and a woolly jumper. In the bathroom, she brushed her teeth; they looked altogether a little- sharper? On the plus side, her hair was having a good day! She bounced through to her kitchen, popping downstairs briefly to pick up the post.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach growling again, having slept off her earlier meal. Chewing her way lightly through a large bowl of cereal, she flicked through her mail. <i>Bill. Bill. Bill. Junk. Catalog. Junk. Ooh.</i> Evie dumped her bowl in the sink with a clink and plucked a banana from the fruit bowl on the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slit the envelope with a finger and read. Finishing her banana she set the letter down and threw the peel at the bin- it missed. Starting on an apple she pondered the letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an invite to Tom Docherty's 21st birthday. He'd been her best friend at school - part of their \"uncool\" crowd of two - but since he'd gone to Uni and she'd got stuck here, they'd grown distant. She checked the date. <i>Of course</i>.

Evie buried her face in her hands and ran, pushing the crowd apart with her increased bulk, out of the flat. The crowd dispersed, seemingly quite pleased with themselves. Tom loitered briefly and sheepishly in the hall, before slipping out of the flat. He hurtled down the stairs, hoping to catch her. Practically tumbling into the street, he looked for her, severely out of breath. She had gone. <i>Fuck.</i> He'd go around to her's tomorrow and try and sort it.

She wiped her eyes again, mascara running down her face. \"Bastards *sniff* all of them.\" She buried her face in her knees again. <i>It's all because I'm getting these fecking growth spurts.</i> She blew her nose. \"I'm growing like a weed, but why!?\" Her teary eyes widened in revelation. <i>Like. A. Weed.</i>She looked at her green tinted arm.<i> That's right! things got weird after i got splashed in those chemicals and fell into those...</i> She got to her feet with difficulty and went over to the display she'd fallen into earlier. She looked down. <i>Venus fly-traps.</i> She poked one of the mouths with a greenish finger; it's jaws closed slowly. Evie sniffed again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her arm again. <i>...And this must be chlorophyll.</i> She then subtly gave her new bosom a heft upwards. <i>Oooh.</i>  Evie sat back down. <i>Weird, yes. But, at least it explains why I'm growing - god I'm so hungry - so much.</i> Then it dawned on her. \"Hey\" she said out loud \"I'm growing!\" She ran her hands over her new body. <i>I've always wanted to be taller...bustier...maybe people would notice me then</i> She paced a little. <i>People wouldn't push me around... or make fun of me! And I would call the shots!</i> \"I could get anything I want...\" Evie's stomach rumbled loudly...</span></div></div>",

Her heart was pounding and her stomach was full of butterflies. <i>Am I going to do this?</i> Again, she was seized by a flush of embarrassment and rage; her eyes were welling up again. She strode over to her sink and inspected the plant food. <i>Miracle-Grow.</i> It was extra strong stuff; it needed a great deal of dilution. Would this work? In fairness, it wouldn't be the weirdest thing to happen of late. <i>What if this goes wrong though...would it kill me?</i> Her eyes unfocused for a moment. <i>I don't care too much...no-one does.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping her eyes, she removed the cap and hefted the container to her lips. She began to gulp down the liquid with forced gusto. It actually tasted ...<i>Pretty good!</i> As she drank and drank, Evie could feel  the liquid filling up her stomach; sloshing about. The liquid had spilled slightly and ran down the sides of her mouth and from her lips, trickling down her chin as she gulped more. It was becoming hard to breath, but she kept drinking, draining the container. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dropped the container to the floor, gasping for air. She wiped her chin on her sleeve and licked her lips greedily. <i>I could actually go for more of thaaaa-</i> Evie's train of thought came to an abrupt end as her stomach began groaning loudly. <i>Oh fuck!</i> Her body was burning, particularly between her legs. \"Ah\" She dug a hand into her crotch; she moaned out loud. \"Oh fuck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, she saw her legs lengthening and her hips flaring outwards with loud creaks; tearing the seams of her tights. She attempted to pull off her already figure-hugging skirt, but she was bulging too quickly- it was stuck! Grunting and straining Evie unbalanced herself and fell to the floor; more creamy flesh was becoming visible through her navy blue tights. The straps of the shoes she had been wearing burst open under the pressure and her feet soon freed themselves of their nylon cage, stretching themselves larger. The, rather expensive, tights gradually peeled off with a sporadic <i>sshriip</i> as Evie\u2019s legs stretched; beginning now to adopt the green hue of her arm. She pulled herself upright with the help of the shop\u2019s counter. Standing uneasily with her knees together and back arched against the ceiling, it dawned on her that her legs had grown, and continued as a matter of fact, but the rest of her had yet to catch up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat grows next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her!? She was anything but! A pair of verdant breasts bounced free in their lushness. She, Evie Bloom, was a growing sunflower - for the purposes of metaphor alone. She was big.

However, it worried her not, for she hardly tasted the food, and no people had dared to approach her yet.<br>\r\nAs Evie finished swallowing most of the meat exihibited in the window of the buthcers' she felt a strange sensation overcome her. She was still ever so hungry, and it forced her to go inside the shop.

She once again began to pull meat to herself and quickly devour it, even faster than before. Her hunger forced her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she felt a strange feeling across her body, and as she stopped eating for a mere second, once again found herself swelling. Not randomly, but all over her body. In a unexplaineble mad laughter to herself, she continued eating, slowly swelling in the process. The growth felt like burn all over her body, but she kept eating and eating, not even thinking about where she stored all of the meat. When her growth forced her the lean her spine the the back wall of the floor, and her legs stretching outside of the shop, pushing a mailbox out of service, Evie noticed a sink behind her. In a masocistis joy over the burning feeling she smashed the sink, and began to let water rain all over her. She forced her head down to the fountain of water, and drank like never before. Of course this added to her growth, and as she, kneeling on all four as she was in this position, felt her back hit the wall, she finally smashed through the ceiling.

They could see nothing inside the building, for the air within it was filled with a thich cloud of dust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a massive force from the 1st floor of the building, smashed a big crack in the walls. The people fearfully stepped back. Suddenly, Buthcer McKennon, came running out from the now clearing smoke cloud, screaming. The people quickly followed him with their eyes, only to return their attention to the smashed house. They could now see more clealy into the building, and inside they saw... legs? Two giant legs?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did not get to think about that, before a new force, tore through the 1st floor, and a second later the crowd saw a sight they would never had imagined.

Her self confidence had only been supported by the few police officers whom had attempted to stop her rampage across town. Like the first one, they had simply been stomped under her green feet. She wasn't strong enough to crush stone walls without effort, and she wanted to force very little of that out. Instead fragile things (fragile for her size, that was) like street lamps, giant signs or cars was smashed out of her path. From time to time she'd stomp some of the insects around her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Evie found herself in a situation, somewhat familiar. All people in a large diameter around her had fled. And she right now stood between a small park, and a large butcherym with several trucks of raw meat waiting to be brought out. The park had a pond roughly the size of her upper body, and the butchery's trucks were all abandoned. Evie felt a urge build up inside her. Being this size was amazing. \"Just imagine what i could do bigger\" she said to herself in a joyful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie didn't hesitate.She quickly kneeled into the parking lot with the trucks, and began to tear open covers of the first truck. She then used her massive hand to scoop meat into her mouth from the truck. She hadn't noticed her hunger until she'd begun eating again. She hadn't bothered to count the number of trucks, and as she finished the first one, she quikcly continued to the next. Two, three, four, and when she reached the 12th and last truck she felt a thirst in her throath, beyond any she had ever felt before. She quickly got up, and ran to the pond in the park across the street. She splashed her entire head down into the pond, and gurgled drank the water. It took her a little less than a minute of swalling before the water height was down to lower than her head. She slurped the last of the water into her, and rolled onto her back, satisfied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the burning feeling once again rose across her skin. Her body slowly expanded once again. She once again enjoyed it in a masochistic please. She grew and grew, slowly griding the grass below her away. When burning finally stopped, she could feel the fence from both egdes of the park. She rose up to her full, height, and noticed that she had at least doubled in size. She was now around 100 feet tall. Once again she glanced at the city around her. \"How to entertain a goddess\" she gladly told herself. </span></div></div>",

Then she found something strange going on. Her hunger was still there, even though she had just consumed large stocks of meat, and drunk most of a lake. But it wasn't normal hunger. Normal hunger was irritating and exhausting. This hunger more felt like a constant tingling in most of her upper body. And in her head an instinct that wanted her to search for food. Nothing she had ever experienced before. She took a look around her. There wasn't much edible around her. She couldn't even spot a butcher. But she wanted something solid. Something juicy. She took a look at the distance, and spotted some motion far away. It had to be people. A growl rose from her stomach, and suddenly an idea entered her head. A cruel grin came forth on her lips as she began to walk towards the troubled insects far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor everyday in 40 years old Barneby had sat in his garden next to the small road in the edge of town, and looked over the endless landscape, as he relaxed to his morning coffee. The road led to a bumpy old hillpass, so not many used it, which left Barneby in his peace. This morning, however, countless of panicking peoplel, both in cars and on foot. Barneby didn't let it bother him. He just grunted at the commotion, and proceeded drinking his coffee. Irish Coffee of course, the best way to wake up. Even though Barneby wasn't a curious man, he couldn't help but to suddenly take interest when people began to fearfully run amok, leave their cars and simply flee. He didn't bother to actually ask what the trouble was for. Then suddenly, out of nowhere, the magnificient morning sun disappeared above him, when a looming shadow covered his house. And when Barneby looked up to see what it was, he spat out a whole mouthful of his drink, when a colossal, green-skinned girl, who well looked like one of the girls from his secret stache of adult magezines was towering above his house. He got up from his stair, and backed towards his hegde, as she with a dim smile stared across the increasingly panicking mob. Suddenly she got a look on him, and her smile grew slightly, as Barneby stood paralyzed from the mere sight of this being. Then with a single step foward, she broke the west wing of his house with her foot, kneeled down and grabbed him with her mighty hand. And with a similar move, she put him in his mouth. Barnebys last words was a tired scream, as he was bitten in two, inside the giantesses mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't even a good taste. Almost metallic and sour. Yet the warm wet yet sticky feeling of blood gurgling in her mouth was dlightfull. Now she felt truly like a goddess. The kind of goddess who was naturally superior and full control of her fearful worshippers. And even though there were little worship from the screaming mob below her, she still felt as a power above them, who now took its payment for them being near her presence of power. In a number of bending swoops and lumbering steps, she managed to get her hands on five people. They felt like little dolls in her hand. As they screamed and by nature fought for release of her grab, she stuffed her mouth with them. Once again the combined sadistic feeling of sour warmth in her mouth pleased her. She repeated that move numerous times filling her mouth with 3-6 people each time. In the process se of course stomped a great amount of her things in her wake. After about 28 people had ended because of her hunger, she suddenly felt a rush of energy, an entirely new feeling. She gussed that it was plant respirational process in a mutated format because she proberbly was half plant and this point. It tickled not only every muscle in her body, but as if every little piece of living being she was tickled, that including her vagine. Over the sudden rush of pleasure, she fell right on her bottom, leaving a crater in form of her ass. When she finally came to herself, Evie gazed at the world around her, once again finding that there was a empty spot in her unplanned daily schedule, what to do what to do.....</span></div></div>",

For what did she spot, mashing its way through the many abandoned cars with giants tanks and armored vans? It was a small heavily armed force. It looked like one of those elite forces from a action movie. What had they plans off, attack her? She was a giant, what coukd they do? In her anger she took a heavy kick, sending numerous cars flying the approacing vehicles direction. Most of them didn't hit anything, some scrapped, but a single one impacted straight onto an armored vans front, tipping it greatly. With such suddenly all the millitary vehicles went onto hold. A tank aimed at her. She stared down onto it. Then, with no warning, it shot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact from exploding bullet felt as if someone had beat her with a baseball bat. They hit her just above her bosom, near the left shoulder, and had it not been for her own fast reaction she would've fallen right on her back. The pain was nearly unbeareble. <br>\r\nSuddenly a great revelation came to Evie. What had she been thinking. Her bubble burst, and reality flew into her head. She was big, but she was just a big freak, whom had annoyed the world, and now they had sent take care of her. She was no goddess. She hardly managed to think of more, before and additionally 2 shot impacted her, just above the belly and on her right leg. This time it forced Evie to her knees. Crying over the panic she saw that numerous men were leaving the vehicles, lining up with machine guns, aiming at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie had to act fast, and that was exactly what she did. After a split second of blind acting, she managed to bite down the pain, and jump off the road. The jump ended in a roll, as a hill next to the road let her tumble down. Once again she panicingly rose halfway and tried to  ake a run. Numerous shot attemtped to hit her, but the lower terain she had reached, and her newfound movement allowed her to dodge most of those shots. When the bombardement has stopped and Evie had a nice jump ahead, she began to regain her feelings, and felt the afterpain. She noticed she was bleeding (or at last some purple-ish liquid was depleting from her body). She ran over the hileld landscape of Ireland, just wanting to get away<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

Eevn though she was rather soaked in it, she found a new feature of her mutation, being that her wounds quickly closed. However what was the point. The millitary would've proberbly already had begun to follow the great footsteps, left behind by her massive stomping figure. She was afraid of tank shells would begin to fly her direction at any time. She was no goddess, just a big green freak, waiting to eventually be wiped out. She felt tears of fear rise in her eyes. When she wiped them while still sobbing, she suddenly got eyes for a most blessed sight ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess than a quarter a mile ahead of her, lied a rather large farm. However, the farm was not what rose her happiness. It was the three enormous silos standing near its fields. If she could get her hand on those she could possibly get bigger! Maybe even big enough to match the millitary that surely soon would come for her. There was no time to waste. She quickly got on her feet and walked towards towards the farm with a rushing speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe farmpeople didn't have much to say to Evies encroaching presence. Most if not all of them fled in terror. This however didn't bother Evies attention, as her main goal was the silos. There were three. Two large ones, roughly half her size, and the last one reaching her knees. When she reached them, she quickly grabbed the top of one of the big ones, and with a mighty pull, tore it off. Jackpot! It was full of conserved corn. She was pleased it hadn't been..... fertelizement. It was possible she was part plant, but she would have to be MUCH more plant, on order to go that far. \"Enough thinking\" she said to herself, and began to stuff her mouth with the corn. Evie hardly even chewed the corn, and sank it whole, before the next handpul would be forced by her hands into her mouth, as if it was a natural process to fill herself up. She felt the corn bumping into her stomach filling up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, all of a sudden she in pure awe stopped. Food began to drop from her mouth as she was petrified by a sight. The two large silos she had planned to eat from both were blank metal barrels. But the third silo had words written on it. Evie found herself silently saying the words to herself: \"Miracle-Grow\". The same liquid she had been pouring down her throat this morning, was right before her, only a barrel roughly a fourth her size. A malicious grin appeared on her face, as her goddess thoughts came back. With no hesitations she removed her attention from the corn, and with hands shaking in exitement, tore the top of the silo. There it was. The currently most beautiful liquid she could imagine. With a great headbutt, Evie dived her head into the silos contained liquid. She drank and drank, not caring an inch if she was drowning herself. Her stomach began to feel full, but she went on. When the container was half empty Evie felt as if she was about to vomit. A loud burp flew out of her mouth, and could proberbly be heard for miles. Then she mustered the mentality to go on with drinking, even though she hardly could have more room in her stomach. She tore the silo of its foundation, and began pouring the liquid onto her head, spilling much in the process. When finally the container was empty, Evis stomach felt like a pudding. She fell over, and was sure that she would puke this time. With all mental might she could muster she held it back. Then finally it came. She felt the growth.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow big does Evie grow</span></div></div>",

That included the straight outcome of her chowing down the large quantitites of Miracle-Grow. Her torso, not her arms, head lower body, breasts or anything, just her torso began to not swell, but bulge. Bulge into a large ball. It grew and grew, and soon Evie couldn't see her own feet. When finally her torso reached the size where the she couldn't see anything but it below her it stopped growing. Evie felt as if she would explode. Then a slight shake filled her body, and the as the torse began to return into her former slim stature, she felt every muscle and nerve in her body blasting with the burning, stretching feeling that had hit her the other times, only stronger this time.<br>\r\nEvie grew again. Her body enlargedned, with every part of her body following. She stretched her swelling figure, and her growth quickly razed most of the farm which had hosted her. And it didn't stop. On the contrary, she kept going. Further and further her body swelled. Evie felt pleasure, and once again found herself slipping her finger up her strecthing legs towards the middle of her legs. Her body grew, pushing the very land below her aside. As her spurt came to an end, Evie rose up, and got herself a foothold, to measure her new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gas station manager from the road not far away had a boring life, as not many cars passed by these days. He had the last few days taken a look at the large farming facility in the distance wondering if any cute girls lived there. But today his interest was vastly increased, and as he stood outside his station and awed at the sight that came from the farm. The \"cute girl\" he had though about had appearently showed herself in a vastly unusual way. Because In the distance, and gigantic green skinned, extremely well proportioned figure had risen from the farm. As it got on its feet, The manager simply stared as he felt slight tremors from the giantesses steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Evie had gotten cockyheaded before over her size, she doubted that would happen again. Because what else but goddess could she truly be acclaimed as now? Her size was truly unbelievable. The ruins of the farm giant farm below her seemed like a Lego structure to her. Evie stood nothing but a mighty 500 feet tall. Around her was widespread landscape. Before the very same land had seemed eternal and desolate to her, but now she easily percieved all around her. She could even spot a town in the distance. With no greater reason, Evie stomped the ground below her, and actuall felt the land below her shake abit. What would anyone do to her now.

For a maximum of 2 giant steps of her, stood the very same millitary unit who had previously shot at her. Evie faced herself its direction and a dirty smile came from her mouth. As Evie raised her gigantic legs to walk towards them, in order to take her natural revenge the entire unit began starting their vehicles and turn around, having from the distance figured they didn't stand a chance at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't get far however, for after a single minut of motion, the giantesses they had previouslt challanged stood with one leg of each side of them, the vehicles began to pull in random direction, each seeking their individual escape route. With a few jolly steps, Evie wiped them out stomping on multiple vehicle with each step.<br>\r\n\"Bow insects! Bow before your godess\" she yelled. When she had wiped 2/3 of the unit out, she saw that the remaining few had organized themself and drove towards the city nearby, however neither they would escape. For in a mighty jump Evie casted her entire giant figure towards them, and after a few seconds of free fall, landed spot on with her colossal bosom, smashing the unit into oblivion. <br>\r\nThe eath shook from her impact, and her large figure left a grand mark in the landscape.

He had gotten up, eaten his breakfast, and sat down prepared to get some paperwork done, when he suddenly had recieved a emergency call about a certain problem which had started this very morning at the outer border of the city of Dublin. He had been called in to coordinate the uncoming front against the problem, which seemingly had the most ridiculous description he had heard in his time in the UK millitary: A giant green woman. However it was his job to deal with these kind of matters, and as the mentioned giant had been seen, he had ordered a small group of offensive vehicles to take down the target. He didn't see any reason in tactical mass-destructive attacks for this strange thing, even if the target had been confirmed to be around 100 feet tall. <br>\r\nHowever as the current hour had passed something unexpected had taken place. Just a few minutes ago, the unit had found and re-engaged the target, but as suddenly they had started to call for a retreat, and before they had time to explain why, radio connection had begun to scramble. Then after a minute of barely understandeble, panicking sounds, all connection was lost. Furious the general had begun to order everyone at the base around.<br>\r\n\"What happened to the unit! Were they taken out, and what did? Do we have multiple targets! What happened to connection\" He had been yelling at his employees. <br>\r\n\"The unit was lost, cause unknown\" a young woman sitting by the radio operating device had said in a serious tone.<br>\r\n\"THEN GET SOMEONE FROM INTELLIGENCE DOWN HERE WITH SOME ANSWEARS\" The general loudly boomed, seeing the situation was getting out of control<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later a tall man with glasses came down from the Intelligence Team. He was map filled to the edge with documents. He stopped on the opposite side of the table from which the General and other mission commander were operating, and saluted the general. <br>\r\n\"Intelligence Officer Mannsling reporting in, sir\" he said in a respectful manner.<br>\r\n\"What do you have for me, sonny\" The general said expectingly. \"What knocked out communication?!?\"<br>\r\n\"Block of signal sir. A object of imminense size blocked the radio waves from the unit\"<br>\r\n\"You're telling me were dealing with two things, and the new one bigger than the current problem?!?!\" The general said stressed<br>\r\n\"No its.... more like the former threat which engaged the units, and thus blocked the signal\" He said calmly<br>\r\nThe general sent a strange look to the intelligence officer. \"I dont see where you're going, boy? The things is big, but not that big\" he said<br>\r\nThe Intelligence offcier sank, and a nervous look appeared on his face. He then took a few documents out of his map, organized them and took a serious look at the eagerly awaiting mission commanders. \"I think it will be easier if i just brief you with everything we've got our hands on up in Intel\" He said. The commanders took interest<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Mannsling began explaining, the generals face slowly became more and more sweaty from the stress that spired within him. The threat he had been assigned to fix had appearently started when a old lady had called the police of dublin about its presence. However the problem was not that. The problem was that the first time the creature had been spotted it was around 20 feet tall. It had then been seen going into a building, only to crash out later, having at least doubled in size. Ultimately, the area the creature had attacked became desolated, and the next time someone got sight of the creature, it was the originally reported height of 100 feet, which the unit had attacked. The creature had escaped, and the next time civilians had spotted it, it had attacked a large farm. Here the creature had consumed large quantities of food from the silos, and had since then, only been seen by the unit at fearsome size of 500 feet. The growth it had gone through had left the farm completely desolated. <br>\r\n\"So..... what you're telling me is that we have a 500 feet tall monster walking freely around Ireland\" The general said in his most calm tone.<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir\" Said Mannsling<br>\r\n\"And from your information its..... seemingly getting bigger with small timespans?\" The general asked<br>\r\n\"It would seem like that sir\" Mannsling replied<br>\r\nThe general had looked at the big screen which showed visuals of cameras on jets going for the creatures location. The base in Ireland had sent them out to look for the lost unit. After a short while the monster came into view. As much as a disaster they had on their hands, The general couldn't help but notice that the creature was extremely beautiful.<br>\r\n\"Were awaiting orders sit\" said on of the lower officers<br>\r\nThe general gathered his thoughts, preparing for a radical decision He then...</span></div></div>",

A silence of shock went through the room, with a few gasp being heard.

Nonetheless Evie enjoyed looking at the panicking insects below her, as she literally towered over a large portion of the town, even in leaning position. She'd have loved to play goddess again, by eating humans, but at this point her hands would not be able to catch humans without grabbing large amounts of other stuff as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Evie heard loud soars above her. She lifted herself up, and saw jets patrolling the area around her. Suddenly a powerful explosion touched her bag. A short while ago, it would proberbly had hurt to the point of breaking bones on her, but now it more felt like a annoying smash in the back, delivered by a lukewarm kettle. It hardly touched her. She turned around to see a millitary jeep like vehicle loaded with 2x2 missile launcher, with 1 hole empty. It would've have taken someone dumber than a moron to not figure this one out. Still, the jeep had annoyed her, and she changed her direction towards it. It with a slick manuveur turned around, and dashed off in full throttle. Evie stretched herself abit, before beginning her pursuit of the jeep, slowly coming closer to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had followed the jeep for a while, she found that it was much faster than she had anticipated. She actually, had to walk relatively fast after it, despite her colossal legs passed miles in less than minutes. When she almost caught up with it, she had reached a lake leading into the ocean. On the beach, a ship was anchored with a open hangar. The jeep reached the ship and climbed the hangar cover. The ship begin to close as it prepared to leave the coast. Of course the ship had hardly pulled up its anchor before Evie towered above it. The ship was twice the size of her feet. So with a great step, she sank the boat, turning it into a ruin.

With a blank expression he took a look at the gigantic lady, sobbing in the lake having just crashed a stealth battleship worth millions. \"It has to be stopped.

And to that she had not taken much of her current situation serious. She found more pleasure than ever in being this big, and had once again let the thought of superior power get to her. This time, however she had passed from monster to colossal monster, and had felt pretty sure she was safe from now. She had however never expected what she saw now.<br>\r\nOf course she at first didn't knew what the speeding light approacing her from above was. Another jet she had wagered. But when it seemingly had no intentions at stopping while it charged towards her, she quickly deduced what it was. What else but a nuclear missile was worth anything against her now? The millitary had to do SOMETHING, right?<br>\r\nAt first Evie didn't really know how to react. She just stood stared into the sky, thinking what the hell the army was thinking with nuclear missiles at all. Then when she could begin to hear the rocket approach, she began to panic. She had heard that nukes had cleaned citys bigger than London in the past. Maybe she was big, but no way she could survive power like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a increasing rush of fear, Evie snapped out of thinking of consequence, and began thinking of action. She looked around her, for something, anything to hide behind. There was plenty of cliffs on the left side of the lake, but none was big enough to shelter her. Ultimately she deduced that there was no cover, until she noticed the rocket, now even louder and closer than before. Suddenly it seemed like all sound disapperaed from her ears, and turned around, dashing out into the lake. When the lake reached knee height, she heard the lone sound of the rocket just about to impact. She took a deep breath and with a jump, she flew several feet out into the lake, and smashed into the water below, waiting to the inevitable exlosion. <br>\r\nSuddenly a powerful light rose from the lake shores, and a powerful shockwave followed, creating stream that pushed even her. Then suddenly a powerful burst of heat ran through the lake quickly increasing the water tempeture to many times boiling water. She felt herself getting burned, as the heat also began to affect her. The burning feeling moved through her body, penetrating her skin. It was many times more painful than the semi-unpleasent feeling that had come before her growth-spurts. The burning kept going and going, until she completely passed out of from the pain. A single name passed before Evies eyes before she had passed out : DEATH....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

She was floating in the former beautifully blue lake, now a pond of mud and smelling ooze, and dark as coal. The nuke had turned the land around in into a wasteland, as long as she could see. Evie got up on her feet, a process that hurt more than any extended excersize she had ever done. Her entire body was creaking and searing. As Evie took a look on herself, wondering how she had survived the damage, she found out why. Her former lustrous hair had been seared of to the point where she hardly had any more than a burnt bush on her scalp. And her formerly curvy and beautiful body was not nearly as flawless as she remembered it. She was terribly thin. Her pretty new breast and butt at the most, along with most of her body, were now hardly any more than skin and bones. And to that, her skin was charred It was almost tearful to her how.... well... ugly she had become from the damages the nuke had delivered. The only thing that kept the tears away was the fact that she WAS ALIVE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie thoughtlessly began to march through the destroyed landscape. She didn't really knew where she was heading, but she kept going. Every step was painful to her. A horrible pain had arisen deep in her stomach, a kind of reverse feeling of what she had felt when she had last grown. Maybe it was some kind of hunger. She had to be hungry at some point with all that growing right? Not like there would be any food for her. What would even happen to her if the millitary found out she was still alive, if they didn't already know. Evie pondered over these things, as she walked towards her own unspecific goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, after a while of walking Evie found herself towering over a large field of crops. Possibly wheat. Evie noticed that she had also gotten smaller after the explosion. She was now standing around 350 feet, if she had to guess in round numbers. Evie was eternally so tired. With a sudden bump, she fell over and landed on her stomach. She felt like sleeping and......</span></div></div>",

Evie couldn't fall asleep now - but she was exhausted, she could almost feel herself deflating, sapped of strength and life. Her heart beat quick and hard in her chest. She exerted a titanic effort to haul herself up; she managed to clamber to all fours. Her body screamed with pain; great tears wet her face and stung her. She didn't want or ask for any of this. Evie's massive hands clawed impotently at the ground beneath them; she wormed them into the warm damp earth; it felt so soothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tears were practically leaping from her eyes and drenching the ground. The sobs wracked and shook her frame. She sniffed and licked her tears. Looking down, she flexed her hands under the ground; the pleasant tingled from the ground was spreading up her arms. In her chest, Evie's heart banged and thumped. She relaxed, letting her huge haunches pressed into the loamy soil of the field, bending the barley. Evie moaned deeply. \"Mmmmm\" Evie felt her strength returning, she felt a prickling on her scalp. An inquisitive hand felt her thick and luscious red curls beginning to regrow, before plunging back into terra firma. Her burns melted as flesh at first slowly but then violently swelled. Her cuts and rips knitted together like threads. She was pleased to see her bosom beginning to swell and blossom again; her backside was once again filling out. She rubbed her hips into the ground, deeper and deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie's eyes snapped wide open. She yelped with pain. It felt like chronic toothache. Evie clasped a colossal hand across her mouth. Her eyes welled up again; her jaw hurt so much. A spam of pain streaked up her spine, she arched her back and screamed. She gasped; as her mouth gaped out, Evie's jaw cracked like thunder as it snapped and elongated, becoming more pronounced to accommodate the growth of her teeth. Her pearly whites lengthened and became drastically sharper, razor sharp blades - her bloodred tongue, long and flexible, whipped across her them. She shook her head violently, resplendent as it was now with her red mane of locks. While blast from the bomb had ravaged her colossal bulk, the fallout was only serving to exacerbate the problem and exaggerating her mutation - her body was warping - it was overgrown and becoming out of hand, wild even! She ground and gnashed her massive new jaws. Her teeth were gritted with a screech like metal, as the growing pains shot through her arms. Her arms grew longer and longer - green spines sprouted from her forearm. She extricated her hand from the ground watching it stretch and twist themselves into monstrous claws. Her legs stretched out behind her, burrowing and boring into the ground - her strength was returning more and more. Evie straightened up on her haunches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe extended a claw and bit it delicately - cackling unpleasantly. Her hair had become rampant; she wound a massive lock around her hand. Her hair snaked its way, from her hand and around her elephantine bosom; worming its way up her cleavage. From her hair's end grew a bud. Evie watched greedily as the bud bulged and swelled, bigger and bigger. From the bud burst a plant head, almost cartoonish, all fangs and tongue. She felt another tendril coiling its way around her waist and another slithering between her legs and around her left thigh - it felt sensational. Evie grinned evilly and extended a claw, tickling the chin of the plant-head, which chirped and squealed as it continued to grow. \"Aren't you just the cutest!\" she simpered indulgently. She leaned forward and planted a wet and sticky kiss on the plant - craftily it slipped her the tongue. Evie pried the pant off her lips and beamed. \"Oh you're a naughty little minx aren't you missus!\" In turn, the plant grinned impishly. Evie relaxed and squeezed her breasts together provocatively. \"How about you get nice and big for mummy!?\" She felt the pressure around her thigh and waist increase as the tendrils thickened - she gasped. \"Oooh\" Resisting the urges, Evie rose to her feet. The monstrous girl towered once again - she was back on top! Perhaps she wasn't as big as before, but she was three times as nasty! And that whole size thing was a work in progress! Butterflies fluttered in her cavernous and, crucially, empty stomach. She bit a claw. \"You wanted a monster!?\" she cackled with relish \"Well you got a monster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Evie whipped her tongue across her razor teeth, face uplifted to the sun - her new ivories glistening wetly. Her verdant expanse of bosom cut magnificently against a scudding of clouds across the sea. She suppressed the discomfort of acid reflux's gastric volcanism. She scanned the landscape, narrowing her eyes to accommodate for her change in perspective. Her buds were ravenous; saliva dripped from colossal jaws. They squeezed her flesh tightly in a lusty embrace that seemed to urge her to gorge herself - the tendril coiled around her thigh licked her green skin with its rough and sopping tongue; the sensation was cooling and invigorating. She unconsciously clutched at a breast and massaged and kneaded , biting ruby lips with her pearly fangs drawing drops of greenish blood, and squeezed and worked. An enthusiastic tentacle snaked its way lithely through the fissure of her cleavage and around the other titanic breast. Rapaciously the bud licked and kissed at the rising mountain of bosom. Mad will greed and desire the blossom sank its teeth into her ripe, succulent and perfumed flesh. Evie shrieked in surprise and alarm, snatching the bloom as it hastily retreated. She grabbed it by the rough approximation of its neck and glared at it, baring her teeth. The appendage writhed and thrashed in discomfort. Evie gritted her jaw and clasped harder and harder with her mammoth claws - the bud squealed with what could have been pain, but could be a chirp of pleasure; it's extended tongue lolled stupidly from a corner of its mouth. Evie could feel her own heart beat pulsing in the vine, she could feel her own tightening grip, faster and tighter. She felt the shaft of the tendril pulse hotly and seem to engorge. She could feel the little traces of quicksilver pleasure in the well of her gut that telegraphed the unstoppable rise - her body creaked like a sequoia in the high wind. Evie reluctantly relinquished her blossom. <i>Couple of extra feet right there!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could return to her thoughts, Evie's stomach rumbled and resounded like seismic activity. Her elephantine foot moved across the landscape, propelling onwards her voracious body with a insatiable and eager gait. Her monstrous moved powerfully and purposefully as impossibly Irish blue eyes fixed on domiciles. Drool splashed to the ground in rivulets from the gnashing and hungering blossom jaws. Evie's stomach Grrrked loudly like an avalanche. Her eye's glinted with avarice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA horse meandering in a field was snatched up and crunched in a maelstrom of soil and teeth; the massive slobbering jags leaving a gaping sunder in the field where it had indiscriminately gobbled. The mouth gulped greedily; a scarlet tongue preened rock, soil and horseflesh from its teeth. A similar fate befell multitudes of livestock: little clouds of sheep were tossed in the air and swallowed whole by a blossom-head; cows were swept from grazing pastures and obliterated in a flurry of mastication before they had a chance to react to their change in space, velocity and existence - the other bovine citizens were dimly aware of the hovering set of fangs which gnashed with relish - sanguinary and resplendent - before plunging into their midst once more. A particularly brazen young worker in a field valiantly plunged a garden fork into the pulsing red tongue. A slight moment elapsed before the tongue whipped to the side and licked him out of existence.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie' felt satisfaction welling up inside her, mentally and anatomically, she felt more alive as her body gorged and combed. Her titanic stride brought her to the outskirts of the village. Her questing and ravening flowers scoured the landscape dispassionately gulping anything they saw fit: livestock; plantlife; fencing; the odd tree; a tractor; two scarecrows; dogs; several tonnes of soil; street signs; people; a washing line and half a motor-home - Evie's new physiology coped marvelously with this! Her stomach burbled and groaned as lakes of violent gastric fluids churned and digested the miscellaneous harvest. Evie's eyes widened and she stifled a belch that probably registered on the Richter Scale. She breathed out, now looming over the buildings. Her massive elongated hands rested on and massaged her stomach. \"Phew! Go easy on Mummy, girls!\" She boomed with glee, patting her stomach while casting her glance across the various rooftops; the little figures darting and tottering around, scarcely and inch tall to her. She raised her eyebrows and communicated in a tone of surprise \"Really guys? I'm not THAT big!\" she cocked her hips to one side coyly, \"You should have seen me earlier!\" She thundered, almost in disbelief. Suppressing another seismic burp, she continued. \"But back then I didn't have the help of my lovely ladies!\" She giggled throatily and strode into the town limits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Evie knelt down next to a building, a rather sprightly home. Craning down, she curiously peered with one gargantuan eye inside and tittered with glee \"I see you!\"...she brought her cyclopean blue eye closer to the trembling inhabitants. Eyelashes thick as a man's arm batted flirtatiously. \"I won't hurt you...\" she oozed soothingly, bringing her immense lips up to replace her eye. \"Much...\" she trickled as she bared her monstrous teeth. Owning to being roughly ten times the size of this particular house, Evie had little difficulty in prising the roof off as she might once have a biscuit tin. She inspected the roof interestedly for a moment, took a bite from it, chewing thoughtfully as her new maw made short work of slates and timber. The O'Boyles, a large family, cowered as the gazed up at this overgrown woman munch curiously on their roof. Mrs O'Boyle had covered the \"boys'\", striplings of 23 and 20, eyes to protect them maternally from the horror and laterally from mighty projection of the woman's heaving naked bosom. The colossal young woman spat delicately as a giantess can over the roofs before carelessly tossing it aside - screams and carnage could be heard elsewhere upon impact. Her huge face came closer, she grinned unpleasantly, a stream of saliva bucket onto poor Mary. Unfixed from their fear the family scattered and made for the front door - only to find it blocked by the girl's massive knee. Thinking fast, Mr O'Boyle spearheaded a charge for the back door, through the kitchen. However, the towering lass was also rather bright and from her lofty view had seen this and had accordingly maneuvered her other knee to obstruct passage - her massive form hug the house, the family could hear her heartbeat from her massive warm thighs; they could her her stomach churning and groaning above them. Helpless the family clustered together. A elephantine claw ripped though the ceiling like cardboard. An amused giggle came from the sky. The Boyles were together as a family as they were scooped up; dangled momentarily over a mouth that gaped like hell and swallowed alive. Evie gulped and grinned brightly.looking down at the house between her thighs she pondered momentarily. With distressingly little effort she strained briefly and the house was squashed to fragments by her thunderous thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, her blossoms contented themselves ransacking and devouring anything in the vicinity. One flower gnashed its way into the local grocery store, thrashing its tongue in and around, lapping up anything before Evie hauled it from its purchase like a curious dog because it was impeding her progress. As Evie's figure passed it, a blossom chewed off steeple of the church; boring its way into the church in a melee of teeth and timber; consuming the congregation ruthlessly. The others tactically snatched and plucked stragglers from around and beneath Evie's feet. By no means thorough or meticulous the vines guzzled anything they could find or that particularly arrested Evie's senses, gulping almost as much concrete and plastics as flesh and blood. They surged and pulsed with bloodlust and hunger. Evie's stalking gait haltered momentarily...another squalling eruption was fought back, this time blowing out her cheeks with the volume of ventilation. \"Jesus...\" she rubbed her stomach \"Not used to this new diet, so!\" she exclaimed happily. Her calamitous footfalls continued until a rather large building caught her attention - presumably a high school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie gruesomely repeated her teasing routine, this time at length. She left great sopping, sticky kisses on the windows; treated some floors to an ecliping view of cleavage thereby - cracking the panes when the immense crush of breast flesh pressed against the building; her apple coloured flesh spilling in through broken panes. Evie picked boys and girls up for tete a tetes. She squinted at some boys and brightened in revelation when she spotted peculiar mixtures of fear and arousal. \"Ha! you'd have to be a whole lot BIGGER to ride this!\" she gesticulated to her couched leviathan hips and thighs. She then, depending on caprice, popped them into her maw, sometimes chewing, sometimes gulping down eagerly. Evie picked something from her teeth thoughtfully, before snatching up a girl at random. As brought the girl upwards she mused out loud, \"Y'know girls, I really is better to swallow rather than spit!\" She giggled naughtily. Evie brought the girl closer, \"I heard it makes your boobs grow!\" she exclaimed emphatically. The girl slipped from Evie's fingers, which were slick with spittle. \"Whoopsie!\". The girl landed on one of Evie's mountainous mammaries. Evie continued \"That must've been what happened to me!\" indicating her tremendously oversized form. She lazily eyed the brown haired girl spreadeagled on her breast. There was a time she'd have thought this girl was big! She must, at a rough estimate, be going on 6,6, and...growing very well indeed with a chest like that! Evie relished her next breath, watching her bust expand and swell underneath the dripping girl. Excitedly, she went on \"Did you girls ever do that silly exercise? ...I must, I must, I must improve my bust!?\" she boomed hysterically. Evie straightened her reclined posture, projecting the prow of her bosom outwards like a jade edifice. She mockingly sang again though the laughter \"I must, I must, I must improve my BUST!\" she hefted her behemothic boobs up as she chirped the last word. The poor girl was bounced skywards by the heaving of the giant girl's bosom. Evie's gaiety was somewhat perturbed by the development of stomach cramp. She huddled over in pain, biting her bottom lip. She grunted and clambered to her feet with support of the science block and stood awkwardly; she thought she might explode; sweat beaded on her brow from pain; she clutched hard at her stomach which was visible distended - the buds had been still eating and eating and eating! The air was cleaved by a calamitous disgorge that knocked out a few of the school's windows. \"Evie straightened up to her full height as the episode subsided, \"God, you people do NOT agree with me!\" she rubbed her stomach tentatively and just as she was gathering her thoughts....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her oceanic blue eyes focus on Catherine, second to biggest, after herself. In those eyes of blue, deep blue, swimming in mists, the blue flame crackles. O! Anna, Mon Ch\u00e9ri! <br>\r\nClimax.  All dissolves and melts away in dewy, dreamy creaminess, splinters of blue and showers of gold. The mists cloud once more; here we go round the mulberry bush, the mulberry bust: here we grow round the mulberry bust on a cold and frosty moaning\u2026Scarlet on green, blend and dissipate; breath-taking stilted trees of ivory all shift and fade in the fog. The songs of the Liffey sirens echo and reecho, vibroverberate their mirthpeals in still mist; freeze solid and shatter, resplendent! Snatches of echolalic melody and fragmented temptations of voluptuous form fall like rhinestones and hail down on a blue void.

It happened that he\u2019d been standing in silence for around fifteen minutes, his megaphone periodically offering crackling feedback. He shook himself and looked at the giant girl\u2019s face. Her eyebrow rose. He espied that she seemed to be preening the inside of her mouth with an immense tongue. Her sweet and aromatic breath washed down the street in waves, tinged with the rancour of death. Many of the men had seen this reported on the news - although, she'd seemed smaller on the streets of Dublin. Apparently the threat was deemed too large and some sort of foreign military action had been taken - much to the distress of the Irish government. When it actually came to confronting her, she seemed much larger than in theory. Her huge blue eyes trained on him with amusement. Her impossibly radiant red lips parted, \"Well,\" she thundered, almost sleepily; beginning to rise, \u201cthis has been a scintillating chat, little people, but -!\u201d Still on her hands and knees, she stopped and her face froze, clouding with discomfort. Her brow knitted and one hand tentatively felt her stomach, before returning to earth to support her massive bulk. Seeing his chance, the megaphone was raised again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess\u2019 body was wracked by a brief spasm. He began his oration anew, with revitalised vigour; the crowd watched the giant woman enthralled. Her stomach groaned like continents colliding, her huge fingers grasped hard at the ground. He continued his address oblivious; some more astute members of the audience bolted. Her tremendous form convulsed and lurched, like she was going to vomit. The rabid and voracious vines had wound themselves around her frame. Her teeth bared themselves and clenched. Realisation came soon to him; the megaphone click off with a whine. The giant woman convulsed and contracted again. With this lurch she seemed to bulge in prominence, again came the involuntary heave and sure enough came the carnal inflation. She began to loom more and more over the street as she huffed she huffed and she puffed and she blew up in size \u2013 Quit it! She put one in mind of a green balloon; she may as well have languorously popped her thumb in her mouth and inflated herself breath by breath. She was wracked by a spasm again and heaved; she was swelling so much, so BIG! With each surge her head grew higher and higher and higher, her eyes still fixed on the crowd, which was dispersing \u2013 apparently disheartened by an increase in her size \u2013 if she continued to balloon in size at this rate, the ground would soon dwindle. He could not be seen to abandon though; he was enraptured and transfixed in her ever-stretching shadow. She groaned and breathed deeply only to be stretched larger. As the voluptuous giantess continued to billow in form with each convulsing surge she began to rise to her skyscraper legs. An outstretched hand crushed a terrace of houses because of the abrupt increase in its owner\u2019s size. She fell back on her haunches, cushioned by their monolithic plumpness. Cushioned briefly, before her she was projected skywards again by her monstrous tumescence, her face was becoming obfuscated by an empire of bosom, which rose and fell and rose and rose magnificently, as she sporadically inflated in height. She climbed again, steadying herself against the last eruptions of stature \u2013 lest she sprawl across the town- Up and up and UP. Goddess rising indeed! She stood once more upright, straddling many streets and blocks, house and church alike, perhaps twice the size she\u2019d been before. The giant girl swayed and tottered precariously with vertigo \u2013 would have thought she\u2019d be used to it by now! She lowered her lovely head from heaven high. Dave despondently looked at his megaphone and tossed it aside, he stretched his arms out in front of him, cool and collected, breathed\u2026then he ran. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Evie's face loomed over the street; her razor smile fissured across her face once more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enormous, fragrant, and  extremely well-endowed florist, one Ms E. Bloom, has once more appeared in Dublin's city boundaries, now increased dramatically in size and apparent appetite since last encountered by Irish authorities yesterday. The consequences of any reprisals from E-B- are, as you can imagine, unimaginable. The young woman's intentions are: revenge (1) , with her carnivorous blossoms and incredible size she can swallow and crush anyone, and to increase in size, a serious problem presents itself if an already gargantuan Ms E-B- amplifies her current stature.(2)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWomanly and Floral are E-B-'s two main attributes, and they are both interdependent, and the immense size represents less an intersection of these attributes than an unconscious collision, voluptuous and colossal and insatiable. E-B-'s estimated height is in the region of 120 \u2013 150 metres (400 - 500ft), compared to her previous 15 metres (50ft) and to the national average for women, 1.65 metres (5,5 ft). Using Ms Bloom's proportionate increase in size is it possible to speculate upon her weight, presumed something over 40, 000 tonnes. (3) Her size is considered anomalous even midst conjecture that womens' heights are constantly increasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to information gleaned from a certain online democratic encyclopaedia (4), E-B-'s physical appearance resembles most closely that of the Venus Fly-Trap, Dionaea muscipula, or other carnivorous plants. (5)  For practical purposes, everyone knows what this entails, perhaps more or less depending on interests and vocation. Taxonomically speaking, plants of the aforementioned species are characterised by 'a flat, heart-shaped photosynthesis-capable petiole, and a pair of terminal lobes hinged at the midrib, forming the trap which is the true leaf. The upper surface of these lobes contains red anthocyanin pigments and its edges secrete mucilage. The lobes exhibit rapid plant movements, snapping shut when stimulated by prey.' (6) In their, and habitat of the subtropical wetlands the 'bear-trap' mechanism of the plant's maw is used to ensnare, digest, and consume organisms in order to facilitate the growth process. (7) The genus name, Dionea, refers to the goddess of love Aphrodite, reputable famed for immense beauty. Whereas the species name,  muscipula, denotes the Latin for 'mousetrap'. The traps allegedly secure the doom of their prey by a process known as 'acid growth'; a process which, as far as can be divined, involves the maw of the plant growing while holding the morsel inside, the stimulative correlation is easily likened to sexual arousal in women (8), and from the resulting acidification of its 'mouth' digesting the prey. All this and more is right there in the encyclopaedia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nE-B- has less in common, say, with the similarly carnivorous Pitcher Plant, Nepenthes, which hang, from tendrils and entice pray into a deep, liquid-filled, cavity. This is an incorrect analogy for E-B- because: A) E-B- would have to have swelled to such a size, and in such a way, as to resemble a gigantic, floral, pelican, with a grossly disproportionate stomach cavity and mouth to allow her to gulp down whole detached houses into a sea of gastric juices: whereupon she would digest; from there, grow even larger and, enlarging done for the moment, apply herself once more to shovelling her voidlike mouth, dredging the city. B) E-B- is clearly possessed of teeth, huge ivorywhite blades, which she would have no need for should she consume pray in vacuous gulps. (9) Though Evelyn Bloom shows characteristics typical of a carnivorous plant and exhibits a ravenous appetite, it is commonly asserted she is a vegan, testified by specialists in this field (10) and the passengers of a bus whom E-B- has just this moment consumed. E-B- arguably has much in common with the Sequoia tree, Sequoiadendron giganteum. (11) Though they are both of colossal size, E-B- being nearly twice as big again, the typical Sequoia is very slow growing. Ms. Bloom has remained an average of 5 ft 3\" for 21 years, but has of late grown very rapidly. (12)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe point is that Ms Bloom is basically a giant, growing, plant-woman. (13) It should be said that \u2013 particularly after adding over 100 metres (several hundred feet) to her height and putting on a little weight in all the important areas \u2013 E-B- is surprisingly pleasing to look at. (14) E-B- is arguably more substantial and voluptuous than most women, so too is Christina Hendricks; their shape curvy wasps and hour-glasses compared to pencils and lollipops. (15) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo then here is a question that's all but unavoidable confronted with the Ireland's largest woman, and may arise in media coverage across the world: Is it all right for Ms Bloom to to swallow, or chew, a sentient creature alive for her gustatory pleasure? A related set of concerns: if not, what is to be done? Is the question irksomely PC or sentimentally narcissistic? Will E-B- consider vegetarianism? How big is too big? Is the whole thing a write off?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Others speculate that girlish fun is the aim: the childlike way she squashes pedestrians like grapes ; the bright glee she bristles with as she pops people into her mouth and chews, wide-eyed; the heavenbells of her giggles and the sporadic utterances of whimsical 'Whoopsies' and coy references to 'Big girl now' tropes. <br>\r\n2. Suggested means include, but are not limited to: ingestion of organic matter; absorption of water/liquid and photosynthesis.<br>\r\n3. Unsurprisingly then the 123 bus  from O'Connell Street was ill-equipped to manage such applied tonnage from Ms. Bloom: cracking like a nutty, blue and yellow, beetle under her sole; lifting metres into the sky as her foot came away; a impish smirk just distinguishable on her face.<br>\r\n4. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivorous_plant\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivorous...</a><br>\r\n5. Her unending appetite would also support this<br>\r\n6. vis. Ms Bloom's semi-autonomous blossoms<br>\r\n7. Alone in the boggy hinterlands Ms Bloom gorged; digested; gradually swelled with each meal, successively outgrowing sustenances: gnats, dragonflies, frogs, fish, otters, herons or deer. Her hips flared fat like bog-cotton on quagwater. Ms. Bloom grew and grew, rising bigger and bigger from the sucking mire; her reach extending with her flexuous shadow: grown too large now; overgrown; needing more; looming tall. Note the way in which the driver of the [Well-known automobile] was just consumed: dangled briefly over her oral oblivion, huge tongue extended and lolling: sublime slavering jaws dripped.<br>\r\n8. A colloquial name for the fly-trap is apparently derived from its likeness to female genitalia. <br>\r\n9. As evidenced in a colossal bite taken from a nearby building; swallowed with some difficulty; rooting around and producing a clutch of human sweeties (candies) in her hand like a bear crushing a hive, paw sopped in honey, she sucks her fingers.<br>\r\n10. Academia moves quickly<br>\r\n11. Ms Bloom halts motionless, excepting a gentle swaying of her incredible frame; the lightning-head of her bust electrifies, rises and grows with a sharp intake of gelid skyair, bouncing faintly, as Ms Bloom clutches to the nebula of her gut: the sound of storms brewing, fulminating, and shuddering in the sky echoes...<br>\r\n12. Convulsing slightly, her cheeks billowed with an eructation of; bwwgrrruuroosooeivaaaaskaasaacheereesereehehehiehp' ,  into the sky, a thundering belch, clotted with low cloud, which clove the sky, shook Ms Bloom and the vicinity: Ms Bloom gently rippled bigger in the thundercloud burp, by a fraction of her lofty pitch. Newly re-inflated, Ms Bloom's bosom deflated as she breathed out a gust of hot air, which turned to icy clouds at her lips' altitude. <br>\r\n13. Dionea creverit giganteas<br>\r\n14.  Until she opens her mouth, which occurs too regularly with the increased traffic: her elegantly defined and prominent jaw conceals a colossal, ivory, bear trap or bin-lorry. It is true she is indiscriminately omnivorous, biting and swallowing animal,vegetable, mineral, elemental and theoretical all with equal gusto: the conventional partition between edible and inedible being thin at Ms Bloom's height. Or so we think now. Up until sometime yesterday morning, though, Ms. Bloom was a confessedly fussy eater, possessed of a particularly conservative palate. Even in company when on the Dublin restaurant scene, it was assumed making Ms Bloom eat anything other than lasagne and strawberry ice-cream would constitute cruel and unusual punishment, like making people eat rats. The reason for the increase in Ms Bloom's appetite is clearly rooted in her increased amplitude. One source describes Ms Bloom in terms of 'colossal epicurism', including accounts of Ms. Bloom's ability to consume the merchandise of grocers and butchers, and of her ingesting huge quantities of store-housed food \u2013 each of these instances preceding, and presumably catalysing, an apparent growth spurt. <br>\r\n15. Ms. Bloom and Hendricks are expected to capture the imagination in a series of photo-shoots for plus-size lingerie, depicting the latter joining the ranks of the ladies of considerable size as Ms. Columbia ( Lady Liberty) combating a colossal Ms. Bloom. Owing to the fact E-B- is younger than C-H- and the aforementioned gluttony, it remains doubtful E-B- will be the same size for long, potentially set to increase in size by as much as an estimated 479%, or more, between then and now. Ever the gracious lady, C-H- has decided her 5 ft 7\u201d frame ought to be suitably augmented to correspond to, if not surpass, that of E-B-. Health and Safety organisations fear the ingestion of growth-inducing reactants by C-H- to coax her body into ballooning to such tremendous size could present the problem of 'a colossal, mile and a half tall Christina Hendricks: concerns are held that she would then continue to grow uncontrollably.' There is some scepticism over the benefits to be had from two immeasurably tall buxom redheads...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This whole interchange takes place near the N4 west of Dublin, 17th June, during Ms E. Bloom's striding once more into Dublin's city limits. Several irreproducible segues down the road from a discussion of the physics of Ms. Bloom's growing odyssey, Dr. L. James \u00e2\u0080\u0093 whose daughter, a modest 5 ft 9 inches, works at the Hadron Collider in Switzerland \u00e2\u0080\u0093 explains what he and his family feel is the crucial element of the whole Ms Bloom problem: 'It is possible to attribute this young woman's (1) exponential amplification, of physical size; weight and volume, to dark matter. Dark Matter composes some 84% of mass in the universe and 23% is luminous matter, of which the young woman in question represents a small but increasing amount, the rest is attributed to 'dark energy'. (2) Though these dark particles do not interact strongly with other particles, when particles of Dark Matter collide they annihilate one another emitting \u03b3 radiation. It is the interaction of this cosmic radiation with the absorbent properties of lead-based paint,  or the like, and then the subsequent contact with the young lady is believed to have triggered the mechanics of her growth \u00e2\u0080\u0093 explaining why nuclear armaments have served only to exacerbate the young lady's size and temperament. (3) From this point of contact, there is a definite transfer of Dark Matter to luminous matter, namely, and exclusively, the young lady. Growing near constantly, the young lady should continue to accrue mass until she dwarfs the city by comparison (115 sq. km.) From there the Country (84, 420 sq. km.) and from there British Isles (243, 000 sq. km.) Once the young lady achieves continental prominence and mass (10, 180,000 sq. km), it will not be long before she becomes a global phenomenon (510, 000, 000 sq km.) Where dark energy plays a part is in this seemingly infinite expansion of her body, for presumably once larger than a planet the young woman will grow too large for both the solar system and the galaxy (4)  Dark energy filters through this young lady, accelerating her expansion; she is glutted with dark energy; clamouring for eternal expansion of her body. For this reason I suspect her size is illimitable or infinite. Logically, once of a certain mass, this young lady will begin to readjust the proportions of dark matter to luminous matter, of which bloominous matter will then constitute a significant amount. The young lady, I fear, will become so vast as to literally fill up all space available, to the maximum capacity of the universe. All dark matter will be squashed and smothered by the eminent and ubiquitous presence of luminous matter, of which 100% will be bloominous matter. She will become all, too big to accommodate the finite. If we add on the young lady's original, pre-growth, height, she will be larger and bigger than the boundaries of the universe by that margin. It is at this point, the young lady and the everything she has crushed with her incessant growing will simply crush herself with her own mass. Unless the strain and force exerted by her incalculable size proves too much for the universe, and shatters the confines, too powerful to pen her, and bursts free from the limits of the universe, fragrant hot flesh spilling out into nowhere.  Presumably the next will be founded on her continuously expanding soft skin. The Big Bang once more. (5)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe above information is fact and grounded in scientific study, research and investigation. However, As you know if you've seen Monsters vs Aliens, Little Shop of Horrors or Attack of the 50ft Woman, there can be multiple explanations for Ms. Bloom. The best way to describe the sonic and visual environment of the outskirts of Dublin is: Imagine that a burlesque club took the form of the apocalypse. She is pornographically huge: larger than any woman has any right to be. A starlet hitting the big time, pumped too large for the wide-angle lens. The towering Ms Bloom moves through the fractal maze of buildings, striding over them in groups of three or more where possible. Once a woman grows to such a size, they are all in the nude or else in drastically abbreviated tatter/bedsheet/advertising banner ensembles. Heels are uniformly lacking, not needing much in the way of apparent height. (6) Pylon cables strap garters and stocking to her immense thick thighs as she swans and graces along the city outskirts, airy billowed, pneumatic, bosom shades the anteriors of domiciles. (7) Ms Bloom stretches her legs wide, thighs gaping in the manner of Hell opened to Christians (8), her 79m legs straddle the road, supporting massive superstructure hips. Her prodigious size defies some very basic precepts of physics. The coils of her red hair are flowing and complexly labyrinthine structures. She slaps a hand to the left buttock of her prodigious rump, swatting a seagull. In the rippling cold breeze, Ms Bloom convolves the two dirigibles zeppelinesque chest; clutching them in an attempt which evinces to her their proportional increase in volume relative to that of herself. A 10m long red tongue extends and is used then to moisten Ms Bloom's red lips, catching hot saliva which leaks and oozes from her jaws; large drops splish onto her right breast as she looks to the east. She stoops, breathing deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sweet, nutty smell lingers in the area. Thick and odd. Her eyes light to the east, with curiosity. Calamitous footfalls resound as she locomotes her 44 tonne and 520 ft body on the compound. As you may or may not know, Ms. Bloom has approached the proximity of the Guinness Brewery, founded 1759 by Mr Arthur Guinness at the lease of \u00c2\u00a345 per annum for 9000 years; covering around 64 acres.  Ms Bloom sniffs the air , smiling over the storehouses. Ms Bloom like all good little catholic lasses allows herself a tipple from time to time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.

This has served to bolster the arguments of those opposed to Nuclear Power in the wake of 2011's nuclear disaster in Japan.<br>\r\n4. the expanding soft flesh moons of her rear colliding inevitably with planets and debunking and bouncing them from orbit and her cleavage engulfing the sun and snuffing its radiant nova, her hair caught with snared asteroids; her mouth crunching up moons and inhaling planets; her extended tongue peppered with wandering comets; her buttocks dimpled with unnamed planets, pressed into her cosmic flesh as they were pushed ever to the edge; insatiable black holes slip between her parted lips; heavy neutron stars are forced from fixation by a universal swell of tight bouncy breast flesh; drawing the universe closer to her curvaceous graviton hips; her great attracting bosom; her lovely indefinable head; sucked in an annihilated or shoved away, embedded...Universal expansion and a half...<br>\r\n5.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The St. James\u2019 Gate Brewery, known otherwise- and more commonly - as the home of Guinness Draught, named after Sir Arthur Guinness (1724/5 - 1803), which therefore attributes the name of The Guinness Brewery to the building, has garnered much worldwide fame in the course of its 254 year history and has, since 1838, been Ireland\u2019s largest brewery (1); this then throws the brewery, in the circumstances now presenting themselves, into collision and contention with Evelyn Bloom, who is most probably Ireland\u2019s largest woman, or at least the largest to take the stage for some time now. (2)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoosing then to approach the brewery by a circumlocutory route, stalking on her huge, long, legs round the skirting walls of the brewery, with dull booming footfalls, Evelyn Bloom comes to the St. James\u2019 black gate entrance (3) - this, while doing a fairly good job of excluding from the premises the average pedestrian or would be troublemaker, is less than effective in excluding a woman of such lofty stature from gaining access to the inner grounds. Lifting and crooking her leg, her thick and soft flesh of her thigh bulging and rounding as it squashes together in a warm crease at her knee with the more taut flesh of her calf,  she straddles widely over the wall into the ground, and her gigantic, dry, warm sole presses down, after a journey through the air, to the concrete inside with a rumble and the ground spider-webs underneath with a splintering sound as the elegant, though huge, foot comes to bear more and more of the giantess\u2019 weight. Though she easily clears the gate, her other foot on its rise and following journey to join her other foot, catches and destroys the gate in her expert clumsiness in a cannonade of dust and twisting metal;  her foot continues to drag through the surrounding bricks and mortar; her foot emerges from this little snag, after a tug from the colossal girl, attended by tumbling masonry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the storehouse, workers (4), taking the advice broadcast on the radio, some 14 hours earlier, that the best way in order to outlast the present feminine problem would be to seek refuge in a sheltered building of some fashion, preferable with healthy supplies of alcohol, and wait until the whole thing \u201cblows over\u201d, at this present time apply themselves to quaking amongst barrels and barrels of porter. They have, naturally, been made aware of the encroaching enormous female presence via the radio provide by a worker\u2019s phone, and which continues to detail the actions of the giantess as she casts about the brewery grounds, but should this have failed, what with reception fluctuating in and out of intensity, as it so often does, Evelyn Bloom\u2019s close proximity would have been telegraphed by minor tremblings and quakes in the ground, which accompany her footfalls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn Bloom casts her huge head hither and thither, her red locks and ringlets swaying about her face, occasionally drifting across her face as a cobweb in the wind, deep red tresses flowing to and fro; thin ropes of hair adhere here and there to her face, plastered there by sweat and her fringe shades her searching blue eyes as they cast across the landscape around her feet: now Evelyn angles the inflated fuselage of her body forwards to better examine the surroundings (5): her while porter sloshes viscously in its casks in the squat buildings which housed them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rivers of saliva, which on occasion have been seen to drip from Evelyn Bloom\u2019s jaws to the earth in sticky, hot plumets of rain, have receded somewhat on account of a thirst growing in her mouth and throat; a thirst which finds its source in the phenomenal volume of water needed to simply fuel Evelyn\u2019s growing body: she licks her lips and flexes her tongue in her mouth and cracks her jaw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is assumedly because of this thirst Evelyn Bloom\u2019s body now inclines itself towards a storehouse, presumably piled high with wooden kegs, causing her huge dirigible breasts to quiver in the sky while casting a deepening shadow on the warehouse, catching the sunlight on their crests which light up and draw out the struts and traceries of veins under the balloon membrane of her green skin, like colossal gooseberries, threatening to swell larger like thick green rubber. Evelyn clutches her huge hand across her breast, biting the corner of her lip, feeling the oilcloth of her skin stretch as she breathes in deeply; as the sunlight bathes it, her chest rumbles and cracks moodily, like thunder in bosky, green clouds: her eyebrows arch as she feels her breast, oddly swollen (though perhaps not so oddly given her current expansive habits) and tender; full like the casks in the houses, she could almost hear herself sloshing with juice; she could feel her mouth waking up, flooding gradually with saliva. (6)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, her monstrous green leg is hefted into the air and comes to land, with a boom, on the western side of the storehouse, so as to cause Evelyn Bloom to straddle the storehouse. She then stoops again (7), bringing her huge head down and closer to the rooftop. the better to inspect, unimpeded by, say, low hanging cloud or even a vast profusion of breast flesh; her haunch, grown massive, protruding into the sky; a helicopter, previously swatted at, swerves to evade the swelling green moons. (8) Her face hovers over the store, fixed in the inert, almost paralysed, half-smile, exhibiting an array of high, jagged peaks, the pallid yellowish, off-white of timeworn ivory: these veritable pearly-gates are now of such a size, post exacerbating of Evelyn Bloom\u2019s mutation, that they force her mouth to bare them, more or less, at all times; making talking somewhat complicated: several times she has made to do so and bitten her long, lashing tongue, a which which had only become more pronounced as she, and her teeth, had grown bigger. From these heavenly mountains, surrounded by the leaking the mists of her breath, came dripping one clear river of slaver, then another, sparkling from the red root of her tooth, and then several, in quick succession, falling in downpours and gushes onto both her chest and the roof below, in hot deluges: inside, the workers could hear the colossal plashes on the roof. Evelyn Bloom draws her elongated hand, tapered like a willow tree, across her mouth to abate, for now, the torrent of drool her jaws seem to produce now. Evelyn Bloom tilts her head upwards, the better to examine with heavylidded eyes the greying clouds of rain beginning to gather, before returning her eyes to earth, and the waiting storehouse, past her swollen bosom.  She bit her lip in contemplation before rounding the thundering syllables through her overlarge teeth and lolling tongue: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. In 1914 this brewery was considered the largest in the world, which presumably would allow them entry into their own book of world records for largest brewery had this phenomenon, at the time, existed.<br>\r\n2. After having written this, it has come to light, through the diligent use of a certain democratic online encyclopaedia, that Evelyn Bloom is, beyond a shadow of doubt, the biggest woman in Ireland. <br>\r\n3. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://briansworldtour.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/st-jamess-gate-dublin.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://briansworldtour.files.wordpress.c...</a><br>\r\n4. A few in as many as 22,000 worldwide<br>\r\n5. She is faintly myopic <br>\r\n6. How do plants (and Evelyn Bloom) grow? <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.plant-and-flower-guide.com/images/how-do-plants-grow.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.plant-and-flower-guide.com/im...</a><br>\r\n7. It is a wonder Evelyn Bloom suffers no back pain from hefting, roughly, 1500 tonnes [confirmation needed] of \u201cballast\u201d in the form of her immense bosom, this is to ignore her immense weight in general. <br>\r\n8. Miss Katy Perry is quoted as having said, according to The Sun, therefore twinged with a certain degree of hearsay and conjecture:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I remember really vividly kneeling by my bed as a nine-year-old, saying my prayers and asking God to give me boobs that were so big that if I laid on my back I wouldn't be able to see my feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wish which must\u2019ve been reproduced in the prayers of a young Evelyn Bloom at her bedside in her nighty, except the Catholic version, which is considerably longer and doesn\u2019t bear too much examination, involves expressing a wish for a set of wide, childbearing hips. Both Perry and Evelyn Bloom must have, on those cold, winter nights, thought themselves quite alone, without God\u2019s attentions or care, because they did not, at that precise moment, quiver, tremble and explode violently in size, bursting their nightblouse with a newly swollen pair of massive boobs, that, as stipulated, occluded any view of each girl\u2019s larger bare feet, heaving gulping of cold night air, standing new storklike legs, head almost brushing the ceiling, breaking into colder sweat; calling out to mum and dad through large red lips with a deeper and throatier, yet softer and dulcet, voice that was not exactly their own; a voice more womanly: seeing their parents reel when confronted by such a grown woman in their place; feeling the tremblings again and hearing their mum shriek as their heads broke through the ceiling because they\u2019d become too tall, and seemed to just keep on growing; getting as tall as the house, arms as thick as telegraph poles and legs like tree trunks; sprouting a veritable gorse of hair hither and thither, having to do their legs with a lawnmower. The impracticality of view-blocking bosoms for which Miss Perry wished is now obviously testified to by Evelyn Bloom\u2019s inability to see directly below her, forcing her to crane and stoop constantly to attend to objects near to the ground and near to herself. (a)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(a) In the editing process, it has been advised, by our lawyer, to admit that God allocated Katy Perry more than an adequate degree of 'boobage' and it should be point out that he in no way 'welshed' upon his deal; secondly that Katy Perry would cope perfectly if she'd continued growing and growing into a 'mega busty' behemoth, as big as, if not bigger than Evelyn Bloom - her statement reads: 'I'm big in Japan anyway so I might as well be big everywhere!'<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The workers of the brewery lie in interior darkness, casked in the comparative gloom of the storehouse. The barrels, piled variously throughout the room, judder and slosh as the quakes of colossal footsteps come from outside. The tremors shake from the rafters jets of dust, which falls and settles on the workers and the barrels, just as a hush falls on the scene. The workers untense themselves slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove the heads of those enclosed within the storehouse, a screeching comes from the roof as four immense claws, perforating the ceiling, pierce own from the roof like splintered bones of some ancient whale, which, having grown to leviathan proportions in antiquity, had long since died and rotted. More screeching as the claws rake through the roofing, shredding the metal and timber like paper; breaking in from these ruptures, left in the wake of the colossal hooks, the light broke into the storehouse, illuminating the workers and the barrels and the kegs sheltering within. The workers scattered amongst the barrels and into the recesses of the storehouse as the firmament of the storehouse was raked again by the immense claws. The roof, having suffered two successive sunderings, was riven by great slashes of outside light, which gave to those inside, looking up, the impression of being beneath the sea and gazing at the surface of the waves as a cloudbreak broke down upon them: the effect of the waves was intensified by the sections of the ceiling where the roofing buckled and warped from the rending and from some immense weight.  The impression was shattered as the roof was ripped and peeled backwards: shards of metal like the hull of a ship came away in the clawed hand and were tossed skywards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe outside light pouring inwards and soaking the interior of the storehouse proved short lived and was soon blotted out by an deepening, looming shadow. Looking upwards, from amongst the kegs, one could see the the sky, dulled with overhanging clouds, quickly eclipsed by a monstrous shadow, a monolithic face, graced with lakelike eyes; a nose like a massif, or a crag splintered from some immense cliff, and teeth like shorn glaciers which towered over the storehouse. Hoving closer, the workers could see about this immense visage a profusion of hydralike carmine curls and tresses, some of which trailed and waved in the air as if of their own accord. Falling from the glacial teeth, came a plumet of slaver like the flow of meltwater. As her eyes adjusted to the gloom her own shadow cast, there came from her throat an amused and silky laugh, which at her size emanated as a sound scarcely distinguishable from dark thunder. This resolved itself into a kind of murmur, which had she been of average size would have been distinguishable as an expression which might be uttered when one was eying something particularly delectable. The face withdrew from close inspection of the store; falling from the air was a flowery and juicy perfume, which mixed pleasantly with the woody smell of the barrels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Workers inside , riveted with fear, saw a gigantic, green thigh crash down and rise high above the western section like a fleshy, thick obelisk, followed soon but the towering of another green pillar more towards the eastern half. An immense clawed hand clutched the wall as the face loomed again. Another claw reaches in and grasps a cluster of barrels in and handful and hoists them towards her face. Detaching her other hand from the wall she picks a barrel from her outstretched other hand and pops it into her mouth, like one might eat a hazelnut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie regarded the little barrels lain out like small boulders across the plain of her palm as she chewed. At first it was nutty and crunchy from the barrel itself, but quickly gushed with sweet liquid; she realised that the sensation was far more like eating a bunch of grapes than eating a handful of nuts. Clutching a few more this time, she gaped her huge mouth and tossed in the barrels and chewed. Swallowing again, it dawned on her that at her newfound heights a real drink would be hard to find; tipping her head back and opening her mouth, she dropped the remaining barrels into her mouth. While chewing, her eyes follow the skittering of the little people below here and there. Swallowing, she reached down again and scooped up a handful, bigger this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several handfuls, occasionally cluttered with people, the alcohol was beginning to affect Evie, her gigantic haunches had slumped to crush into the ground beneath her. She leaned on the foundations of the building, trying to focus on the contents: Evie shook her immense head and grabbed more barrels, practically stuffing them into her mouth. Her lip was tickled by something, which, as it happened, was a worker swept up by her clutches who had slipped from her grasp and landed on her lip. Evie unconsciously ran her tongue along her lower lip, and swept the dangler into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Evie continued to empty the storehouse, the sun broke through the clouds onto her vast, green shoulders. She swayed with intoxication, leaning on the foundations further; her huge and swollen breasts beginning to crush the walls beneath their weight; Evie, still sitting and yet still enormous, hefted a breast in one hand: she bit her lip and squeezed.  \u2018God I\u2019m so drunk...and sooooo big!\u2019 Evie had remained here for over an hour now and she had gathered a crowd of authorities and media coverage. She swatted at what sounded like a wasp or a hornet by her head, the huge lagoons of her eyes attempted to focus on a helicopter whirring near her face. In irritation, she swiped again at the buzzing fly, but the ponderousness of her movements at her size meant the helicopter evaded her and spiraled away by the gusts of air which attended the passage of her huge hand. Grinning stupidly, her eyelids drooping slightly, Evie looked about her, her vision smearing as she turned her head, until eventually focusing again. \u2018Ughh...that has gone right to my -- HIC!\u2019. Evie watched the little beetles of police and fire engines scuttle into the compound and giggled. \u2018You\u2019re all so litt-hic-le!\u2019 She nonchalantly dipped her hand into the storehouse, steadying herself solely by virtue of the fleshy immensity of her buttocks and thighs, and rooted for more barrels. As more vehicles and people flocked, she crunched on the handful of barrels she had scraped from inside. It was odd to her, she thought, how like a finely spun spider\u2019s web the scaffolding draped across a far off building seemed to her, or how the stretching frame of what she thought was a crane came, from the perspective lent by her size, to resemble a delicate mantis, risen up and poised. Her vision began to swim<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie, with a thunderous hiccough, regarded what looked like little, delicate insects flitting here and there. Resounding up from the depths of her gut, causing the stones by the feet of onlookers to jitter from tremors sent through the ground and swelling her chest and her cheeks like a bodily gale as it surge up her gullet, came the thunder of a belch, which shook the sky around her and the ground beneath her, the force of which tumbled members of the crowd to their knees, and from their feet. However, after the rumblings of her eruption had faded from the scene, their persisted a minor trembling in the atmosphere. Evie, the sun flanking her back and shoulders, felt rising within her another fluttering, like colossal butterflies, which seemed to grow and spread, causing the enormity of her bosom to bob and the vastness of her thighs to ripple like the surface of a green sea. Evie, through the haze of porter, planted a hand, flattening some sort of shed, on the ground and rose from her couched position, shatterings of concrete adhered to her buttocks and lifted in the air as she rose, trailing dust and pulverised foundations. Erecting herself to her full and tremendous height, Evie teetered on the her clocktower legs. But, attending this, Evie felt a growing dizziness, and the world swirling into blurred colours: \u2018I think I\u2019m---HIC!---I\u2019M...Hic!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie, swaying precariously on her feet, plunged backwards in a catastrophe of architecture and a woman\u2019s voluptuous body. Now, lying unconscious and supine across the brewery...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The dust clouds, which had arisen from the titanic fall, now resolved themselves and it became possible to distinguish, becoming clearer by degrees, the immense supine form of the unconscious giantess. However, while the dust of her cataclysm dispersed, because of the girl\u2019s size, it was impossible for those on the ground to form an impression of her whole, being able, at any given time, only to view a fragment of her body - some could see a vast and towering, bulwark-like, wall of green hip and buttock; some only the smooth rotundity of a breastflesh massif, the crest of which darkened against the sky, and some could see only, residing between the valley slopes of her bulging thighs, the deep and long crevasse therein, which extended vertically upwards and was crenelated by a forest of deep red curls. Only those in the helicopters high above, an altitude higher even than the girl\u2019s head when she stood at her full height, could assemble a portrait of the giantess, stretched out where she had fallen like a baby on the soft bed of a cot, one leg crooked inwards slightly. He breasts, swollen huge by now, seemed to flatten themselves out, from their usual vertiginous and globular size, like a mesa under their own weight and wobbled as she breathed as if shaken by earthquakes. Set in the midst of each plain of green flesh, her nipples erected by the wind which swept across her from the river and sea, looked almost like little temples built upon the steppe of her breasts. Upon her face there rested a dreamy and satisfied smile and she groaned sleepily and shifted in her tightfitting crater, buoyed up and made comfortable by her colossal rear, a colossal clawed hand came to rest over the warm and faintly curved intersection of her thighs. The hydra-like blossoms of her hair lay strewn among the blanket of soft, auburn curls cast over the street. The giantess sighed deeply and the shuddering filled the sky again. Throughout pockets of the crowd panic and commotion spread recognising the tremblings which came ahead of, what they could only presume was, another growth spurt which would tack on more height and flesh to the girl\u2019s massive body. Instead, the onlookers were elated to see her mountainous form slowly deflating, as if she had blown herself up like a balloon and had only been holding her breath. Slowly, the monstrous crags of her boobs dwindled in their prodigious girth. Hearts skipped as the towering soles of her feet seemed to withdraw from them, as her arms seemed to coil themselves inwards, away from the people. The spread curtain of her hair receded like a fishing net, cast and now being reeling back in. From above, the giantess\u2019s body seemed to ebb  from the lip of the faint crater she left behind, leaving behind an indent of her former expansiveness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Evie\u2019s eyes flickered, but she remained asleep. I opened my eyes and looked towards the canopy stretched out above, through which bled light and this dappled my eyes as I lay there. The forest floor was soft with fallen pine needles and it seemed warm with the life of the trees and I wormed my fingertips into the dead needles and lay there for a while, breathing deeply. In the silence I can hear the forest dreaming, and in the air above my lips I can see my breath, or is it the mist? I should like to die if this was what dying was, close to the roots and the dead earth. Raising myself on my elbows I can see my bare breasts, pale and soft, with my nipples pipeclayed and I am glad they are not longer so huge and glutted; glad to see I am not overgrown. Rising up I no longer feel the same ponderousness of my body as I move, the weighing of my bloated body upon my soul, and I don\u2019t feel the gusts of vertigo blowing across my head as I rise to those heights. Standing, with needles and earth clinging to my buttocks, I run my hand down my stomach and I smile at the daintiness of my hands on my skin. Where the needles lay on the floor, I had become used to seeing architecture and seeing my feet cleave through them as they do through the needles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach tree about me is a dark pillar in the mist, which forms in tiny pearls on the fine hairs of my skin and dampens me. I do not feel the cold; my feet are still amongst the warmness of the needlebed. I walk through the remains of the trees and stand by a trunk; its bark is already wet and black. I bring my hand away and it is sticky with sap and, bringing my fingers to my nose, I can smell the resinous, lemony sap of the tree on my fingers. I look about me, still sniffing the sap, at the labyrinth of trees fading beyond the extend of my vision. I suppose I am probably in limbo here, but I am contented. Leaning against the tree, I  sniff gently the damp bark. Reaching up, I bend down a branch and release it, letting the droplets fly. Against the tree, I shut my eyes and drowse a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom far away I hear a crash tear through the air. I look around but cannot see, while behind me another echoes. I run around the trunk of the tree and strain my eyes to see beyond the mists. The thunderclaps become a chain, one by one and sometimes two in close succession. I see, on the fringe of my vision, a tree sway and topple to the ground. I am screaming, but I cannot hear myself. I can feel my heart bleeding and swelling in my chest, beating like a slowly intensifying like tympany. In my joints I feel stabbing pains and another tree topples; I can see shadowy figures by some of the trees. My spine cracks and creaks and I cry out again. No, no, no. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough tear-blurred eyes, I look down at my hand and I see my fingers stretching longer with crackling sounds and short spurts of pain. I look up and I feel before I see my hand stretching against the dark bark of the tree.  With my heart beating with fear, I realise the branches above me seem closer and that I am becoming taller, the figures seem lower than they did before and another tree come thundering down. I look at the torn stump and rent roots; I look down and gulp as I see my breasts bulging up in spurts which caused them to bounce uncomfortably. To my left, a trees swings downwards and lands near my feet; my feet are creaking as they lengthen and as they lengthen they plough dunes into the soft bed of pine needles. My knees tremble as my legs stretch more; I grit my teeth tight in my head; I feel my hips flaring outwards and I hear the tree I am leaning against creak as it bends; my buttocks are swelling up behind me. I close my eyes and arch my spine as my head brushes the canopy, but I am still becoming taller; looking down at the forest floor, I see another uprooted tree toppling towards me and I put out my arms, which lengthen even as I watch them, and brace myself against the tree behind me; the cheeks of my growing buttocks feel rasp against the bark of the tree. I catch the tree and it is too heavy, but as I strain my burden becomes easier and lighter and I realise that I am still growing and that it appears I am becoming stronger when it is the bigger I become compared to each of the trees, the lighter each tree seems. Struggling, I heave up the trunk of the fallen tree and cast it backwards; I look down and I see the shadowy wisps of the figures scattering. Even as I do this, another tree falls behind me and crashes to earth, in a blizzard of needles; I can feel a branch stabbing into my right bum cheek as the cleft of my ass grinds its way up the damp trunk as I rise. The immense weight of my chest is increasing and and I clasp them and try to halt their expansion. Even though I am arched over, my shoulders begin to break through the sparse canopy above, I reach up and try to spread the branches and bend them from my path. I continue to feel and see my body grow in sporadic surges, like deep breathes, pushing my way skywards through the branches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI keep growing bigger and taller and the figures beneath me, the falling trees and my own elongating feet are blocked from my view by the branches of the trees and all I am left with is a hunched view of my own breasts swelling. Soon I feel my shoulders emerging and I stand up straight; my head is now higher than the serried spires of the treetops. I close my eyes and bite my lip as I feel the stabbing of branches and twigs against my chest as my bouts of buoyant growth bring them to the surface of the forest. I look about; my cheeks are sore with tears; I see the wood stretching further than I can see; I feel myself grow in a bound again, but the trees were falling all across it and, as I become taller, it looks to me like moths are devouring holes in a dark green blanket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI close my eyes and scream and I cover my ears with my hands; I can feel my head bulge against my hands. I keep shut my eyes and groan deeply as I shudder bigger and taller - I cannot see it but I can feel it; I feel my chest burgeon and bounce and I feel my spine lengthen. When I open my eyes I am amidst a sea of black stumps. Alone in the wasteland, the pine tree against which I grew reaches to my hips and the shadowy figures flocked towards my feet and great tears were leaping from my face.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie drowsily awoke on the street. She noticed immediately that she was markedly smaller, smaller but not small, having diminished greatly from her massive size. Groggily, she supposed that the alcohol had dried her out, which must have shrunk her. She attempted to roll over, but could not. Her eyes focused slowly. She had been lashed down to the ground, trussed by long, metal cables...Hmmm</span></div></div>",

She thought she could still be suffering from vertigo; Evie, her blue eyes crossed, was, however, still at a height hitherto only recorded in sagas, legends and historical apocrypha. In the past, Evelyn remembered reading, or hearing, of the body a 200ft woman, who was supposed to have washed up on the shores of Scotland, among the mist and seaspray, beneath the shoreline crags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the Annals of Innisfallen - 906 AD<br>\r\n\u2018A great woman was cast upon the shore of Scotland in this year. She was a hundred and ninety-two feet in length; the length of her hair was sixteen feet; the fingers of her hand were six feet long, and her nose was six. Her body was as white as swan\u2019s down, or sea foam.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen years earlier however, in the Annals of Ulster, this sea-foam skinned woman appears to grow in height by three foot; her hair grows out by a foot and her hands and nose both grow a foot in length; her skin remains white as soft, swan down. It certainly looked as if the chroniclers of Ulster thought that this young woman\u2019s size was seemingly unbelievable and shrunk her down to a more acceptable height:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018The Sea threw up a woman in Scotland. She was a hundred and ninety-five feet in height; her hair was seventeen feet long; the finger of her hand was seven feet long, and her nose seven feet. She was all as white as swan\u2019s down.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe records of this woman, washed up like some female Gulliver, beached on the shores of Evie\u2019s mind now because its consonance with her own situation. Evie had imagined this woman, at the time, crumpled like a swan, crushed by storms, and thrown upon the pebbled beach. Evie found herself considering that this colossal woman would have been probably twice her size now, but not even as much as half as tall as her when she was at her largest. She found it strange to consider, to think about having been so big. Evie pitied that woman\u2019s broken and foam licked body and envied her for her snow-white skin, like oystershell.  She regarded, with a sense of disappointment, the hills of honeydew-coloured flesh before her, which had remained swollen to such a size that they blocked her view of her stretched out body. Criss-crossing her bosom were thin cables in an irregular latticework: hatching her soft and prodigious chest, these cables divided her flesh into areas, drawn down tightly into her, like the twine butchers use to truss meat. Because of this tightness of the cables and the voluminosity of her breasts, the cables, bearing down deep into each breast, created running clefts in her flesh along their length, like valleys and gullies. The sides of these clefts were consequently curved where her flesh bulged to close over and envelop the cable, like some parted sea or the gelatinous yielding of a vast water-balloon, but was unable to do so because fat is not water. Thus, the binding forced the flesh of her flesh to bulge upwards, creating the impression of both further size and firmness; creating several tumescent hills of flesh, swelling up from in between and around the wirework constraints. Sticking upwards, her nipples each resembled clay chimney-pots atop her pale green hills. No doubt occupied her thoughts that, owing to her inability to move, her legs and arms had been similarly bound to the earth. With each breath Evie drew  she saw the cables became more taught and quiver like struck and resonating guitar strings.  They had not tied down her head and she craned her neck to view over the bulwark of her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough not surprised, she was still dismayed by the fact she saw her huge body stretched out before her like a steppe: she had hoped that any change would be for the better, i.e. a return to normal stature. It annoyed her that, while in a sense this was a step in the right direction, she was now more exposed to the antipathies of the crowds - a hurled bottle might just chance to hurt her - and yet seemed to garner as much fear and attention now as she did when she was considerably bigger and less lucid. She had been really quite stupid. Evie wondered if what she was ashamed of, becoming enraptured with growing bigger, wasn\u2019t actually a thing endemic to humans. Did she belong as part of a pattern in social thinking, where bigger was better? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerIsBetter\" target=\"_blank\">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ma...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie, though originally of distinctly average height, was made remarkable by an accentuated hipline, considered immensely attractive on a primal level because it implies child-bearing, which curved outwards from her waist in a creamy ogee which branched into the thick, milky columns of her thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogee\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogee</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie had been a somewhat accomplished gymnast as a young girl because she was small and wispy. However, while she grew her boobs, the ruin of many girls, it was her hips caused her the most awkwardness - suddenly sprouting up and fleshing out out like a matryoshka doll again and again: her hips were not well accommodated by the leotard. The added weight of her lower regions counterbalanced her, her hips throwing her off-kilter, rendering her awkward and clumsy. Her legs arcing and trailing through the air, brought up to above her head, where they would come to rest, before her hips dragged her back the way she came, or worse fell to earth on top of her, her weight buckling her arms, and brought her head and neck down uncomfortably on the matted floor. Evie had little trouble in accepting gymnastics was not to be her calling, for her new hips and thighs attended a newly kindled interest in plenty of other things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExaggerations of this defined feminine feature, for, though it was, hitherto, white and plump her dovelike bosom fitted perfectly with the slightness of her body, her ribcage being compact and slim - this delicacy of form served to indirectly accentuate her hipline, lead to comparisons with bells. Violet had seen fit to quip, not so long ago, that what Ms Evelyn was in dire need of was someone to \u2018ring her bell - hard\u2019, Now, with her hips having, so to speak, broken the iron mould, out of which the molten metal of her body had flowed outwards and cooled as a tremendous iron goddess, it would require a rather heroic feat to ring Evie\u2019s massive bell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.notredamedeparis.fr/local/cache-vignettes/L262xH320/arton466-3d35a.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.notredamedeparis.fr/local/cac...</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen going further, Evie\u2019s haunches received comparisons to the spires Russian cathedrals (what are known colloquially as \u2018onion domes\u2019) - drawing out and further emphasising the size and proportions of the bellringer\u2019s name, albeit mostly approvingly. At this moment, those embellishments did not seem so outlandish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/St_Basils_Cathedral_closeup.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt upset Evie further when she realised that she would probably never find a soul-mate, never get married or maybe worse yet, never have a baby. She seemed to have exceeded the point where being large ceases to be a boon and gigantic breasts, thundering hips and a colossal rear only seem monstrous and grotesque to the average onlooker. She would squash any man not hung with a schlong like an oil tanker. Evie huffed, tears starting in her blue eyes. Her size, changing so much of late, had begun to be, above all, a tremendous source of frustration for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecoming increasingly aggravated by lovelessness and awkwardness, looking about, as best she could, Evie could see one of those blossoms of her hair, though considerably diminished, catatonic on the pavement, it\u2019s long tongue unfurled. She saw too that people were rushing by her face. Tickling on her body meant other people must be scrambling all over her: she attempted to shake herself, but could not move sufficiently. Groaned with frustration, choking back a sob - her vision dissolved from the tears, unable as she was to wipe them. Her wrists strained against the restraints. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at the clouds in the sky, the setting sun turning their fringes yellow. The yellow fluff, curling in snowy peaks and ridges, put Evie in mind of ice cream, cold and rich - in no small part due to the fact Evie, when she was feeling upset, often sought the company of a bowl of vanilla ice cream, several usually and it comforted Evie to imagine, with her head among those custard-coloured clouds, swallowing one and licking the powdery crest from another and how sweet it would taste on her tongue. Evie rolled her blue eyes to street level; idling song way off was, lo and behold, a ice-cream cart, wheeled from its usual haunt by the south banks of the river by the fat gentlemen who stood some way off, methodically smoking and considering the melon-coloured summits of Evie\u2019s constricted chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie felt her stomach rumble, dropping like a depthcharge sinking to the mouth of a trench. She felt pent up anger rising inside her, her eye twitched in the way Violet\u2019s often did, and the confluence of this and the return of a bubbling and fulminating hunger - this then percolated down like raindrops through her emotions to become panic, gathering in a pool in her feelings. Closing her eyes, her breathing slowly intensifying, she tried to think on apple trees and fine rain. But her stomach went again: the sound sent tremors through the crowds around her, and she tried to arch her back. Amongst the fanned locks of her hair, one of her concussed blossoms twitched and retracted its long tongue into its razored maw. In a maelstrom of brittle wood and dairy, the blossom lunged and eviscerated the cart, gulping down the frame and, more importantly, its contents. There came a pause, fractured by the sound of tortured cables and a resounding of a woman's gut. The cables frayed in places, the welts on her flesh grew deeper as Evelyn Bloom gained mass.</span></div></div>",

She looked down as the blossom retracted from a small shed that it had been eating through in a manner that reminisced as a scalded dog limping away. Concerned the giantess reached down raising the blossom in her clawed hand her face showing concern. As she did so the other blossoms seemed to sense something was awry as they paused the glutinous rampages, in some cases mid-bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the red blooms, the peddles that made up the ravenous maw had a brown mark that was quickly spreading as the bloom writhed in pain. Eve for her part could feel the stinging that radiated up from the bloom along the several hundred foot vine. The as the brown colour spread across the broom the withering quickened the blood red pedals contorting and writhing in her hand, the radiating pain causing Eve to grit her razor sharp teeth and mindlessly stomp on the gymnasium of the school that she had been playing with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds the pain reached a crescendo as bloom finally succumbed to the brown rot and in a jolt of pain the blossom feel free of the vine. Eve blinked in shock, her beautiful blossom had been killed! A rage built inside her the likes of which she had never had, looked down at the small shack outside the school greenhouses she had to know what had killed her bloom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping to her knees, all thoughts of the playful games were gone her knees smashing through the brick and mortar school building while her massive claw hands cleared away the glass greenhouses away from the shed in two quick swipes. Dozens of blooms converged on the shed, sensing it as the target of Eve's anger snaking through the air their maws snapping and drooling in anticipation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a moment hesitation Eve reached forward with a clawed hand and ripped the roof off the shed revealing a cowering janitor and several spilled barrels of some substance which had pooled over the floor. Carefully she plucked the man out of the ruined structure and held him up at eye level, her pointed teeth barred, blossoms snapping in anticipation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was in those barrels?\" Eve growled threateningly, her voice reverberating over the man as her long tongue lashed out, showing him in saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFacing Eve's monstrous disposition while hanging between the point of two claws, hundreds of feet in the man when limp, seemingly passing out from fear. Eve let out a sigh of frustration and dropped the man. Immediately half a dozon blossoms grabbed him and tore him asunder. Lowering herself closer to the ground, Eve's massive breasts smashing the ruins of the school and handful of survivors she carefully picked up one of the barrels to examine the label. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weed-be-Gone\" the giantess read aloud as she rose back up looking at the minuscule barrel some concern appearing on her face. She had survived a nuke, but a few barrels of this stuff had killed one of her blossoms. What if the government got wind of this? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if the emphasize the point the stump of a vine that once held the now deceased blossom rose up to eye level but something was different, a pod had emerged where the blossom once was. She watched as the bud at the end of the vine split in two as if in a time lapse video, then the two pods grew, quickly swelling and turning red. Eve could feel the pressure growing in the pair of buds and with a sigh she watched them burst open revealing a pair of new blossoms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of realization dawned on Eve as she dropped the tiny barrel and her clawed hand reached out and caressed the now double bloomed vine, when one bloomed died two took its place. As a clawed finger caressed the hydra blooms they cooed and snapped their jaws in anticipation for what was to come. </span></div></div>",

The image of her body swelling filled her mind, and her hunger gnawed at her subconscious. She awoke with a start, and looked down at her body. She hadn't grown at all last night. At least that was a relief. She stared at her freshly-grown breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be real,\" she whispered to her luscious breasts. She poked at them with a finger, and felt a tingle run over her body. She gasped and released a small, panting moan. She grinned. Her hands flew to her breasts and began to knead them, as if possessed by some autonomous desire for pleasure. She began to feel a swelling, wet emptiness between her legs. \"Oh...oh god, oh fuck <i>yes</i>! She lowered a hand to her wet vagina and began to rub. Her rubbing and kneading became more violent. \"More...More...Yeah...I...\" In an act of erotic inspiration, she raised both of her hands to her nipples and begin to rub at them. She attempted to suppress the ensuing scream, but to no avail. The feeling of her hands on her erect nipples brought Evie inordinate amounts of pleasure, but no hope of satisfaction. She grabbed a pillow from the bed, clasped it between her legs, and ground her dripping pussy against it as she continued to stimulate her nipples.  After a few minutes of furious, screaming masturbation, her body contorted in orgasmic pleasure and she uttered a faint, groaning sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie lay in her bed, the pleasure of her little adventure still surging through her body. She couldn't focus her eyes or her mind. Evie shuddered and grinned. She had never experienced anything like that. She stood up and began to dress herself. If this is what her most recent transformation had to offer her, then she saw no reason to try and deny herself that pleasure. She would follow through with her new self's whims. She thought of what she wanted to do next. She could have  respect. She could have power.  She thought for a moment and realized...</span></div></div>",

She turned on the basement light and grabbed a bottle of liquid fertilizer. She stared at it for a second as she imagined what she could do if she was big enough. She could masturbate with the Dublin Spire. She could crush entire streets beneath her glorious ass. She could get the attention--no, the <i>worship</i> -- that she wanted.

She flitted hither and thither, bird-like, tweaking various floral arrangements, ranging from gaudy harlequins to sober and iridescent petal-crowns. A cup of tea cooled on the counter. Her slender fingers coaxed a crocus from a recumbent dozing. She gulped from the milky tea, leaving a red lipstick smear on the rim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smoothed her skirt over her hips, she puffed out her cheeks and looked around. <i>Perfect</i>. Chewing partially on a fingernail, something caught her eye. A lonesome sprout in one of the pots on the floor. <i>We can't have that!</i> She plucked the tea-spoon from beside her cup and bent down to dig up the little sproutling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shapely hips bumped a pot behind her. The clink of pottery alerted her and snapped her from her tending. She wheeled quickly to catch it. Red hot pain seared across her arm. She cried in pain. The pot fell and shattered into a dozen or so shards. Evie clutched her arm and winced. Red seeped through she white fabric of her blouse. She looked at the offending plant. A prickly customer, some odd and aggressive looking cactus. A drop of blood hung suspended on a spine. \"Why do I even stock this!\" she wailed in despair. Tears pricked and dampened her blue eyes.  Teeth bared in a grimace of pain, Evie rolled up her sleeve. A gouge in her upper arm, a red slash in her soft skin, scarlet on ivory. It seemed surprisingly deep. Evie clamped her napkin, dotted slightly with tea stains, and clamped it to the wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a spiteful glance at the plant, she dressed her wound upstairs in her flat. <i>Christ it hurts...</i> Evie stood up, she rubbed her hips. <i>You girls are nothing but trouble.</i> Grudgingly, she returned to work. She glared at the plant. She extended a finger and tested a spine. \"Feck sake!\" she sucked the finger in disbelief. <i>Right, your fecking gone.</i> She moved the plant to a corner of the shop where she could ignore it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day rolled on and her arm still hurt!

With difficulty she she unpinned the dressing, slowly unraveling it. Evie bit her lower lip in apprehension. Although, the bleeding has stopped substantially, there appeared to another problem developing. The gash, a couple of thumbnails long, has taken a worrying and sickly green colour. Clearly it had become infected. <i>Fecking bush</i>. She squeezed around the wound a bit - eliciting not only pain, but droplets of a greenish liquid - presumably pus. <i>Oh dear, oh dear...</i> She hyperventilated inwardly - for she was always slightly given to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick Farrell had worked in Dublin for many years. In addition to this, he had been married in Dublin and remained just so for many years. He perused the flowers meditatively. <i>Their anniversary today.</i>...<i>The problem is you just can't express how you feel in a flower - not everyone just matches up...roses perhaps?</i> Undecided he maneuvered the veritable Congo of flora towards the desk where the girl was. A charming girl; moontouched skin; heavy dewy eyes; a few rogue slivers of russety hued hair had come loose about her face like fingers of a sweet breeze. <i>Must be about little Mary's age.</i> He reflected often on his youngest daughter - <i>in London, making a name for herself soon so she will.</i> He smiled kindly at the girl. She seemed preoccupied. He hazarded a look at what she had engaged herself with. In her upper arm was a rend in her flesh that she had let turn apparently septic.\"Christ alive!\" he blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie snapped her head up and attempted to hide the offending arm from the little man. \"Sorry! I -\" <br>\r\n\"Let me see that, lass...\" the man interrupted, adding, when she did not budge, \"come on I'm a doctor.\"<br>\r\nUnwillingly she consented stretching out her arm for him to examine. The man peered at the wound from behind round spectacles. He certainly looked the part. \"How'd you do this to yourself?\" he said at length. Her head was quite foggy from the heat of the day and her pathological shyness was beginning to show itself. <br>\r\n\"Uhhh, I grazed it on a plant...I dunno\" The last part came rather sheepishly. <br>\r\n\"You did a lot more that \"graze\" it my girl\" he said kindly, still looking at the wound - there was something quite unusual about the shade of green - not that green was ever a good colour for the body to turn...medically speaking. He went on \"and when did this happened\"<br>\r\n\"Only this morning...\"<br>\r\nThe little old man looked up in surprise. \"Eh?\" Evie smiled awkwardly back. \"Right\" he said \"hang the flowers, we've got to get you to hospital lass.\" Evie protested \"Oh no...really?\" She had a tendency to avoid hospitals -<i> ever since mum</i>- <br>\r\nThe little man had bustled around the counter and was ushering her out from behind it. \"Come on, else you may lose your arm.\" Evie, again, acquiesced...there was something kindly and grandfatherly about the old man. The old man, who it became increasingly obvious was actually a doctor, remarkably adroitly redressed and pinned the wound after being directed to the counter's drawer, where the fresh bandages were. The man conducted himself with a dexterity and grace that Evie wouldn't have thought possible after watching him pottering about the store.<i> Fretting about what to get his wife?</i>...<i>Bet he did something stupid.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This yours?\" the old man said gesturing towards a coat on a hook.<br>\r\n\"Yes\" she peeped. He old man detached it from the hook and quickly retrieved her shop's keys then he slung the coat over his shoulders and hustled her towards the door. <i>Little presumptuous of hm to rifle through her pockets. </i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside was fearsomely hot; Dublin had no business being his hot. Sweat has already began to form on her brow lightly; she could feel her underarms perspiring too - <i>\"Alright for Women\" protects 24/7 against perspiration!... my arse</i>. Her arm, oddly, felt pleasantly cool in the bandages...which, she was pretty sure disobeyed some rules of science. The old man plodded along beside her - he smelt faintly sweet in the hot air. She felt nauseous...she could feel that cup of tea, all she'd had today apart from a biscuit, churning in her stomach. Her head continued to be foggy as he walked alongside the little man, who was wittering about something or other. The world was hanging in a haze, she wiped her eyes with her sleeve to clear them. Her body was burning up. Crippling pains shot from her arm. She cried in pain and halted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Farrell stopped his rather long winded talk about how he planned to surprise his wife today. The girl had halted, in apparent distress and pain. \"Lass\"...he patted her gently. She winced and grimaced in pain from her arm. The girl gritted her teeth, he hear them grind against each other. \"Come on\" he said sympathetically \"not too far now.\" <i>Strange, I wouldn't expect this from someone with this condition...the heat must be getting to her.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie's chest felt tight, she gasped for breaths in deep gulps. Her tights stuck uncomfortably to her thighs. Her shoes hurt her. Sweat ran down her delicate heart shaped face, hung and pooled momentarily on her jaw, before falling into her cleavage - showing slightly between the buttons on her blouse. Strands on hair were slicked to her face. Her body ached. Her heart hammered...chimed...beat...rung faster in her chest...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Farrell tried to console the flower girl, who was sweating profusely in the heat and throes of pain; she groaned in discomfort, still clutching her arm. He could feel her heart thumping as her tried to coax her onwards. He noticed, innocently, the strained look of the girl's blouse about her chest - which heaved with each frantic breath she took. He averted his gaze sheepishly - girl's these days just wore tighter and tighter clothing, putting themselves all on show...nothing left to the imagination. He told her he'd return in just a moment; she squeaked a response of some sort or another from between gritted teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dashed to the nearby phone-box, panting - he shouldn't...at his age...in this heat\u2026.be running. Out of breath, he telephoned the hospital and urged them to send an ambulance after explaining the situation \u2013 they\u2019d be some while because the heat got to a lot of people. He glanced back at the girl who had leaned herself against a lamp post for support. It looked like she'd unbuttoned her blouse more. Hoping she'd be alright for a trifle longer he hurried into a nearby cafe; pushing in front of the queue - to a chorus of annoyed shouts - and garbled the situation...water! - Cold! -Quickly! The woman behind the counter gave over the large bottles gingerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn returning to the flower girl, Farrell wet his handkerchief with water and placed it across the girl's head - slicking her sweat sopped fringe to on side. He felt something under his foot. He lifted his foot. A button - a little distance from his foot another was spinning delicately. He turned his attention back to the girl; her perspiration had stuck her clothes to her body like a second skin. Her purple bra's outline came through the powder blue of the blouse. Farrell averted his eyes again and looked apprehensively down the road - a rather large bosom bobbed and rose not far from his eyeline - something he must confess she'd hidden well. The girl moaned again. He unscrewed the water bottle and offered it to her lips. Her eyes closed; she drank greedily, pausing only to pant. Water dribbled from her chin, splashing on her, slicked bosom - glossy as it was with sweat. With each gulp and breath she took it rose and fell: Swelling and falling and swelling and falling and swelling and swelling...As she drank and drank, Farrell notice how ill she looked - there was flush of greenish colour in her cheeks and beginning to rise in her gorge. He noted the way the bandage was digging into her arm flesh, clearly inflammation caused by the infected sore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished the last of the bottle with relish and gasped for air. Surprised, Farrell tossed the empty bottle aside and handed her the other, for she was apparently quite parched. \"Go easy on this one\" he mumbled to her; distracted, he looked for that damn ambulance again. A loud Shrrrip drew his attention back to the girl. He look at her puzzled, she was still licking moisture from her lips - a pained sort of expression across her drenched brow - and began to gulp again with sensual glugs. A little exploration yielded an explanation, but only raised more questions. When she shifted her weight against the lamp-post, he saw a large tear in the seat of her jeans exposing the vivid, damp, purple of her underwear. He flushed hotly - Told you so...too tight, too..eh? Farrell's inner pontification was halted slightly by the appearance that the hole was widening...almost as if stretched by something...her rear end? He looked up again. A projectile button bounced off his glasses. He raised an eyebrow of surprise. Her bosom had apparently freed itself of the upper part of her blouse. It suddenly dawned on Farrell that this bosom was now above his eyeline, so that he had to incline his neck to look at it...not that he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drained the last of the second bottle and let if fall to earth; soon she was sweating in buckets again. Farrell tried to shake her tentatively...she must be a good foot or more bigger than he remembered. He place a hand on her waist and was alarmed to feel the flesh beneath his hand shift and grow. He stepped back. The girl looked down at him - communicating, with those big blue eyes flecked with yellowish pigment, surprise to see him look up at her. Again she winced  with pain, wracked perceptibly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFarrell stood in shock and disbelief. The flower girl grew more perceptibly now. She leaned and arched her elongating torso against the lamp post, which creaked. Her hips and rear widened the hole - exposing more flesh and undergarment to the sweltering air. Sweat cascaded from her landing the odd droplet on the pavement, running down her neck and between her breast, escaping down her navel in streams.. Her calves thickened, ripping more of her jeans. The green colour was high in parts of her body now.  Her thighs began to erupt from the jeans in patches, as if devoured by invisible moths. A button popped from her jeans, revealing her plushy stomach. Her damp and musky hair shimmered and curled, glossy and thick, in the hard sunlight like red gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFarrell looked around, the girl was beginning to grab the attention of the odd person here and there \u2013 she was pretty big now. her brow furrowed in pain as she stretched taller. Her bandages fell away from her arm, exposing what look like for all the world like a ...spine? The green was deepening across her. Her fingers looked both long and slender as they stretched across her arm where they clutched. A creak of twisting metal alarmed Farrell. The lamp post bent under the girl's weight and size as she pushed against it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Hnnnng! <br>\r\nFarrell looked up at the flower girl. Her swelling bust line was straining against her purple bra, causing much discomfort. She was beginning to tower over everyone as much as the lamp post. Her head hit and bent the top of the post, by sheer force of her size. Several more spine began to burst from her arms and legs, accompanied by sharp yelps and cries from the girl - they were long and white, like ivory, and grew more pronounced with the girl herself. The green hue had spread across her now, save for a few odd spots. The girl was much distracted by her constant increase in size. He, nor anyone, had never seen anything or anyone like it! Farrell reached out and touched her ankle and found a light coating of little bristles of spines, fine like the little hairs that cover all human beings and a little sore to the touch. A ...cactus?The girl, apparently sensing his touch, inclined herself to look down. Her blue eyes were ringed by a floral or petal-like curls of vibrant red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer showers of red locks framed her face; the bun on her head had swollen, with strands of long soft curls radiating from it, her sweating had loosened it. Mrs O'Neil outside the cafe was put curiously in mind of a flower bud or blossom perched on top of the girl's huge lovely head. What a pretty lass...pity she's fecking huge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFarrell was struck by how gorgeous the girl smelled - a curiously blend of the heady, primal musk of her body and the floral, sweet and watery lushness that seemed to ooze from her in waves - she smelled erotic and faintly delicious. He shook himself and focused on her face. She was biting her lip, great tears were forming in her eyes. Her long fingers brushed them away - she looked in surprised at her hand; the fingers were long and white, to Farrell they put him in mind of claws. The sun beat down on her giant red head. She, caught unawares, reeled and stumbled on her tree trunk legs. Gasping, she grew again. Farrell heard groans and moans rumble deep in the girl's elegant throat. With a <br>\r\n<br>\r\n -hhhnnah<br>\r\nthe girl swelled larger. Something to do with plants, water and sunlight was niggling at the back of his head, but because of the situation his brain was otherwise involved. She was truly towering now, he estimated 30ft or more. The girl stretched and groaned <br>\r\n- nnnnguhgh, <br>\r\nher tortured bra flew into a nearby window. Her heaving endowments bounced forth - huge, succulent and ripe, like colossal watermelons - her flowery nipples hardening in the breeze she now caught at her size. Retain water. An uhhngguh signaled that the girl had outgrown those, rather sprightly, purple panties; only a gorse of red hair masked anything of her nether regions. Farrell look awkwardly away, he could hear the ambulance in the distance. We're going to need a bigger ambulance.It dawned on him that he could be in genuine danger; the girl probably wouldn't hurt a fly, but she was clumsy and rather unused to being her size. Doesn't know her own strength. He waddled to the clumps of people that were beginning to form on the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFarrell joined a cluster of women and men in the road. The flower girl was huge now. She'd rumbled to a fearful height, casting a well curved shadow on the street...looks like she's still growing. After the last surge, the growing did appear to be slowing down, her body now only rumbled gentle...she swelled slowly, like a great green parade balloon...ever so slowly expanding, undulating and swelling...If not for the fact she towered over the street you probably wouldn't notice her doing it. Too \"little\" too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n An old woman, hard of sight; hearing and probably not all together \"there\" leaned across and spoke to him. \"Is she your daughter?\"<br>\r\nFarrell turned in surprised \"Ugh, what?\"<br>\r\nThe old woman smiled \"You must be so proud\" she laid a gnarled hand on his shoulder \"The grow up so fast\"<br>\r\nFarrell, a little confused, turn back to the figure of flower girl who was gazing around her in disbelief at the change in perspective, swaying slightly from vertigo. She grew slowly in the cool drifting breeze. <br>\r\nHe bit his lip. \"40\" going on \"50\" - he thought dryly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie corrected her posture; her shadow fell long and dark along the street. She tottered precariously on legs like apple trees, swaying dangerously in the wind. Her blue eyes scanned the road from this new vantage point. She was not used to her new size; she was not used to her weight; she was not used to the increased weight at the front. She steadied herself with a lamppost using an outstretched arm. The metal twisted where she grasped it. Evie hastily withdrew her arm, surprised by her own strength. Oops. She stepped backwards, feeling little pangs of guilty pleasure at the boom of her footsteps in her stomach. The unctuous bounce of her bosom caught her attention, ripe and hefty; she managed a slight smile. They were like soft, round hay-stacks \u2013 bales of perfumed flesh. She was \"stacked\", as our cousins across the pond might say. She breathed deeply, watching her bust swell. She felt cool and pleasant. She enjoyed the tingle of sunlight on her skin. Evie moistened her lips. She dozed briefly in the heat, admiring the play of the light across and off her verdant and juicy buxom. An ambulance screeched to a halt down the road. The sirens and screeched jerked Evie from her boob-admiring and back to the admittedly surreal situation. She started, stepping backwards; pain shot up through the sole of a foot and she twisted awkwardly as she trod on a bicycle; she yelped: Evie flailed ungracefully \u2013 her mammoth chest threatening to unbalance her now. She stumbled backwards into the rows of shops. Her hulking ass and hips thumped into the flats above the shop with a thunder. She felt bricks and mortar crumble reluctantly under her cheeks. A rogue thrash of her arm decapitated a chimney pot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames Docherty joined the group. As a student and aspiring poet his mind did cart-wheels. The girl cut a tremendous figure against the sun. Her vast bosom was a hillock, fruitful and succulent; the cleft of her cleavage a lush and deep, dark valley between them. Her hips and buttocks moved with opulence and graceful eroticism as she, the flower goddess, twisted to regain her footing properly after the last surge of inexorable growth... and slammed them into a building. The size of her! \"Sorry!\" she bellowed. She was sorry!? She had nothing to apologise for, she was so lovely - so big - she couldn't help it. He thought briefly of his girlfriend at that size... or bigger! She'd look pretty spectacular too. His mind wandered back to the girl, who the old man near him had explained to the crowd was a girl from a flower shop nearby. She did look vaguely familiar. He imagined this girl bigger...if that was possible. She'd be huge...A continent! She'd grow and grow! Her hips could squeeze and lock around the world with their size in her carnal embrace. She could lap up the seas. Her massive chest swelled like a planet...the dark chasm of her cleavage swallowing cities in the veritable cradle of eroticism. Her red locks of hair a perfumed, damp ladder to the sky's empyrean. Ahh yes. Between her legs - a dark and sprawling rain forest of red, luscious and steamy with hot life. Her lips and tongue upon the world in passion, sticky and juicy with her hot saliva, a deluge left on earth. She just kept growing. He surreptitiously adjusted his coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie hoisted herself from the brickwork, her rear peeled from the wall, displaying the craters her haunches had impressed upon the foundations. A window frame came away with them comically. Picture perfect. She lurched forward a tad dazed. She stood, knees together, with her legs splayed. As she breathed a sigh of relief, the pavement under one foot, already tortured by her increased weight, caved and crumbled. Her foot went through the street. Evie toppled like a bosomy tree, thankfully cushioned by her billowy rear, but leaving a matching site of impact on the ground. Evie rubbed her butt with her branch-fingered hand. <i>Guess I\u2019ve put on weight</i>\u2026. A faint rumbling from her left foot attracted her attention. From the hole, a geyser of water jetted into the sky. Her foot must have burst a water pipe. The water rained down the street, which soon was hot, steamy and damp. Evie confessed the feeling was pleasant; she felt it sprinkling down on her curvaceous form. Her body was beaded with it, it trickled down over her bosom in little rivulets. It felt good this impromptu shower. She languidly eyed the rainbow forming at the spout.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paving stone rubble shifted under her. Evie watched a little stream of water balance briefly on the crest of her breast and then slide down into the black ravine of her cleavage. She teased a long finger through her slick cleft. So soft and cool to the touch. The rainbow was getting bigger now. Evie shifted her hips uncomfortably. She saw a number of people dash from the crowd. She felt quite offended; she hadn\u2019t done anything on purpose! But ooh, the water. She swept her hand through the eruption playfully. Evie leant back slightly, the sun was in her eyes now, time must be getting on. Her eyes were drawn back to her breasts. She sat up again and hefted them in her huge hands; they were quite heavy. She let them fall, gleeful at the jiggle they gave. She gathered them up again, intrigued by the bulge in size it gave them. They were rather heavy. Squeezing them slightly with her elegant fingers felt great\u2026she\u2019d never had all that much to work with. The squashing, Evie thought amusedly, looked like getting bigger and bigger. Her hands were getting a bit tired; her chest was surprisingly heavy! She must be tired from the heat. <i>Here we grow girls\u2026 </i>she giggled inwardly. <i>Big</i>. A slight squeeze. <i>Annnd bigger</i>. More pressure. <i>Aaaand bigger! </i>Evie clutched her breasts to her in a rush. <i>Biggest \u2013Oopps!</i> Her slippery boobs spilled over her hands and bounced rebelliously. To big too handle! She grinned at the street. There was a woman shouting now on the street and gesturing towards Evie; more people were running frantically. She tried to catch what the woman was shrieking. She strained her hearing. \"Run! \u2013Something \u2013 Something \u2013 Figger? Figure?\" Hey! Evie flushed heavily under her verdant skin. <i>You try maintaining a figure when your weight is measured in tones \u2013 cheeky bitch! </i>She fumed inwardly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt hot and angry. She needed a drink. She craned her neck and opened her mouth at the zenith of the geyser, feeling the cold water splash her face and running down her throat. The fount diminished \u2013 her foot must be blocking it. She look around, her face sopping. Evie attempted to extricate her foot from the hole \u2013 God it was tiny, how\u2019d that foot even get in there!? She wrenched her foot out; the pavement came away like biscuit. The spout leaped up and danced around the underside of her breasts. She giggled with girlish mirth at the sensation. She feel calamitously to her knees and gulped and lapped at this little urban fountain. She looked absentmindedly for the rainbow. There it was, dancing about eye level a little way off. Evie drank quite greedily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fountain died away, leaving Evie staring blankly at the street below. She espied a Fire Engine a little way off who appeared to have cut the water off. She knelt there, hair wet and mouth dripping. The little Dubliners looked even smaller. Wait a sec\u2026Evie went to stand. Huge knuckles ground into the road to lift the colossal girl skywards. Evie rose. A gargantuan foot came down on the road. And rose. The people and vehicles dwindled in her big innocent blue eyes. And rose. The flats she\u2019d careered into ebbed, they were the very same; there was her buttocks\u2019 crater \u2013 it looked small to her; too small to be the thing she felt behind her. Evie realized she had got big. The roofs of the street waned as she stood. She had got very big\u2026 She watched her shadow spread down the street more and more. She had got very, very big. The houses were hips level. Evie gasped. She\u2019d grown again! \u201cI\u2019m huge!\u201d She blurted out, shocked by the rumble to her voice. The crowds were running and the uproar was spreading. Evie assumed the knees together stance and clutched at her huge bustline. <i>Apparently a 30 -40 ft woman is a novelty spectator sport, but a girl does a little\u2026 developing\u2026and suddenly it\u2019s pandemonium\u2026It\u2019s like when Violet was bullied at school for being so small\u2026she\u2019d gone away for summer\u2026puberty hit her like a train\u20264,10 to 5,9!...apparently positively bursting out of bras!...She just grew and grew!...I'm was like that\u20265,3 to uhhhh\u202680ft.? 90ft\u2026100 maybe!?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The office, uncomfortable and stuffy as it was, had languished to a few tired stragglers. Violet yawned deeply and stretched. Dark stains had formed around her armpits and the material clung, sticky and unpleasantly to her skin. Her raven hair had begun to wave and curl slightly in the heat; her mascara dripped and ran with her perspiration. As she stretched the blouse pulled and tightened, displaying thumb-size gaps between the buttons - Violet was not by any means a \"little\" girl. She inhaled deeply. She was vaguely distressed to note the reek of body odour that clung to her. Her left eye peeped open in time to clock a male colleague sneaking a glimpse of the startling projection of her chest. He flushed and bustled away. Violet adjusted her bra which was beginning to chaff and hurt her. <i>Fuck, I think I've grown again...  </i> She looked around the office, sighed and grabbed her jacket. She peeled herself from her chair; her leather skirt had stuck to the chair. Violet plucked at her tights, but couldn't fix their incessant riding up. <i>Fucking heat!</i> She strode along the corridor, accompanied as she always was by an unmistakable bounce. <i>Evie will hit the fucking roof if I've got any bigger</i>. For at  5'11 and ..ughhh....to borrow a phrase coined for Julia Breck...\"mammoth breasted\", Violet towered over her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet stormed from the building; passing a group of rather lecherous young lawyers, who grinned and delivered sycophantic greetings. Outside she breathed and fumbled in her bra for her cigarettes she produced one and sparked it. She walked homewards and smoked as she went. It wasn't that the guys at work were ugly or inadequate - she cast her mind back to her living room after the last wild work night out - certainly not in some cases! It was just she felt unfulfilled or unsatisfied...no matter how big...how good. She shuddered a little. In her peripheral vision she saw people bustling around frantically - which was nothing unusual. Her clothes were really irritating her. A woman ran out in front of her; forcing Violet to grind to a halt suddenly. The woman apologised hurriedly and scarpered. Violet bit through the nub of her cigarette with frustration and spat it into the road; stamping on it on her way past. Her bosses told her she had an attitude problem...which had naturally developed, not unlike Violet herself, into a great office pun. They all thought she had a lovely at\"tit\"ude. Also...she had a foul mouth on her. <i>Fucking morons.</i> She'd be on top one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBursting through her door, she discarded her keys on the floor. She shore herself of a couple of layers. She absentmindedly turned on the TV and went into the kitchen as it flicked into life. She picked out a couple of ice cubes and deposited them into a glass. Violet went through to the living room. The couch provided lovely relief from the ache of back-pain. She lazily unbuttoned her front and even went so far as to loosen her skirt. She glared morosely at her \"girls\", and the red welt where her tartan bra pressed into them. Violet plucked an ice cube  from her drink and ran it along her sweaty flesh, quickly checking that the blinds were closed.  She smirked at the sensation. Just as she was about to slip it under her padding, the Tv caught her attention. The cube fell to the floor. She watched in amazement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn screen, Violet saw her friend Evie, undoubtedly her - yes! Except she.. was...big! huge even! A giant! \"Fuck me! She's fucking enormous!\" gasped Violet. Evie strode across the shot on gigantic legs. Violet was aghast. \"Ev....what the hell happened to you?\" Evie turned and her top half was visible above the rooftops. Violet whistled <i>Phew, where did those come from!?</i> As the report continued they displayed a camera phone video of Evie earlier in the day. Violet watched was the candid Evie gulped down water in the scratchy footage, which then zoomed in on Evie's chest, sopping and sweaty. As this continued a button burst from her chest. The camera zoomed out to follow Evie skyward ascent. Violet felt a little glimmer of exhilaration in her stomach as she watched her  friend grow... and grow...The screen flicked back to bigger Evie, who was clutching at a nearby building. The other hand clutched her right breast - her head tilted back and she moaned. To Violet's amazement, Evie appeared to grow again - 10ft maybe! <i>God she's fucking massive.</i> The caption on the news read \"Monster Woman continues to grow?...\"</span></div></div>",

She flailed manically and yelped she tumbled to earth with a thump. She heard a plastic crash as the phone vibrated itself from its perch. She spat a strand of tawny hair from her mouth and scrambled for the phone. Sprawled on her front, she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahoy hoy!\" she trilled.<br>\r\n\"Fuck, Hazel, Fuck!\" came Violet's voice frantically down the phone.<br>\r\nGetting to her feet, Hazel laughed \"That's right say my name!\"<br>\r\n\"Shut it! Listen  -\" snapped Violet.<br>\r\n\"Charming!\" chimed Hazel \"I see you're in a foul mood!\"<br>\r\n\"Look jus- hang on; getting some clothes on...\"<br>\r\nHazel sensed she was on speaker phone. \"Vi,\" she said wandering out of the bedroom \"I really hope you're not apres-sex...\" Hazel said without amusement, Violet could be quite the \"goer\" and this potential scenario shouldn't necessarily be ruled out. Hazel heard from somewhere in the room what she presumed was a \"Fuck off\" muffled by clothing that was probably a smidge too tight. Hazel shifted from foot to foot and whistled into the phone until Violet returned. There was a loud boom or rumble from outside - momentarily distracting Hazel from her tune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, back - now - quit it!\" snapped Violet<br>\r\n\"Sorry babes...\" Hazel appeased.<br>\r\n\"Have you SEEN the news!\"<br>\r\n\"Nope, been asleep...\"<br>\r\nThere was an awkward pause<br>\r\n\"...Well?\"<br>\r\n\"Well what Vi?\"<br>\r\nViolet made a frustrated sound. \"The news!\"<br>\r\n\"What about it?\"<br>\r\n\"Turn it on!\"<br>\r\n\"Fine, your highness!\"<br>\r\nAnother pause during which Violet could be heard crashing around her flat. \"You okay Vi?\"<br>\r\n\"Me? I'm fine!\" flustered, the usually unflappable, Violet.<br>\r\nAnother pause. \"No signal from the satellite Vi...\"<br>\r\nShe heard Violet fuming on the other side of the line. <br>\r\n\"Look Vi, what's - hang on...\"<br>\r\nHazel put down the phone on the coffee table. She could hear Violet yelling something - something really had her pissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wound up her blinds and blinked momentarily in the sunlight. She had to confess herself....rather shocked. Outside her window was a monstrous pair of buttocks, shadowed by a set of bulwark hips - replete as they were with green flesh. Hazel's flat was not high up really, but strictly speaking a woman - for she clearly was a woman - had no business being so big! Hazel solved the broken satellite mystery  when she clocked the twisted metal embedded in that behemothic arse. A proportionally huge hand extricated this from the soft flesh, peeling it delicately from where it was wedged and flicked it into the street below. The monstrous woman's weight shifted and twisted. Violet  could be heard screeching from the speaker. Hazel gasped in revelation. Upon the hips of the woman she saw a mark - a little reminiscent of a daisy. Hazel distinctly remembered a August evening in down by the seaside. The sun rimglistened on the surfswirling sea. Gold and bluerry. The sound and swash of the seaxteen. The sunlight obliterated on the shimmering shurface. All on the cushp of womanhood. Evie knee deep in the water, licking around her pale legs and warm specks her flicked her developing thighs. Her thighs are blossoms who blend with the dimming day. Her bathing suite, riding up slightly at the back - a glimpse of her flower...a birthmark - flower of youth, small fragile. On a rock by the shoreline...another flower blooming. Vi. Wet and dotted with the sea, body soaked in sun - moist dappled light on her. Breathing in and out with the sea. Too big for bathing suit. The waves spilled over the sand...it was the summer she'd sprouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie's bloated haunches swiveled and pivoted; Hazel jumped back as the titanic hips collided with the building - shaking the building and knocking in Hazel's window. <i>She can barely fit the street!</i> \"Sorry!\" boomed Evie as she strode onwards - her impossibly large hips knocking perilously from side to side.<i> Bigger but just as clumsy!</i> \"Girl's got swagger!\" yelped Hazel from the floor. Hazel heard her friend's thunderous footfalls retreating. Again came Violet's voice. Hazel quickly scoured jumble for the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh....\"   <br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" mumbled Violet.<br>\r\n\"She's pretty big huh?\"<br>\r\n\"Yup\"<br>\r\nYet another awkward pause. \"Our little girl's all grown up...\" Hazel giggled<br>\r\n\"Heh...\" huffed Violet.<br>\r\n\"Soooo....What now?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shuffling and faintly hopping from foot to foot to heel to foot where one very much indescribable street met an equally bland and unnameable street, was the slender and bird-like Hazel. Nervously casting about from time to time. In the distance, the wail of sirens dopplered across the sky. Clouds had begun to scud across the sky in smears and elsewhere dispersed in grey blankets. She closed one eye and squinted at the clouds for a time. There was something she admired in clouds, in rain. The air hung heavy and close, portending thunderstorms above the city. She mused. She espied a figure striding down the street. From the walk, obviously Violet. Her chest notable from this distance - owing partly to Hazel impeccable eyesight (unmarred by myopia) and partly by just the expectation - things are always exaggerated in size and grandeur in living memory. T<i>here was always something in Vi's walk, ever since she was young in the green parks - an old country movement in the way her clothes would wave, an attitude from her body, down through the ground, like electric. Vi, reminded her much of thunder and of lightning - vitriolic and electric; fearsome when aroused...Herself? Snow. Light and soft...drifts and powder. Fragile and brittle ice - a haze of crystals ....a blow of  blanche iridescence. Head in those cloud again. When ice crystals rub in a cloud, two meet...electric! Charge and static. Lightning! Ice and electric.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was definitely Violet. She, as she was prone to doing, smoked as she walked. She spat out her cigarette as she reached Hazel, grinding it underfoot. Hazel cocked her head to one side. \"Really?\"<br>\r\n\"Litter is the last thing the police care about right now...\" mumbled Violet<br>\r\nHazel grinned \"I meant a leather jacket on a stuffy day like this!\" <br>\r\n\"Looks like rain\" said Violet passively, looking around in affirmation.<br>\r\n\"You should dress more summery - like me!\" Hazel twirled to fan out her skirt and readjusted her summer bonnet. <br>\r\n\"You mean,\" Violet laughed \"like a 14 year old!\"<br>\r\nHazel stamped a foot in mock petulance \"You're so mean!\" She struck off in a pantomime tantrum, Violet quickly catching up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked, they talked and caught up with life - blissfully managing to avoid the elephant in the room, the elephantine Evie Bloom. After a moment of silence,                                          Hazel ventured \"So....how about Evie huh?\"<br>\r\nViolet breathed deeply, \"Yeah...pretty fucked up...\"<br>\r\n\"How'd you think she got so big?\" quizzed Hazel.<br>\r\n\"Pfftt, Dunno...late growth spurt?\" Violet quipped \"A late \"Bloom\"er per se?<br>\r\nHazel snorted \"That's dreadful!\" she touched her bonnet slightly as they walked onward. \"Seriously, you should be ashamed of that...you'd have to be pretty dumb to find that sort of rubbishy punnage funny - yeah it's a word...now!\"<br>\r\n\"Alright! Calm down!\" Violet protested \"There seems to be this gold-mine of plant based puns.\"<br>\r\n\"Why plant based exactly?\"<br>\r\n\"Well\" Violet stopped \"...really!?\" said Violet exasperatedly <br>\r\nHazel looked at her blankly<br>\r\n\"Between: Evie, Miss big, mean and green, growing like a weed (there's another!), sprouting all sorts of spikes and flowers, working as a florist and, to boot, her name being Bloom you see no irony?...Nothing!?\"<br>\r\nHazel mused briefly...\"I'm not sure it's irony as such...perhaps appropriate or even coincidental...\" she shrugged \"Guess I never considered all that...\" <br>\r\nViolet was agog, \"So what you're saying is...you actually didn't get it.\"<br>\r\nRevelation flooded Hazel's mind. \"Ohhhh, \"Bloom\", yes I get it now, yes.\" She bumped Violet with her hip \"you're so witty!\" she dripped in a sardonic way. Violet shook her head and walked on.<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you din't get it...\"<br>\r\n\"Well I didn't see her properly....just a butt-load of ass...\" The continued on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBizzarely enough, Evie's shop's door was open. The girls stepped inside and looked about. \"Well nothing strikes me immediately as out of place Hazel.\" said Violet. <br>\r\n\"Better look the, hadn't we!\" chirped Hazel and wandered into the jungle of potted plants and arrays. The search continued for an hour or more. Violet shed her leather coat, her light blouse underneath. Hazel in turn removed her bonnet and tried to control her unruly tawny locks as best she could with a fraying hairband. Violet was leafing through some of the notepads near the sink, Hazel could see. Violet looks unsuccessful in her attempts to get to the root of things that way...Evie probably wasn't and evil genius that had concocted some weird growth formula to turn herself into a giant...she had always complained about lacking inches, but that probably wasn't too much to go on. A weird hackneyed Dr Jeckyll scenario drifted into Hazel's head - Evie gulping down with relish a potion, purple...no blue or green, with relish, dribbling down the corner of her mouth - in one gulp. It is also raining...it is important. Evie reeled, crying out, clutching at the table. She gasped, her nails scraping against the desk which Hazel perused over.  Swelling larger and larger in the mind's eye, Evie began to bulge, swell, grow and expand. Buttons popping and ricocheting, her breasts spilling out over her bra. She rapidly grew skywards, her head colliding with the ceiling; her arms lengthened and shredded her clothes, her plushy stomach popped open the last of the shirt. Evie grew more and more, her upper body bursts through the ceiling.  \"Oh yeah!\"  she boomed. Her arms and legs moved. She tore through the floor as she walked, quickly becoming too big to be accommodated in the fragile building. Her swelling form burst forth from the shop into the street. The rain quickly damped her skin, soaked her hair. Laughed loud and proud as her ever increasing stature cut a more more impressive profile against the moon. Hazel snapped back to reality and, frowning, inspected the cup on the desk more thoroughly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Violet shuffled through papers and books, she happened upon a battered copy of \"Alice's adventures in Wonderland.\" Not that Evie especially cared for it - describing it once as vastly over-rated for what it was. Violet smirked at the scene she imagined. Evie scarfing down some random mushroom she found, replete as the image was with hair bows, pretty shoes and a dress...and petty-coats. Evie then bustles about she shop. Stops suddenly - eye's wide. This time Evie puffs up like a balloon, slowly inflating to fill more space. Distressed she continues to grow. None of that kiddy stuff though, that doesn't happen, <i>I have enough trouble finding clothes to fit.</i> Evie's pretty little black buckled shoes pop off; white tights shred by thickening legs. Maybe she grows at different rates? Unevenly?  Evie's bust detonates outwards, busting dress and bras like, quickly three times the size of her body - <i>and I thought I was big!</i> Now feet, suddenly Evie stands balanced precariously on pontoons! And arms, first own arm extends through a wall, then the other. Now for legs, those weather-balloon breasts are carried into the sky by instant tree trunks. Head. Evie's head bubbled up like a bobble head. That ass you're so proud of m'dear. Evie's is soon bhouyed upon a glorious set of fleshy domes. Last your body...just to even you out! Her torso thickens to support these massive endowments...........Don't think it's over! There is a loud pop and suddenly Evie occupies quite a large portion of the street....Her legs sticking out comically from the bottom; her arms from the sides and her head from the roof. The house around her torso, bent considerably to accommodate her bosom. Shook her head. \"Eww\" she exclaimed as she realised she'd leaned in something sticky. She went to the sink and washed her arm. Finding herself parched she drank from a bottle by the sink - she presumed was juice, for Evie had a habit of keeping diluting juice in identikit plastic bottles. Delicately Violet scowled, extended he tongue and gingerly removed a petal from the end - flicking it away in derision... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazel's voiced chimed across the shop \"Hey Violet!...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

An idea or notion of scale. From his super-lacustrine porcelain aerie the beetle surveyed, beneath a sheer smooth white cliff, a turquoise Sargasso Sea - still and unrippled. A brief buzz and an unechoable click of carapace from The Cup's rim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinor quakes, tremors - shudderings in the eastern sky beyond The Cup's circumference. A great orb, pale green and dewy hovered Orwellian over his world entire (beetles are by nature possessive and sentimental...also remarkably agoraphobic, myopic and oblivious. The orb was shuttered by a vast screen - adorned with rainbows. In the background, to the left, forests of dark gold coiled and hung.  The orb reflected in the surface of the green lake. The two melted and blended. Great sea green dissipated to one, gigantic snowflakes in an ocean. Gusts of sweet and perfumed wind caressed the lake and brought saccharine tides to the beveled foot of The Cup's cliffs. It broiled and clouded on the invisible meniscus - nectarous fog. There came a peal of mighty bells, chimes of heaven that split the vault of the sky. It resonated in the beetle world, the cadence of heaven's empyrean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistant thunder brewed and tumbled. The black thunderer from the west. Quakes and waves again. Louder they become as something wicked this way comes. A darkness was upon The Cup; the lake darkened. There rose, there grew, there dawned a colossal tower of ebony. A massive cloud buster. Unconquerable. Follow the tower to the sky one could. Towards the top, beginning to become lost in the distant clouds. A jutting crag; black projection and gigantic bulwark or edifice that eclipsed the tower's peak. The monolithic balcony seemed to grow repeatedly in size, fall, but only to rise again. Thunder rumbled. The chimes of freedom rang again. The tower stirred. Time to fly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beetle fluttered and lifted off. He swerved to avoid the monstrous green orb and flew towards the tower. Upwards! He zoomed and scaled the titanic and ever bulging escarpment. At it's crest, an unfathomable trench or abyss, formed by the intersection of two white tectonic mountains - smashing together mightily.  Above this rift another cliff face, resplendent with two of the orbs and a gouge of scarlet - incarnidine. He circled wildly, distressed. From the west came a mighty white pillar. It collided with him, smashing him from the air. He plummeted to earth, wheeling in vain. Towards the chasm he tumbled, down and down into the black and deep abyss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet cast around, her chest bouncing magnificently. \"Where'd it go!?\"<br>\r\nHazel looked distressed. \"You didn't have to do that...\"<br>\r\nViolet peered disgustedly into the blackness of her cleavage, but to no avail. \"...I hate bugs.\"<br>\r\n\"Is tea supposed to be green Vi?\"<br>\r\n\"You get green tea...\"<br>\r\n\"This looks weird though, I'd say.\"<br>\r\nViolet eyed it and made an affirmative noise in her throat.<br>\r\n\"Try it maybe?\"<br>\r\nHazel pulled a face. \"Does that seem sensible?\"...\"anyway, why me!?\"</span></div></div>",

Other feelings could in part be attributed to the potential that the Coleoptera in question may continue to exist in the meridian that bisected her salient anterior\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat reasons might Ms Rosenkratz have to bear the arthropod such a resentment?<br>\r\nAmong others: As a young girl, a bee sting sustained to her tender, pink, heel as she trod upon it as it navigated and pollinated among the rockery; On holiday in Italy, bearing witness to multiple scorpions that had chosen to colonise the airing cupboard where the Rosenkratz family had chosen to temporarily store towels; finding beetles in her boots on several separate occasions; the sheer size to which the spiders, emerging from cracks in her house, were capable of growing; the associated connotations of effluvia and pestilence that clung about the common cockroach; the extreme alacrity of the centipede; the potential fear of the earwig penetrating her aural canal\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat, if anything, redeemed Violet\u2019s impressions on insects?<br>\r\nThe diaphanous fragility of a dragonfly\u2019s wing, and their dewy iridescence after light rain, which reminded her of the misty and cloudy childhood afternoon spent with her maternal Grandfather walking in the countryside: an experience soon rendered unrepeatable; the various brightnesses of ladybirds; in some cases, their picayune size in relation to her own body; the eucastrophe of rapid metamorphosis underwent by the catepillar, ignored, plain and even repulsive, luxuriating and growing quickly until she emerges, nascent and glossy, a resplendent, glorious, butterfly\u2026 or pale, downy, flocculent, gossamer luminous moth\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn light of this irritation incited by the beetle, what feelings did Violet bear towards to the hesitance and reluctance exhibited by her companion, Hazel?<br>\r\nExasperation, communicated to her companion by the sharp inhalation of air into her lungs and expelling of this from her lungs and from her mouth in such a fashion as to be made audible, slightly aspirated\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did she proceed?<br>\r\nGrabbing the cup, containing the miscellaneous liquid, Violet proceeded to ingest it. She then returned the cup to the table\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat phrases may describe best the process of ingestion of the peculiar liquid, henceforth \u2018tea\u2019?<br>\r\nApparent relish, which was affected to articulate her impatience; in a duumvirate of gulps which produced sounds which were incongruous with a person of such feminine persuasion; accompanied by a thin rivulet of tea from the right-hand corner of her mouth\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat trajectory did the river of tea course?<br>\r\nFrom its source at the corner of Violet\u2019s mouth, the stream trickled to the sheerness of jaw-line at which point it bifurcated, one path streamed and pooled minorly on the escarpment of Violet\u2019s chin in a quantity substantial enough as to develop a droplet; the second stream followed the course dictated by the origin, down the alpine slopes of the neck; according to momentum, gravity and the forces of cohesion and adhesion, the river was borne to the apex of a smooth expanse of ivory hill whereupon it delicately hung, before trickling laterally down the curvature of the aforementioned hill of ivory\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat course did events now take?<br>\r\nBoth girls stood pensive; 9 minutes and 23 seconds elapsed; Hazel moved to speak, Hazel was interrupted by Violet whose avaricious consumption of the tea had resulted in the simultaneous and unavoidable ingurgitation of pockets of air; These were now disgorged unexpectantly and abruptly as one eructation at approximately 60 decibels; this particular eruption or outburst elicited the roseation of Violet\u2019s alabaster cheeks with embarrassment. A downwards look was directed at Hazel\u2019s face, which expressed amusement; a sheepish excusal followed\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResulting from Violet\u2019s consumption of the tea, what did the pair conclude?<br>\r\nA)\tThat the liquid, previously contained in the now empty cup and now residing in Violet\u2019s stomach, was, in fact, tea; <br>\r\nB)\tThat the unusual substantiality of one Evelyn Bloom could not be attributed to this liquid\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat disparities between Violet Rosenkratz and Evelyn Bloom informed this conclusion on the part of both girls?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn stood, at last estimation, in the region of 100ft tall, without assistance: Violet stood at 6 ft 2in in large heels; Evelyn\u2019s skin was coloured a distinct green, where Violet retained her ivory white complexion; Evelyn\u2019s strength allowed for many more possibilities that were simply impractical for Violet: likewise, Evelyn\u2019s size made pedestrian tasks, easily preformed by Violet, implausible; Violet was a Gemini, where Evelyn was a Sagittarius; Evelyn\u2019s hips, already larger in circumference than Violet\u2019s prior to her enlargement, spanned two stories wide, as a rough approximation: Violet\u2019s measurements are undisclosed, but assumed smaller; Evelyn\u2019s bust size increased proportionally to her size, this coupled with her present magnitude resultantly renders speculation as to her bust measurements impractical\u2013 bra size remains unconfirmed, a conclusive answer cannot be empirically determined until the subject\u2019s \u201cbust-line\u201d ceases to increase: Violet is proportionally considered bigger than Evelyn, this considerable endowment is attributed to genetics, combining size with outward projection in a gamut of hormones that is also responsible for her substantial height \u2013 bra size the product of, and subject to, much conjecture and speculation from ex-lovers and colleagues and is therefore unempirical; accordingly, Violet is considered scientifically more attractive, based on current opinion polls, because Evelyn\u2019s dress size is many times in excess of what is considered \u2018normal\u2019; Evelyn continued to enlarge, Violet, considered a late bloomer, had stopped growing by 18 years of age, bar the continual development of her bosom\u2019s girth. Evelyn\u2019s growing resulted in: a drastic increase in height, exhibiting itself as colossal stature, unbridled strength, insatiable thirst, a high degree of exposure, a phenomenal increase in weight, increased male and female attention, a newfound love of the sun, sensations of loneliness and the issuing for writs for damages totally several thousand monetary units; Violet\u2019s latent growth spurts resulted in: a sudden and immense increase in her bust size, a deeper and more dulcet voice, the appearance of hair elsewhere \u2013 later the necessity to shave, increased male attention, above-average height, medical examinations for hormone imbalances, a desire to wear, and acquired tolerance for, tight clothing, self-confidence, seemingly unending appetite, an appreciation for a button popped from one\u2019s blouse, a tendency to breath deeply, power and the necessary expenditure of the monetary funds afford to her piano lesson being redirected to keeping her in custom-built bras\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Violet had not grown, why then did she feel the need to look down (see earlier) at Hazel?<br>\r\nBecause Violet was greater in height than Hazel.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHad this always been so?<br>\r\nNo. The girls had remained, since nursery, of equal height, allowing 1 \u2013 2 inches for height gained by differing brand of footwear; puberty affected Hazel first and she accordingly stretched taller, by the age of fifteen reaching 5,5 in. and growing only an inch more since that point in time. Violet remained at 4, 9 in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Evelyn?<br>\r\nEvelyn originally attended a different school and joined the group aged 11. Evelyn developed like Hazel, but not so lean or so tall. Evelyn grew to \u2018comeliness\u2019 with thick creamy thighs and lovely bevelled hips, but the numbers who noticed were as next to nothing as makes no odds. Hazel and her brought Violet on their first fitting for bras. Despite inclusion, Violet did not buy anything on this occasion. They were good friends to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat reason did medical professionals provide vis a vis Violet\u2019s lack of development?<br>\r\nGenetics, hormone imbalance <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat, then, accounted for her sudden change in physical proportion? <br>\r\nSee above<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>What age did this change take place?<br>\r\nThe summer of her 16th year of existence as Violet Julia Rosenkratz, in Dublin, capital city of the Republic of Ireland, forming, with others, a segment of the contingent continent of Europe; by extension the greater continent of the Unites states of Eurasia, which alongside the closely borne brother Africa; their distant sister Oceania and despite being divorced after all, post-separation of Pangaea, from the from the conjoined twins of the America dynasty, South and North, - family reunion expected at the birth of Pangaea Ultima, these continents characterise, excepting the cold and lifeless, the face of the face of the planet know as Earth, whose age many times over dwarfed that of Violet Rosenkratz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom where did the middle-name \u2018Julia\u2019 originate?<br>\r\nOf Latin derivation: Youthful. Feminine of Julius/Julian. Relevance to Violet: an anglicised form of the name \u2018Yulia\u2019 \u2013 in itself a Eastern-European variant. The name of Violet\u2019s maternal Grandmother Yulia Vinogradova, to whom Violet\u2019s genetic physical features were most easily traced, who hailed from St Petersburg, Russia\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat specific traits did photographs reveal Violet had inherited?<br>\r\nAtramentous, raven hair; refined white complexion; an ample bodice; a propensity for dark moods as voiced by dusky, expressive eyes\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad Violet known her namesake?<br>\r\nNo. She died at the age of 28. The child, Anya Vinogradova, later Rosenkratz, was raised from the age of four years old by her father, alone\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what did Yulia Vinogradova die?<br>\r\nDepression\u2026hypothermia\u2026lack of oxygen\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Anya\u2019s father, Violet\u2019s Grandfather, come to terms with this and remarry?<br>\r\nNever\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat first alerted Violet to changes in her physicality?<br>\r\nTenderness in her chest, later attributed to the frictional forces generated between the fabric of her pyjamas and her nascent breasts\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat action was necessitated by this sudden development?<br>\r\nThe purchase of a brassiere\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat action soon followed this?<br>\r\nThe purchase of a larger brassiere\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did the summer proceed?<br>\r\nForwards, upwards and outwards\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResult?<br>\r\nViolet returned from the summer taller and greater in upper circumference\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpper only?<br>\r\nHer abdominal circumference did not increase by such a salient margin, but did develop more feminine characteristics in line with the national average\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat reaction did this elicit in school mates once the new term commenced?<br>\r\nSome were surprised to find themselves looking up, where previously the had looked down, at Violet; those who remained taller, some only for the time being, were made intensely conscious of a profusion of flesh in the humid autumn weather which had hitherto not existed; the coining of assorted nicknames varying from degrading and offensive to endearing and flattering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGive and analyse one of these nicknames?<br>\r\n\u2018Jugasaurus-Rex\u2019 \u2013 a combination of \u2018jug\u2019, a container of liquid i.e milk; colloquially applicable to breasts that have attained notability for their size, and \u2018Tyrannosaurus Rex\u2019 a dinosaur of the late cretaceous period characterised by immense size and a carnivorous diet. The nickname pertains specifically to the size of Violet\u2019s bosom. Aside from this, it connotes her size in comparison with other, being that the female of the species was genetically larger than the male. Furthermore, the Tyrannosaurus\u2019 carnivorous diet implies, as a facile irony, Violet\u2019s reputation as a \u2018Man-eater\u2019 and her rumoured sexual promiscuity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy is this ironical?<br>\r\nViolet received no male attention, in romantic terms, until her return to school precisely because of her lack of female attributes in comparison with her fellow classmates: It is therefore improbable that Violet could euphemistically \u2018devour\u2019 men to increase her size; nor were Violet\u2019s summer growth spurts so pronounced as to grant her the disparity in physical size between herself and the objects possessed of masculine attributes to enable her to literally swallow a man. Additionally, although sexual activity is suggested to increase breast size it would have no bearing on Violet\u2019s physical height, furthermore, contrary to popular belief, the ingestion of male ejaculate does not increase breast size \u2013 even were this based on empirical evidence, Violet would be required to consume several litres to account for her size. Excepting all this, Violet had developed a particular distaste for masculine attentions, particularly those of her school-mates \u2013 mostly out of spite. Only in later life, when she had grown more sizable and her chest more full, Violet did feel the need to lose her virginal aspect to a sailor from Belfast. Violet\u2019s sexual liaisons are therefore confined exclusively to men outside her educational sphere, bar one or two one night stands with members of the undergraduate law faculty.

Added to this now came the displacing weight of Violet\u2019s left arm, the volume of her breasts and soon after the considerable mass of her whole form. Cascades of water poured from the rim\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat in water-lilies did Violet, great displacer, water-borne swan, leviathan, plunged in the sink-pond, love? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere transience on the surface of lacustrine steppes, the serenity of unfolding, of blossoming and unfolding, trembling and breaking in the purity of white or the exclusivity of blue in the forests of murky pools; their ubiquity in season; the transitive temptation of the East: glimpses of the mist hugged monastery; bright petals\u2026 a long slowmoving river water-coursed; muck-exuding stems\u2026 blossom and sun: rise \u2026monk and farmer in the shadow of the valley; black flies on the sepal\u2026 shallow water in ricefields; wet and waxy lily-pad\u2026the aerie towering of the mountain; girl of ivory body and ebony hair\u2026the cries of women in the dark; colossal and pitiless, a wooden mask\u2026 shadows of the valley; luscious, soft breasts\u2026luminescence of lanterns at the bog\u2019s side; eyes of grey-blue ice\u2026The sun climbs ever-higher in the sky; the latent blossoming of evening violets\u2026mist-soaked bamboo forests growing: a girl\u2019s mirage mid-stream, bog weed snagged on a thigh\u2026wooden barrels of amber wine; the cool caress of cream on swollen breasts... towers of civilisation crumble; long, elegant white hands\u2026quiet grounds wracked by quakes; the footfalls of a girl in the night\u2026ornate pagodas by twilight; tight, corseted flesh...pillars of ancient times; erect and stiffened nipples through well-drawn cloth...  vastness of China; the slope of a young woman\u2019s frame... snow on the unending steppe; length of a girl's belly bathed in moonlight\u2026brink of the void of incertitude; a cold finger traces cleavage\u2026 eclipse of the sun: masked flower goddess inheriting the sky, gorged and swollen on the cry of the dying sun\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising like a leviathan of the deep from the sink, what in water-lilies did Violet dislike?<br>\r\nThe taste\u2026she picked petals from her mouth\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The image of the Girl turned black against the sun and her blue eyes lit up with gold. She cast them downwards and breathed deeply. The Girl stood alone, she felt the wind in her hair and enjoyed pleasant the airkiss; cold and soft. She had become greater in size. She could feel it. She could see it on the faces of the apparitions that flickered on the ground. She felt thirsty. She strode on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe straddled a high railway bridge. Her head was above the noise of traffic and the distress of the inhabitants of the city coursed about the streets like conscious rivers of chaos. Her eyes caught the train, clicking its way from somewhere in the city\u2019s heart like a snake coursing the wet grass of Eden, and her heart flickered with a curious caprice. The train passed underneath her and between her legs and she inclined herself forwards, she held back her coils and locks with her hand. The sun was dying in the west and the rays red lights fractured through the glass prisms of the buildings and the shards streaked warm and radiant on her face and her body. Her long hands, outstretched, clasped the train and halted its progress; dragging it back across the lines and towards herself; she carefully lifted and held it in her hands like a salmon plucked live and thrashing from the cool stream of some far off mountain and she enjoyed the pangs of pleasure in her stomach; it was lighter to her than she had expected and as she inspected she caught the stink of the diesel and felt the slickness of oil on her palms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl lifted the train; inspecting closer with her huge blue suntinted eyes; her pupils had widened in the sun and the passengers flitted inside the long metal box of the train. She felt to oreborn snake humming dully in her hands, alive with the refined black blood of the planet and deep in her chest she felt the rattlings of the carriages as a little girl and she was on the train and her mother was there and the girl clutched tight to her mother\u2019s skirt among a forest of legs. She inhaled the diesel fumes in one breath and she breathed outwards; her breath was hot and moist and it fogged the little panes of glass which ran along the train; the girl was deft and careful; the pressure of her manipulation dented and bent the train where she held it and she was surprised by ease of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl stooped and returned train to the tracks; the quickness of the wheels nipped her fingers and she cried out and the train tumbled from her hands to the ground, twisting unpleasantly. She reared up from the lower elevation and sucked her finger; her saliva was sticky and balmy and its sweetness soothed the abrasion and with wet eyes wide she looked down at the train and was dismayed by the damage her curiosity had wrought. She attempted to salvage the train and the people scattered from her looming form and she hastily recoiled. She attempted to retract her foot from near the wreck and retreat from her meddlings; her foot caught the rail-bridge and she collided with the building at her posterior; her huge hips and buttocks shook the foundations and ruptured vast sheets of glass and they were followed by her immense upper half which cracked and fissured the building like God\u2019s thundering upon man. She quickly recovered and stumbled forward, standing with knees together, and meditatively rubbed her bristly buttocks and her finely spined thighs. She winced as she plucked a sliver of glass from her right hand hip and let it fall to that ground and she felt with her fingertip the drop blood forming on her skin. Smoke rose under the bridge and people scuttled. Turning awkwardly, she strode on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light of the only Godgiven sun was on her back and it was right and it was pleasant to her; it soothed the pain in her right hip. She was still curious about her size and the world seemed alien to her now. She stopped briefly and winced and her body shivered for a moment; a breath deep as lakebeds was drawn and it was exhaled and she knew she had grown still larger, if only by a fraction. She strode on. She was large and she could not properly avoid people or vehicles in the streets and she ungracefully picked her way through the streets; the paving cracked periodically. Her body caught her eye in the panes of higher buildings and reflected her changed self; a profusion of blossomred curls and elegantly defined face and radiant eyes; the graceful slope of her neck and the unctuous succulence of her bosom, soft and cool like the ripeness of fruiting barrel-cacti; burning in desert sun, but swollen and plump with cold coalescence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood and her stance spanned the street. She inspected dispassionately the team of windowcleaners and they cowered on their platforms.  The girl leaned closer and the projection of her bust collided with structure; the men clung tightly and their water-buckets tumbled onto her breasts and she gasped at the sharp coldness. She eyed the glossy wetness of the building; she was thirsty and leaned to lick moisture from the glass. The windowcleaners descended and the girl angled and pressed herself to the building and the platform was pulverised by the crush of soft breast flesh; the sensation was cold and invigorating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The girl separated from the building and brushed the splinters and metal from the bounce of her bosom and she tried not to smirk at the cracks her size has impressed on the building. She strode on. Her head felt pleasant and light; she felt rosy and warm and the world assumed dreamy creaminess in the balmy sunlight. Her looming shadow coloured purple over the earth and was fringed with pink. Her silhouette cut sharp against the light and her heartshaped face was shaded and masked by dark red clusters of hair; radiant and fragrant and lush, she basked for moments in the brightglow and her skin was wet and ripe like a morning garden, dewy and hung with cool vapours; she twisted with slightness and her upper carriage heaved upwards, her form fleetingly, tremulous, and a moan warbled in her colossal gorge. A fine tapering hand convolved her thigh and her thighs pressed together and she bit her red lips delicately, another hand clutched in red hair, and a murmur of a bleat bled from the clasped lips. The girl, her eyes closed softly in a dose, felt the creeping in her skin; she felt her flesh rise beneath her touch; her hefty thighs spread and round out. She sleepily eyed the swell of her bust and felt her stature increase. She did truly love the feeling on growth and the flitting shadows of the people who panicked as she subtlety and gradually amplified, fed by the sun. She turned to the sun and she gaped wide her mouth to drink sunlight; if God ever did reveal himself He did not reveal himself so glorious. The sunswelled girl relaxed her features and she licked her lips and she stretched richly, her backbone and fingers cracking, and gazed as she panted heavily. She tentatively hefted and briefly massaged the tenderness in her breasts and felt on her fingertips and cool and wet sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blue eyes caught the gleam of the river in the distance and she seized the aroma of slowmoving river water\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Evening now in the glade of blooms, dark and moist is the air. Within this budding grove, wet Violets, inked abstractly, unfurl into becoming gloom; coils of black hate drip with stagnant, liquid corruption. Darkblotted pools form among the roots. The golden leafed Hazel tree bends down its slender, finely brushed, branches to touch the atramentous blossom. Through golden Brightness courses fear as moody, wet Darkness snaps. The vale of blossoms trembles with rage. A mask of ivory, graceful and heavenwrought, etched with rage; its coldness unbroken and elegance eternal; below the suggestion of a nose spread teeth, a maw of madness replete with daggers, inhuman and gaped wide; in the facelessness are two wells of black: within, set large sapphires glowing with pale luminance, expressing brooding thunderstorms. Brightness shimmers red and gold in the sundappled vale and flickers indistinctly from the damp and cold eminence of her twin, in all but likeness. Heat and light collapse into Darkness\u2019 flexuous black form; violets cry drops from their bodies which fall as tears of corruption, foul and rank flowerwater, the mask still unmoved. Pitiless is sister Darkness, but full of love is Brightness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavy clouds portend the scene, sponged in the air, the ivory-masked girl turns cold the air and freezes deep the ground, her breath hangs fleetingly in clouds and turns in the air, blooming violets upon the snowbound steppes attend our sense of her. The ardent girl of light and gold sports a mask of trembling pine, olive-hued and warm with woody smells, scion of Florentine seraphs and born of hazel trees. Golden feathers wreathe the fringes of her wooden mask. They are simulacra of artisan artificers, idols of masterwork stood among nature\u2019s darkening fronds. Each is written indistinctly in the mists of the vale, surrounded by blurred inky distaffs of trees.  Cool mist ornaments the air around the girls. The pine-masked girl, her body slender and tapering, cuts sharp, thin and silky, contours against our dying sun, elegant trails and strokes upon the parchmented air. They are drawn in fine and distinctly outlined contours, as rendered by calligraphy, ideograms of female forms, sharp straights and graceful curves. They waver and flit, ever so slightly and almost indistinctly, as the parchment of the day wears onwards. The wood-masked girl moves; her willowy limbs produce a staff of bamboo adorned with the wool of lambs. Her willowy frame flicks to and fro across the grounds and around the feet of the ivory-masked one, who remained, as ever, impassable, like a golden censer. Cloth now heavy with dark waters is wrung. The girl of bones, her body of damp, generously carved, ebony was unmoved, stood where rage had rooted her; petals on her wet black bough. Ebony encases ivory and hides its soft secrets. Xu\u00c3\u00a1n upon b\u00c3\u00a1i. Blossoms of plum haunt the alabaster of her sculpted projection; ebony warped to ridges at the prow by curved ivory. Across the bone mask a lilacing shard trembles with cold. The wispy girl with mask of pine, bright olive wrapped by scarlet and gold \u2013j\u01d0n embraced by j\u012bn s\u00c3\u00a8 and ch\u00c3\u00ac, casts a blanket over the ivory girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround them nature assumes colours and forms more distinct. The Violet hour is a hand and the buds blossom. Life fruits and unfolds at their sides; flowers and leaves hang from the heavenly canopy. A sprig of heliotrope adorns the wet, dark, coils of the ivory girl. The girl born of hazel boughs, still toting her staff, gazes with peridot eyes. She deftly returns her sedge hat to her golden head, crowned with tawny curls. Her eyes express joviality behind her warm mask, she perfumes the air with sylvan aromas. Her companion stands, still sodden, slouched in the half-light; her blue eyes twitch. Impishly the wood girl titters at her companion. Incensed by fury and flower perfume, the waterlogged ivory girl lunges towards the mischievous wood sprite; she adroitly dances from reach and fends with her pole; the ivory girl slips in the drying pools of befouled water and lands, tortoise, on her back. More blossoms fall delicately from the air. The whimsical sprite gingerly prods the recumbent ebony shell of the ivory girl. She trashes to dismiss further advances from the stick. The willowy imp sees holes in the testudine armour exposed; alabaster mountains riven by a chasm of darkness, rising and falling as the snowy-masked girl turtled in the puddle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer azure eyes caught her companion disappear and change in the air, inverted, and perch, simian, on a stump. Lavender fractured ivory in a fleeting expression of mirth. Sweeping aside the flowers that hung down, the sprite sprung to her feet with all the celerity and grace of a zephyr, and declared her intent. They, together, would journey from the vale and onto the niveous and expansive Steppes that would bring them to unknown wilds; rumours had reached her elfin ears of streams in the mountains that ran hot and steaming which pooled in a lake rimmed by alabaster rocks surrounded by structures of shining metal and white rock which where the remains of forgotten civilisations; beyond those the hot lake\u2019s basin, there were the ramparts of a monastic order, now enshrouded by dense mists, couched high above a lush valley, a place of solitude and repose; the valley then housed in its womb a stonework brewery, removed from epoch and tradition, barrelled high with amber wine and endlessly casked thunderstorms;  find the airy temple of the tenuous sky, citadeled at the foot of a mountain; beyond even that was to ascend the sacred mountain, from whose slopes and summit no traveller or pilgrim returns, which is the road to heaven\u2019s canopy, a bridge to the resplendent comics dome of the sky. That light at the mountain\u2019s summits that shines through a narrow pass, and is not obscured even by the cloying cloud and the wrath of snowstorms, lets one walk the path of ascension to the pale green sea of heaven; eternity and infinity come to you just through a dream and that is the realm of a Jade Empress\u2019 supremacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnger is quelled behind the ivory mask. The material darkness shifts and reforms. Her body swells rapidly; her massive chest warps her armour. Effort exerted, she rolled on her black carapace to her front pillowed by her breasts; limbs stretch; hands to claws; her body cracks and bursts from her shell, ferocious and wild, a laconic turtle no more. Reformed, She righted herself, she was seen to climb and rise, and rise, on her pearly legs; tower of ivory. She adjusts her garments of ebony; the ineluctable caprice of water appeared to have shrunk her black exterior. She was mistress of snow and water, brooding and impressive. Her companion twirled a long lock of hair around her hand like a golden tail, waggling her stick back and forth. The pit of the ivory girl\u2019s soul bred thunderstorms. She plucked the heliotrope sprig from her hair and wafted it under her face. Her azure eyes flickered. The wood masked girl sat upon a rock and surreptitiously frayed a long leaf dextrously with her deft and keen hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ivory girl drew herself up to her full height, her garments nestled to fit her tightly; her mask grinned horribly. The sylvan faced girl beheld her newly rejuvenated companion. She stalks ahead, impossible black and pure white breed in clouds; fangs are bared and she prowls the gloom as a bosomy leopardess, conveying size and savagery. She scampers to her side on her sliver-like limbs. The bone masked girl\u2019s ivory front could turn lances and is yet impenetrable by the shafts and barbs of arrows. Her pale fire burning in the forest of night. The wooden girl clocked the fearful asymmetry of the leopardess as she padded forward, imbalanced at her vanguard and an unstoppable bounce. Through her wet ebony hide, which clung like a skin, could be defined the cartilage of her supports, industrial and constructed for sturdiness, yet could not control her amplitude altogether and an unctuous bounce was sustained. Together they masquerade forward as lithe monkey and radiant leopard onto the Steppe, nature\u2019s staircase in the darkening world. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Vast and white, occasionally spattered with red blood of grapes, spilt in long gone-by battles that commemorated the 20th anniversary of the birth of the empress Evelyn, at which both the leopard of violets and the monkey of hazel boughs had been present. Together they ascend onto the endless plain. The simian girl talks and laughs; but, the leopard girl still recalls her murky plunge and continues to drip. The leopardess stops her journey momentarily; she plucks at her ebony hide. Black clings to white like a second skin. The masked monkey ascends further and round upon the leopardess. Impishly she plucks a frond from her fellow\u2019 hair and twirls it whimsically between her thumb and forefinger. The wet smell of the ivory girl hangs in the air, musky and damp, she growls like thunder as she preens her body. Mischief overrules the olive girl\u2019s mind; she laughs and swipes outwards with her slender hand catching one of the two ivory prominences of the other\u2019s body \u2013 a tart slap, a wobble and a bounce. A snarl from the leopard of violets and she pounces upon the simian of hazel; who, quick as ever, leaps, tamarin-like, from harms way and chitters with laughter. Fangs bared, the ivory masked girl caresses the raw and tender. With a heft and a bounce, all returns to the rightful balance and symmetry.  The leopard girl, gathering snow upon her frame, breathes clouds into the wind, twin worlds of ivory rise and fall. Studs stiffen and grow under black cloth. A deep purr reverberates in her throat. The wooden monkey averts her emerald eyes and gazes onwards. Best never to leap on a leopardess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walk, the leopardess slows, pauses and sneezes a little cloud of petals. The wooden-tamarin delicately springs to her side and lays a hand across her ivory masked companion\u2019s damp forehead. They must reach the end of the endless plain soon. The monkey seizes the leopardess\u2019 and drags her forward in a swirl of snow, her hair streaming like a golden scarf; silhouettes in the dying light, black against the sky. The duumvirate shades skim across the surface of the sea of snow, ascending. The wooden tamarin leaps into the air, slipping earthly shackles and dragging the leopardess with her. In an instant the length of a flutter of dewy eyelashes, they alight at the wooden arch which heralds the end of the endless. The tawny girl land in a graceful sweep. The ivory girl, less so, sprawled on her back; panting heavily, her huge chest swelling and deflating with rapidity. In the distance, mountains loom in watercolours, red and purple. Some moments pass and the parchment continues onwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverleaf, the pair reach the shores of the rumoured white lake. Soon scribbles of vapour rise from its green-hued surface. The leopardess approached the shore. She dipper her surprisingly elegant foot into the warm water. She drew a deep breath; this form was becoming tight and confining. The olive girl perched on a white rock at a distance and sheepishly eyed the other. The ivory girl strained against her tight, wet, hide. She dug her long white claws into her cloudy hide. Her white form swelled from below. She tore and raked and black slowly was stripped from ivory. Blackness came away in sheets. Her fangs bared and elongated in the half-light; Her body lengthened up and up, huge and white. The girl stood resplendent, a tower of ivory, her battlements heaved slowly. She snorted hot steam from her nostrils. Her great talons came upwards to shield her hanging bulwarks. Great plates of armoured ivory shifted as she adjusted and stretched her wide shoulders, now free of the increasingly shrunken black hide. The alabaster dragoness, titanic, submerges herself in to lake. Grown colossal, she fills the lake with her body. Her tiny, black, husk lies crumpled at the olive girl\u2019s feet\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet submerged beneath the rim of the bathwater in exhaustion. Hazel, sitting on the toilet seat, cracked a wistful smile\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Introducing, Do\u00f1a Evelyn de la Dubl\u00edn. Over a certain street in Dublin city, which I shall not name, there stood, not long, one of those winsome Irish girls who are never with a hanky in their jacket, an old hairband, high-cut plain panties, and a tartan brassiere. Some say her surname was Virag, or Fowler (for witnesses differ in this particular): however, we may reasonably conjecture she was called Bloomsbury, for this concerns us but little, provided we keep strictly to the roofs and the wharfs during this history. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou must know then, that our lady in times of leisure (which came often in years when supply-teacher work was sparse), partook often of long, therapeutic baths; which she did with that application and delight, that she was never unattended by overtures of cream and coconut; nay, she delivered such diligence to her nightly ablutions, that her skin was rumoured to be not unlike the softness of silk; by which she set great store and hoped to pass romantic muster: but among all rituals of cleansing, none pleased her like the washing of her hair; for the fruity aromas that accompanied the lather as she worked it through he soft auburn curls. She would often feel pangs of pleasure as she soaped each breast, till slippery and slick; repeatedly gathering them and releasing them, she would then slip herself more beneath the surface, up to her neck, and rise to wash from her soft chest the suds. For hours,our lady would then languish lily-like about he bathing, drawing warm water with her toes as and when she required; she enjoyed with relish the rubbery elasticity of her submerged haunches as they lay on the porcelain bottom of the tub; from time to time, she would thread her fingers through the underwater forest of her bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was this long harboured love of bathing on a hot summer's eve which stirred in the alps of el Do\u00f1a giganta's bosom; she gulped at the smell of slow riverwater in the air. Finding her caprices ripe for indulgence, she sallied forth towards the river which rested in the humid evening. Her, what we may call, vigour had begun to show signs of withering from her urban excursions; sweat formed on her verdes hips and dewed now on her throat: never had she been a lady well disposed to bouts of hot weather nor one to exert herself in such conditions (or ever for that matter); our lady swooned dangerously, but shook it from herself. Being graced with a cyclopean body, grown now to some enormity, our lady did her utmost to avoid trampling upon vehicle and person alike, which she found difficult; nay, impossible. The lady of Dublin felt beneath her sole the metal and glass as her weight was placed upon it; reeling at her misconduct, she hastily withdrew her Hekatonkheiresque self, staggering backwards, our towering Do\u00f1a tilting rearwards, the great green sails of her of arms flailing to right herself, her long spines scraping terribly against the foundations. The monstrous bulwark of her womanly haunches collided with the buildings behind her, her arms clutched to the neighbouring buildings for support of the interminable Do\u00f1a; the bosom of that colossal lady was thrust proudly skywards, where it buoyantly hung, lunar-like, over the street as Do\u00f1a Evelyn heaved and panted, apparently distressed by the encounter with the metallic oxen of the highway. From her lofty heights, the lady of evergrowing stature, eyes wide, cried, 'My apologies! My apologies! I fear my size has become too great!'; 'These street's ill-befit someone such as myself!' That indefatigable giantess attempted to remove herself from the foundations. Met with further screams, she pleaded thus in her thundering tones, 'Nay! Fear me not! I am not monster; I am like your good selves, just bigger!' Rubble fell from about the goodly lady's hulking rear as she drew herself from the building, slowly relinquishing her grip on the building. 'But, I grow no smaller: I only become bigger!' The graceful giant lady righted herself with a grunt, as much as a lady of her station might so do. 'Please retreat, for these new curves hinder my sight of those below me!' Our gallant lady steps forth once again with newfound temerity and practised grace. 'Worry not, Dubliners, for my long legs will bring me to a safe place!' The green sail of her arm reached out to steady herself as she tottered down the street; despite, honest intentions, our maiden of Dublin town knocked, from its perch, a chimney stack, now sent clattering to the street below. Shocked by her unconscious display of strength, the lady gasped, putting a hand to her mouth. Tilting, and then inclining dramatically, she was seen to stoop and attempt to peer into the alley with a colossal blue eye; a itinerant vagrant or wastrel backed away in the gloom against a bin, so small to her now, brandishing what appeared to be a bottle of wine, but the detail was too fine and her become too large. 'My apologies!' The dirty old scoundrel rushed towards our gargantuan heroine, who nimbly and expertly cried an 'Eiyeee!' of distress and affect much haste in beating her retreat from her inspections. As she rapidly righted her body, her lovely head clipped, unintentionally, the turret of the building, which broke with ease and it too tumbled to the street. 'Gracious!', uttered the prodigious maiden, rubbing her head where it had struck, 'You have my word! No need to fear! I am but a slightly bigger and more curvy mademoiselle  than you are accustomed to!' She plucked a large banner flag and-pole from her hair then momentarily contemplated. She tore the banner from the pole and flicked it aside, breaking a window pane; even that tremendous young lady of Dublin winced as the glass shattered. She repeated this process, imbued with purpose, her huge hands making deft work of what took many men to erect. Knotting the materials together, our resourceful maiden slung one across her hips and buttocks, straining to tie one end to the other owing to her girth; the other, she slung across her upper body to canvass her immense emerald endowments, the struggle was resolved by holding her breath momentarily and a quick knot fastened at the back. The capacious Do\u00f1a looked worriedly at the taught material stretched now across the round acres of breast flesh; and grew anxious as she breathed inwardly, which was accompanied by the inflation of her chest. Yet, it held true! Stayed fast! Our maiden then breath a sigh of relief; then twitched the sling to recapture a nipple which had popped outwards. To the spectators on the ground, across her huge backside ran the warped text ..<b>.BEST PUMPKI</b>...(disappearing momentarily into the parting between the two orbs it then emerged thus) ...<b>MPETION</b>. Across the from of her hips she wore a kilt of the Irish colours. The rooftop observers read upon the fabric now attempting to mask the glorious young maiden's bountiful buxom as thus: <b>MER'S MARKE</b>...(text then swallowed partly by cleavage or stretched into folds, but ended on the right breast with)...<b>SSIVE MELONS</b>! 'Good Gracious, how I have grown!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She stopped to hitch at her upper garments; 'These garbs are most restrictive.' She addressed a nearby rooftop, 'Be there any gifted-tailors among your ranks?' She leaned closer, 'No?', but the citizens only quailed as she loomed larger as she brought her head closer to them and so she saw fit to retreat. She took another tentative step onwards; 'I do then hope I am finished becoming bigger!' Unbeknownst to our huge heroin, a window frame came away embedded in her left buttock's cheek, from where it had pressed as she leaned inwards. With the utmost grace, that titanic Do\u00f1a bore herself along the street on long windmill legs, stretching with ease from one destination to the next. She emerged, valedictory, onto the wharfs by the river, which coped with her weight surprisingly well. 'At last!' Our lovely Do\u00f1a breathed in the river air. Free of the ordeal of evading pedestrians, the green beauty picked her way along a road bridge, littered now with abandoned cars. She tested, with a toe, the waters. 'What a pleasant surprise! It is most agreeable! More than adequate for a refreshing dip.' Extending her long legs, she stepped into the water, ' Ah, most delightful!' She waded inwards. Standing midstream, she turned disappointed: her gigantic rear gouged into the bridge as it swung behind the colossal maiden, taking away a chunk in its wake, 'Gracious me!' she cried, turning to lament the carnage the prodigious rotundity her rump had swollen of late with had wrought on the construct. 'I have indeed become a much more voluptuous maiden!' chimed she. Looking to her sides, she awkwardly sat down in the river and hugged her knees too her. 'Ho hum,' she boomingly mused. ' it appears t'is to be but a shallow bath for I; Where in past, nay, just this morning, when I was still but a little florist, the river had seemed so deep!' She let her legs stretch out in front of her into the river, 'Now I have becoming so large that it is simply a flowing puddle that comes only to half of these green shins of mine!'' She flicked the water with her hand, 'A deep puddle no doubt, but a puddle nonetheless. ' She looked to the bank and then to the other, ' It is queer, how large I must seem in your eyes...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo\u00f1a Evelyn was now cooling off. She let herself relax now, as she was she was used to; though in a bigger, yet more shallow bath. She rested her huge head upon the bridge. Dozing, she eyed the sun ; all was calmed around her by its balmy glow. She let her buttocks sink deep into the Liffey mud and silt; wormed her toes into it and pushed her clawlike fingertips into the muck. Her body felt soothed and gelid in the rivermud. At peace for the day.  Quest at the end. Sat by the shore, fishing. Wake up and have dreamt the whole thing. Shantih, Shantih, Shantih...The end of  the adventures Do\u00f1a Evelyn. The sun, bleary and hazy through dark eyelashes,  winked out of existence... Do\u00f1a. Done.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sometimes, when I had slipped into the bubbles, my head would fill with dreams so quickly that I had not even times to unwind and think to myself: \u2018What a hellfilled day\u2019.And half an hour later the thought that it was time to leave the water, and dry and dress for bed, would awaken me; but I would move amongst the water to create splashes and sloshes and make out as if I was leaving the bath, which had by then become much colder, and draw more hot water from the tap with my foot; I would continue, therefore, to dream in the bubbly waters for as long as contented me; mother and father being often otherwise engaged to be out of the house and being the oldest of three sisters...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-May 17th 2007 -  Mum and Dad are out to to tea at a fancy hotel for something or other to do with their firm; Yana has just got herself a new bra and insists upon flaunting herself, shirtless, in the sitting room while Sofia and I are watching telly; doing it just to annoy me, although it doesn\u2019t it annoy me : it hardly seems fair when she\u2019d two and a half years younger than me - perky little pest; sent her to her room to do homework.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-May 18th 2007 - Dreadful day at school: not in the mood; bed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-May 19th 2007 - Had a curious dream last night; I was down by the seaside, standing knee-deep in  the water; the waters were green;  the sky was meeting the sea not far from my eyeline; black distaffs of sails worked their way along the horizon under steely clouds; I felt very thirsty and the sweet lapped sweetly against my thighs so I cupped up a little pool of it and sipped; it was like sweet milky tea. The dream turned oddly in my unconscious head as I felt myself stretching taller; the horizontal black and white stripes of my swimsuit stretched and pushed outwards and bevelled as I swelled, I was taking  on an increasingly feminine and gigantesque stature; I felt like I could feel the water\u2019s lip dwindled on my legs: it was at this point that I leaned down to drink more deeply, cupping and gulping, cupping and gulping. The hitherto svelte ghost of my shadow stretched long and tall across the sands as my shoulders and head invaded the clouded sky; before long in my dream I had become so tall that the sea was a puddle in which I stood; the salty winds that skirted the pools around my ankles were rushed up to my head and blew gently through my hair; the morning sun warmed my face and my chest, my chest! I had a bosom! Huge, pillowy and soft. My dream clouded with the mists of the sea; the girls in their striped bathing suits, whose faces I recognised faintly, were blended with the sealicked stones and grayish sand and I was dimly unconscious therefore of striding towards the horizon; of the waters lapping and breaking against my thighs; of the waves rising to submerge my legs so that I came to stand waist-deep in the sea; and in the breakwaters about my trundled little boats of cloth and wood. I plucked one from water and giggled as I watched the little toy sailors run to and fro. The dream ceded as the gloomy sun went dim and the clouds turned black; the boat tumbled from my finger and I tried to catch it but I could not; with a tremendous splash I found myself, my little self, on board of that same ship, the sky was dark and the waves thrashed iron grey and my body was drenched - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Hazel tapped at the door and said she had dried my clothes or scavenged from somewhere other articles of clothing; I grunted a response through my lips flooded with bathwater so it became much more of what one would describe as burble; I did not feel the need to bubble my suspicions that any clothes Hazel might have garnered from about the flat would belong to Evie and would in fact be too small in the bust for me to wear......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis impression of having grown colossal would persist for some moments after I awoke; it did not detract from my reason, but fogged my mind and prevented it from registering the fact I was not of titanesque nor even Amazonian stature, nor possessed of such exaggerated endowments. Then it would begin to seem unintelligible, as the thoughts of a former existence must be to a reincarnate spirit; the subject of my dream would separate itself from me, leaving me free to apply myself to it or not; and at the same time my sight would return and I would be astonished to find myself broken into a cold sweat. I would fall asleep again, and thereafter would reawaken for short snatches only; I would bury the whole of my head in the pillow before returning to the world of dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n - July 1st,  2007 - School broke up for summer, thank Christ; went to beach with Ev and Hazel; lovely weather; think I have buggered my ankle. Ev is apparently helping run her mum\u2019s shop most of the summer and Hazel is gallivanting off to Venice apparently so I\u2019ll be alone for the whole summer. Knackered and need bed soon...going for a bath now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- July 2nd, 2007 - Feeling really tired today; can\u2019t explain it; vegged in an armchair and gorged on cereal, tea and biscuits; such a pig...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-July 3rd, 2007 - So bored/tired/hungry... all very interesting<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- July 5th, 2007 - Oh my god! I grew! ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-July 10th, 2007 - Got fitted for my first bra today! Nice white and read, threaded with a few strands of blue, tartan pattern, the elastic of it itches a bit, think I might be a tad allergic. I haven\u2019t half gone from ironing board to Cs practically overnight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- July 18th, 2007 - Still kind of hungover after the other night\u2019s bout of  underage drinking. On another note I think I\u2019m growing again; boobs are sore; hope I\u2019m right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- July 21st, 2007 - I was right, as usual! Bra is definitely getting much tighter; took it off tonight and it left welts in my boobs where it has been digging in; which, I might add, I love being able to write! To boot, I\u2019m getting taller; jeans look a bit short on me now: I\u2019m going to have to go shopping tomorrow for new clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuly 22nd, 2007 - And there it is, my chest has grown into a D and have got a few new bras, similar to the other one. In addition, I have apparently grown 3 whole inches taller since the start of the month. Off to Prague tomorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAugust 4nd, 2007 - Forgot journal when we were on holiday in Prague. Back in Dub. now; Prague is a beautiful city and food is to die for, I must have gained over a stone in weight, but it was very hot when we were there so a great deal of my time was frittered away in cafes or going out at night, and the city might be said to be more gorgeous by night, resisting dad\u2019s insistence on doing touristy things; luckily many of the clothes I\u2019ve outgrown now act like summer wear, albeit tight summerwear. It\u2019ll come as no surprise, journal, that,much to my parents\u2019 dismay, I kept right on growing while abroad: I consequently suffered no less than three blouse malfunctions. The first of these occurred when dining out in a restaurant, as I was eating my soup, a button pinged from my blouse and rang smartly off Sofia\u2019s glass, leaving me a touch exposed. The second, two days later, I swung back in my chair out of boredom and stretched, for the heat had fatigued me, when my yawn was somewhat interrupted by the ripping sound which attended my action; as it transpired, I had ripped the seams of my blouse, with tears running from my armpits. The last one was the following day, at breakfast I simply, and without warning, though I was dimly conscious of a creaking sound, just popped out of the top in a moment: mum decided that this was the last straw and took me off to get bigger blouses and bras, once I had put on something else tight, but not so tight. Mum was a little snippy at first before finally conceding that I can\u2019t help it: apparently I\u2019ve grown into 30G, which is apparently pretty big...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAugust 7th, 2007 - I have officially outgrown Yana! Mum pointed it out in the living room and Yana was raging. She denied it at first but Mum measured us and she\u2019s only 5,3; I\u2019m now 5,6!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAugust 9th, 2007 - Got my hair cut today; got a fringe which everyone says suits me and the rest was cut so it hangs a few inches above my shoulders; shaped around my face. My hair used to be very long really, apparently, or so I am told by those around me, my new style makes me look taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAugust  11th, 2007 - Oh my god, I suspect I\u2019ve grown again; my brassiere is feeling awfully tight and I hit my head on the cupboard door in the kitchen...this brabusting habit of mine is becoming quite inconvenient really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAugust 20th, 2007 - I was refitted for a bra today; Mum pleasantly blurted my bra size out over the dinner table, which Yana jumped at the chance to highlight meant I had become broader or wider in the back: I am also taller than Dad now, although he\u2019s quite small for a man, Mum says my genes are her side of the family through and through; Mum joked that at this rate we\u2019d be dealing with Attack of the 50ft Violet before the year was out; I was not thrilled by this conversation especially, although neither was Yana at that last comment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAugust 23rd, 2007 - Mum has furnished me with some Vitamin E oil, for stretch marks, of which I now have quite a few; I apply it before going to bed; it smells a bit strange and leaves me quite greasy and it comes off on my bedsheets...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAugust 25th, 2007 - Took Sofia to the beach to make the most of the weather; had to buy us both school uniform (Yana did it last week/ need to get Mum to pay me back...although she\u2019s spent a lot keeping me in clothes);Left it until the last second; back to school soon; on me it feels very tight and I am not altogether convinced about how long it will hold up if I keep growing at such a rate as I have done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAugust 27th, 2007 - Quick morning entry: School today; looking forward to seeing the girls after such a long time; put on my uniform; had quite a bit of trouble doing up my shirt buttons; I don\u2019t think I or my boobs are done growing yet, not one bit...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe<span class=\"cviolet\"> Little Violet</span> was not happy. The<span class=\"cviolet\"> Little Violet\u2019s</span> bath had gone cold because all the hot water had gone from the little white pot.

The<span class=\"cviolet\"> Little Violet</span> was cold.

Hurray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">Little Hazelnut</span> landed backwards in a higgledypiggledy pile:<span class=\"cviolet\"> Not-so-Little Violet</span> landed on top of her! <span class=\"ctan\">Little Hazelnut</span> was swaddled and squished by <span class=\"cviolet\">Not-so-Little Violet\u2019s</span> giant jubblies like big cushiony clouds. \u2018Sorry!\u2019 cried <span class=\"cviolet\">Not-so-Little Violet</span>  <span class=\"ctan\">Little Hazelnut</span> murmured something from below. \u2018What?\u2019 <span class=\"ctan\">Little Hazelnut</span> returned \u2018Mmmmnt mmmmmw\u2019 \u2018Sorry?\u2019 said <span class=\"cviolet\">Not-so-Little Violet</span> and moved a smidge. <span class=\"ctan\">Little Hazelnut</span> popped up and sputtered \u2018Don\u2019t.

VIOLET is markedly larger, at least double the size of HAZEL, and lies prone on top of a supine HAZEL. To the girls\u2019 left a nearby door leads to downstairs: to the right opens a bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE BELL: bring<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Both girls are startled by THE BELL: Violet lifts herself up on her elbows; they look at each other, electrified by the sound&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE BELL: bring<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;VIOLET hefts herself onto all fours in the cramped corridor, careful to avoid banging her head; her hand rests tentatively upon the ceiling: beneath VIOLET, HAZEL scrabbles to her feet, stooping to avoid a clout from VIOLET\u2019s huge chest. HAZEL runs through to the bedroom door to the right and carefully looks out of the window; presently she runs back to a stooped VIOLET.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: (whispering intently) Oh my...it\u2019s the fecking police!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET (draws a sharp breath and accidentally knocks her head off the ceiling: she bites her lips, which now carry definite hints of lilac, rubbing her head) Fucking low ceilings...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;in frantic whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: shhhh!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET: I am shhhing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: Well shhh more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET: (frustrated) I\u2019m trying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: SHH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;HAZEL listens for a second while VIOLET fumes above her, but keeps her mouth shut tightly&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: Hopefully they\u2019ve just gone away...they must be looking for whatever made Evie grow so big: I suppose that makes sense really; wouldn\u2019t want any more girls getting huge all over the place -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET: (exasperated whisper) It looks a bit late for that now Haze!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: Ah, yeah....but I suppose two\u2019s company, but three\u2019s a crowd?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;VIOLET\u2019s face says it all.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET: (again through gritted teeth) Not funny Haze...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;A moment of tense silence ensues&gt; <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: Hey Vi....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET: Mmmm?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: (uncertainly) I\u2019m...not sure that was normal tea you drank...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET: (cocking her head to one side) Really?

(she places her hands on the offended breast and tries to push VIOLET down the corridor.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET: (in a bitter whisper) Fine, fine, stop pushing...quit touching my boobs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET, never the most athletic girl, turns her back to HAZEL and attempts to crawl down the corridor, made more difficult now by her size: This means VIOLET\u2019s pale rump faces HAZEL, who cannot pass because VIOLET hogs the hallway with her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;more clattering&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;HAZEL stands impatiently, hopping from one foot to another&gt; <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: (whispering again) Can\u2019t you go any faster!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET: (gritted teeth) Fuck off, I\u2019m trying, for Christ sakes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL:  No need to take our Lord\u2019s name in vain...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET: (grunting mutedly) What!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: (a louder whisper) I said: No need to take the Lord\u2019s name in vain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET: (gritted teeth again) Are you being serious!? You better not be being serious!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL:  Hurry up Vi!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET: I swear to God, I\u2019ll squash you if you don\u2019t stop!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: There you go again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Before VIOLET can respond, another clatter from downstairs, voices in the street again&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: It\u2019s fine, keep going...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;comparative silence as VIOLET moves down the hallway: until a groan and a grun from VIOLET&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: (stepping closer to VIOLET\u2019s buttocks: teasingly, but still whispering) You better not fart Vi, what\u2019s up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET: Fuck off!  It\u2019s too small...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: What is?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET: The fucking doorway<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: I suspect it might be you\u2019re too big...It\u2019ll be those broad shoulders and massive  boobs of yours<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET:I know the problem. help please!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: Okay, hold on<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;HAZEL inspects VIOLET\u2019s hindquarters&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET: You know....if at 16, you had told me that I'd grow so big and so busty that I couldn\u2019t get through doors, I\u2019d never have believed you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: You\u2019d have lapped that up...you always wanted to big and tall with monster boobs Vi...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET: Well... I did get big with monster boobs eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: And now you\u2019ve got even bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET: with monster boobs...Who\u2019d have thought getting bigger would have such disadvantages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;HAZEL hurls herself against VIOLET\u2019s left butt-cheek and pushes, digging in her heels: VIOLET strains and grunts with the exertion of squeezing through the door...eventually, once VIOLET\u2019s larger top half squeezes through, the rest of her follows with comparative ease&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: (looking at the squatting VIOLET, with a tone of sympathy) Oh...Vi you\u2019ve got so big...<br>\r\nVIOLET: Mmmm...I never realised how awfully small Evie\u2019s bedroom is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: (shutting the door with a click) She\u2019s a small lady (going to the window)...well...not anymore, but she was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET: (fanning herself with her hand, the incredibly tight clothes she wears are becoming wet with sweat) It\u2019s roasting in here...(She repositions herself, stretching one arm over the top of windowframe and the other along the ceiling. She sits herself in a corner, taking most of that corner up.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: Looks like rain, to me...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET: (plucking at her chest) You know, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d mind growing into a monster girl if it means I get out of these clothes...I feel like I\u2019m ready to burst right out of them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: Well hopefully you don\u2019t grow anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET: Umm, yeah, hopefully...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;the sound of voices downstairs&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: They must be looking around...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET: Yeah, but it\u2019s only tea...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: And the mess downstairs, you made...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;VIOLET closes her eyes and breathes deeply&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: They\u2019ll search the whole place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET: Mmmm<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: You\u2019ll have to slip by...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET: How do you expect me to do that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: I\u2019ll distract them, easy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET: (with exasperation) I\u2019ll get stuck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: Nah, I\u2019ll help...I\u2019ll distract \u2018em then I\u2019ll come andpop you in the downstairs bit, where they\u2019ve already searched and send them away happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET: What will you say abou Ev?...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: I\u2019ll say something about bad mashed potato or a meteorite in the woods...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;They wait in silence: clattering and banging from below, men\u2019s voices muffled. HAZEL crosses to the door&gt; <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET: Haze...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: Yeah, babes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET: (gritted teeth) I\u2019ll get stuck<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: Nah, it will be fine<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET: (with a whine in her voice) Haze, I think I might be growing again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;HAZEL darts across the floor and puts a hand on each of VIOLET\u2019s mighty breasts&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: (in a serious whisper) Don\u2019t you dare Vi, Don\u2019t you dare!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET: I think I am...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: Don\u2019t you dare, it\u2019s tight in here as it is - hold it in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET: So tight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: Vi you\u2019re too big!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;HAZEL pushes her back against VIOLET\u2019s bust&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n HAZEL: Vi... we could really do with you not being any bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET: Oh you are being such a bitch about this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;HAZEL pushes her back against VIOLET\u2019s bust&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET: Nggg...I can\u2019t...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;VIOLET grows; her head inches towards the ceiling, her head bumps into the ceiling and her neck bends onto her shoulder as she grows in size, her face looks pained; her arm curves around the frame of the window and meanwhile the other bends and presses against the ceiling; her legs bend more and more in an attempt to conserve space though they keep growing. HAZEL presses and pushes against VIOLET\u2019s growing chest, in an attempt to stop them, but they swell bigger and bigger, soft flesh bulging around her hands. VIOLET quickly stops growing, both girls panting; HAZEL falls back onto the bed&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: (out of breath) Phew! You\u2019re getting too big to handle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET: (breathingly heavily) See what I mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: Okay, at least that was a small one...no problem<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;HAZEL rouses herself and slips out into the hallway and returns in a few moments, meanwhile VIOLET gingerly hefts her newly enlarged chest, pursing her mouth, HAZEL returns holding an armful of bottles&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET: What\u2019re those?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: Oils...Evie\u2019s got loads of them.<br>\r\nVIOLET: Why\u2019s this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: To stop you getting stuck again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET: But ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: Shh! Just trust me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;HAZEL proceeds to apply baby oils all over VIOLET, paying particular attention to VIOLET\u2019s shoulders and chest: VIOLET\u2019s clothes are, by now, sopping and impossibly tight.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAZEL: (inspecting a bottle) This stuff goes a long way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;HAZEL tosses the bottle, right, showtime&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shuddering with panic, Hazel swept from the table the box of teabags, slightly greasy with the oil from Violet\u2019s body. Clutching the little box to the slightness of her chest for a moment, she hesitated in the doorway; in the endless pause she became conscious of her breathing and of herself breathing rapidly, heard her blood in her ears and was hurt by the fluttering of her heart in delicate pigeon-bones of her rib cage. Like ribs knitting together; strain or even crack with a breath. Tightness in the chest; attributable to a mild form of arrhythmia present since birth.  Faulty hearted? Broken hearted? Murmurs of the soul? Abnormal electrical activity; sheet lightning in the clouds of my heart, cloud-to-cloud; Mama so worried; astraphobe for me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow she could hear Violet arranging herself and contorting her longer limbs to allow her comparative comfort. Long, longer, lovely limbs; willowy; not often that means big as a tree. She could dimly see the almost translucent pallor of what may have been Violet\u2019s shin, but could have been her arm. In the gloom Violet\u2019s skin glowed dully with blue shadowed tints in the half-light. Skin like a huge pale squid, colour of the moon on dark water; taught, all litheness and rubbery; thick and supple; slicked and wet from the depths; coming up, too slow for the bends, through a thrumming sea of packed ice; Leviathan rising; Leviolet more like; whale in white; old testament; Moby Dick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazel became conscious of herself again, now of her thoughts prolonging the moment definitely, cluttered full of cloudhearts and giant violets. Hazel, as she tried to move, skittered on the floor where Violet had gone by. Soles of Vi\u2019s feet in the doorway, purpling in the sick fluorescent light. Landing on her bottom, the box sprung open, scattering teabags: Hazel hastily gathered those that she could see and returned them to the box, which has become dented, and those prone to springing open, when Violet had blundered past. Biting her lip, Hazel forced down the lid. A call from upstairs again. Hazel, returning to the awning of the door threw, overarm, the box of teabags into the gloom and, leaving Violet to hide it further beneath the floor, she shut the door behind her. She dusted the tea from her blouse in little puffs before returning upstairs to relay to the policemen and women that there was, unfortunately, no tea in the shop.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\nOnly dimly conscious of the time trickling away upstairs as Hazel deflected the police on her behalf, Violet sat sulkily in the gloom and damp of the cellar, pouting and sighing, though she was conscious now that her breathing was louder, by a great deal, than previously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shifted uncomfortably; ass freezing ; is this floor made of fucking ice!? Sitting on a glacier? Sitting in a sort of gloom-filled nadir while, so to speak, going \u2018up\u2019 in the world; she\u2019ll have no problem going up in the world Dad said; now I\u2019m sitting on top of the woooorld, just growing along, just growing along\u2026.pfft. Wonder if it\u2019ll come to that though? Wonder how big Evie is now? Much bigger than me; could still show Yana though; little bitch hated it when I blossomed, finally started growing; Turned into \u2018Juggasaurus Rex\u2019; put her in her place. There was that boy from her class, John or Jim or something, going out with her over the summer; poor bugger had to watch me grow, and then grow some more, over those months when visiting her, bigger than her: bigger than him by the end; boobs as big as his head by the time they broke up. Got so shifty when we were in the living room, I was between bra sizes then, stuffed into one; practically popping out of it, stretched out that red jumper something awful; sweater stretchers. Melons, melon farming; I am a rather splendid melon farmer, as farmers of melons go. In eastern lands, glazed with rain and mist, wet. Ripened low on the breathing earth; damp, juicy. Vision comes and goes through the haze, dew-speckled. Minds wanders to the mountains, swelling up out of the mist, green and huge; mind over melons...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe better hurry up, up there. Violet yawned widely, resolving in a high pitched sound which she hoped wasn\u2019t heard upstairs. She looked down at the lurking white flesh of her chest, indistinct; submerged; blubbery and white. Back hurts; used to be big, but now really swelling up; forgot what a pain growing was...and how tiring. Wouldn\u2019t think I\u2019ll end up as big as Evie, wouldn\u2019t want to; bit weird, she\u2019s the tall one now though, got used to being that out of the three of us: she\u2019ll be the one, when shopping for clothes, complaining that nothing fits properly, with an air of secret glee. She picked languidly, with a huge, longboned hand, at the taught, greyish gauze of her stockings, which were severely to laddered and frayed by the swelling flesh of her calves and thighs; the elastic which held them up dug tightly into the soft, white skin of her thigh, which bulged on either side of the divide. Slowly creeping her hand up her thigh, her fingers plucked the red material of the borrowed, and now drastically stretched, panties which, too, dug into soft, supple flesh, stretched thin by her expanding hips and buttocks. She bit her lip and snorted in frustration, all attempts to loosen the pants having failed. Even Ev\u2019s pants aren\u2019t big enough, especially for her now! She has quite a set on her, real bulwarks; lovely bellshape to her; Bells of Notre Dame; the names? Hmmm... Emmanuel is the biggest, or at least the heaviest. Marie, who\u2019s probably the widest...most like Ev\u2019s hips...and Marcel, yeah like Proust. Maurice, ol\u2019 Moe. And Jean-Marie, Gabriel too. There\u2019s one called Denis or something; Then there\u2019s the really French one\u2019s: \u00c9tienne Beno\u00eet-Joseph  Anne Genevi\u00e8ve, how did I forget that one!? God my accent is awful...probably not the time to work on it though. Where was the point...Ah yes, Ev\u2019s hips. Violet attempted, without much success, to liberate her gusset from the stretched and tight underwear.  Yeah, she\u2019s built, fine piece of architecture, like a church, more of a cathedral, with ebullient ogee curves for hips and haunches, like the arabesque spires on St. Mark\u2019s: Dad once quipped I was \u2018built like a jetty\u2019 and should \u2018marry a pier\u2019; I think he stole that, it\u2019s too witty\u2026 Probably could get my claws into an aristocrat now if I wanted, Duke of Something or Baron Von Whatever would suit me nicely, a handsome european, not some horsetoothed Brit in galoshes; Erzherzogin Von Rosenkranz, probably couldn\u2019t keep my name though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh Austria, in the Alps, huge house, like an alpine Elsinore; I barely fit through the heavy wooden doors; by the fire, a shaded man coming cleaer, draped in fine, deep blue, with a short , black beard, slicked back hair and a glass of wine; couldn\u2019t resist a girl like this, tall, very tall, and skin as white as driven snow: oh but, if he did, tried; I could make him if I wanted, make him love me, especially if I got even bigger, I\u2019d shake a little, holding back the tears then I\u2019d get bigger and I\u2019d get bigger; head soon among the rafters; shoulders soon cracking them, while my head pushes against the roof as I get bigger and taller: I wonder if, as I get bigger, which at this stage seems almost inevitable, I get stronger? Could snatch him up in one hand, squash him if he wouldn\u2019t love me, between my fingers, between my boobs. Pop him in my mouth; stick him in my snatch, get what I want\u2026If I was a little bigger, I could make a few changes to the way people see me, towering, surrounded by snowpeaked mountains...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet reclined her head, but bumped it against the ceiling. Stifling a swear, she bit her lip. Spreading her legs, her foot met with something small and cold out in the cloying darkness. Must be the tea\u2026 She felt it small and hard under the soles of her feet, a little brass lozenge, and curled her toes. Just above her head, there came the sound of footfalls, sharps and crisp clicks which must have been the police followed by shier and softer ones which must be Hazel. The floorboards creaked from place to place as they moved; she could hear voices too, easy to pick out though her eyes were shrouded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden scuffling came from above, a little plume of dust fell in front of Violet\u2019s face. Hazel\u2019s voice came again from nearer the door to the cellar, and getting closer. Violet faintly heard Hazel place herself against the door. Panic ignited in Violet\u2019s prodigious chest. Feeling the tea-box still beneath her sole, she dragged her foot towards her; she heard the doorknob faintly jangle. Her foot brought towards her, so much so her knee must be nearing the ceiling, she awkwardly fumbled in the darkness beneath her. A shrill, forced laugh from Hazel came through the door; Violet\u2019s long fingers closed around the little box and inelegantly lifted it to her eyes: her huge, powdery blue eyes quivered to focus on the box, dwindled so little now in her fingers. Fear coursed through her chest again as she heard the muffled deep voice of the Policeman: without any thought, Violet popped the box into her mouth, crunched and swallowed\u2026The moment receded though. Violet ran her tongue along her teeth and twisted her mouth. Hazel\u2019s got a silver tongue on her if she stopped them! Can\u2019t believe she managed it all. I hope that tea - Ughh, don\u2019t feel so well\u2026 Violet stifled a wretch, convulsing and almost hitting her head. Think I\u2019m going to be sick. Violet\u2019s stomach churned and groaned; she reached down her hands, laying them across her stomach, feeling it almost distend and swell. She twisted her mouth and convulsed again, this time thumping her head, hard, against the ceiling...Fuck...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hazel smiled as the police moved from the shop. Outside she could see it had begun to rain and it already streaked the windows. Hazel\u2019s mirthful smile waned as there came, from the floor beneath the police, a cracking and creaking of wood. The bearded policeman turned and cocked an eyebrow: \u2018That was - nothing?\u2019 Hazel ventured unconvincingly. Hazel sighed inwardly with despondency as the splintering and rupturing of the floor revealed the dark crown of Violet\u2019s head tumescing from the ground like a volcano.  Hazel could see thin streams of the inky slopes of Violet\u2019s hair turned to purple, amethyst veins embedded in the obsidian and others paler like falling wisteria, like lavender magma flow across black rock. The mountain of Violet\u2019s head rose further from the floor; the police stepped backwards from the widening circle as Violet grew; her large eyes, ringed by a plum corona, rising up over the lip of the boards like twin moons over a lake, Violet winced as her nose, the size of which she had always been sensitive about, pried up the floorboards in front of it as it grew and lengthened. Soon her head had all but erupted, rising before them, her twisted mouth like a shard of glacier ice, blushing indigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Violet showing no sign of ceasing to grow and that her swanlike neck was sprouting up from the rupture, Hazel, suspecting what was to come, stepped back slowly towards the wall. Catching the eye of the bearded policeman, who, like the others, stood in a rapture of confusion and amazement, Hazel crooked a finger to them. Before a reaction could be elicited, the floorboards heaved beneath them, the planar wood becoming more and more convex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Violet\u2019s head bloomed further upwards, the floor began to sunder and break, seismically, as if shook asunder by her expansion: visible between the fissures that spread across the floor, or where an over-tensed floorboard had sprung away, was the ashy flesh of Violet\u2019s colossal breasts as she and they grew, the effect not unlike snowy lava bursting up from the earth\u2019s crust. Continuing to swell, the dark crag of Violet\u2019s head was nearing the ceiling; her huge shoulders had wrenched through the floor and the floor burst apart before her, revealing the dark chasm of her cleavage, but Violet swelled, like she was filling with magma. Hazel watched as Violet\u2019s breasts welled up to bulge through the void, overflowing in a magnificent crest of cleavage like the flesh of immense boiled eggs. The floor had become unstable, fractured by the growing Violet, whose swelling seemed now to be shuddering to a halt, and this resulted in one policeman plunging, headfirst, into the taught divide of Violet\u2019s cleavage, where his blackbooted feet and legs waved like grass in the wind. Violet, one eye shut and her head brushing the ceiling, glanced down in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet struck Hazel, as she regarded the length of her elegant and thick neck and followed it up to her friend\u2019s faintly shaded face, like she was an egyptian monument, hewn from some opalescent stone and half-buried in the sand, yet hummed of entombed size and greatness. Violet had, obviously outgrown the casing of her clothes, again. It occurred to her that Violet bursting through the floor was not entirely unlike an insect imago emerging. Violet had always had a soft spot reserved for moths above most insects, perhaps, Hazel now thought, because of the parallels she drew with herself. To see Violet at 16, still in her embryonic stage, a dull little egg just on the cusp of hatching, one would never have suspected that the latent bloom of true puberty would transform the gloomy and sickly, dark-haired and pale young girl into a statuesque and bosomy swan, taller than many men, suffused with a haunting pallor. Hazel could remember, even as her own growth from puberty was slowing, seeing Violet grow in abbreviated meetings across the summer. Each time Hazel saw Violet she was taller, and in Hazel\u2019s eyes seemed stronger because she was taller, and she had become more ample, seeming to be invigorated the more full-bosomed she became. From the parting at the start of summer, Violet had grown as tall as Evie and as Hazel embraced her she felt the plushness of apple-sized breasts press against her ribcage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the second meeting, Hazel was greeted by a Violet who had grown to match her in height, if not fractionally taller; their embrace could now consist of pecks on the cheek, without any stooping, and Hazel felt faintly squashed by Violet\u2019s cuddle, and felt her pert, tight breasts pressed upon by big grapefruits, pulpy and soft; the girls had enjoyed a walk together, that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA third time, Violet, returning from Prague and having grown again, was seen to clear Hazel by several inches and her chest had ballooned as well. It was Violet this time who had to incline to peck Hazel on the cheek. Sitting at dinner, Hazel could see from the splaying gaps between the buttons of Violet\u2019s shirt how much she had grown since last time. Anyone unacquainted with Violet\u2019s track record, over this particular summer, would have been surprised to know that she was not done growing, returning from the summer even taller and continuing to grow, much more gradually, over the coming year. Hazel remembered Violet\u2019s mother expressing the fear that Violet would just keep growing and never stop, the fear obviously being born out a need to keep Violet in bras and clothes as quickly as she could outgrow them (Yana and Sophia receiving many of the stretched cast-offs), until it resulted in Violet having grown to such an extent that she could clutch a screaming Hazel in one hand and, with the other, swat at aeroplanes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho would have supposed that this flourishing constituted only the transition to a larval stage in Violet\u2019s life, commensurate with that of a moth? She had gushed from the egg of prepubescence in a new mould, still glossy and wet, to prepare eventually, though she remained ignorant of this, for bigger things.  A few hours previously, and years later, the larval Violet had pupated and begun to change once again. Fueled seemingly by the dormant energy inside her, Violet had proceeded to expand and change inside the cocoon of the room, her movement impaired and her body changing more drastically, luxuriating; warping and twisting itself into something else, not quite a flower and not quite a girl, but bigger than either. What Hazel was seeing now was Violet\u2019s eclosion, her emergence again in a new form, this time bigger and bustier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as a moth or butterfly erupts from a silkspun cocoon as a gossamer vision, Violet grew out of the cellar, the new Violet as before becoming larger and only more radiant. Violet had consumed so much space in the cellar that her breath had condensed about her body: this created about her the impression of having only just split her cocoon and was still moist with sweet dew of the casing. It followed that Violet was still undergoing her eclosion, still not wholly grown into a tremendous moth: that the whole building was her cocoon, not the cellar, and her monstrous friend rising up through the floor was, in fact, still growing. Hazel was shocked in thinking that the bosomy creature, unfortunately given to the crushing of people\u2019s hearts, she had entered the shop with had only been the unpleasant, wormlike precursor to the huge creature heaving herself  from the floor, who would be capable of crushing not only souls, but bodies. The boys who had sneered at the dull egg of the jewish girl in youth would howl in despair now as the ripe and still dripping imago of a jewish goddess was slithering from her tight cocoon and ascending towards the sky in all her snowy, bosomy glory. Hazel surmised that Violet must have been affected, in the way Evie was by the tea and the cactus, by the tea and either an orchid or, and perhaps most likely and most appropriately, by the flower which bore her name. Shaded by the ceiling, Violet\u2019s hair was dark and glossy, her fringe, like that of those little painted japanese doll, hanging like curtain, but splayed so as to reveal her big eyes. These icy blue eyes were increasingly ringed by a corona of colour, pavonian and beautiful, while  in the irises themselves bloomed flecks of gold, hanging there like pollen suspended. The swathes of skin which were visible had turned to a white-blue quality, like she had etiolated underneath for some time, but here and there this icy colouring had become mottled by indigo. As the immense butterfly heaved a breath the dusty from the floor lifted too and the floor trembled and creaked as her chest expanded upwards and outwards. On the hillocks of breast-flesh, Hazel could dimly distinguish the traceries of violet-blue veins which spread across Violet\u2019s almost translucent skin in a rich filigree, like patterns in the Russian snow. Hazel fancied she could hear, or rather feel through her feet, Violet\u2019s large heart beating like tympany, pumping empurpled blood through the snowy mountains of her limbs and body. Hazel balked a little to think of her friend\u2019s strength, which was apparently only increasing with time, for Violet was always prone to swings in her mood and was often pronounced by teachers to be temperamental: Violet\u2019s mouth, which was no longer curled slightly in amusement at the man lodged in her cleavage, but about which there lingered the slight twist of discomfort which was suffused with an almost cruel aspect as she attempted to examine the police elsewhere with some annoyance - this, for all she had undergone huge changes, testified to Violet\u2019s somewhat capricious nature when it came to those other than herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hazel mused on Violet\u2019s dark, Cleopatrine hair, one policeman produced a radio; Hazel, making as if to stop him, was politely and calmly restrained by a policewoman.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Violet\u2019s head bumps against the ceiling, shaking loose pale plumes of dust down onto the floor below. Unable, because of her pinioned arms, to rub her head she pursed her lips tightly, drawing them in, like sheets of silk, to a thin, slanted blue line across her face. While, speaking more generally, her whole body felt fatigued from the comparative trauma of growing to many times her original size, speaking specifically though, her legs and body ached dully with stiffness, from enclosure in what essentially amounted to a wooden box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Hazel\u2019s willowy limbs pinned behind her like tied cornsilk and seeing the delicate porcelain of her friend\u2019s little doll\u2019s face twist in pain and alarm, Violet glowered down the slopes of her shoulder, the blood already high in her veins, from the heat and embarrassment, became quickly channeled into the gullies of Violet\u2019s rising rage. Confused by the police buzzing about her like blue and fluorescent locusts and which increasingly turned to irritation, which was in turn exacerbated by the pain originating from the serrated teeth of the floorboards gripping her huge soft chest and thick upper arms. Attempting to shift herself, Violet succeeded in spearing her monstrous chest and, from the recoil, her arm. Looking down she saw, beginning to seep slowly from her arm, came lilacy blood. She looked from this to the woman holding Hazel. Baring her teeth, like a siberian tigress in a snarl she bellowed a: \u2018HEY, Bitch!\u2019, which shook the pots about the shop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground trembled as Violet, gritting her teeth against the pain, wrenched a huge, ashen arm from the floor with a succession of cracks, like the root of some colossal tree bursting from the soil as the trunk topples to earth. Crying a relieved \u2018Hnnngah\u2019, Violet\u2019s left arm sundered out of the floor and stretched out; her finger flexed and, now free from the crampedness of the cellar, her muscles bulged like pillows as she tensed them. To the police and Hazel, Violet\u2019s arm, with its long, tapering fingers, looked not wholly unlike the played limbs of a tree in winter or an achromatic hydra, casting back and forth. Violet, now more unpinioned, swatted a nearby chair towards the policeman with the radio, who was bowled over by the flying chair: Violet giggled cruelly at the man knocked from his feet by her strength - she had had little chance to measure her brawn against other people; obviously she harboured an advantage in height, that was plain from being around Hazel, but it had not totally struck her how much stronger, or heavier for that matter, she must be compared with anyone who didn\u2019t match her in size. Though she was right handed, Violet has played viola since she was very young, which left her left arm and its long fingered hand lithe, strong and deft and, if she was to place the soft palms of her hands together, larger by a generous fraction than her right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArching and narrowing her blue eyes, Violet reached for the policewoman who held Hazel. Hazel ripped herself from the woman\u2019s hold, Violet\u2019s huge splayed fingers grasped the woman, enfolding her in a strong and supple prison, like twined willow branches. Violet smirked hollowly at the woman struggling in her hand as best she could, it felt as if her held a delicate little bird; she could feel the woman\u2019s bones, fragile compared with the strong bones of her own digits. Lifting the unfortunate woman from her feet, she brought her fist up towards her face; Violet found it somewhat difficult to focus on her, Violet\u2019s blue eyes fastened their gaze on the blonde woman, who still twisted in her clutches, Violet noticed that, although it could be an impression created the police uniform\u2019s defensive padding, this woman was quite well-endowed for a 'rozzer'. Not as much as her though; the woman was suspended above the bulging and swollen testaments to this fact, but, even before Violet had been graced with a few growth spurts, Violet massively outsized this woman, an advantage gained by eating constantly, like a pig, and a superfluity of growth hormones. Violet wondered, mostly in jest, whether if she squeezed she could make this woman\u2019s boobs swell and pop out of her jacket. The woman looked into Violet\u2019s face, larger, in all probability, than herself; she saw the woman\u2019s blue lip curl and she rumbled out: \u2018Not so tough after all?\u2019 She grinned, holding the woman close to her face. Distracted by a tickling in her cleavage, Violet broke her gaze with the woman\u2019s body to view the crevasse of her boobs, jiggling slightly from the thrashings of her man lodged therein. Laughing hollowly again, she strained again. The policemen and women to Violet\u2019s right, skittered away from the heaving line of the floor. Like her left arm, her right arm sundered the floorboards as she broke it loose from them. Once free, Violet languorously brought her arm sweeping across the room to pluck the wriggling policeman from the cleft of her bosom, like a thrush pulling up a worm from the soil, where he dangled from between her long finger and thumb from his foot, panting for breath with his face a peculiar shade of blue.  Coyly, she swung him gently back and forth, still grinning like a moonbeam. Her smile waned as she saw the jagged teeth of the floor had grazed the soft, white-blue flesh of her upper arm, from which droplets of blood had begun to form, but sea-green in colour; the sight sickened her slightly; dropping the woman abruptly, she touched her arm tentatively with her fingers, examining the blood, smearing it between her fingertips and thumb. To her it seemed sticky, almost like syrup or sap; the colour reminded her of the sea during coastal gales, like her blood had been churned into a frenzy by her tempestuous and violent growth spurts, which more than likely meant that the storm would not die down after all, but instead was still whipping up and that a more colossal tidal wave of growth, castellated with floral alterations to her physiology, was cresting the horizon and surged ever higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet felt a fluttering in her stomach and gulped. From somewhere beneath her, Violet heard voices and shouts she did not recognise shout at her to stop and to put the man down and to stay calm, all of which frankly annoyed her.  Violet sneered and cast about her as best she could. \u2018Do you not think,\u2019 she boomed, dropping the man, \u2018that I would stop growing if I could!? God, you lot sound like my mother!\u2019: silently, Violet, was taken by the deepness of her voice in her throat. The policeman with a beard had cupped his hands and was shouting something about staying calm and trying not to cause any more damage, which succeeded only in further aggravating the huge girl. Violet\u2019s touchy ego had inflated right along with her body. Never one to shy away from loggerheads even when smaller, growing had succeeded in swelling her pride also: since bursting the floor with just the force of her expansion and then rending it apart with her arms by way of an encore, it had begun to dawn on Violet just how much strength and clout her size was giving her as she became bigger - Violet was big and she knew it. Hazel approached the police officer and tried to broach the topic of Violet\u2019s somewhat erratic temper, when the woman Violet had cast aside, rather unadvisedly, chose that moment to vent her rage towards Ms. Rosenkratz and dug her taser into the flesh of Violet\u2019s underarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet cried out in pain and alarm, shaking the room as she jumped. Violet cast about furiously: \u2018Oh you little bitch!\u2019, the police were edging towards the door, \u2018And where do you think you\u2019re going\u2019, Violet planted her huge hand across the door. In frustration and pain, Violet fumed further: \u2018I could just about ----nnnngggh\u2019. Violet\u2019s eyes widened as she stopped, as if paralysed, her teeth gritted: grunting through her teeth \u2018nngg---oh you are so for it now\u2019. Hazel, ushered the bearded policeman forward, along the floor edging of Violet\u2019s heaving breasts, which lurch from her breaths like a white sea. Violet\u2019s breath came deep and heavy, growing and intensifying in vigor, becoming with each heave more guttural and harsh, so that her breathing sounded less like gales through the pine trees and more like the growl of thunderclouds. The ceiling was already cracking and the floor was breaking up. As the crossed the skirting of the floorboards, instants before it was broken off by the rising tide of flesh, Hazel could feel Violet\u2019s heart beating. Violet\u2019s hand still covered the door and was creeping quickly stretching across the breadth of the facade; the bearded policeman hastened to the window and smashed it with his truncheon, hopping through first and pulling Hazel through afterwards - the other quickly followed suit, until her Violet\u2019s palm entirely consumed the paned facade. Inside, there came a splitting and cracking as Violet\u2019s shoulders thrust through the lower ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside rain fell on the street. After some time, Violet\u2019s hand disappeared from the door: after more cracking, the bearded policeman, cigarette tucked in the corner of his mouth, gestured to the upper window, which was now blocked by more white flesh. It became apparent to Hazel that Violet was growing far more than she had done hitherto. They could see the whiteness of her thighs, bulging up against the door windows, having since swollen too large for the cellar, unfurling and rising. Motioning upwards, the policeman pointed to the slated roof, which was tumescing like a volcano - it was clear Violet had decided to stand up. After a few more moments of growth, the roof exploded in flurry of cloven slates and shards of water, revealing Violet\u2019s huge, dark head and her broad shoulders rising from the ruins. Straightening herself up to her newfound height, Violet\u2019s shadow grew across the onlookers as she loomed high above them in the rain. Her huge face was\u2026.</span></div></div>",

Looking up from the wet asphalt, Violet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stature, outlined against the darkening sky and the iron clouds, forming out of the sunset like cooling slag, seemed, through the play of streetlights and the rain and the intercession of the dying daylight, to glow with a strange lambency. This greenish twilight broke across the broadness of her shoulders, seeming to to pour down her spine and girdle her hips and buttocks, the contours of which, as she became taller, had exaggerated more and more femininely, and lit Violet from behind, causing her shadow to stretch over the street. To Hazel, the darkness of Violet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hair and the darkness of the sky threw over her face a shadow that obscured her huge, pale and gold-flecked eyes, socketed  in her marble skin, ringed by a black and glistening crown like a briar thicket. The ends of her hair curled more in the rain; a black ribbon stuck to, and followed, the contour of her jaw, which jutted out from beneath the shade and the blackness like a white crag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3c0Ot8gS810/UVnxjX8CmBI/AAAAAAAAAN4/621ZYzHAQlA/s1600/Athens%2B-%2BStatue%2Bof%2BAthena.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3c0Ot8gS810/UV...</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere and there across Violet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body, thrown up by the light, were mottled patches of indigo, spreading across the white-blue in a filigree, like the presence of dull, semi-precious stone through rock, that looked in the half-light like bruises, and it was, thought Hazel, possible that the matter of growing out of a building might have left Violet bruised. This was drawn from the few scratches Violet had sustained from the splitting wood and shattering of slates as she grew; two short scratches ran on her forearm and on her thigh, while one, longer than the others, adorned the softness of the inner part of her upper left arm and to Hazel, though neither bleed profusely, the rain seemed to wash blue from these cuts. The pain attending the taking on of giant stature was further evidenced where Violet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body bore other signs of the stresses of growth; in delicate lines, where Violet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body had expanded most violently and abruptly, her skin had developed stretch marks, shreds which faintly ridged her quilty breasts; the cleft of her pillowy buttocks; the curvature of her hips and hatched the spread and swell of her thighs and stomach like blue shadows. It should be added, occurring as it did to Hazel, that for years now Violet had possessed stretchmarks, particularly on her breasts and back, ever since the rather violent onset of puberty, the result of suddenly growing much taller and her ribcage and bust detonating outwards being the laddering of her back and the moraine effect, a fading of the red starkness, left behind on her chest in the aftermath of her expanding bustline, which reminded Hazel, whenever a drunken embrace from Violet had smothered her into Violet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arrayed cleavage, of the slopes of white mountains pushed upwards and formed by the passage of some massive glacier. Although Violet had lessened these scars, slicking her body with oils to fade them, they remained behind as reminders of Violet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sudden and violent growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cloudcover moved and Violet could be seen, one eye gazing down, smiling with degrees of awkwardness and nervousness with her eyebrows turning upwards and her left cheek could be seen, flushed increasingly the colour of wisterias in bloom. Hazel heard something creaks deeply and briefly, this could have been the rafters of the shop or the last sputter of Violet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growth spurt, she found it hard to tell. Violet, made conscious of bareness of her chest by the swelling of its immensity in and out of her peripheral vision, gathered their weight, as best as she could, and held them with her huge hands, the largeness of which had always irked her, despite the unwieldiness of each breast\u00e2\u0080\u0099s immense size, the comparison invited by this and the supported added made Violet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chest seem even larger to Hazel, and she drew an enormous thigh across and crossed the other, leaving revealed only a gorse of lavender, speckled with rain, between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://thewellnessdoer.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/lavender.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://thewellnessdoer.com/wp-content/up...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazel wondered now how tall Violet stood, it was hard to gauge from the angle but she definitely, at least, exceeded her mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anticipation of a 50ft daughter. The policemen and women, though obviously dispatched to the shop in light of one immense girl, still reeled from the arrival of another girl grown giant. Though Evie had seemed to Hazel to be huge, an impression only accentuated by the partial view of only her buttocks filling her window in the late afternoon sun, but Violet appeared immense to Hazel, though there could only have been a few feet between them. But given, thought Hazel, the tendency for these girls to grow sporadically and often dramatically, it was not unreasonable to assume that, in the time intervening since Hazel had taken her eye off her, Evie had become much larger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/43/cb/14/jardin-de-cactus.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/p...</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more lights came on about the street, Violet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breath seemed to catch in her throat as she heaved a breath causing her to hack and to cough, deep and throaty enough to shake the chimney pots. Standing by a lamp-post, Hazel saw what looked like a slight spark in the air come from Violet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parted lips, seeming like a pine needle falling in the night, and fly across the street, jangling against the slates of the house behind Hazel and clinked into the gutter, where it came to rest. This apparently escaped the notice of the policemen and women, who were busy radioing this and that while Hazel titled her head to inspect the guttering, blinking when the rain, which had attenuated to that drifting drizzle, fell onto her eyes. Violet, finished coughing, let her gaze wander from Hazel and the police to the length of the street and across the rooftops with the little turrets of the chimney stacks. Violet, finding herself now tall enough to see over the rooftops, could faintly distinguish on the other side of the slanted row the sweet shop she used to walk by as a little girl, holding her mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand, which now had the character of a ornate and delicate doll\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house. Recalling the doll\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d had as a child, which had her mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beforehand and was built by her maternal grandfather back in Poland, Violet remembered the strange enjoyment she felt in pretending that she was a giant little girl, peering in through the tiny windows with her long-lashed, blue eyes. Violet had been told by her grandmother, when she must have been about two years old, that if he ate all her gulasz she would grow up to be both du\u017cy and pi\u0119kny and, thinking of the doll\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house, Violet had done so, while Yana, who was only a baby, munched and dribbled yoghurt in her high-chair. In fact Violet was so attached to this doll\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house that it was still in her room, on her dresser, where now she kept her make-up, and when applying her mascara or lipstick the sensation of being, in comparison to the house, a giant would often return to her, except this time those feelings were exaggerated by the fact that, where the house had reached her shoulders as a child, the miniature house now would rise only to her knees, making her feel not simply du\u017cy but kolosalny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BN5om89qL8o/UBoBZ64T5oI/AAAAAAAAAmI/OEjdbl8QKvk/s1600/Tudor%20Dolls%20House.JPG\" target=\"_blank\">http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BN5om89qL8o/UB...</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, having grown bigger and, from there, grown even bigger, that doll\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house would hardly have constituted a thimble to Violet, but as she looked down on the houses around her she felt, as if drifting in on strange tides, an oddly familiar sensation of being, once again, a giant girl among, this time, a terrace of doll\u00e2\u0080\u0099s houses. Unfurling in her chest, like a hibiscus flower soaked in syrup and dropped into champagne, was the impishness she had felt as a child, the kind of playfulness which compelled her to peer through windows or pluck a doll-like woman from inside a house and to giggle with naughtiness as the dolly dangled from her dress, and to sway her back and forth between her huge fingers before her huge, blue eyes, to do, in short, what she liked. Smiling to herself, Violet lifted her huge leg and stepped onto the street with a boom, the bearded policeman, whom Hazel had deduced was an inspector, shouted upwards, up the lengths of Violet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shin and thigh, for her to stop. Looking down, Violet arched her eyebrows in surprise and, after a moment, boomed out sweetly: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hmmm, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think you are in a position to tell ME what to do\u00e2\u0080\u0099. Hazel watched as, having finished speaking, Violet jutted her jaw and brought her other leg onto the street in a languorous arc, the arc described by her thigh and calf seemed slowed down by her size, where it slammed down by a group of people and soon afterwards. the echo gone, Violet straddled the slated rooftops ahead of her with a crunch of chimney-bricks and slating and loomed into the night town, wet and glistening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting a few minutes, and ignoring the departing inspector\u00e2\u0080\u0099s instructions to stay put, Hazel stepped back from the street and scaled the fire escape attached to the building across from the flower shop and Hazel was able to climb onto the roof, where she sat in the drizzle. Stretching out, with her foot she fished out the dull, gold object from the gutter, where it had been coughed by Violet. Hazel clutched the bent tea-box, slicked saliva and rain, and shook it before peeping inside. Looking up she saw, a few streets away, above the edge of the roofs, the huge and voluptuous body of her giant friend, radiant and pretty, lit up as if by spotlights...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.watchismo.com/promotions/bigger-better-banner.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.watchismo.com/promotions/bigg...</a></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By now, Violet's massive tits were rising toward the roof, a pair of gargantuan orbs making a slow-motion escape from their stony prison. The alabaster skin of her unclad body seemed to shine with a kind of inner light. \"Wait till you see these,\" she told the stunned policemen in front of the shop, with perverse glee in her voice. Violet's face was lit by an impish smile, a smile that seemed to grow larger and larger as she crept toward the sky. She was huge, without doubt the second biggest person in the world! -- and yet Violet wasn't even as tall as Evie\u2019s legs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"My god,\" she said, admiring herself. \"Look at the size of my breasts. Nobody's ever been close to this big before. Well, except for Evie, I guess. I mean, I've had big boobs since I my summer growth spurt, but never this big!\" Hazel looked up to see Violet's monumental breasts rising above her, swelling still bigger as she steadily grew taller. The ivory pale woman was growing at an amazing rate, her head shooting upward into the air! With ease she had freed her hands, which rose up through the remains of the roof of Evie's now-worthless shop and house.<br>\r\nViolet grabbed her massive breasts in her Hands. Suddenly she smiled even naughtier. She reached her huge hand down toward her crotch. She started to finger herself, and moaned as softly as a two-story tall woman could. Her gigantic breasts heaved with her quickening breath. Disbelieving Hazel stared at her friend, trying to see her adorable face, though she could barely see it from her angle, obscured as it was by Violet's staggering breasts. Violet was continuing to grow at a fantastic rate, her bosom leading the way. Her waist rose over the roof-line, the growth was revealing more and more of her gigantic, naked body in the process. She started to masturbate more quickly, the windows rattling with her moans. Unstoppable Violet\u2019s enormous body in all its glory rose into view: After her hourglass-shaped waist her hips followed, the downy fur and pink, glistening folds of her pussy and then the upper part of her beautiful, shapely legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don't know how incredible this feels, Hazel!\" she purred between moans.  Intense pleasure coursed through her body. Suddenly, the giantess let out a thundering cry of satisfaction, the ground, where Hazel was sitting, trembled slightly. Finally, Violet\u2019s growth slowed and eventually stopped, her legs as tall as the whole house. Carefully the black-haired giantess lifted one enormous leg and climbed out of Evie\u2019s house. Hazel gapped at her unbelievingly. Violent was just magnificent! She must have stood sixty feet tall, or maybe even a bit taller! Her ivory-pale, gargantuan body in glistened in the rain, minuscule spots still covered in oil. Violet\u2019s ample bosom was awe-inspiring, each curved with a perfect teardrop shape and swollen to the size of her head, her rose-colored nipples standing out against the alabaster complexion of the giant orbs. She stepped gracefully into the street, avoiding crushing cars or homes or people in her way. Hazel couldn\u2019t help but to notice Violet\u2019s beauty again. The towering giantess Violet was just beautiful. Hazel\u2019s eyes followed the sinusoidal curve of her friend\u2019s hips, to the welcoming swell of her perfect ass. But most inviting of all was the soft, pink curl of flesh that she could occasionally glimpse between her legs. It was capped by a layer of downy black hair, and glistened with tiny wet droplets in daylight and Hazel was quiet sure that this wetness was not caused by the rain. Violet looked as though her body had been sculpted from a single, gigantic mountain of marble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Violet took a menacing step forward, letting her shadow fall heavy upon the policemen and Hazel. Bending down, she gently lifted Hazel up. Only now Hazel realized that a small and thorny cactus had left some spines in her right heel, some of them had penetrated her shoes, socks and skin. When did I step on this? She thought. Amazed that she even cared about this. . Violet\u2019s touch was delicate despite her size, her larges palm silky and warm. Despite this fact Hazel felt the incredible strength her friend possessed. The bearded policeman stared at her and Violet in shock. Violet brought her to her gargantuan lips and kissed her gently. \u201cOhh, Hazel, you have to experience this!\u201d she moaned. \u201cThis is incredible! I can see everything getting smaller\u2026 the growth pleasure coursing through my body\u2026\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Acting with a degree of alacrity and efficacy to which her ordinarily calm and laconic nature did not well dispose her, Hazel shut the door to the cellar with a clack, wincing at the sound. Almost as part of the same movement, Hazel righted the upturned table, its legs scraping against the varnished floorboards, and, casting about with her green eyes and shielding her face with a hand from the setting light through the shop\u2019s blinds, pounced upon the brass box, ornately embellished with chinese patterns, which contained the tea which had caused so much palava. Narrowing her lips, she ran her thumbs over the cold, metal carvings; she screwed her mouth into a corner of her face. <br>\r\n\u2018Everythin\u2019 alright miss?\u2019 came a voice from the top of the stairs, which she attributed to the older policeman with the beard, but in truth they all more or less converged into one another, save the woman. Calling back that it was nothing, Hazel sought a frantic path of recourse. Flicking the lid from the box with a click, accompanied by a slight squeak from the delicate hinges, Hazel plucked a gossamer bag of tea from the heap within: then, with added thought, individuated two, then three more bags with her slender fingers. Glancing nervously about her, Hazel proceeded to push the bags into her mouth: they were dry and horrid, the efflorescence of the tea blendings shifting between unpleasant and simply foul - Hazel gagged once or twice. However, putting aside the unpleasantness, Hazel gulped the tea down and stuffed more into her mouth, chewing in a frenzy, aiming to chew and swallow as fast as was possible, owing in three parts to: the encroaching presence of the Police; the fact there must be over 30 tea bags in the box for her to consume and, simply put, the unpleasantness of chewing dry teabags. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMunching with some distaste the remnants of the tea box, Hazel, her jaw sore from chewing through her mouth becoming increasingly cemented shut with tea, bolted to the sink and ran the tap; cold water streaming with force. She put her head to the stream and drank in sporadic slurps, to purge the dental concrete of the tea. Drawing a final mouthful, she spat this into the sink and retightened the tap; running her finger around her gums, her eyes focused on the foot of the stairs. Distracted from this little torpor, Hazel tore a sheet of kitchen roll and mopped and padded at her mouth: proceeding to vigorously wiped and scrub at her tongue. Pivoting slightly, she spat again into the sink. She ran her tongue contemplatively around her mouth and across her teeth, Hazel mused loosely, breathing somewhat heavily from her faint asthma, clearly aggravated by the flurry of exertion - one reason for Hazel\u2019s laconic nature and composure was rooted, facilely, in a wish to prevent any flare up of her asthma, which could extend to crippling as a young girl. She felt a bit ill; it probably wasn\u2019t the smartest thing she\u2019d ever done; it is probably up there with picking up that jellyfish as a toddler and the sting got infected and she wound up with impetigo, or least that\u2019s what we think - she really was quite an unhealthy child, still quite prone to bouts of illness. Or when she tried a draw of one of Violet\u2019s cigarettes, choked and coughed it down her top, in between those milk-monsters; her shirt caught fire a bit and she had a burn on her tit: she wonder if that scarred eventually? Hope not; something to remember her by though!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazel blinked; from the head of the staircase she could hear voices and footfalls. Breathing shallowly against the coming moments, Hazel stretched out her arms and rested her hands on the counter behind her, leaning in a nonchalantly against it. Emerging from the foot of the stairs was the policeman with the beard, whose name she could not muster; her mind had drifted frequently from the course of the police\u2019s, admittedly very friendly, lines of questioning to the growing situation downstairs. He smiled a little, his hands in his pockets, he looked at the floorboards as he moved across the shop: the others following from the bottom of the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere grew in the air a silence as the police, hands in pockets, examined the shop with not much in the way of interest or expectation. The one with the beard scratched his neck, while looking contemplatively at the ceiling: rummaging in his pocket, he produced a packet of cigarettes and, after drawing one, returned them to his pocket, leaving it unlighted. Hazel inclined her head and raised her eyebrows; she was feeling a little more nauseous; the tea wasn\u2019t agreeing with her. The bearded policeman was saying something about something; did she have anything else that might help? Hazel\u2019s vision swam a touch; she waved her hand and told them she was sorry, but knew nothing more, rather unnerved by her voice echoing in the tenement of her skull. The other police were moving about, and the bearded one was talking again. Colours felt more vivid; she closed one eye and shielded her brow with a hand, revealing some teeth in a half grimace. Mhhhmm: she nodded and gave affirmatives, while her focus dwindled more and more into blurs. Everything felt very far away, over the hills. It hadn\u2019t occurred to her that scoffing a bunch of teabags proven, or at least highly suspected to, have caused, in at least two of her friends, excessive and even gigantic increase in size might have some side-effects. Her left hand ached and throbbed in time with her heartbeat, pressure deep in her bones, like the bends - she hoped the tea had not irritated her heart.. Uhh yeah\u2026 she offered and the answer seemed to satisfy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bearded policeman turned on his heel, Hazel nervously threaded her fingers through the fronds of her fringe. Her hand felt odd and cumbersome, almost numb. Suddenly, her little finger poked her hard in the eye; her hand dropped to cover her eye, though it was hastily dropped again and the right hand took its place covering the watering eye; Hazel had realised her left hand left hand, when cupped soothingly over her eye, would easily have covered her face: it was like a dinner plate on the end of her svelte arm. Oh bollocks! Releasing a high and shrill yelp, Hazel hid the offending, huge hand behind her back - feeling it plump up again against her backside. The policemen and women turned quizzically, was everything alright miss? Hazel\u2019s mind became frantic; she, to an outward audience, must have been babbling the utmost nonsense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, yeah, yeah it\u2019s just my asthma you know, all the pollen and the heat and stuff, it gets to me, yeah, it makes it hard, hard to breath...Hazel felt a groaning pain in her toes\u2026It\u2019s always been a thing, so, my ribs are a bit wonky from it, because of the inhaler things, I could show you; not that I\u2019d flash a policeman because that would be flashing, obviously, I just reali-highseeeddd - Hazel winced as she felt each toe sporadically balloon in her shoes\u2026 But yeah, because of all that, sometimes my ribs kind of lock or tangle, or at least it feels like that and it hurts to breath, like a knife being twisted in you and\u2026 underneath the palm of her inflated hand, Hazel her buttocks bubble larger; she attempted to clamp them down, but they only filled more and more of her palm\u2026 Nothing really; so I guess you guys will be looking to head off pretty: try and stop my gigantic friend? Ms. Big, Green and not so mean, the Statue of enormity...Hazel casually positioned herself behind the counter, smiling with a slight twitch in her eye as her feet began to rip and burst from her shoes; beneath the desk, she felt her other hand bloating in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe policemen and women filtered towards the door: the one with the beard remaining behind. Hazel snorted as her arse romped outwards, stretching her dark jean shorts. She felt her lips tingling and prayed that they too were not swelling up. She wished the \u2018rozzers\u2019 would hurry up and leave before things got embarrassing. Even as she thought, her feet stretched out below the table. He furrowed his brow and removed the cigarette from his mouth: he pointed at her with it: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou alright miss?\u2019 \u2026 </span></div></div>",

In the cool night air, a stretching, rubbery, sound started to pulse lightly in the room. The bed springs clinked softly to adjust to a fractional increase in weight. The light cotton of the pajama bottoms found itself a little snug around the cuffs and waist. The recumbent let out a sigh and rolled over again onto her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed clinked more audibly this time. The fabric of her night-blouse adjusted itself to accommodate a deep breath...but the relief did not follow. On the bedside table, the lamp and alarm clock would doubtless have confessed themselves surprised when an arm, that had previously strained to reach them in the early hours of the morning, collided with the lazily as it arced like a planet. Equally bemused was the duvet, which was now covering much less flesh than it was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain the blouse strained under another swell from below; a blue button delicately popped off and spun into the darker recesses of the room. The bed now clanked and bent under more and more weight, the metal frame groaning slightly. A couple of petals fell to the ground, from the bed. Evie's legs now hung off the bed's end. The pajama bottoms were forced to give up as her hips and butt both decided to flare in size, leaving only her pants to resist the hot and moist expanding flesh beneath. The lamp and clock were introduced to the floor by the increasing girth of the arm, which seemed intent on stretching further too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie's heaving bosom decided to follow the example set by her lower regions and burst the the front of her blouse, bouncing free, her bra attempting to hold back her bulging buxom.

She swelled larger. The sound of twisting metal rang out as her butt pulverised the remnants of the bed. And she grew. <i>Thud!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The floor beneath Evie collapsed, her growing body falling into the shop below with a thunderous crash. However, she was big enough by now that her upper half remained in the bedroom. Again her head, now bigger, began to push against the ceiling; huge legs stretched and strained against the walls of downstairs; hulking arms braced themselves on opposing walls, before pushing their way into the bathroom and living room respectively.Now the ceiling crunched and heaved as she grew through it, leaving the torso and, more importantly, bulging chest to continue filling up the bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene now presented itself as such: Evie's ass, hips and legs pursued as campaign or expansion, flaring and elongation in the shop; while her torso and arms thickened and stretched in a scouting mission, her breasts fought the good fight with a strategy of billowing and ballooning - enjoying much success; all the while her head piloted a solo endeavor with its task of general ascendancy. The mutation, quite apart from the obvious alterations to Evie's size, had begun to take further hold. Her fingers and toe were now proportionally longer and more slender; while parts of her body took a greenish hue and an odd waxy quality, others, like her face bleached further from her already creamy skin to a lily white. The gorgeous locks had blossomed with flowers and leaves, coiling long and lustrous- changed to a deepening green- flecked with blues and purples. Diaphanous gauzes of petal-like film had sprouted like cloth in areas, for example around her widening hips- ineffective at any attempt at modesty, but aesthetically pleasing none the less. During this deviation Evie has continued to expand and is now pushing the confines of the building itself. Each breath taken causes the flat to groan and crack. Her hips and butt have found themselves hard pressed for space in the shop, while the door bends with forced of an expanding foot, the counterpart of which is in the midst of a fleeting liaison with a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe picture paints itself not unlike <i>Alice in Wonderland </i>- big girl, small house. When one examines the evidence, cracks in this analogy begin to show. Apparently, the houses in France are made of much sterner stuff containing their growing gals modestly, but Irish girls are made of much BIGGER stuff! And Evie was only getting bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the two men from earlier stumbled along the street, having not fully thought through the plan of a drink before driving home. The leader, the \"mastermind \" behind tonight's happenings turned to his colleague puzzled. <br>\r\n\"You 'ear somethin'?\"<br>\r\nThe other stood pondering.<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"<br>\r\n\"Dunno...A sorta ...rumblin'\"<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie's leg burst through the door of the shop, followed by the other from the wall. Her arms punched through the sides. The upper story bulged outwards and exploded; a huge pair of breasts bouncing free. The two men back against the wall, dumbstruck. The roof heaved and heaved; the sides of the building were pushed outwards by a gargantuan pair of hips and buttocks. Finally, the roof erupted as Evie surged up and out in all her giant glory...</span></div></div>",

Squeek Hissssssssssssss<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie emerged from the foggy bathroom; toweling her long hair. She sat on the bed for a while before getting ready, squeezing into her jeans and slipping on a woolly jumper. Quickly, she popped downstairs to find some of her work, account books and such, to do while eating her breakfast of, as was often the case, muesli, the more she could get done now; the more of the weekend she would have to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pulled the books from under the counter, something caught her eye. <i>What the...?</i>. Leaning down, Evie inspected the odd blue flower protruding from the flower bed. Evie was rather confused. <i>Weird...looks like a tulip</i>. She prodded the bud, which was closed in a bud, with her pen. The bud suddenly burst open, spraying a cloud of pink pollen into Evie's face. Coughing and spluttering, Evie stumbled backwards; catching herself quickly though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick drink of water from the sink downstairs solved the coughing. <i>Well - cough - that was eventful</i>. As she went upstairs she was wracked by a sneeze. Blowing her nose she proceeded up to the flat.</span></div></div>",

Walking through to the small kitchen she tossed the books onto the counter and went to sit down in the living room, she was feeling too weird to work at the moment. Her jeans felt a bit - <i>Achoo</i>! - tight. She was dimly aware of an odd rubbery or stretchy sound that seemed to accompany her sneezing. <i>Achoo</i>! <i>rbbb.</i> <i>There is was again</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie was beginning to feel really dizzy now and the sneezing was still coming. She must be delirious, her arm looked faintly greenish. <i>Weird</i>. <i>Achoo</i> ! Evie blew her nose on a tissue from her pocket; she was finding it hard to get her fingers into her pockets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Aaachooo</i>! Shhrrp. The seams on Evie's jeans split up her ass. In horror, she clapped her hands across the tear; reddening. Another sneeze wracked her just then. <i>Achoo</i>! Bizarrely, Evie felt her butt bulge<i>(!?)</i> under her hands. \"Ah!\" she exclaimed; she could feel a sharp pain as her bra strap dug into her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie bolted through to her bathroom, pulling her jumper off. She looked at her chest in disbelief; it was stretching the fabric of her t-shirt very tight indeed. <i>Achoo</i>! the fabric across the chest tore slightly as her breasts pumped up. <i>Achoo</i>! the tear increased dramatically. <i>Achoo</i>! Her breasts burst out of the fabric of the shirt, jutting outwards. \"What the - fuck!\" Evie bumped her head on the door-frame. Rubbing her head, it dawned on Evie she was growing taller, much taller!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down she was her feet were turning the odd greenish hue her arm had. Her bra was really groaning now under Evie's ballooning form. <i>Achoo</i>! Another sneeze added to her bulk. In the mirror, she could see her hair appeared to be flecked with blue. But this was on the periphery of her mind, Evie had gone from 5,3\" to around 6,7\" - <i>Achoo</i>! groan - 6,8\" for no reason! Evie braced herself for another sneeze...she waited...nothing. Evie took a deep breath- the tortured bra snapped under her bosom's size. \"Fuck...\"</span></div></div>",

Evie simply watched in awe as her formerly brown hair was changed to a beautiful blue color. She saw what appeared to be rose thorns sprouting from her arms, and her skin had now turned completely green. From her back, several brilliant red rose petals were sprouting in like a pair of wings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the transformation completed, Evie began to grow bigger.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Evie snorted and wiped her nose with a scrunched tissue she found in her pocket, examining the spread of pink tinged mucus with some distaste and worry. Sniffing again, she pocketed the tissue. Picking the trowel from her counter, she sought briefly for a pot with a succession of chinks of terracotta on terracotta. Settling on a small, rotund and brightly painted pot, Evie proceeded to carefully dig up the peculiar blue plant. Evie lightly bit her tongue as she prised up the plant, laying bare the sinews of a few roots: she deposited the plant snuggly in the hollow of the pot. She looked at the plant, now comfortably sitting in the squat little pot, the blue bell of its flower drooping over and nodding slightly, like it was drowsing there. She noticed, gently stroking the cerulean petals with her fingertips, that, following the explosion of pink pollen in her face, the bloom appeared to have puckered itself up again, perhaps dropped back to sleep. Picking up her books again, she ascended the staircase again, sniffing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoring over an encyclopaedia of plants and trees, which had distracted her wholly from her, otherwise meticulously kept, account books, Evie, without lifting her bright eyes from the print, took a mouthful tea from a chipped white cup - making it milky and sweet, Evie sometimes thought she drank her own bodyweight in tea. Her eyes had flicked over the gloomy blue clusters of grape hyacinths, each little flower was plumped like the fabric of a skirt filled by a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hips and legs:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Syrphid_fly_on_Grape_hyacinth.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nand floated like a bee over to the folds of skyflowers, yawning like parasols in some sunshot glade: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://crewlandtrust.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/skyflower.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://crewlandtrust.files.wordpress.com...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the sighing caps of bluebells, the ends curled like a sprite's shoes:<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.english-country-garden.com/a/i/flowers/bluebell-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.english-country-garden.com/a/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned further and considered the blue leaves, oddly reminiscent of frozen shards of foxglove, of catlin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s giant:<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.nzplantpics.com/pics_ground_cover/ajuga_reptans_catlins_giant_flower.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.nzplantpics.com/pics_ground_c...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n but wandering on to the fanned petals of a galaxy spring starflowers, each winking with a sort geometric loveliness:<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://springstarflower.com/images/img0001.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://springstarflower.com/images/img00...</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this moment, cheeks still ballooned with warm tea, she was reading about Lithodora diffusa, sometimes called Grace Ward. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://plantality.com/upload/wikiplantphoto/0000/0041/Lithodora_Heavenly_Blue.jpg?1281016305\" target=\"_blank\">http://plantality.com/upload/wikiplantph...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis plant, indigenous to the alpine regions, was, certainly in this particular photo, a starlike array of blue petals, arranged around a centre of pink bases to those petals and, extending from the flower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart, pink stamen. Apparently, the name Lithodora meant something like \u00e2\u0080\u0098stone gift\u00e2\u0080\u0099, because of its residence among the scree of alpine slopes, and the name diffusa referred to the \u00e2\u0080\u0098spreading\u00e2\u0080\u0099 growth of the plant. Swallowing her tea, Evie, though the colours were approaching correct in places, did not think that this was the plant now sitting on her windowsill in the bright morning light - though its hirsute, green leaves reminded her that she really ought to shave her legs ahead of the night out. Evie rifled the pages and was about to begin reading about bog sage, when her phone, which she had set on the wooden table, buzzed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking with the pages, Evie checked her phone while taking another mouthful of tea: Hazel was meeting with Violet and they would walk over together. She set her phone down again and as she closed the encyclopaedia she ran her fingers over the ornate blue signature - C. Bloom. She flicked the hard cover over and, crossing her arms over it and leaning forward, stared purposelessly at the pale sky beyond the blue bell of the flower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blossom. She could see, through the pane, the various dark and serried peaks of roofs against the sky, with the bell-shaped bud seeming to rise up and loom over the rooftops. Evie fancied, as she watched the bloom sway ever so gently in the faint breeze, which drifted in through the slightly ajar window, that the stalk of the flower would look, to people on the street, like a great spire rising from the ground, a magic beanstalk if ever there existed any such thing, while the bulbous, blue cupola of the flower itself appeared to watch the street, looking down at the little people, like aphids, thronging about below it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrumming her fingers on the book, she remembered that she really ought to visit her dad soon - although she was normally a very attentive daughter in this respect, she had lapsed a little, but still phoned fairly regularly. He always kept her bed made over there, although she stayed more often above the shop, with her childhood teddies arranged with the high fidelity that she associated with her father. Felix Bloom was the son of Jewish immigrants, from what was then Czechoslovakia (although Evie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s paternal grandmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family had hailed from Hungary originally), had been born in Dublin and had trained as an architect. His family had changed their name from Kv\u011bt to a rough English equivalent, which had lead to a debate between he and his wife over naming their youngest daughter Kv\u011bta, although he had eventually to settle for this to stand as her middle name - Evelyn Kv\u011bta Bloom. He pursued this occupation as a natural extension of a childhood love of precise drawing; to Evie her father drew as accurately as Da Vinci and his ability to draw things into life had fascinated her. Evie could recall floating around him and his desk like a wasp around jam as he drew and sketched in the afternoons; he seemed to her to permanently smell of pencil shavings and he would draw faint smiley faces in smears of shiny grey on her cheeks. In his leisure time his drawing not always limited to buildings, and Evie would commission him to draw for her all the landscapes and objects of her mind - which survived today in large sketchbooks he kept in the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s older sister, Aster, had never really been taken with art or flowers and had applied herself to studying accountancy at university: while Evie had swithered contrarily between fine art and botany, although her intentions to study had been waylaid by the car crash. Since the accident Evie seldom saw her sister: it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that her sister was callous, but she was busy and had become a little detached. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The pink pollen had left her feeling a touch groggy and tired, which she put down mostly to hayfever, which was not the most useful of things to suffer from while running a flower shop, because of the periodic streaming of her blue eyes and nose. Evie rubbed her eyes and sniffed. Her chair scraping on the floor, she pottered hither and thither, attempting to make something approaching preparations for the day. Turning on the radio, she set about putting together a picnic, which, although it might not be called for, she intended to have just in case. After this, and clicking the lid shut, she wandered through to get changed; on the way, she sneezed again. Wiping her nose with another scrunched tissue, she groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the warm, pale light of her room, she stripped herself until she was in her underwear - her bra was underwired and purple tartan, the smooth purple mounds hatched with various colours of green and blue. Matching this were her lilac knickers, fringed with powder blue, which extended up her hipline and was canvassed tightly across her hips and buttocks: so well-fitting that, when, as had happened now, her knicker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rode up from their snugness, the lower portions of the white hemispheres of her backside were disclosed beneath the blue-fringed arcades of the kickers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 back, while from the arches at the side of the garments extended the pillars of her thick, white thighs. Furthermore, the soft flesh of her thighs and the cushiony melons of her buttocks, were the blue rim of the fabric marked the end of her knickers, bulged out again, like inflated white rubber, as if too large to be constricted. Placing the palm on the curve of her right haunch, meditatively running her hand over it and while looking in the mirror, Evie was slightly dismayed by the snugness of her lower underwear because, while she thought she might not have lost weight, it seemed apparent to her that she had gained weight. Putting a hand on the plushness of her stomach, she broke with the fear of suspected fattening, she dressed: first swinging on a light, white blouse, the front of which was adorned with a slight cluster of semi-transparent ruffles and second drawing on a pair of tights while lying supine on her bed - To this she added navy blue jean-shorts and a thin a thin blue cardigan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Finishing her makeup in the a mirror she heard the girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letting themselves in downstairs. After wandering through to pick up the picnic box, she picked up her bag, her keys and, after slipping into her shoes, went to meet Hazel and Violet on the stairs. </span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Our main character is Evelyn \"Evie\" Bloom. If you hadn't guessed from the title or her name, this is set in Dublin, beginning in Evie's shop, above which is her flat, where she works as a florist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie is built quite small - 5ft 3in- with long and softly-curled auburn hair, accompanying her deep blue eyes. Additionally, she sports milky white skin and rose red lips; naturally carrying an Irish accent. Despite being very pretty, in a cute sort of fashion, she counters this by being overly shy and reclusive; spending rather too much time around her flowers and books. Her butt and hips, however, have been noted, by drunken Dubliners, to have a lovely bell shape to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway; moving on, through some accident or event, of your choice, Evie's, or one of the other girls', DNA is altered to resemble that of one of the various flora she loves so much, once again you can choose. As a consequence of this altering the girl will begin growing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven she takes on the characteristics of a plant, she will develop when exposed to or absorbing: sunlight, water or some form of nutrient. However, she could grow from exposure to the agent that changed her to begin with, e.g. radiation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn terms of  what \"nutrient\" makes her grow? Well this depends what kind of plant she takes on the properties of. For example, a venus fly-trap, and other carnivorous plants, will grow from eating things; whereas a tulip would grow from basic nutrition. Basically whatever works, just be imaginative!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from this you can be pretty free with her body, in terms of vines and flowers etc. Likewise, her attitude and reaction to her growth; what size she will become; what she does and such is down to you! As for writing styles, all are welcome, even if doesn't match with the earlier author because that makes it interesting. Additions are very welcome!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdditional Characters you may wish to use:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet Rosenkranz - 5ft 11in, powder blue eyes, straight black hair, produced through much effort, that hangs to above her shoulders, rounded to frame and hug her heart-shaped face, with an accompanying fringe - very much in the Gothy frame - she is perhaps guilty of rather too much make-up and black clothing.  One of Evie's only two friends, both of whom she went to school with. From a Jewish background; both of her parents are originally from Poland so she speaks with a twinge of accent. She is currently studying to be a lawyer, but remains quite unhappy and dissatisfied with her life - prone to low moods and somewhat erratic behaviour. Very much impresses the male population by being rather...top heavy - special bras and woolly jumpers were a necessity. However, a propensity to being rather spiteful and resentment of being controlled means she doesn't really seek their company. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazel Fallon  - 5ft 6in, green eyes, lovely, long cascades of tawny hair that falls to her lower back. She's slender and lithe, sometimes joking on occasion that Vi and Evie should lend  her some - curves ain't all that! She habitually dresses in summer clothing, vibrant colours; tights, long skirts etc. Her chirpy and sunny disposition endear her to many, particularly her friends Evie and Violet. Although very pretty, her odd and quirky nature has consistently alienated her. Violet has pointed out Hazel is too amicable for her own good - break her nose and she'll say sorry - to which she flashes her happy and bright smile. Her voice is sweet and chime-like, like a songbird - cultivated, since she was a child, in church choirs. She is currently pursuing a passion for musical theatre and drama.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI value all reviews and additions: in addition, I welcome requests for directions in which you'd like to see the story go; any particular elements you'd like to see or which sections you'd like to see added to next.
