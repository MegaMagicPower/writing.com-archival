By the time, the last of the hens arrives, you've already donned the outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWherever you go, you're certain to all be the centre of attention. Half already seem to have a head start on their drinking, and as the mini-bus arrives to shuttle you around town. Several drunken songs are being sung to keep the party atmosphere going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first stop, has you at a local bar, where you decide that a drunken stupor feels like the best way to pass the night. It was your plan (as much as you had one) for the stag-do. When it's your turn to get the round of drinks, you discover how attractive your body is..., as you get groped and caressed on the way to the bar, and back to your table. Each time with deniable plausibility, but you certainly have a lower opinion of guys after tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the third stop, you have a pleasant buzz going, and are giggling along with the other hens about men, even with your limited experience. Their frankness, and lewd details make you nervous about what's happening, and what might happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Amy drunkenly suggests strippers, you're one of the few whooping and cheering. Until you realise she means male strippers. This prompts Charlotte... or <i>Charlene</i>... (you aren't quite sure) Chazza to tell a story about her cheating husband, and the stripper he had an affair with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuoying up Chazza, the other hens rally round, telling her she was too good for him, and that anyone could be a stripper...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the mini-bus takes you to the next stop, Amy tells the driver to take them to 'The Bunny Hutch', and the hen party ends up arriving in the car park of the best strip-club in town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking your way past the bouncer, you find the pounding music makes you feel nauseous. Inaya Day's 'Nasty Girl', is blaring out at a deafening volume, and you enjoy the sight of the women humping the brass pole, and teasing the men sitting on perverts row. Thrusting cleavage, and ass in their faces, jiggling and twerking for dollar bills to be stuffed in....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder if you should be turned on by this, as Amy points with an unsteady hand to a cheap poster taped to the wall. Apparently, the uninspired acts are because it's amateur night, and the contestants are mixed in between the Hutch's more experienced girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's not hard to make up a set of clothes, though you wonder how clean some of them are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of the items are modest or restrained, generally being a mix of garish, glittery, brief or all three. Pulling on a thong, you cover that with a fuller set of underwear, even if it sports the words 'Heaven this way', with an arrow.

Also the swell of your rump, gives it a flattering shape. A giggle spills from your lips as you wonder if it's street legal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing a shot glass in one gulp, you think about what else to wear. The frilly bra covers you, while revealing everything. It's lace design is more absent than present, and doesn't give you the support, or restrain you need.

Nodding your approval at your mirror self, you pull on a looser T-shirt to disguise the size of your bust, and top it all off with a bolero jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving a cute little bunny hop, you nod approvingly at the bounce and shimmy of your body.

It\u2019s always easier for the client to get immersed in their new bodies.  Pretending we are really a mother/daughter family will be much easier for you.  I just need you to sign this updated agreement\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your new contract and see it is pages long.  Not wanting to waste any more time reading, you just flip to the back page and sign.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Jones files the updated contract and instructs you, \u201cFrom now on, you will call me Mommy.  I will call you Stephanie.  That is the name of the body you are currently in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggle at your new name and realize you will have to get used to it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Jones then takes a deep breath and then suddenly starts acting motherly.  \u201cOk Stephanie.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nYou aren\u2019t sure what to expect anymore after signing the new body Port agreement.  On one hand, you are glad to have the help getting your new body ready for the wedding.  Without the help of your new Mom, you wouldn\u2019t have any idea how to do hair or get dressed.  She was already helpful this morning helping you put your hair into a neat pony tail.  On the other hand, you are still mad that you missed going out with your friends you haven\u2019t seen since college.  You knew all the guys were going to the strip clubs last night.  Given you were in the body of an 8 year old girl, you wouldn\u2019t have been to go along anyway.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, you sit in front of the TV and turn on ESPN.  Your Mom grabs the remote and changes the channel to Nickelodeon.  \u201cHey!  I was watching that!\u201d  You try to tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom says, \u201cThere is inappropriate language on that channel.  You need to watch something more your age.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, \u201cOh.  This must be part of the updated contract huh?  What am I supposed to do all morning then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to figure that out right now.\u201d  Mom explains, \u201cI\u2019m looking at this family\u2019s calendar to see what they normally do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou point out, \u201cWait a second?  I\u2019m not here to live this girl\u2019s life for her!  I came here for my friend\u2019s wedding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom agrees, \u201cYou are right Stephanie.  According to the contract you are able to attend every required event dealing with the wedding.  But by signing it, you consented to maintaining Stephanie\u2019s lifestyle.  It\u2019s not just you though.  This also means I have to keep up her mother\u2019s regular schedule too.\u201c  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou joke, \u201cSo if this wasn\u2019t the middle of the summer, I would have to go to school for Stephanie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.  You have to remember.  Most people who sign this type of agreement enjoy living someone else\u2018s life for a vacation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter reading the wedding itinerary, Mom explains, \u201cIt says that there is an afternoon social today.  It is at the father of the bride\u2019s home starting at 3.\u201c  Mom noted, \u201cThat means we will have to find Stephanie\u2019s swimsuit.  It says it is a pool party.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes hearing you will be wearing Stephanie\u2019s swimsuit.  You nod, \u201cOh, that\u2019s right.  I forgot about the pool party .  But  isn\u2019t there anything before that?  I\u2019d like to hang out with my friends for a bit.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head, \u201cIt looks like the bachelor party was last night.  I\u2019m sure all of your friends are hung over and wont be getting up until after noon.  That\u2019s probably why they scheduled it so late.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do we do until then?  It\u2019s only 8am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom finished reading the family calendar and sighed, \u201cHmm\u2026It says here that my body goes to a yoga class in the gym at 9.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh, \u201cHa ha!  Looks like you will be doing some working out while I\u2018m home watching TV!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom then explained, \u201cNot exactly.  It says here that Stephanie\u2019s summer gymnastics class also starts at 9.  They obviously scheduled it so they could go to the gym together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes get wide, \u201cGymnastics?  You can\u2019t be serious!  I\u2018m not prancing around with a bunch of girls!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mom walked towards Stephanie\u2019s bedroom, she cracked a smile, \u201cRemember, you are contractually obligated to do everything their normal bodies would!\u201d  She came back shortly with an article of clothing and handed it to you, \u201cYou better put this on!  We need to leave in 10 minutes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held a leotard in  your hands and rolled your eyes.  You hold it up to your body and groaned.  It was baby blue with a small attached skirt.  Sparkles ran down the neckline.  \u201cOk!  This is enough!  I appreciated the help with getting my body ready, but this is too much!  I want to go back to the old contract!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head, \u201cTrust me.  I wish we could!  I hate yoga!  I\u2019m not thrilled about this either.  But the contract you signed last night cant be altered for 5 business days.  Unfortunately, the only other option would be to terminate the contract.  But that would mean you would immediately body port home.  And since somebody else is currently utilizing your original body, you would be body ported into the first available body on a temporary basis until yours was returned.  Then you would incur a mandatory 20,000 dollar fine for replanting you back into your original body.  You would be banned for life at the Body Port Inc.  Not to mention that would also mean you\u2019d miss the wedding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing she was right, you held up the leotard and groaned, \u201cI may as well get this over with!\u201d  You walked into Stephanie\u2019s bedroom to change.  Mom added, \u201cLook at the bright side!  Gymnastics might be fun!  You will probably do some interesting spins and jumps!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh back and sarcastically reply, \u201cYipee!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.  And one more thing!\u201d  Mom looks at you with a serious look, \u201cI\u2019ve been pretty relaxed this morning with your demeanor.  I understand this is taking some getting used to.  However, periodically the Body Port company sends out disguised agents to monitor our behavior.  It\u2019s kind of like an auditing system to ensure we are doing our jobs correctly.  They could be monitoring us at any time.  So from now on, you need to clean up your language and stop those sassy remarks.  A normal daughter would never get away with talking to her mother like that. I am supposed to treat you like the body you are in.  I don\u2019t want to jeopardize my career over you.  I\u2019ll have to discipline you like Stephanie\u2019s real mother would if you act up.  You are a bit old for swatting, but I have the authority to <i>ground</i> you if I deem it appropriate.  You don\u2019t want to risk missing the wedding do you Stephanie?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath realizing how serious the Body Port company was.  You would hate to get grounded and miss the wedding.  You are really regretting signing the updated contract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom asks, \u201cDo you understand Stephanie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to comply with Mom and almost over-act your role.  You give a huge fake smile and reply with the cutest voice you can muster, \u201cYes Mommy.  I understand!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom cant help crack a smile at the way you answered.  She ends with, \u201cWatch that sarcasm too young lady!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh back, \u201cOopsie!  Sorry about that!\u201d</span></div></div>",

She also changed and has yoga pants with a tank on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell her, \u201cThat was a bit more difficult than I imagined!  This leotard is so tight it feels like a second skin!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s good.  That means nothing is baggy and wont get in the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your back to her and say, \u201cI couldn\u2019t quite get these tricky neckline snaps.  Can you help me out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your back so Mom can snap them for you.  You then joke, \u201cI think I know why it takes girls forever to go to the bathroom now.  It\u2019s going to take me forever to get this thing off when I have to pee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shakes her head, \u201cI keep forgetting this is your Body Port into a female body.  You don\u2019t have to take your leotard off to pee.  The same goes for swimsuits.  All you have to do is sit down and pull the material aside.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d  You feel stupid for not realizing that.  You say, \u201cSo what are girls doing in the bathroom for so long then?\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom explains, \u201cLots of things.  Luckily you aren\u2019t old enough to worry about some of them.  Unlike boys, girls don\u2019t just pee and leave the bathroom.  There\u2019s always touchups to be made and hair adjustments\u2026\u201d  Mom then looked at you and realized, \u201cSpeaking of that, we better do something with your hair.  You can\u2018t have it down like that for gymnastics!  If we don\u2018t put it up, it will get in your way..\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow Mom to her vanity and sit down.  She thinks out loud for a moment, \u201cHmmm\u2026Your hair is pretty long\u2026A pony will fling around too much\u2026\u201c  She then starts pulling your hair back tight, \u201cOuch!\u201d  You say as she tugs it back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom explains, \u201cRelax.  I have to pull it back tight for your French braid.  That way you wont have any loose hair dangling out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit for 10 minutes while she braids your hair.  After securing it with a tight rubber band, she hands you a mirror so you can see the back of your head.  \u201cCool!  Nice job Mom!\u201d  You tell her as you admire her work.  \u201cThis is much better than having all that hair in my face!\u201d  You then suggest, \u201cCan you do these braids for me on the wedding day too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head no, \u201cThis style isn\u2019t nearly fancy enough for a wedding.  I\u2019m not sure what the stylist is going to do with all the girl\u2019s hair, but it definitely wont be a French braid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStylist?\u201d  You question<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem to have a problem with reading up on things?\u201d  Mom was of course referring to the fact you neglected to read the Body Port contract AND the wedding itinerary.  She continued, \u201cAll the women in the wedding are getting their hair done early Saturday morning.  You will have to join them considering your current body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were hoping to hang out with the other groomsman before the wedding.  You hadn\u2019t realized you would spending the morning getting your hair done with the other girls.  You then ask, \u201cEven though I\u2018m technically a groomsman, a tux is obviously out of the question with this body.  Do you think I\u2018ll have to wear a bridesmaid dress to match the other women?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shrugs her shoulders, \u201cI\u2019m not sure what they have planned for you.  Just like you, most of the wedding party Body Ported in for the occasion.  You will be attending a dress fitting with the other women tomorrow morning at 9.  I presume you will learn what the plan is then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the clock, Mom sees it is time to leave.  You put shoes on and start following her towards the door.  Mom looks up and down your body and cracks a smile.  She barely manages to hold back her laughter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly feel self conscious, \u201cOkay?  What\u2019s so funny?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom explains, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for laughing.  That was unprofessional of me. As an employee of Body Port Inc, I\u2019m supposed to help guide you with your vacation.   I just keep forgetting this is your first time in a female body.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing her, it was obvious you were making a mistake.  \u201cOkay..What do I need to do?\u201c  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom got her composure back and explains, \u201cFor starters, you are wearing a beautiful blue leotard with a pair of knee-high white athletic socks\u2026.And a pair of big clunky red sneakers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down and see what she is talking about.  Your look ridiculous with your outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continues, \u201cActually\u2026That\u2019s not your biggest concern.  Girls don\u2019t typically drive around and walk through parking lots wearing only a leotard.  You might get some funny looks.  You\u2019ll need to pull on a pair of light pants and a top over it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start walking towards Stephanie\u2019s bedroom to find the articles of clothing.  Mom adds, \u201cAnd lose those socks and shoes.  A pair of sandals with your bare feet will be fine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow her instructions and come out properly dressed.  Mom is pleased, \u201cMUCH better Stephanie.  We better get going!  You don\u2019t want to be late for class!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you are about to attend a girl\u2019s gymnastics class, you are somewhat relieved Mom helped you with the details.  You laugh thinking about the funny stories you will have to tell your friends when you meet up with them tonight.  They will probably get a good laugh about hearing how you went to Stephanie\u2019s gymnastics class for her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get into the car, you tell Mom, \u201cNOW I\u2019m starting to understand why it takes girls so long to get ready!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom just grinned and thought to herself, \u201cShe has no idea!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m Amanda!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the flower girl dress she has on and realize you will soon have a matching one.  You reply, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you.

Wow!  That\u2019s really you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nods for you and explains, \u201cYea it\u2019s really him.  John decided to wait until the last minute to book a teleport ticket!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother Bridesmaid came up to John with a smirk.  You don\u2019t recognize the woman as she says, \u201cHey John!  Remember me?  I\u2019m Susie!  I like in California now and had to use a teleport to get here too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly get a lump in your throat hearing the woman announce herself as \u2018Susie.\u2019  Susie is Amy\u2019s sister that you slept with in high school.  You look up at her and reply, \u201cHi Susie\u2026Its nice to see you again..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie winks as she whispers, \u201cIt\u2019s too bad you ended up as an 8 year old girl.  I was hoping we could rekindle some memories from high school.  I guess that\u2019s not possible now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kick yourself realizing if you would have teleported into ANY guys body that you would have slept with Susie tonight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you know it, a seamstress comes over and guides you to a mirror.  The woman quickly takes off your shirt and pants and makes you slide into a pair of white tights.  Next she pulls a flower girl dress over your head.  As you look in the mirror, you see how wide the dress seems to flare out.  It only goes to about your knees and has a big bow in the back.  As the seamstress ties the bow and buttons the back of the dress up, she smiles, \u201cWe lucked out on this one!  No alterations are required.  It fits her perfect!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy is relieved that the dress won\u2019t need altering.  Amy then starts walking around to the other bridesmaids to see how their dress altering are going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seamstress then starts pinning your hair up as you wonder what she is doing.  She then puts a matching tiara on your head, just like Amanda has.  She spends 10 minutes adjusting the tiara so it will fit you perfect.  She tells you to check with Amy to see if Amy approves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to Amy and ask, \u201cWell?  How do I look?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiles as she sees how pretty you look with the dress on.  Amy then notices the tiara and smiles, \u201cWow!  The tiara looks really cute!  But I was planning on only having Amanda wear one since she is really the flower girl\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seamstress apologizes, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.  I just figured this young lady was a second flower girl.  I figured she would need a tiara too\u2026.I will go ahead and take it off your bill.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the seamstress starts to remove the tiara, Amy interjects, \u201cWait!  On second thought, I really like the way it looks!  I think John should wear a matching tiara too with that dress!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seamstress cracks a smile, \u201cJohn?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at the seamstress and nod, \u201cYea\u2026I\u2019m normally a guy.   I\u2019m actually the best man.  It\u2019s a long story\u2026I had a mix up with the teleporter\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seamstress just smiled, \u201cTwo tiaras it is then\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One of groomsman jokes, \u201cTough break about your body John.  You are going to miss some great strippers tonight at the bachelor party!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes knowing you aren\u2019t old enough to go along to the bars tonight with David and the groomsman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wedding coordinator comes up and starts explaining the walkthrough of the wedding.  The wedding coordinator starts pairing up bridesmaids with groomsman to walk down the aisle with.  You notice the maid of honor has been paired up with a groomsman and you interrupt the wedding coordinator, \u201cUh..Excuse me..but I\u2019m the best man.  Shouldn\u2019t I walk down the aisle with the maid of honor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wedding coordinator looked down at you confused.  She wondered why an 8 year old girl was claiming to be the best man.  Amy quickly interjected, \u201cIt\u2019s true!  There was a mix up with his teleport.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the wedding coordinator understood what happened, she explained, \u201cThat\u2019s ok..This sort of thing happens all the time in my business.\u201d  The wedding coordinator started looking around and thinking of what to do with you.  The wedding coordinator finally explained, \u201cHmm\u2026This is highly unusual.  It will look rather strange for an 8 year old girl wearing a flower girl dress to walk down the aisle with the maid of honor\u2026.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wedding coordinator grabbed another groomsman and said, \u201cYou will have to escort the maid of honor instead\u2026\u201d  Next she grabbed your hand, \u201cYou are going to have to walk down with Amanda, just before the bride comes down the aisle.  It will look more appropriate if the two girls wearing matching flower girl dresses come down the aisle at the same time!  I have an extra basket you can carry too with flower petals so you can help Amanda spread them along the aisle\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy seemed relieved that the wedding coordinator figured out a way for the wedding party to enter.  Being a nervous bride, that was one less thing for her to worry about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the wedding coordinator hands you a basket of flowers, you start realizing your role of the best man has turned into the role of a second flower girl.  After you finish the practice walk with Amanda down the aisle, you wonder how tomorrow will go.      <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You ask Amy, \u201cIt\u2019s 7 am?  Why did you want me here so early?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy explains with a sigh, \u201cI suppose that\u2019s a fair question since you are new to the whole \u2018girl\u2019 thing.  The wedding is at 2pm and we have tons to do!...For starters, all of us girls need to get our hair and makeup done. That includes nails too!  We have to be completely dressed by 1pm for pictures. Followed by final touches for the wedding!  There\u2019s my hair, 5 bridesmaids, and two flower girls that have to get this all done in less than 4 hours!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can tell Amy is a stressed out bride.  You would have rather hung out with the groomsman all morning.  You were curious to how the bachelor party went last night.  You thought about what Amy just said and asked her, \u201cWait a second!?  Did you say TWO flower girls?  I\u2019m the best man!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know you are David\u2019s best man.  It\u2019s just been easier to organize this hair and makeup session by classifying you and Amanda both as flower girls.  The women I hired to do our hair and makeup needed a way to set everything out.  My wedding dress, hair extensions, and makeup is all in the corner over there\u2026All the bridesmaids stuff is along that wall, and yours and Amanda\u2019s stuff is by the other corner.  Don\u2019t worry sweetie, everybody knows you are the best man!  David wouldn\u2019t want anybody else giving a speech at the wedding besides you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel somewhat relieved hearing Amy refer to you as the \u2018best man.\u2019  But you suddenly get a nervous feeling remembering about the speech!  \u201cOh crap!\u201d  You thought to yourself realizing that you never wrote a speech.  You were planning on using this morning to write it.  You quickly find a pen and paper and sit down in front of your dress hanging on the wall next to Amanda\u2019s dress.  Just as you start writing, Amanda shows up and sits next to you.  She is giddy and excited for today with her big role as the flower girl.  As you try and write the speech, Amanda keeps talking to you causing you to lose your train of thought.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually a woman approaches you and Amanda,  \u201cHi girls!  I\u2019m Carolyn!  I\u2019m going to be doing your hair and makeup today!  I\u2019ll have you two girls looking just as beautiful as the bride today okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda wiggles her hands in excitement after meeting Carolyn.  Carolyn notices your lack of enthusiasm as she asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong sweetie?  Aren\u2019t you excited to get all dressed up for the wedding?  It\u2019s quite an honor to be chosen as a flower girl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly interrupt her, \u201cFirst of all, I\u2019m not a flower girl!  I\u2019m just wearing the same outfit as Amanda because there wasn\u2019t a bridesmaid dress in my size!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman replied, \u201cOh\u2026Okay..I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t know that sweetie.  That\u2019s really cute.  What are you\u2026about 7 or 8?  I\u2019ve never heard of such a young bridesmaid before.  You should feel honored the bride chose you for that job!  Are you her sister or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes, \u201cNo, I\u2019m best friends with the groom.  I\u2019m actually his best man.  There was a mix-up at the bodyport company yesterday when I arrived.  I ended up with this body instead of a guy\u2019s body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolyn nodded with understanding, \u201cAhhhh\u2026I see!  Don\u2019t worry honey, you aren\u2019t the first man I\u2019ve seen as a woman in a wedding.  After years of doing hair and makeup for weddings i\u2019ve seen it all with people using body-porting!  I used to work in the Bahamas doing destination weddings.  Due to the shortage of available bodies in such a tourist area, it was pretty common for body porters to end up in bodies of the opposite sex.  And I\u2019ve also seen plenty of men who chose to be ported into women\u2019s bodies for weddings.  I did a bridesmaid\u2019s hair and makeup just last week who was actually a man.  He was the brother of the bride.  The bride really wanted him in the wedding, but there wasn\u2019t room for another groomsman.  So her brother agreed to bodyport into a woman to be a bridesmaid.  He actually did a great job too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Carolyn\u2019s explanation made you feel better about the situation.  Carolyn finally said, \u201cOk girls!  Let\u2019s get started!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You try your best to work on your best man\u2019s speech every time Carolyn focuses her attention on Amanda. With all the women constantly gabbing, you barely have time to write anything down.  After getting your nails done, you couldn\u2019t hold a pen while your nails were drying.  Then almost immediately after, you got a light touch of makeup.  You weren\u2019t able to write with your face being worked on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith less than an hour before pictures, Carolyn has you both get your white tights on.  She then has you carefully step into a slip.  As Carolyn buttons up the back, you ask, \u201cWhoa?  What is this?  This wasn\u2019t part of the dress I tried on yesterday?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolyn explains, \u201cYou only tried on the outer shell of the dress yesterday to make sure it fit.  This slip has an attached petticoat so your dress will flare and fill out more. You will see what I mean in a second\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolyn then helps you pull the dress over and it falls into place over the petticoat.  You are surprised at how much the dress flares out now.  Carolyn ties the bow in the back and says, \u201cBe careful when you sit down. You don\u2019t want your dress accidentally poofing up.    It\u2019s only 11am so you will be wearing this dress until late tonight when the reception is over.\u2026Make sure you sit down and rest when you can.  These shoes might start to make your feet sore after wearing them all day.  And don\u2019t forget to have somebody help you go to the bathroom.  It will take too long to unbutton this dress, so they will have to hold it up while you sit down on the toilet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being educated on how to wear a dress, You mumble a reply, \u201cUh..Thanks\u2026I guess that\u2019s important to know\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolyn gets Amanda into her matching dress, and you try to sneak in some more speech writing.  Carolyn quickly grabs the pen out of your hand and says, \u201cSorry sweetie, but you can\u2019t risk getting ink on your dress.   You are going to have to just work on your speech in your head!\u201d   With barely anything written down anyway, you just toss your scratch paper into the trash.  You are going to have to try and come up with something and try memorizing it from now on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Carolyn pulls out two boxes of jewelry.  \u201cLuckily, the jewelry store was able to get a second set of these.  Amy was relieved when she found out you two would have complete matching outfits!\u201d  You stand still as Carolyn puts a necklace on you and a pair of earrings.  Finally, she pins both of your tiaras in and smiles, \u201cAll done girls!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow completely ready, you join Amy and the bridesmaids on the other side of the room.  They all smile at you and Amanda telling you both how adorable you look.  You tell Amy, \u201cSince I\u2019m done getting ready, Do you think somebody could drive me to meet up with David and the groomsman so I can see how they are doing?  I wanted to talk with David before the wedding\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looks at the clock and shakes her head, \u201cSorry John, but according to my wedding schedule, all of us girls are leaving here shortly to meet the guys together.  Don\u2019t worry, you will have plenty of time during the pictures to talk with David!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know there isn\u2019t any way to convince Amy to let you leave.  She has been a nervous and anxious bride all morning and you don\u2019t want to disrupt her strict wedding schedule.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thanks to Amy having a last minute hair emergency, the girls were all 20 minutes late for pictures.  The wedding planner and photographer quickly get to work positioning everybody for pictures.  Everything happens so fast, that you barely have time to even talk to David.  At first, you join all the groomsman in the \u2018boys\u2019 photo.  The photographer has you step out for some pictures wanting to get just the guys in their tuxes.  When the bridesmaids start getting their group pictures, the photographer asks you and Amanda to step in for some shots with only the girls.  Then at the end of the photo shoot, they have you stand with Amanda for a few shots because you have matching dresses on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn\u2019t until everybody lines up for the procession that you get a chance to finally talk to David.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid winks, \u201cHi John!....Cute tiara!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes, \u201cI wasn\u2019t originally supposed to even wear this stupid thing.  But once Amy saw it on me she, she decided that she wanted me and Amanda to match.   I decided not to fight it.  You know how crazy brides can be before their wedding!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid laughs, \u201cThanks for not causing any trouble!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then ask, \u201cSo how was the bachelor party last night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid replies with a big smile, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry you had to miss out on that!\u201d  He then whispers, \u201cThe strippers you set up for me were amazing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are still sour about not being able to hang out with the guys last night.  You then ask David, \u201cWhere\u2019s Amy\u2019s ring?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid reaches into his pocket and hands you the ring, \u201cGood thinking!  I almost forgot about that!  The best man always gives the groom the ring!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are glad you finally get to actually do a wedding task that is designed for the best man.  You look at the ring and smile, \u201cNice job buddy!  This must have cost a fortune!\u201d  Out of instinct, you try putting the ring in your pocket for safekeeping.  You look down realizing the dress you have on doesn\u2019t have pockets.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start looking for a place to put the ring as John notices your problem.  John finally says, \u201cHmmm\u2026It\u2019s probably easier if Roy (one of the groomsman)  keeps it in his pocket.  He\u2019s the next groomsman in line.  Just get it from him after we are in our places at the altar!...I\u2019ll see you up there buddy!\u201d  David then goes to the front of the church just before the wedding starts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the wedding party ready to start walking down the aisle, the wedding planner hands you and Amanda a basket of flowers and says, \u201cOkay flower girls\u2026.Remember to smile and spread these flowers out as much as you can!

Remember to walk slow so you don\u2019t trip over your dresses!...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you take the basket of flowers from her, you say, \u201c\u2026Ahem\u2026Amanda is the flower girl.!  Remember that I\u2019m just helping her out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wedding planner says, \u201cOh yea!  I keep forgetting that you are really the best man.

As you try getting into your place next to David, you realize your dress is so wide that it flares out too much.   The wide petticoat gets in the way and you cant fit into your spot.  You need some more room.   As you try spin around to whisper to the groomsman to back up a few steps, your dress brushes against a row of candles.  Luckily, the entire crowd is looking towards the back of the church and doesn\u2019t notice the candles almost fall down.  The preacher fortunately stopped the candles before toppling over.  You try to get the groomsman\u2019s attention again to back up, but they are all looking towards the bride and can\u2019t see you.  You know Amy will get mad if the wedding party doesn\u2019t look good.  You see that Amy is about half way down the aisle and will there soon!  You quickly start looking for another place to stand and see one of the bridesmaids waving you over.  You hope she has a good idea as you quickly and quietly slip over to the bridesmaid\u2019s side.

You are relieved you didn\u2019t ruin Amy\u2019s wedding procession.  But now you are stuck at the end of the bridesmaid\u2019s side with the rest of the girls.  Your real spot as the best man should have been next to David.  A few minutes later, the exchanging of the rings is about to happen.  Now that you are so far away from the center of the altar, you start thinking about how you are going to get the ring from Roy, and then hand it to David?  After all, as the best man, it is your job to hand the ring to the groom.   Before you can decide on a plan, you see Roy hand the ring to David.  From the end of the line, you just glare knowing your most important job was taken from you.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid nods, \u201cJohn got totally screwed by bodyporting into an 8 year old.  This would give him the chance to be an adult for the rest of the wedding, and the rest of his trip here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as you just wanted to be in a man\u2019s body so you could be a normal best man, the thought of being older was sounding like a better idea.  You reply, \u201cI really haven\u2019t felt like much of a best man since I\u2019ve been inside this 8 year old girl\u2019s body.  I suppose becoming Amy\u2019s Maid of Honor would finally give me something important to do for your wedding!  I\u2019ll do it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy hugs you and thanks you for doing this.  The limo pulls up to the bodyport terminal and you follow Vicki inside.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Luckily Vicki wrote down her speech!  It\u2019s in her purse so you can read it at the reception!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou agree, \u201cDon\u2019t worry.  Vicki told me all about the speech when we were inside the bodyport terminal.  She gave me specific instructions to make sure I cried a little at the end to make it look good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy laughs, \u201cTypical Vicki.  She is always trying to steal my thunder!  You are doing me a huge favor John!  I owe you big!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh, \u201cHow about a drink then!  I\u2019ve been 8 years old for the past 2 days!  I need to catch up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bridal party laughs and you finally get a glass of champagne.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling up to the reception, you get in line for the grand entrance.  You finally get a chance to talk to David.  You tell him, \u201cThanks for hooking me up with an adult body!  I can finally enjoy your wedding!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid nods, \u201cNo problem.  You deserved it!\u201d  David then eyes your chest and you realize he is checking you out.  You are going to have to get used to the stares while you are in Vicki\u2019s body.  With the low cut bridesmaid dress, your breasts are practically falling out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour conversation is interrupted by another groomsman, Roy, who takes your arm, \u201cCome on\u2026We are walking in together!\u201d     Making light of the situation you say, \u201cHold on tight\u2026I\u2019m not very good with these heels yet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy whispers back, \u201cSo what\u2019s it like being Vicki?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continue to walk you whisper back, \u201cIts better than being 8 years old!  I\u2019m not used to these boobs yet though.  Its weird to feel them bouncing around with every step.  I don\u2019t know how real women get used to this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy answers, \u201cI think that\u2019s why they invented bras.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dress you are wearing was a strapless and didn\u2019t have a bra.  You nod your head, \u201cHmm\u2026I think you are right.  A bra would help keep these things under control..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy then asks, \u201cSo\u2026 did Vicki mention anything about last night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell him, \u201cShe barely had time to tell me much of anything.  She had to bodyport immediately.  It was mostly advice on the maid of honor speech.  Why do you ask?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy explains, \u201cHmmm, I would have guessed she might have told you that we hooked up last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes get wide finding out that Roy and Vicki slept together last night.  \u201cWow!  That means I\u2019m in the body of the girl who you screwed last night?\u201d  Your male mind takes over and you quickly ask, \u201cHmm..Was I any good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy nodded with a giggle, \u201cYea!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then joke, \u201cI hope you had your fun last night.  Because there is no way you are screwing me tonight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy then gave the best smile he could and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be so sure!  I\u2019ve heard when you bodyport that you develop the same attractions that the body has.  That means YOU are sexually attracted to me now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scowl at him, \u201cThere\u2019s no way that\u2019s true!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy nods as he comes in closer.  Now holding both of your hands, he gives an even sexier smile.  He then pushes your hair out of your face.  You are caught in his smile as you let him get even closer.  For some reason, you start to think that Roy is pretty cute.  When he leans in, you can smell his cologne and you really like it.  Roy quickly steals a kiss and you stand frozen realizing you let it happen.  Roy then winks, \u201cIf you change your mind, I\u2019m staying in room 201!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap out of it and take a step back.  You can\u2019t believe Vicki\u2019s body is so attracted to Roy.  You give him a glare.  Your glare then turns into an embarrassed smirk as you say, \u201cYou jerk!...I can\u2019t believe you just tricked me like that!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy smirked, \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t feel anything with that kiss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly reply, \u201cOf course I did!  I\u2019m in Vicki\u2019s body!  It felt great kissing you!  But knock that shit off Roy!  I\u2019m really a guy!  There is NO way I\u2019m messing around with you tonight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy laughed, \u201cWe\u2019ll see about that\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When she asked you how big little Roy was you panicked and told her you would go check and see.  She laughed and told you to take some pictures with your phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross!\" you muttered as you carefully walked on Vicki's high heels and bump into Roy.  He asks you to dance.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how to dance backward!\" you inform him, but he points out that the band is playing a rock tune and all you have to do is 'shake your groove thing' as the tune the band was playing demanded...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed your hand and gently pulled you into the other dancers.  You almost laugh at his own bad dancing.  You couldn't do much worse than Ron!  So you started copying the moves of another girl and soon your new body parts both fore and aft were swinging and swaying to the song.  It kind of felt good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was actually fun, you thought, until the song ended and a slow love song began.  All the girls and boys pulled each other close so you started to move back to your seat.  Suddenly Ron took your hand and pulled you close, your firm breasts pressing up against his muscled abs.  Your body betrayed you and your feminine hands reached up to his shoulders as his hands wrapped around your oh-so-slender waist.  He pulled you much closer and you decided that 'little Ron' was not so little, as Vicki's friend would be pleased to learn if you saw her later.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some strange reason you felt safe in Ron's strong arms and relaxed as you both slowly swayed to the music...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

You pulled the end of the dress a bit to try to covered up more of your legs but you fail, then you turned toward David and asked him with his wife's voice, \"David ...

She notices you standing there, pauses, and raises her eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That you, Caitlin?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly...\" You reply, Caitlin's squeaky feminine voice coming out of your throat. \"I take it you know she went to the bodyport earlier today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl sets the bag down on a table and sweeps her long, blonde hair to the side. \"Yeah! Please, make yourself at home. You already know your name; my name is Brittany. We're roommates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany is a short, thin girl with a cheerful demeanor. Her tanned skin and bleach blonde hair makes her look like a beach bunny, the kind who wouldn't look out of place in a sorority. She's pretty, with a dazzling smile that dimples up to her raised cheekbones, and she has the slightest hint of freckles. She has a nose piercing and plug piercings distending the lobes of her ears a little. Her eyes are also brown, and they shine back at you with a fresh curiosity as they seem to try to pierce inside of you to find out who her roommate has become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's dressed in a strappy tank top (floral patterned, not a solid blue like yours) that frills out at her hips and gives way to a denim miniskirt that rides halfway up her tanned, creamy thighs. Finally, cute little sneakers adorn her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step forward to shake her hand, introducing yourself and explaining why you'll be occupying her roommate's body for the next week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany erupts in a peal of nasally laughter. \"Ah ha ha! I can't believe this... My roommate is really a 21-year-old guy named Jonathan Rivers.\" She kicks off her shoes, sits on the couch, and pulls the tab of a soda can. It fizzles in her hand as she presses her lips to its mouth, sucking in the froth so it doesn't spill on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't talked to Caitlin yet. Anything I should know about her just in case?\" You ask, gazing down at this roommate who seems just as messy as the rest of the apartment reflects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me think,\" She inhales. Counting on her slender fingers, she begins, \"Well, for starters, your body is most definitely lactose intolerant. So no milk, no cheese, no dairy for you! But Caitlin doesn't really mind because she's a vegan. So I guess that means you are now too, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snort, folding your new slender arms underneath your boobs. <i>Oh yeah, you have boobs now</i>. \"Not if I can help it. I'm sure the planet isn't gonna burn down if I eat a hamburger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself, but meat upsets Caitlin's stomach pretty easily.\" Brittany winks innocently. \"I doubt you want something like <i>that</i> happening during one of your hotshot business meetings, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grimace. Why did you have to get this body and life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, whatever. I'm sure I'll find out more stuff about this girl's life over the next week. Just a couple more questions: why would a girl like Caitlin want to swap with me? Assuming it wasn't a mix up, of course. I'm a big guy, I'm six-foot-four, played basketball for several years before going to university. And lastly, does this chick have any business clothes I can wear next week?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot everyone likes using bodyports because to use them means swapping lives with somebody else. You get their body and, in exchange, they get your body. The bodyport works essentially like a mind uploader, transferring your personality, memories, knowledge, and other things between physical brains. For people swapping across the country, and in many cases across different countries, that means trusting strangers not to ruin your life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen bodyports were first invented, few people wanted to use them because of some highly publicised stories of joyrides taken while in others' bodies. Crime, drug use, even accidental deaths while in someone else's body were all legitimate concerns that deterred people from using this new technology. But against doomsayers' predictions, most people actually <i>do</i> treat others' lives with care and respect. Bodyports are required by law to compensate thefts and other \"damages\" to customers, and they afford this through subsidies from the government as well as fees and charges paid by those found to be irresponsible while in others' lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, Caitlin probably wanted to know what it's like to be a guy.\" Brittany shrugs her shoulders. \"That's what she told me at the club on Saturday night, at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, do girls really think about that sort of thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glances at you crassly. \"Seriously? Who <i>doesn't</i> wanna know what it's like on the other side of the gender fence? I've even had a few thoughts myself. I've never been a guy though, only used a bodyport once and that was to go visit my Nana in the hospital before she passed away. She had had a stroke all of a sudden and I couldn't get there in time by train. And most regular airports had gone out of business by that time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to hear that,\" You reply. It's amazing how much this girl is willing to open up to you. Maybe it's because you look like her roommate, so she feels more comfortable around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have, like, a Facebook or Instagram account?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, and she gives you her laptop to log into your Facebook profile. You're not active on that site, but there are several tagged photos which you show her. She hums in admiration as she tabs through the photos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... yum! Now <i>that's</i> definitely my cup of tea! Caitlin found herself a sexy bod for sure,\" She laughs, and your face reddens. Seeing your reaction, she scoffs, \"Aww, how sweet! You look so cute when you're embarrassed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChanging the subject, you clear your throat. \"So, why is this place such a mess? Looks like a tornado went through here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wanna clean it up, <i>roommate</i>, I'm not stopping ya!\" Brittany drawls, stretching out her legs on the couch and flipping on the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what about my other question? The one about business clothes?\" You frown. \"I don't want to spend my own money buying clothes for this girl that I'm only gonna wear once or twice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo prevent identity theft, bodyports also electronically transferred customers' banking and credit information into their newly swapped lives. That means that even though you may have Caitlin's credit cards, anywhere you use them will recognise your own accounts instead. It's not a perfect system, as online purchases are still vulnerable to people manually entering in card information, but people usually approve these purchases using text or e-mail confirmations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's an easy answer!\" She replies flippantly. What does Brittany, Caitlin's roommate, say regarding business clothes you can wear for the upcoming, week-long meetings?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But if you are going to pull of being a woman for the next week, you are going to have to try and play the part.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to play along and smile sarcastically, \u201cYay!\u201d  You wave your arms like Brittney was a moment ago.  Brittney laughed, \u201cWe will have to work you your girl-mannerisms a bit.\u201d  Brittney then grabs your hand and drags you into her bedroom, \u201cLuckily, Caitlin and I are the same size.  We always borrow each other\u2019s clothes.\u201d  Brittney grabs a short red mini-dress from her closet and holds it up to you giggling, \u201cFYI, this looks amazing on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eye the sexy looking mini-dress and still can't believe you have a body that can fit stuff like that now.  You interrupt, \u201cAhem.  I\u2019m going to need something more professional looking for work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittney grins, \u201cRight.  I guess we can save this for later this week when we go out for drinks.\u201d  She quickly grabs a few items from her closet and then rushes into Caitlin\u2019s bedroom.  She gathers an ensemble and lays out the clothing on the bed, \u201cHere you go.  I wore that skirt for an interview\u2026Caitlin\u2019s blouse matches it perfectly...The shade of these pantyhose will go fabulous with my black heels.  Trust me, your legs will look great.\u201d  You look at the pile of clothing on the bed and slowly pick up the pair of panties Brittney laid out for you.  It\u2019s a tiny pink lacy thong with a bow on the front.  You laugh, \u201cSeriously?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittney rolls her eyes, \u201cYou are a girl now.  You can\u2019t wear a form fitting skirt with granny panties underneath.  Hello?  You have to wear a thong so you don\u2019t get pantie lines underneath.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to act like you knew that, \u201cOh.  Yea.  Thanks.\u201d  Brittney cues you again, \u201cGo ahead.  Try the complete outfit on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and patiently wait for Brittney to leave you in privacy.  After a few moments, it\u2019s obvious she isn\u2019t going to leave.  Brittney smirked, \u201cRelax.  It\u2019s just like when you were a guy and changed in front of  your friends.  It\u2019s not a big deal.  We are going to end up seeing each other naked all the time you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you had a penis, it would have been rock hard as you eagerly reply, \u201cWe will?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittney nods, \u201cIt's pretty much necessary when living with another woman sharing an apartment with only one bathroom.  It\u2019s descent sized though.  The sink is big and lot of counter space.  Caitlin and I usually end up doing our makeup together.  Plus, the shower fits two comfortably.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes get wide hearing that Brittney and Caitlin periodically shower together.  Brittney explains, \u201cYou\u2019ve had a girlfriend before right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod 'Yes' in a daze imagining what showering along side Brittney would be like.  She continues, \u201cThen you know how long it takes girls to get ready.  If we waited until the other one was done with their shower, it would take even longer for us both to get ready in the morning.  So feel free to slip in if I\u2019m taking forever in there okay?\u201d  Brittney then asks, \u201cBy the way, were you ever on the swim team by chance?  Have you ever shaven your legs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, \u201cNo.  Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now you have slipped on the pink thong and have most of your legs exposed.  Brittney can tell by face that you have never worn such an item before as you tug and prod on the fabric snug in your butt, \u201cDon\u2019t worry.  After a few minutes, you won\u2019t even notice you are wearing a thong.\u201d  Brittney then points to your bare legs and shakes her head, \u201cCaitlin didn\u2019t do you any favors by leaving you with freshly shaven legs.  It appears she left you a few days worth of stubble.  So I\u2019ll give you a lesson once we get into the shower.  You are going to be wearing a skirt to work tomorrow so you have to shave your legs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, you\u2019ve finished buttoning up Caitlin\u2019s blouse and notice how it hugs her hourglass curves.  You can't help but keep eyeing Brittney's body knowing that you will be showering together soon.  You step into the business skirt and pull it up.  You look down and zip the front as Brittney laughs, \u201cThe zipper goes in the back\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are embarrassed and spin the skirt around and finish zipping it up in the back.  Brittney is pleased with the outfit she has created for you and smiles, \"You are going to look great for your first day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the apartment door opens and a man\u2019s voice yells, \u201cCaitlin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittney yells back, \u201cTyler?  What are you doing here?  You know Caitlin is gone this week!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are startled and ask Brittney, \u201cWho is Tyler?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittney tells you, \u201cThat\u2019s Caitlin\u2019s boyfriend.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler turns the corner and looks at you with a skeptical eye.  Brittney introduces you, \u201cThis is Jonathan Rivers.  He body-ported into Caitlin\u2019s body for the week while she is gone.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler seems mad, \u201cYou are really a guy?  And you are in my girlfriend\u2019s body!  Are you some sort of sick pervert or something!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly feel your new female body trembling at how big and strong Tyler seems when he is mad.  You blush, \u201cIt\u2019s not what you think.  I didn\u2019t chose to end up in your girlfriend\u2019s body.  It was a last minute body port for a job interview.\u201d  You spend the next few minutes explaining to Tyler who you really are and what you are doing in Caitlin\u2019s body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler seems to finally understand and isn\u2019t mad anymore.  He is curious about your personality and asks, \u201cSo?  Are you a baseball fan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile big, \u201cHell yea!  I can\u2019t wait for the game tomorrow night!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler laughs, \u201cThis is so cool.  My girlfriend is into sports now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your hands on Caitlin\u2019s hips and joke, \u201cGirlfriend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler smirks, \u201cYou know what I mean.  You are in her body for now.  What do you say about watching the game tonight at the sports bar with me?  The real Caitlin would never tag along with me to watch baseball.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, you excitedly reply, \u201cSure!  There\u2019s NO way I\u2019m missing the big game tonight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler winks, \u201cThen it\u2019s a date!  I\u2019ll be back to pick you up at 6:30.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringe, \u201cA date?  I\u2019m really a guy you know!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler apologized, \u201cSorry.  It\u2019s just habit to refer to picking up my girlfriend\u2019s body as a date.  We can call it whatever you\u2019d like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou joke back, \u201cLet\u2019s call it a guy\u2019s night out then!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler laughed staring at your boobs, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem exactly accurate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at your curvy hips and agree, \u201cFine.  Let\u2019s not call it anything then.  Just pick me up at 6:30.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler winked, \u201cOkay.  Then it\u2019s a date!\u201d  He slammed the door shut and ran out to his car before you could complain to Brittney, \u201cWhat was that?  It\u2019s NOT a date! Tyler seems like a nice guy but he can really be a jerk sometimes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittney giggled, \u201cYou are really starting to sound like the real Caitlin!  She said that exact sentence the last time Tyler left our apartment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand why.\"  You mumble as you start taking off the professional skirt and blouse for work tomorrow.  Soon you are down to your panties and bra.  You decide to slip into something more comfortable to lounge around the apartment in.  You notice that Brittney is wearing a pair of yoga pants that hug her curves.  You follow suit and find a pair of Caitlin's yoga pants.  As you start pulling them up, Brittney looks at you confused, \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally tugged the yoga pants up and giggle at how tight, but yet how comfortable they feel.  You always wondered why girls wore them and now you know why, \"I'm getting dressed.  Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittney points at the clock, \"Why?  Are you serious? It's 5 o'clock.  Tyler will be back here in an hour and a half to pick you up for your date!  You need to start getting ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's NOT a date!  We are just watching the game.\"  You reply, \"Plus, that's plenty of time to get ready.  We should hang out before I leave so you can fill me in on more things about Caitlin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittney shakes her head, \"If you are going to pull off being female for the next week, you need to get used to girl-routines.  You still need to shower, shave your legs, pick out something to wear, do your hair and makeup.  Only having 90 minutes to get ready for a date is barely enough in girl-time!  Let's hit the shower!  I'll show you how to shave your legs.  Then I'll give you a crash course on hair and makeup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's NOT a date!\"  You say again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittney rolls her eyes, \"Whatever you want to call it.  You are a woman now.  And you are about to go to a sports bar filled with men.  Like it or not, you'll be getting lots of stares tonight.  You need to look Caitlin's best.  She would be devastated if her body went out in public without cute hair and makeup.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch in amazement as Brittney rips her top off and pulls down her yoga pants.  She scurries off to the shower and gets the water going.  You can't believe how cool she is being by helping you out with all this girl stuff.  You are even more excited at the thought of sharing a shower with her.  You eagerly tear off your yoga pants too and join her. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From inside the shower, Brittney motioned with her hand, \u201cCome on girlfriend.  Don\u2019t be shy.  The clock is ticking.  You only have about 75 minutes left until Tyler picks you up!\u201d  She had turned on both shower heads and steam from the hot water was starting to thicken the room.  You could only make out Brittney\u2019s silhouette as you started getting excited.  You were about to get a lesson on female grooming while showering alongside a sexy woman.  You are thankful that Brittney is so willing to help you out.  You have no idea how to get ready in this body.  The last thing you want to do is cause any problems.  But seeing her naked body through the thick steam started to turn you on.  \u201c<i>Uh oh..</i>\u201d  You think as you feel a stirring in your crotch.  Instinctively, you give yourself a mental pep-talk, \u201c<i>Come on Jonathan!  Don\u2019t get an erection now you idiot! You don\u2019t want to scare her away from helping!</i>\u201d  You look down in hopes to talk your stiffening member down.  You suddenly snap out of your daze.  As if Caitlin\u2019s bare breasts dangling off your chest weren\u2019t enough to remind you that you were a woman, you also glance at the void in between your crotch.  For the first time since body-porting into a female body, you were thankful NOT to have a penis.  As you stared at Caitlin\u2019s womanhood from above, you smirked knowing there was not outside evidence that you were turned on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn\u2019t realized how long you were looking down at your current body until Brittney interrupted. \u201cIt\u2019s just a vagina sweetie.  All us girls have one!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are starting to get to know Brittney better by now and follow her lead by joking back, \u201cCut me some slack girlfriend.  This is totally like the first time I\u2019ve seen myself naked since body-porting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittney is pleased with your attempt to talk like a normal girl and laughs, \u201cThat\u2019s the spirit!  You are starting to really sound like Caitlin!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, you have joined Brittney in the shower and start lathering up. After a few moments of seeing what you are doing, Brittney laughs, \u201cI think they are clean by now!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been using Caitlin\u2019s bodywash and were rubbing around her breasts getting used to having her mounds.  You hadn\u2019t realized you\u2019d been cleaning them for such an excessive amount of time and smirked, \u201cOnce again.  Boobs are new to me.  I used to have to search the internet to see a set of these up close.  It\u2019s certainly going to take some getting used to having a pair attached to my own chest.\u201d  You jokingly wiggle your body back and forth while your breasts jiggle around, \u201cI see why you ladies wear bras now.  These things have a mind of their own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittney understands how strange it must be for a man to suddenly be in a woman\u2019s body.  She lets her roommate rub more bodywash on her chest for a few moments until interrupting again, \u201cAhem.  You may want to split your washing time on places that are more likely to need cleaning.\u201d  Brittney points to your crotch with a wink, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to have any bad odors down there for your big date!  You know, just in case you end up back at Tyler\u2019s place afterwards.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh, \u201cVery funny!  That\u2019s definitely NOT an option.  I\u2019m really a guy!  The idea of being with another man is disgusting.  Plus, I signed a standard contract at the body-port company that said I wouldn\u2019t have promiscuous sexual encounters with Caitlin\u2019s body.  Not that I\u2019m even the slightest bit interested, but it would be a breach of contract and a lifetime ban on body-porting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittney smiles, \u201cI know about the contract.  You are right, you aren\u2019t supposed to have sex with random people while body-porting.  But if you read the contract closely, there are exemptions.  For example, if you body-port into a married couple\u2019s body, you can have sex like they normally do.  The same counts for a current relationship.  Tyler is currently Caitlin\u2019s boyfriend so it would be totally legal if you slept with him.  Caitlin always does.  I should know.  I\u2019ve heard them through the walls before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ask, \u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittney grins, \u201cYep.  And FYI, Tyler must be pretty well hung.  Or else Caitlin is just a screamer. The noises I\u2019ve heard her make are rather impressive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant!\u201d  You reply, \u201cI meant really?  It\u2019s legal to sleep with your body\u2019s significant other?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittney nods , \u201cOf course it is.\u201d  She then smirks \u201cSo?  Do you have a girlfriend back home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly realize that Caitlin could legally have sex with your male body.  You technically have a girlfriend you started dating a few weeks ago.  It was just easy casual sex until you found the next best fling.  But then she cut you off and started acting crazy.  You agreed to call her your \u2018girlfriend\u2019 just so you could continue sleeping with her.  You had future plans for ever staying with her.  You suddenly hoped Caitlin wasn\u2019t taking advantage of the loophole in the body-port law and seeing her.  The last thing you needed was having your new crazy girlfriend thinking you really liked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts were interrupted by Brittney, \u201cI think you should totally do it.  I would.  Talk about a learning experience.  I always wondered what really turns a guy on.  If I ever body-port into a man\u2019s body I\u2019m going to certainly try it.  Just imagine how much better of a sexual partner you\u2019d be.\u201d  Brittney then giggled, \u201cOh yea.  If I\u2019m ever a man, I totally want to GET a blowjob too.  I\u2019ve given way too many of those to miss out what it feels like to receive one!  I\u2019m so jealous that Caitlin will find out what it\u2019s like before me.\u201d  Brittney winks, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve gotten tons of blowjobs too.  As a \u2018thank-you\u2019 to all women, you should give Tyler a blowjob tonight.  Then you\u2019ll finally find out what it feels like to be on your knees while a guy tugs your hair all around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes get wide at the thought of sucking another man\u2019s dick, \u201cEwwww!\u201d  You shriek, \u201cI\u2019m NOT doing that.  NOR am I letting a man stick his dick inside me either!  I\u2019m really a GUY and I have my pride!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittney giggled, \u201cYour loss.  You finally have a chance to experience multiple orgasms and you are just going to pass it up?   Over pride?  Like I said, Caitlin a screamer too.  She sounds like she has tons of orgasms when she has sex.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t help but go into a daze imagining what multiple orgasms feel like.  The thought of having sex with Caitlin\u2019s body hadn\u2019t even crossed your mind until now.  You began to wonder if you could even go through with it?  You look down again at the void in between your legs and think about how strange it would be to watch a penis disappear inside.  With each deep thrust inside, it would expand Caitlin\u2019s womanhood.  You wonder what it felt like to be screwed.  You wondered if you\u2019d feel every inch of Tyler\u2019s penis while he was inside.  You wondered what having your new labia rubbed against felt like. You then wondered what it would feel like when Tyler shot his load.  Would it be warm?  Would it feel good? You get into your daze even more daydreaming about Tyler.  You start to convince yourself that he is handsome (for a guy that is).  He had an attractive 5 o\u2019clock shadow and his pecs were tight under his shirt.  You wonder if he had a 6 pack.  If you were going to roll around naked with a guy, you wanted him to be perfect.  You hadn\u2019t realized it, but you had your eyes closed and were washing your vagina.  You started rubbing and let out a moan, \u201cMmmmm\u2026.Tyler\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittney broke your concentration, \u201cWow!  You sure changed your mind quick!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Huh?\u201d  You say trying to cover-up what you just got caught doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittney giggles, \u201cIt\u2019s okay to be attracted to guys now.  You in Caitlin\u2019s body.  You are a woman.  You have female hormones and desires.  You can\u2019t fight what your body wants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Oh shit!</i>\u201d  You say thinking, \u201c<i>I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m actually attracted to men now!</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittney then tells you, \u201cOh yea.  By the way.  Caitlin was trying to put in some good words for me to Tyler\u2019s friend Josh.  If you see Josh tonight, can you try and talk me up to him.  I\u2019ve been trying to catch his eye for weeks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are glad the conversation has finally changed, \u201cUh.  Sure.  If I meet Josh, I\u2019ll say something for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittney thought, \u201cHmm.  That sounds weird coming from you. Caitlin has knowing Josh for years.  You wouldn\u2019t technically be meeting him for the first time tonight.  That makes we wonder if Tyler is going to mention that Caitlin body-ported this week?  I think she only told me and Tyler that she was leaving.  I wonder what Tyler will tell his friends?  They won\u2019t think anything is strange when you two show up together like normal.  But I wonder if he already told them who you are?  Or maybe he will be embarrassed to admit his girlfriend\u2019s body is really being controlled by a guy and just keep it to himself.  That way, all his friends will just think you are really Caitlin.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn\u2019t realized that Tyler might keep your true identity to himself.  You assumed you\u2019d be introduced to a bunch of guys tonight and watch the game like normal with your regular male friends.  You looked at it as a nice way to escape the reality that you were spending a week as a woman.  But on the other hand, it might be easier to just pretend to be the real Caitlin.  You\u2019d avoid lots of embarrassing questions from his friends asking what having boobs felt like.  You would be certain to endure lots of pussy jokes too. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At 6:30 sharp, Tyler walked in his girlfriend\u2019s apartment like he normally did.  Brittney was helping you with the final accessories for the night.  As she put the backing on the last earring you noted how strange it was to have holes in your ears now.  It was one of many new thoughts you had over the past 90 minutes getting ready as a woman.  You were pleased Brittney was so willing to help you out.  Although, you still were a bit leery with her outfit choice.  You were wearing one of Brittney\u2019s red mini-dresses that she claimed made Caitlin\u2019s body look amazing.  She was right.  It was hard not to stare at your own reflection in the mirror.  The dress hugged every curve of your body and barely went to mid-thigh.  It was a new feeling to have so much bare leg showing.  Although you weren\u2019t looking forward to navigating in them, the 3 inch heels Brittney chose for you made your legs look extra long.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turn back and forth in the mirror, your male brain is excited to see such a sexy woman.  You run your hands over your round butt and are amazed at how great it looks in the dress.  If you were in your normal male body and saw this woman, you\u2019d be drooling.  It was a comforting feeling to know you could look in the mirror at any time to see Caitlin\u2019s beautiful reflection.  You hear Tyler yelling from the living room that he arrived.  Brittney smiles, \u201cYour boyfriend is here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tug down on your mini-dress in attempts to make it longer and mention, \u201cI feel over dressed.  It\u2019s just a sports game.  I usually wear comfortable clothes for stuff like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou usually aren\u2019t a 19 year old girl either!\u201d  Brittney jokes, \u201cCaitlin would be devastated if she found out you wore frumpy clothes in public with her body.  Plus, we didn\u2019t spend all that time shaving your legs in the shower to hide them under pants.  The sports bar Tyler is bringing you to is a college bar.  Us ladies always dress our best at places like that.\u201d  Brittney hands you a purse as you go meet Tyler.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a shy nervous look on your face as you walk across the hardwood floors.  Your heels sound so loud with each step.  As you sway Caitlin\u2019s hips, you know the view from behind would be sexy.  Tyler was fumbling with his phone and looked up.  He practically gasped seeing his girlfriend\u2019s body looking so beautiful.  It was a satisfying feeling to be looked at with such admiration.  For some reason, Tyler\u2019s smile calmed your nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler let out a whistle, \u201cDamn.  You look fantastic!\u201d  You let out a giggle and do a quick spin to show off your outfit.  Tyler laughs, \u201cAre you sure you\u2019ve never body ported into a female before?  Because the way you managed to do Caitlin\u2019s hair and makeup flawlessly\u2026.That dress\u2026those sexy heels\u2026.Wow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou appreciate the compliment, \u201cYea.  This is my first female body.  But I owe it all to Brittney for her help.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittney emerges and waves to Tyler, \u201cYou are welcome by the way.  I couldn\u2019t let my best friend go out without looking fantastic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks!\u201d  Tyler says as you both walk out of the apartment.  The hallway was easy.  It wasn\u2019t until you got to the stairs where you had to slow down and really concentrate.  You told Tyler, \u201cSorry.  I\u2019m not very good with heels yet.  Stairs are a bit tricky!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was already at the bottom and came back to your aid, \u201cHere! Take my arm.  I\u2019ll help steady you!\u201d  It was the first time you\u2019d touched Tyler.  He embraced your arm and put one hand on the small of your back.  The support was appreciated as you traversed down the staircase.  Tyler pointed out, \u201cDon\u2019t feel bad.  I help Caitlin down this staircase every time when she is in heels too.  Even a real woman has trouble with these stairs.\u201d  Tyler\u2019s kind words make you laugh as you explain, \u201cI wanted to wear yoga pants and a jersey to the sportsbar.  But NOOOOO.  Brittney just had to get me all dolled up like this.  She could have gone easy on me as my first time out in a woman\u2019s body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler smirks, \u201cI still can\u2019t believe you are really a guy.  That has to be so strange to have a\u2026\u201d  Tyler seemed to struggle with the correct word.  He would have never said such a thing to his girlfriend.  But knowing that his girlfriend\u2019s body was being controlled by a regular guy, Tyler continued, \u201c\u2026You know\u2026It must be strange to have a pussy.  I can\u2019t imagine what it would feel like not to have a dick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou joke back, \u201cI thought the same thing at first too.  But it\u2019s actually not too bad.  To be honest, it\u2019s rather comfortable without extra parts getting in the way.  Check this out!\u201d  Just for fun, you intentionally walk into a nearby bench so the seatback hits the front of your pelvis, \u201cSee!  No pain.  If I had balls I\u2019d be crying right now!\u201d  You then sat on the bench quickly and crossed your legs.  You bobbed your leg up and down smirking, \u201cGood luck trying doing this with a dick!\u201d  You then shook your head so Caitlin\u2019s long hair flared around while cupping Caitlin\u2019s breasts with both hands, \u201cThe weirdest part about being a woman is getting used to all this hair and having these babies attached to your chest.  Every time I breath or even move my body they seem to shift around.  Thank goodness for bras.  Otherwise they would be bouncing everywhere.\u201d You then jokingly slap the sides of your curvy thighs, \u201cNot to mention all this extra padding from behind makes a nice cushion to sit on. It makes sitting down to pee more bearable.  Speaking of that, you have no idea how weird of a sight it is to have panties around your ankles while sitting on a toilet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler couldn\u2019t help but laugh seeing his girlfriend\u2019s body acting and talking like this.  It was amusing to see Caitlin with such a different personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give your breasts one last jiggle and tell Tyler, \u201cYou are a lucky dude.  I can\u2019t believe you get to screw this body whenever you want.  I couldn\u2019t help but sneak a few peeks while I was naked earlier and daydream about it.  I\u2019m guessing she is fun in the sack.  From what Brittney mentioned, Caitlin gets very vocal when you two have sex.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler grinned, \u201cYea.  Caitlin is a freak in bed.  She can really bend her body around.  She\u2019s into kinky stuff too and role playing.  There's never a dull moment.  I\u2019m pretty sure it stems from her daddy issues.  To be honest, Caitlin is extremely high-maintenance.  She brings the term <i>crazy</i> to a new level sometimes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jokingly reply, \u201cOh great.  So you are telling me I\u2019m in the body of a crazy chick?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler nodded, \u201cYep.  Caitlin is a handful.  Between you and me, I\u2019m only riding this out for the great sex.  Caitlin texts me like a thousand times a day.  It\u2019s been a relief having you control her cell phone recently.  She\u2019s big into labels and insisted that we call each other boyfriend and girlfriend.  To be honest, I\u2019m banging a few other chicks right now too that she doesn\u2019t know about.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to make a crazy-girlfriend face and complain, \u201cYou are cheating on me!  I can\u2019t believe this!  OMG!  What\u2019s her name?  I\u2019m going to chick punch that bitch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler grins, \u201cNow THAT\u2019s the crazy Caitlin I\u2019m used to!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell him, \u201cDude.  I know exactly how you feel.  I have a similar situation going on at home.  This crazy chick I\u2019m dating insisted we call each other boyfriend and girlfriend too.  I can relate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler smiles, \u201cI gotta tell you.  This is really exciting to be discussing this sort of thing with my girlfriend.  I mean\u2026I know you aren\u2019t my girlfriend, you are just in her body.  But it\u2019s fun to discuss this stuff with her.  It feels like I let a load off my shoulders telling you I\u2019m cheating on her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool.  Your secret is safe with me!\u201d  You reply while walking towards the sports bar.  You then mention, \u201cSo, speaking of great pieces of ass.  You\u2019ll never guess what I got to do today.  Brittney helped me get ready\u2026\u201d  You twirl around in your mini-dress showing off your appearance, \u201c\u2026Thus this outfit she made we wear\u2026  But anyways, while we were getting ready we showered together!  It was like the hottest thing ever.  I\u2019d love to pound Brittney sometime.  She is sexy as hell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler felt a stirring in his pants at the thought of two women showering together, \u201cReally?  Caitlin mentioned they did that sometimes.  I didn\u2019t think she was actually serious.   You gotta give me details.  Did you two wash each other\u2019s breasts?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh, \u201cUnfortunately no.  I spent like half the shower washing my own tits.  Brittney did wash my hair for me though.  And she washed by back.  She also helped me shave my legs and crotch.  I\u2019m glad she offered to do that.  I have no idea how to shave a vagina.  DUDE.  That reminds me.  Thanks to 'yours truly,' Caitlin has a new look down there.  I had Brittney shave most of my bush and shape it into a landing strip.  I always love that look on women and figured I\u2019d give it a try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler seemed to be getting turned on hearing about the details of his girlfriend\u2019s new appearance.  By now, you had reached the entrance of the sports bar.  Before going in, you stop outside the door.  Tyler asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?  Let\u2019s go inside and meet my friends.  They are going to get a kick out of seeing Caitlin talking and acting like one of the guys.  They are going to get a good laugh once they find out who you really are.  None of the have any idea Caitlin even body ported this week.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You get a nervous look, \u201cActually, I had a different idea.  Since none of them know I\u2019m not really Caitlin, I\u2019d rather not say anything.  It\u2019s an important game.  I\u2019d rather watch it without having to answer questions all night about what having a pussy is like.  Afterall, I\u2019m really a man.  I\u2019m currently in a woman\u2019s body wearing a dress and heels.  If your friends are anything like mine, they will be ruthless.  I\u2019ll have to deal with all sorts of jokes the entire time.  How about instead, we just pretend I\u2019m really Caitlin for the evening.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shrugged his shoulders, \u201cFair enough.  I won\u2019t tell anybody who you really are.  But be careful not to rattle off stats or call players by their names.  Caitlin barely knows anything about sports.  We don\u2019t want anybody to get suspicious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, \u201cNo problem!  I can even ask stupid questions about the rules every now and then so I look like a normal chick who doesn\u2019t follow sports.  Any other advice?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler nods, \u201cTry and act bored like she always does when she tags along to games.  And try not to laugh at our normal guy jokes.  Say stuff like <i>Ewww</i>\u2026or <i>Gross</i>\u2026 if my friends say something inappropriate.  Tell them they are disgusting.  Caitlin always says that when she hears us guys joking.  Play with your cell phone a lot.  At the end of every quarter, pretend like you think it\u2019s the end of the game and get excited to leave.  Stuff like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh, \u201cI suppose I can try to pull this off.  Thanks for not telling all the guys who I really am.  This will be relaxing to watch the game and BS with friends like I normally do. Plus, this will give me a little practice pulling off being female in public for my interview tomorrow.  I\u2019m sure the panel will find out my true identity, but I don\u2019t need every other employee I walk by to know I\u2019m really a man.\u201d  You lead the way and reach to open the front door and say, \u201cLet\u2019s go in.  The game is about to start.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler stops you and grabs your arm, \u201cNot so fast.  If we pretending to be boyfriend/girlfriend tonight, we better start getting used to it.  I\u2019m not letting you open your own doors.  Caitlin always expects stuff like that.\u201d  Tyler reaches over and opens the door.  He holds it open enough so you can walk in while placing his other hand around he small of your back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggle, \u201cHmm.  I suppose there are advantages of having tits.  I\u2019ve never had anybody open a door for me before!  This is kind of fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Tyler takes your hand and explains, \u201cCaitlin and I always walk like this.  Like I said, she is into the whole appearance thing and likes showing off that she is taken to the other guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs strange as it is to hold another guy\u2019s hand, it somehow feels reassuring that every guy isn\u2019t going to walk up and hit on you while walking across the bar.  Tyler guides you to his regular table with his guy friends all eagerly awaiting the game.  They all give you a smile and say hello like they know you.  You can\u2019t help but notice them staring at your breasts in the mini-dress while you adjust into the seat.  After some quick small talk, the game is about to begin. You are relieved that none of Tyler\u2019s friends seemed to notice you were an impostor so far.  You don\u2019t want to leave once the game starts so you decide to use the bathroom first.  You stand up and announce to nobody in particular, \u201cI\u2019m going to hit the ladies room before it starts.\u201d  You lean in close to whisper in Tyler\u2019s ear, \u201cI wonder if there are couches in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler smirks and notices a few of his friends are watching.  He quickly grabs your cheek and turns so you are face-to-face.  You are amazed as he puckers up and gives you a kiss.  Knowing there is a crowd, you have no choice but to kiss back.  Tyler can tell by your wide eyes that you weren\u2019t expecting a kiss. When none of his friends are looking, he whispers in your ear, \u201cTell me you will miss me while you are gone.  Call me lover-boy.   That\u2019s what Caitlin always says when she uses the ladies room.  I know it\u2019s creepy, but we don\u2019t want anybody to get suspicious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull away from the kiss still shocked that you kissed another guy.  But for some reason, it didn\u2019t gross you out like you\u2019d thought.  It had to be something to do with having female hormones now.  You wanted to do your best to look like the real Caitlin and followed Tyler\u2019s suggestion.  You even overacted a bit and blew him another kiss while walking away.  You could hear the guys around the table all groaning and giving Tyler crap for having such an affectionate and needy girlfriend.  You walked away smiling knowing that none of them had any idea you were really a man.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sitting down to pee, you stood at the sink washing your hands.  Another woman was adjusting her hair and putting on makeup. You felt like a spy inside the walls of a woman\u2019s bathroom.  You gave her a smile and reached into Caitlin\u2019s purse.  You glanced down to see what things were inside.  You pushed aside a tampon with a hopeful wish that you wouldn\u2019t be in Caitlin\u2019s body long enough to figure out how to use one.  You found a tube of lipstick and applied a light layer.  You made a kiss face in the mirror giggling to yourself.  You knew over the course of the game that you\u2019d probably need to use the ladies room again. That would mean another passionate goodbye kiss when you left Tyler.  You liked how the deep red lipstick looked on Caitlin and figured it was a nice gesture to primp up for the next kiss.  Now that you would be ready for it, you\u2019d know what to expect.  You were glad Tyler agreed to keep your true identity a secret.  This meant you\u2019d have to do little things like this like goodbye kisses to pull off being his girlfriend for the night.   You fluffed your hair, adjusted your bra, tugged down on your mini-dress and headed back to meet the guys.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning, you took a taxi back to Caitlin\u2019s apartment and rushed in the door.  After last night\u2019s game that went into overtime, you decided to crash at Tyler\u2019s place because it was close to the sports bar.  Your hair was disheveled as you met Brittney in the living room.  Brittney cracked a smile seeing your attire, \u201cWow!  Your first night as a girl and you slept in Tyler\u2019s bed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, \u201cYes I slept in his bed.  But It\u2019s not what you think!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittney giggled, \u201cYou came home wearing his clothes and you expect me to believe nothing happened?  Give me some details girlfriend!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll I had was that mini-dress you made we wear last night.  Tyler just borrowed me some comfortable clothes.  I slept in his bed and he slept on the couch.  Nothing happened.  My interview is in less than an hour!  Can you make me look pretty again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittney nodded, \u201cOf course.  That\u2019s what roommates are for!  We already chose the business skirt-suit that you will be wearing.  We just need to freshen up your hair and makeup!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were relieved that Brittney was so helpful.  You weren\u2019t sure what you\u2019d do without her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nAfter work, you confidently strolled into the apartment, \u201cI got the job!  I\u2019m going to train the rest of the week in Caitlin\u2019s body and then body-port home.  They gave me 3 days to pack up and move my stuff here! I owe it all to you Brittney!  Thanks for helping me look presentable today for my big day!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittney came up celebrating and gave you a big hug as your breasts mashed together.  You then looked at your watch and explained, \u201cThe game starts in 30 minutes.  I\u2019m going to meet Tyler at the sports bar again.  I texted him like 20 times today but he didn\u2019t reply.  I\u2019m sure he is with all his friends down there.  I can\u2019t wait to celebrate my new job and watch the game with the guys!\u201d  You strip down to your bra and panties and beg your temporary roommate, \u201cWhat should I wear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittney laughed, \u201cI\u2019m surprised you are going back there!  Didn\u2019t all of Tyler\u2019s friends tease you all night once they found out you were a man in a woman\u2019s body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell her, \u201cNo.  They didn\u2019t say a word.  That\u2019s because Tyler and I kept it a secret that Caitlin body-ported this week.  I didn\u2019t want to deal with the snide remarks and jokes all night. As far as anybody knew, I was really his girlfriend.  Is there something else besides a tiny mini-dress I can wear?  I was cold last night in the bar and always had to keep my legs crossed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney smiled, \u201cOf course.  I\u2019ll find another type of outfit that makes Caitlin look cute.  Since you are still pulling off being Tyler\u2019s girlfriend, we better choose something to keep up your image!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes later, you were wearing the tightest pair of pants you\u2019d ever managed to wiggle in.  It form fitted around Caitlin\u2019s hips and ass.  You were surprised that a camel-toe wasn\u2019t showing in front by how tight it was.  The sparkly top Brittney had you wear matched perfectly and rose up above your midriff.  You put both hands on your ass to feel the pants, \u201cWow.  These pants feel like they are riding up my butt crack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittney giggled, \u201cI know wearing girl-pants is new to you. They are supposed to be that tight. That\u2019s your thong that you can feel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn back and forth in the mirror admiring Brittney\u2019s outfit selection for your body.  If you were a man, you\u2019d certainly check out Caitlin\u2019s ass in these pants.  You grabbed your purse and thanked her again for helping you look cute for a night out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you arrived to the sports bar, you saw Tyler standing near his regular table with some friends.  You looked closer and realized he was talking with another woman and seemed to be flirting.  As you approached, Tyler quickly said something to the woman and she walked away.  You smiled big and said, \u201cThere you are!  I text you like a thousand times today!  I got the job!  I\u2019ll be moving here next week once I\u2019m back to my normal male body.  Can you believe it? I\u2019m here to celebrate and watch the game!  Let\u2019s get a drink!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler glared at you, \u201cWhat are you doing here?  You just blew my chance at hooking up with that chick!  Now that my \u2018girlfriend\u2019 is here, I can\u2019t cheat on her with somebody else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t realize what you\u2019d just done.  You felt bad, \u201cOops.  Sorry dude.  She looked like a great piece of ass.  I can go talk to you for her if you want.  Maybe coming from another girl, I can convince her to talk to you again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler rolled his eyes, \u201cYou are in my girlfriend\u2019s body.  You cant be my wing-man and help me pick up chicks.  You know what it\u2019s like to be a guy.  All I want to do is get laid.  It was apparent last night after I brought you back to my place that you aren\u2019t into that sort of thing.  I assumed guys that body-ported into female bodies were eager to test out arousal of the opposite sex.  But that obviously didn\u2019t happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are offended, \u201cHey!  I didn\u2019t chose to end up in your girlfriend\u2019s body!  I requested a male body for my big interview.  But it was last minute booking and this is what I ended up with.  I didn\u2019t want to walk around with tits and a pussy all week!  I just came here again to have some fun with a familiar face and watch the game!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shrugged his shoulders, \u201cFine.  Let\u2019s sit down and watch the game.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, you joined Tyler\u2019s guy friends at his normal table.  You saw how frustrated Tyler was.  You hadn\u2019t meant to mess up his newest conquest tonight.  You also realized that last night must have been confusing to him.  You were drunk and agreed to go home with him.  You ended up sleeping alone in his bed.  If you were a guy, you would have assumed you\u2019d get some action too.  You figured it would be a nice gesture to cheer him up.  You excused yourself and went into the ladies room.  As you left, you did what Tyler told you yesterday and leaned in for a kiss like Caitlin always did, \u201cI\u2019ll miss you Lover-Boy!\u201d  You locked lips like you\u2019d done a few times yesterday when heading off to the ladies room. You even slipped in a little tongue to make Tyler feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the ladies room, you got to business.  You peeled off the skin tight pants and thong and grabbed Caitlin\u2019s cell phone.  You remembered telling Tyler about trimming his girlfriend\u2019s bush with a new style.  You figured a selfie of what he could expect when she body-ported home would be appreciated.  You had to take about 10 selfies before you got the perfect view of Caitlin\u2019s landing strip and pussy.  You took a moment to examine the pic and couldn\u2019t believe that equipment was currently in-between your legs.  You sent the pic to Tyler with a bunch of smiley face emojis.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then strolled out back to Tyler\u2019s table.  Tyler had read the text and was smiling, \u201cThat was unexpected!  You look sexy as hell down there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a flirtatious smile back, \u201cThanks. I know it\u2019s just a pic, but you will love the real thing once Caitlin body-ports back to normal.  I figured a preview would be nice.  Sorry about messing up things with that other girl earlier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler put his arm around you and pulled you in close.  He leaned in for another kiss.  You were taken by surprise and knew his friends were watching.  You had no option but to kiss back.  It lasted much longer than your normal \u2018goodbye\u2019 kisses that you\u2019d done before.  You started to feel your face flush and your body started to tingle.  As your tongues twirled around, you felt a wetness starting to form in your crotch.  You still had your eyes closed as Tyler pulled away.  You let out a satisfying humming sound as you opened your eyes with a nervous smile.  Tyler winked, \u201cI know you are really a guy, but aren\u2019t you the least bit curious?  You are inside the body of a beautiful woman.  Don\u2019t you want to find out what multiple orgasms feel like?  I\u2019m assuming by the pussy pic you sent me that you are ready to experiment.\u201d  Tyler then runs his hand up your thigh slowly.  You hadn\u2019t noticed how slick Tyler was.  His hand was now rubbing the outside of your pants directly over your crotch.  You felt your pussy getting even wetter.  Tyler\u2019s hand was hidden under the table so nobody else could see.  You figured Tyler missed touching his girlfriend\u2019s intimate parts and let him continue.  You still felt bad for screwing up his possible new fling earlier.  It was the least you could to do for a new friend to let him cop a feel.  You admitted to yourself that it did feel nice to be aroused.  Getting wet was similar to having an erection but it kept feeling better.  You pretended to watch the game while Tyler continued to fool around under the table.  You knew he missed his girlfriend.  You felt like a good friend letting Tyler caress Caitlin\u2019s body.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You woke up the next morning to the sound of Tyler\u2019s snoring. You carefully sat up on the bed trying to avoid waking him. A smile blossomed on your lips at the night\u2019s events after you and Tyler left the bar. It had been so hard to keep a straight face while Tyler discretely caressed and toyed with your borrowed body. You did suspect that his friends might have caught on to what was going on, but you also knew how guys seemed to get tunnel vision when a game was on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes at yourself, maybe you\u2019d been a girl for too long already; at least it would be over very soon. At that thought a swirl of emotions roiled up in your stomach. You were looking forward to returning to your body and your life. The job was yours and there was a new chapter of our life ahead. At the same time though you had to admit that your time in Caitlin\u2019s body had been much better than you had expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeat spread through your young, female body thinking of how right Tyler had been about multiple orgasms. As a man you were used to a very concentrated and explosive event and then a sense of finality. As Caitlin the experience was very different, the excitement wasn\u2019t just where you expected, but there was tightness and heat in your chest, a tingling from your fingers and toes, it was like electricity coursing through your whole body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you got to Tyler\u2019s place after the bar it was like a dam had broken, all the pent up wants and desires since landing in Caitlin\u2019s body had come pouring out. There was a broken shelf somewhere as testament to your shared passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been cross when you first found out you\u2019d be in Caitlin\u2019s body during your trip, but if anything, the previous night had shown you that you should have indulged in your body\u2019s desires sooner. You look over at Tyler and find him still deep asleep. You shake your head and roll your eyes. It was almost strange to think that when you woke up the next morning it be in a body more like his instead of the one you\u2019d woken up in every morning for the past few days. At that thought you slowly got out of bed and padded your way out of the bedroom and toward the living room. Seeing the front door brought back a memory from last night. The door was barely closed when you\u2019d  jumped and wrapped your legs around Tyler\u2019s hips, feeling his length strain his pants and push against your body. The memory sent a tingle through your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScanning the room it took you a moment to locate your purse. It had somehow found your it\u2019s way under the living room table. You fished your phone out of your purse and were about to sit on the couch when you felt a chill. Looking around you found Tyler\u2019s jacket close by and wrapped yourself in it. It was hilarious how oversized it was on Caitlin\u2019s body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down you unlocked the phone and quickly thumbed through several social media notifications. There was also a message from your roommate demanding details before you left Caitlin\u2019s body. You rolled your eyes and laughed at yourself. Brittney had introduced you to the world of womanhood and you were going to miss her a lot more than you\u2019d have thought at the start of the exchange. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to type out a reply for Brittney when a call came in. it was \u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyler walked out in his boxer shorts. You were still in disbelief about the news you just heard. Your original body had been killed in a car crash. That meant you'd never return to it. Tyler's 6 pack abs took you off guard as you looked up. The events of last night were still fresh in your mind. You recalled how you wrapped your legs around him while he introduced you to the joys of multiple orgasms. He sat down next to you on the couch and put his hands on your chin with a alluring smile. You were in a trance as he guided your lips into position. You closed your eyes and felt warm all over as you gave each other a long good morning kiss. You would have kept going but Tyler broke it off. He pulled away with a smile, \"Last night was amazing. I hope this means we can still be friends once you body port home and move here for your new job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, \"I'm not sure that's going to be possible...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler reached over and got the stray hairs out of your face. You enjoyed the feeling of his touch on your forehead, \"There's no need to feel embarrassed about what we did last night. I know you are really a guy. I'm familiar with what happens during a body port when you're suddenly in somebody else's body and have to deal with new hormones. There's nothing you can do to fight the personality and characteristics that come with inhabiting another person's body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to lean in for another one of Tyler's famous kisses but restrained yourself.  You told him, \"I'm not mad about last night. I enjoyed every second of it. I just wish I hadn't been so uptight about experimenting. I should have let loose much earlier had I known chick orgasms were so intense.\" You were about to tell Tyler about the car crash and what happened to your normal body when something he said was confusing, \"Hold on. You've body ported before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler's face turned red, \"Yea. I've never told anybody before because it's a bit embarrassing. It was an emergency for my grandfather's funeral. I couldn't afford a body port like you and Caitlin did where you swap places. I had to travel coach. It's much cheaper but you end up in the first available body for the duration of your trip. It was a low travel time of the year and there weren't many options after booking a last second trip 5 day trip starting on a Wednesday night. I ended up landing inside the body of a 19 month old little girl named Annabelle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cracked a grin, \"OMG. That's hilarious. I can't believe you were stuck as a toddler for five days! Were you still in diapers?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler glared, \"What do you think? Annabelle wasn't even two years old yet. I could barely walk on her wobbly legs more less control her bladder. Of course I was in diapers still. I was supposed to help carry the casket during the funeral but that obviously didn't end up happening.\" Tyler grabbed a family photo taken at his grandfather's funeral. He pointed out most of his relatives who were in their normal bodies. The majority of his family still lived close by and didn't have to body port to the event. He pointed to a woman in her 40's explaining, \"That's my Mom holding me for the picture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cooed at how cute Tyler looked as Annabelle, \"Awww. That dress you wore was totally adorable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler rolled his eyes, \"Thanks I guess. I borrowed it from my niece Christie. She's my oldest sister's daughter and was the same age as Annabelle. I ended up staying at her house the entire time since she had all the clothes and supplies for a girl my size. It was convenient so I wore Christie's outfits and slept in her bedroom. My sister set up another crib for me next to Christie so she could easily breastfeed us both before bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled, \"Holy shit. You had to breastfeed off your sister's tits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was basically still a baby. Babies need milk. My sister was the only one I knew who was lactating. I was lucky she hooked me up with the nourishment while I was stuck as Annabelle. By the way, I didn't tell you this so you could make fun of me. I just wanted to let you know that I understand what you are going through. After spending almost a week as a little girl, I couldn't fight the urges that came with Annabelle's body. I loved carrying around teddy bears and playing with dolls. I got into playing dress-up and having tea parties. It wasn't my fault. Certain traits and personalities hit during body ports. My brothers will never let me forget about it and joke every time I visit now. But they don't understand. None of them have ever body ported before. I told you this to let you know I can relate to you. Don't feel bad for letting loose and enjoying Caitlin's female body. Last night we had passionate sex as a man and a woman. I hope you don't feel ashamed once you are back to being a guy. I can't wait to have a beer with you and re-introduce you to all my friends at the sports bar once you move here for your new job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember about the phone call and explain, \"That's the problem I was trying to tell you about. I can't ever return to my normal male body. It's dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler's reaction wasn't exactly compassionate, \"Thank goodness. That means the real Caitlin is never coming back!  I was starting to get freaked out knowing that crazy bitch was going to be back in her body soon. I was dreading the constant stalking, phone calls and texts. That's a relief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glared, \"Ahem. My male body is dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler apologized, \"Oh yea. That totally sucks. What are you going to do? Is there another body the company is going to give you? I hope whoever ends up with Caitlin's body is as cool as you have been. I hope it's not another crazy chick that takes over her life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cross your arms, \"I don't know what I'm going to do. A lawyer is going to meet me at the body port company soon to discuss my options.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler suggested, \"Do you think there's any way they'll let you keep Caitlin's body? You'd be the perfect girlfriend. Not only are you a great piece of ass, you're really a guy and understand how us men think. You wouldn't care that I cheat on you all the time with lots of other booty calls. You love sports and act cool around all my friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push Tyler away giving him evil eyes, \"Do you WANT me to turn into a crazy chick? You better stop talking or I'm going to lose it. My guy body is dead and I have no idea what's happening! I might be stuck in Caitlin's body for awhile until I figure out what my options are. In the meantime, I have to go to work at my new job and live as a woman. Having boobs for a week has been interesting, but I never considered wearing skirts forever. I'm on the edge of a nervous breakdown and all you care about is how much better your life got after mine was shattered!.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler laughed, \"Wow buddy. You are really starting to sound like the real Caitlin. I'd suggest you don't dig too deep into her personality and start acting like a crazy chick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glared being accused of acting like the real Caitlin. Tyler had plenty of experience dealing with Caitlin's craziness. He smiled with his arms open for a hug, \"Come here sweetie. I'm sorry for acting like a jerk. It was my fault. I should have never said those mean things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly felt better during the embrace. You hug back and feel warm and safe in Tyler's arms. You get weak in the knees as you look up and close your eyes. After a long passionate kiss, you pull away smiling, \"That was slick. You know exactly how to calm my body down. I'm sorry about slipping into crazy girlfriend mode back there. I'll make it up to you. You've been really sweet helping me deal with being a woman for the past week. I owe you big time for all your understanding.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler winked, \"I've dealt with your body for years and know how to handle it's crazy mind. There is one thing that could make up for your bitchy attitude.\" Tyler sat down and freed his penis out of his boxers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirked while getting on your knees. You Caitlin brain knew thanking Tyler with a blow job was a great way to express your gratitude. You opened your mouth and engulfed his manhood. The body port company could wait. For now, you had to thank your boyfriend for being so cool.  As you slurped on his penis, you looked up and saw how much Tyler was enjoying having his dick sucked.  Between deep throats, you realized he tricked you into giving him a blow job.  You had Caitlin's body and emotions now and Tyler was taking advantage.  Your male brain couldn't help but laugh at how slick he was.  You were jealous of his ability to trick Caitlin into doing anything he wanted.  You decided to continue knowing the real crazy Caitlin would never end a blow job early.  You had no idea how much longer you'd be stuck in her body.  At least you had a cool boyfriend that understood what you were going through.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mincing back to the table, you notice several pairs of eyes flashing upon you. Tugging at your miniskirt once again, you blush and take a seat next to Tyler, setting your purse on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The lady in red returns,\" Tyler pecks your cheek, slipping his arm around your waist and complimenting your freshly applied lipstick. He moves his hand lower and pulls you onto his thigh. You're sitting dangerously close to his crotch now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What gives, <i>loverboy</i>?\" You scamper down and shoot him a glare. You cross your legs femininely and smooth out your dress, silently willing this outfit to cover up more of your exposed flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just giving you the best seat in the house, babe!\" He grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't had enough drinks tonight to get away with that line... <i>yet</i>.\" Chides one of Tyler's friends. He sits across from you and has wavy blond locks and a beard. \"What is that pisswater you're guzzling down, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's pacing himself, obviously.\" Interjects another friend, who looks really bulky with a tight fitting t-shirt. \"He'll have plenty of reasons to keep drinking as we watch his favourite team get thrashed tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piss off!\" Tyler laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great comeback, genius,\" The bulky guy smirks, crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the boys laugh and trade insults, you sip your Cosmopolitan and pretend to be browsing Caitlin's phone. You would never order such a girly drink, but the cocktail goes down surprisingly smoothly and leaves you feeling warm and fuzzy. Tyler mentioned that Caitlin loves vodka mixers, and since you now had her taste buds it makes sense for you to enjoy them as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what brings you out with the guys tonight?\" Asks another one of Tyler's friends, taking advantage of a momentary lull in the conversation to change the subject. This guy is tall, dark, and handsome, but he's sitting at the far end of the table. \"You never join us for sports night... not that we're complaining, right guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys raise their glasses and mumble in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp, almost spitting out your drink, and reply, \"Oh, I just thought I'd mix things up a little. Y'know, get to know you boys better while scoring a few drinks off my boyfriend here,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys chuckle. You catch Blondie sneaking a glance at your cleavage. You continue, \"Also, Tyler really wanted to watch this match tonight. So... what teams are playing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, it's a game, not a match.\" Tyler corrects you. \"This is the Celtics against the Mavericks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, basketball.\" You study the large, flat screen TV monitor suspended from a wall. You know a lot about basketball, having played it for many years, so pretending like you're clueless seems like a fun challenge. You place a finger to your lips innocently. \"Um, so why are they not trying to stop that guy from shooting the ball? Look, they're all standing around waiting for him to do something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's called a free throw.\" Explains Tyler. \"Somebody fouled him when he tried to make a shot. Now he's given another chance unimpeded by the other team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes and scoff. \"Sounds boring! Glad there's only like four minutes left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulky smiles apologetically, \"Actually, that's four minutes left in this quarter. We're only in the first quarter now. There's three more after this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't make any sense.\" You pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It makes perfect sense, just watch the game baby,\" Tyler replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever...\" You take out Caitlin's phone and tap your nails on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So which team are you cheering for tonight?\" Asks Tall-Dark-and-Handsome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" You drawl in a sing-song voice, \"I guess I'll go with the blue team. Their clothing looks a lot nicer than the green team anyways.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulky extends his hand out for a high-five. Evidently he was a Mavericks fan too. \"That's a girl! You see, Tyler, Caitlin may not know much about basketball, but she knows a winning team when she sees one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler grumbles, and you pat him on the leg underneath the table. His face softens and he leans in for another kiss. Coming up for air, he replies, \"My Celtics can lose every game this season but I'll be a winner as long as I have you, Caitlin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys groan, one of them tossing a sugar packet at Tyler. His line was incredibly corny but you can't help but melt a little into his arms. You're loving all this attention right now, not to mention the third (or fourth?) cocktail at this point. Being able to taste each one just a little bit less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick at some appetizers at the table, not bothering to order a full entree as you aren't feeling that hungry. Perhaps another part of you \u2014 the Caitlin part \u2014 wants to limit herself from eating this fatty, salty sports bar food. You don't want to return her body fat and bloated, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this leads to those Cosmos hitting harder and, as time drags on, you've lost count of the number of fruity, girly cocktails you've downed. Finally, Tyler and his buddies have finished their meals; the basketball game is over but you've spent the past several minutes browsing Caitlin's phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone pays their own tabs, except for Tyler who pays for both you and himself. He helps you up, as you wobble unsteadily on Brittney's heels and sling Caitlin's purse strap over your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels pretty hot in here...\" You complain, fanning your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she'd had too much to drink,\" quietly comments Blondie, but you overhear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have <i>not</i>!\" You stamp your foot petulantly, a bit louder than intended. Then, to Tyler, \"Wait up for me loverboy. I need to use the little girls' room before we leave.\" You lean up as he places his hand on your cheek. This kiss lasts for a good five seconds. You can taste the alcohol in his breath... or maybe that's your own breath?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll wait up for you babe. It is kind of warm in this bar, isn't it fellas?\" Tyler asks, eliciting a few nods from the guys. \"Why don't we go for a stroll on the boardwalk next to the beach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but it's bound to be full of tourists this time of year.\" Remarks Bulky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just makes it easier to cast my line into the waters... if you know what I mean!\" Chortles Blondie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And <i>that's</i> why you'll always be single,\" Dryly retorts Tall-Dark-and-Handsome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave them for a moment to go back to the ladies' room. Between the drinks and Brittney's heels, you're afraid to trip over and fall on your ass. After doing your business, you inspect your outfit and hair in the mirror once again, reapplying the lipstick and smooching your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're so happy that Brittney convinced you to go out and have fun with the guys! Even if they treat you like a girl, it's nice to pal around with people who remind you of your own friends back at home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, you wonder what the real Caitlin is up to. What she's doing this evening... who she's spending that evening with... whether she's doing anything with your own girlfriend that you wouldn't do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder as the thought of Caitlin possessing your own dick and balls, along with the rest of your body and life, crosses your mind. There's nothing you can do about it, so you hope she's enjoying them responsibly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Brittney's heels look nice, and they keep you from being dwarfed by everyone, but they aren't designed for long walks on the beach... literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, you've come to accept the 'male gaze' as a necessary evil that comes with wearing such a flashy, low-cut dress. Not that you blame them, as you too would stare at the blonde-haired vixen wiggling her hips and bouncing her ass under the moonlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been holding hands with Tyler all this time, but eventually the guys walk ahead immersed in some heated sports debate. One of the guys falls behind to walk alongside you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's Tall-Dark-and-Handsome, whose name you gathered by now is Josh. Caitlin's longtime friend. You look up at him and nod politely. He matches your stride, and his commanding presence seems to part the crowded tourists like a boat gliding through water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, can I talk to you about something important?\" He asks, after a few minutes of small talk and mild pleasantries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, what's up Josh?\" You chirp, tearing your eyes off of a woman's boobs which are nearly popping out of her bikini top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh puts his hands in his pockets. \"I've been debating whether to tell you this... and if so, exactly how to break it to you...\" He trails off, then chuckles nervously. \"This isn't the easiest thing to tell someone... I hope you can understand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou interrupt his ramblings. \"Oh my God! You're not confessing to me, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh pales. \"What? No! We've had <i>that</i> talk before, Caitlin. I wouldn't want to ruin our friendship like that... or my friendship with Tyler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" You raise your eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snaps his fingers. \"Actually, that reminds me of something else I wanted to ask you. You're roommates with Brittney, right? Has she... has she ever... you know, said anything about me before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try not to burst out laughing. Is Josh crushing on Caitlin's roommate? Do they really both like each other, yet neither have come out and admitted it? And here you are, placed as Cupid's messenger between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like Brittney?\" You ask him to make sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I mean... Of course I like her.\" He stammers, rubbing the back of his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm asking if you <i>like</i> like her.\" You persist coquettishly. \"A girl's got a right to know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh exhales. \"Okay, I <i>like</i> like her. I've thought about her ever since you introduced us at Tyler's birthday bash. You know, that time when we all went to that escape room and Brittney filled in as a plus-one because Jake said he couldn't make it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I had my suspicions!\" You lie, twisting a lock of hair around your finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, what does she think of me?\" Josh asks earnestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you ask her yourself?\" You tease him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you know her better than any of us!\" He cries. \"I don't want to confess to her and look like an idiot if she rejects me. Please Caitlin, do me a solid will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, just keep your pants on!\" You giggle, then continue. \"Truth be told, she likes you too. Uh-huh, <i>like</i> like. In fact, before I left she wanted me to feel you out concerning your feelings for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Josh's face brightens up. He looks like he could be floating on air. \"What did she say about me, specifically?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That you're tall, dark, and handsome of course.\" You lie, not knowing Brittney's opinion exactly but giving him your own impression through Caitlin's eyes. \"She thinks you're a total hottie! One hundred percent husband material.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing his elated expression, you quickly add, \"But don't take my word for it! Why don't I arrange some place for you two to meet up? Let me be your matchmaker!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would do that for us?\" He asks incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? You both obviously need a wingman. A wing-woman. You know what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's wonderful!\" He exclaims. But his expression quickly turns somber. \"But that's not the only thing I wanted to talk with you about tonight, Caitlin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? Got any more dirty laundry that needs airing?\" You smirk, looking up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a way...\" He replies. \"Just promise me you won't get mad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A girl can't make a promise like that so carelessly!\" You smile coyly. \"Fine then! You can tell me... I promise not to go ballistic or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Josh inhales. \"Because I've been your friend for too long to let Tyler keep going behind your back like this. There's rules about this sort of thing... but I can't keep silent any longer. Caitlin... Tyler's seeing another woman. He's been taking her out on dates and inviting her back to his apartment. I'm so sorry to have to be the one to tell you this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing his pained expression, it's like he expects to be thrown into the sea. But all of the colour drains from his face when he sees you burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-you're not mad?\" Josh stutters. \"Caitlin, he's cheating on you! Tyler has been cheating on you for six months now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course he has!\" You reply. \"He admitted it to me, and I'm totally cool with it. By the way, he told me he's been secretly fucking <i>multiple</i> women behind my back. What a stud, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh comes to a full stop on the boardwalk, causing some tourists to accidentally bump into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-b-but... what the... I thought...you and he, uh...\" He babbles, expecting a completely different reaction from Tyler's possessive, high-maintenance girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? This isn't the 1950's, Josh.\" You shrug Caitlin's shoulders. \"If a man wants to pitch his tent in multiple camps, he should have that right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... if you put it that way!\" His eyes pop back into his head. He must think you're wasted to be saying something like this. \"Hold on a minute. Are you only fine with this because you're hooking up with some other bloke too? Like, is this an open relationship or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" You reply simply. \"Tyler's the only man for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm very happy for you then.\" Josh mutters lamely. \"Since I'm the only one of Tyler's friends who knows, I suppose I won't tell anyone else if you won't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your secret's safe with me.\" You promise. For some reason, everyone seems to be coming to you as their safe keeper of dirty little secrets. You would never trust a girl like Caitlin to keep anyone's secrets. Knowing several things you'd rather not tell your own girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You understood how much Tyler missed caressing his girlfriend.  You only had one more day as Caitlin until your Body Port appointment.  You already landed a job in this city and would return in a few days after packing up your apartment and renting a moving van.  It would take a few days to drive back once you had your normal body.  Your new boss was impressed with your interview and didn't care you were in a woman's body. Ever since body porting had become popular, it was common to borrow somebody else's body for interview purposes.  It was much faster than driving across the country for days.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to last-minute body port planning, you ended up in Caitlin's body for a week.  At first you were upset to be a woman's body for your big interview.  But after living Caitlin's life for the past week, it helped you meet some new friends in the town you'd be moving to.  You couldn't wait to hang out with Tyler once you were a man again.  He was the type of guy that reminded you of all your old friends back home.  You were thankful he didn't spill the beans to all his friends about your true identity.  You knew all the guys would have made fun of you and the jokes would have never ended if they found out you were really a man.  Caitlin's body was interesting to inhabit for a few days.  You got to shower with her sexy roommate a few times.  You learned a new appreciation for how long it took women to get ready for work.  Thanks to Brittney, she helped you get dressed and do your hair everyday.  You were relieved that she picked outfits for you to wear.  You would have never been able to match all the jewelry and heels with the business skirt suits she had you wear.  You were pleased she was so cool about helping out a guy who was stuck in a woman's body for a few days.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few too many cosmopolitans at the bar, Tyler offered for you to crash at his place again.  You were glad he helped steady your buzzed body during the walk home.  Brittney insisted you wear a pair of Caitlin's 3 inch heels with the skinny jeans you wore to the sports bar.  You were glad to wear pants for a change.  Since body porting into Caitlin's body, you mostly had worn business skirts and cocktail dresses during happy hour.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler helped you sit on the edge of his bed and mentioned, \"Thanks for pretending to be my girlfriend tonight.  You made me look like a stud in front of all my friends at the sports bar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hiccuped while smiling, \"No problem buddy.  I'm just glad you didn't tell them I'm really a guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler asked, \"Do you want to borrow some of my clothes to sleep in?  Caitlin always wears my stuff when she stays over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod at the offer, \"Hell yea!  I'll take a pair of boxer shorts and a t-shirt.  I gotta get used to wearing boy clothes again.  I'm body porting tomorrow after work and will finally be back to my normal male body.\"  You raid Tyler's drawers and carry his clothes to the bathroom.  Moments later, you emerge with a pair of his boxer shorts on and one of his sports jerseys.  The jersey is so big it drapes down like a short dress on your petite female frame.  You walk out with a sigh, \"This feels great to wear some guy stuff again.\"  You are holding Caitlin's panties you were wearing moments ago and toss them at Tyler's face, \"Go ahead and sniff them! I know what guys want to do after getting a hold of a freshly worn pair of panties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler appreciated the gesture, \"Thanks!' He smashed them into his face and took a huge whiff, \"Mmm.  Damn your pussy smells amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wiggle Caitlin's butt while passing by, \"No kidding. I've sniffed the panties I've worn every day since I body ported into your girlfriend's body.  I know her scent very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler smirked, \"I had no idea girls sniffed their own panties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed, \"I'm pretty sure REAL girls don't. They grew up with vaginas between their legs and don't appreciate the luxury of catching a whiff of such a sexy body part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler laughed, \"It's so cool to talk with my girlfriend's body like she's one of the guys.  DUDE.  I still can't believe you spent the past week as a chick.  That had to take forever to get used to walking around without a dick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, it didn't take as long as you'd think.  Nobody walks around concentrating about what's in-between their legs all the time.  When I was a guy, I never thought twice about my balls sticking to my inner thigh or my penis dangling around in my boxer shorts.  In fact, having a pussy is actually more comfortable.  There's not any loose parts to worry about getting tangled.  Being able to sit down and cross my legs is relaxing without a cock.  If you think about it, unless you are using your private parts for their natural purpose, you don't ever think about them.  It's really only when I use the ladies room that I'm reminded about having girl parts down there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler poured two shots of vodka and handed you one.  He let out a laugh, \"That has to be a pain in the ass to sit down to pee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slam the shot and slap your butt giggling, 'Not really.  Caitlin's ass is curvy and lots of cushion to sit on.  It's actually a nice break to sit down and relax for a minute during a bathroom break.  Girl's bathrooms are way nicer than than men's rooms. The toilet seats are clean and warm from the last woman who sat on it.  It's not like standing to pee at a urinal and staying silent while pretending to stare at the wall.  The ladies room is more of a social getaway.  That's where you hear all the good gossip. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler slammed another shot of vodka and let out a long burp.  He didn't need to impress his girlfriend knowing it was really a guy inside her body.  Tyler explained, 'Sorry about not answering your texts earlier.  For a few hours I thought you and Caitlin body ported back to normal.  I had flashbacks of dealing with her craziness when my cell phone kept buzzing every 2 minutes. I lined up a few side pieces of ass that I was trying to screw tonight behind her back.  I was freaked out Caitlin was back in her normal body and I'd have to deal with her crazy shit so soon again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou apologize, \"That was my bad dude.  I was excited to tell you I landed the job and would be moving here.  I didn't mean to come across like your obsessed girlfriend always does.  I shouldn't have called so many times and sent so many texts.  I just wanted to watch the game with a friendly face for my last night stuck as a woman.  When you didn't get back to me, I got worried.  I thought your phone was stolen or the number was wrong or something.  I know it sounds crazy, but it made sense at the time.  The body port company warned me about side effects that could happen while living in somebody else's body. For awhile this afternoon I thought you were ignoring me.  It's a good thing I'm body porting out of Caitlin tomorrow.  I think her personality is starting to leak into my brain or something.  The last thing I want to be is some crazy obsessed chick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler took another shot of vodka.  He decided to take advantage of somebody else in his girlfriend's body and winked, \"You know what Caitlin?  There's something I've always wanted to say to you.  You are complete psycho crazy bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed while giving Tyler a high-five, \"That had to feel good.  You'd never be able to say that to the real Caitlin.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler agrees, \"Yep.  You have no idea how clingy and obsessive Caitlin can be. I only let her call me my boyfriend so she stopped stocking me.  I still bang every skirt I can talk out of their panties. <br>\r\n I only let Caitlin think she's my girlfriend so she doesn't go completely crazy.  I gotta say dude, you make a much better Caitlin than she does.  It's been nice having you around instead of dealing with her psycho crazy bitch attitude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took another shot of vodka and could feel how giddy your petite body was starting to get from the alcohol.  You figured you'd do Tyler a favor since he was acting so cool about the situation.  Except for some playful grab-ass in front of the other guys, he hadn't pressured you into doing anything sexual that you didn't want to.  You had to pretend to be his crazy girlfriend and kissed him lots of times while at the sports bar over the past few days so his friends didn't think anything was abnormal.  You played footsie numerous times and traded secret touches under the table.  You figured Tyler deserved to touch his girlfriend's body now and then and didn't slap away his wandering hand when he rubbed the outside of the crotch of your skinny jeans earlier.  You figured he earned it for not blowing your cover.  If his friends found out you were really a guy they would have never let you hear the end of it.  You slammed another shot of vodka and smiled, \"I'll tell you what buddy.  I still feel bad about cock blocking you with that blonde earlier at the bar.  Since you've been so cool with me over the past week while I've been inside your girlfriend's body.......\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The receptionist barely looks up from reading his book, giving a cursory 'Hello', as you sign-in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes only drifting from his book to as high as your bust. It is impressive, looking firm, but well contained and professional in your suit. The luggage is necessary for body-porters. So everyone can select the right outfit. Alas, you have no preference for how you appear as a woman. This formal, buttoned down look is fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpreading the notes out over the bed, you try to mentally summarise all the facts, and every angle you'll use to win the contract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA piping hot coffee sits on the bedside table, an aid to stimulate your mind and keep you sharp. It's a little disconcerting how quickly you feel full. The first cup being enough to make you want to pee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's an experience, you didn't consider in advance. You think as you return to your notes. Making another cup, you want to redirect your focus back from your distracting body and experience and onto the matter in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching your heel in the thick carpet you stumble. The coffee sloshes everywhere, burning your hand as you fight to keep it from going everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt soaks your suit, ruining it. The heat builds quickly to painful levels, and you don't want to be billed for damaging the body. Quickly, you unbutton the ruined blouse, and business slacks. Thankfully, it hasn't reached your underwear. You stand awkwardly in the hotel room, as a naked woman, in just her underwear. The mirror stops you from forgetting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScowling at the ruined outfit, tossed casually onto the floor, you realise you now have to dress yourself as a professional woman. The pre-selected clothes starting to look like an option you took for granted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngrily, you lift the luggage onto the bed. Your bust shimmies and dances at the sudden vigorous motion, reminding you of what you most want to forget. How attractive that body truly is... She'd done a fantastic job of disguising it's femininity. Though standing in the expensive lingerie you can't pretend to be anything other than a gorgeous woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe contents are mostly unsuitable, with a change of underwear, and a bikini, too. Even just seeing it there, you imagine yourself wearing it. Your lush curves filling it to perfection. A very formal gown is there too. But that doesn't suit either. Selecting a skirt and top, you assemble your professional suit alternative. Naturally, everything fits. It's tailored for this body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/05/e7/96/05e79653f8005986224ff00bc0a6e02a.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/05/e7/96/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you admire it, the thought occurs, \"Does my bum look big in this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look is more secretarial than managerial.

Channeling your last ex-girlfriend who\u2019s been a total airhead you replied, \u201cLike, that was totes not cool, you guys, I felt really bad!\u201d waving your hands in a decidedly feminine manner. The three of you laughed and the girls brought you into a hug like you were all old friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally you wouldn\u2019t have been okay with someone toying with you like that, but you figured the Brandi Boudoir persona you were creating would be too much of an airhead to take anything persona. You kept asking yourself, \u201cWhat would Cindy do?\u201d The two of you had dated for a while, and had a lot of fun together, but you often wondered if there was much more than cotton candy between her ears. Part of you thought you should just walk away from this craziness, especially once you were told to dress in a skimpy swimsuit and parade in front of a bunch of strangers. However, you\u2019d always had issues saying no and you were in so deep already you felt obliged to keep going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, we just wanted to know if you had a good sense of humour. The last girl they sent to join us was such a drag!\u201d Akane explained and Jane nodded, \u201cYou gotta stay in a good mood to do this kind of thing for hours and hours,\u201d Jane motioned towards the rest of the event.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then the one of the executives that had been part of the panel walked over and placed his hand on the small of your back, \u201cGood, I see you girls are getting along,\u201d his hand slipped south towards the top of your butt, but you didn\u2019t say anything. \u201cMiss Boudoir here is the newest member of our team and I want her to feel welcome.\u201d He had a deep, commanding voice and the build of a man who still hit the gym in spite of probably being in his mid-50s. You felt a confusing set of emotions with him standing so close to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, Mr. Galloway!\u201d your fellow models chimed in unison. \u201cGood, I\u2019ll let you girls get to it. Put on your best smiles and maybe we can sell a few these beauties,\u201d Mr. Galloway gestured towards the yacht you were there to promote. As he walked away he gave you a soft pat on your butt and you had to fight to keep from jumping out of the high-heeled sandals you\u2019d been given. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Couple hours until the interview and I'm like this you thought gesturing towards your new very womanly body underneath you. ..Well at least it's enough time to..ugh..fix this you thought as you dragged the woman business skirt past your ankles and fished the annoying black thong out of your rear, throwing it across the room. \"I don't need a lot of things but I definitely don't need you.\" You said pointing a well polished accusatory fingernail at the sad garment in the corner of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing more comfortable, you gave your large rear one last feel before you slipped the skirt on to redirect your attention towards the blouse trapping your new hills. Feeling like a eager school boy, you stripped yourself of the blouse to reveal your soft mounds incased in a frilly black Victoria Secret holster. Flopping your body onto the water bed, you decided perhaps a bite to eat before the interview would be in order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanging up the phone with your order placed, your attention turned back towards the woman's breasts. Fighting back the urge to stop, you unclasped the cups and peered at your borrowed beauties. Pawing a kneeding them, you out a quite moan as you felt the nipples harden underneath your fingers. In intense exploration, you moment was spoiled as you heard a knock on the hotel door.

Feeling a shudder resonant throughout your body you couldn't help but to examine her further. She really was cute, her thin frame accented her C cup breasts wonderfully underneath her gray hotel polo, hanging just long enough to cover her perk rear and supple thighs peaking from her matching black skinny jeans. Watching her walk in-front of you into the entrance of the store, you wasn't sure if you was going thru with this for her or she was somehow using you, whatever the case maybe you shook your head and gladly bounced your behind after her into the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWandering behind Jenny throughout the store, you watched as Jenny gleefully danced round about the store collecting various items. Frilly bras, exotic lingerie all of which she happily threw across her shoulder. Confused you had to speak up, \"What are we doing here, I can't go out wearing all that!\"  \"You will if you want to get fucked!\" Jenny retorted \"I would wear these every where if work at the hotel would let me, and what do you have to lose? Its not like that is your actual body, whats so wrong with showing it off a bit you know?\" Jenny questioned as she pushed her soft body's breasts against yours into the changing room behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n_<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing you up against the wall, your excitement was soon extinguished as Jenny stuffed a pile of expensive lingerie between you and her. \"Come on hurry up, this bitch is getting hot and we don't have long before the clubs open up for the night.\" Jenny said as she gave a quick rub of her crotch and began watching you undress. \"Uh..A little privacy please?\" you muttered as you stripped yourself of your bodies blouse and slacks leaving you in your underwear. \"Why? Were both bombshells, and girls do this all the time it'll be strange if I left you by yourself.\" Jenny said stopping her rub down of her baby-maker just long enough to give you a quick wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling your face growing flush it was obviously you had a heavy crush on this girl and if going thru with this makes her happy then, well it was good enough for you. Pushing all doubts of Jenny's motives out of your mind you happily took off your bodies fairly plain bra and looked down towards your crotch having forgotten you walked out of the hotel without panties. Mildly embarrassed as you was completely naked, you wasted no time into slipping into one of the many various lingerie Jenny provided for you. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/zwtj7tl\" target=\"_blank\">http://tinyurl.com/zwtj7tl</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFastening the final straps across your ass you stood in-front of Jenny, already in her own outfit. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/gpqs44k\" target=\"_blank\">http://tinyurl.com/gpqs44k</a> Shocked to how quick she put that on without you noticing, you figured she must be far more experienced in women's clothing than you. \"Well, don't we look sexy.\" Jenny said as you both looked into the mirror at your reflections. \"Although I'm a bit jealous of this..\" Jenny said slapping your right ass cheek causing you to yelp as your butt collided with itself. If you're ready we can get out of here, Jenny said as she motioned towards the stall exit, with you close in tow attempting to shield you're arousal from Jenny touching you for the first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The generally accepted standard was you should look reasonably smart in the body you had, and not worry too much about it.<br>\r\nAlthough you felt rather awkward rifling through an eight-year old's underwear, you soon pick out a couple of dresses that might be suitable and head into the bathroom to try them on. However, before you strip off you have a quick look at yourself in the mirror. Everything looks strange from this angle, and seeing a chubby, blonde haired kid squint back out you from the mirror instead of you normal body makes you feel rather ill. You shake your head, still trying to get to grips with the whole idea, and begin changing. <br>\r\nDisrobing down to your underwear, you put the first dress on. However, you soon realize it's far too short to be appropriate for a business meeting. With a sigh, you fling it away and grab the other, longer garment, pulling it over your head and then realizing it has a zip up the back. Now thoroughly missing your suit, you head through to the next room to find Joshua Jones. <br>\r\n\"Hey, uh, Mr Jones?\" You ask slightly uncertainly.<br>\r\n\"Call me Joshua.\" He said.<br>\r\n\"Okay. Then, ah, call me Jonathan.\" You say.<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say, Jonathan. What did you need?\"<br>\r\n\"Could you help me with this dress?\" You say, trying not to blush. This whole situation is just... unnatural. Two grown men occupying the bodies of a young girl and her mother, so one can go to an interview without travelling.<br>\r\nYou turn around, and Joshua starts zipping up the back of the dress. It's tight, very tight, but you suck your newly rounded belly in as best you can and eventually he managed to get it fastened. Breathing lightly in the constricting outfit, you do your best to shift it around and get comfortable. Meanwhile, Joshua is massaging his hands.<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" You ask.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah.\" He says. \"That zipper was a b-\" He cuts off the swearword suddenly, then remembers you aren't actually a little girl. \"Sorry, after a while, you lose track of who's in who's body. I once had a family where the six year old was in the adults body, and vice versa. I got in some trouble by swearing in front of their kid.\"<br>\r\nWe both laughed, but that made me think.<br>\r\n\"So you must be in other people's bodies a lot. How often do you get back to your own?\"<br>\r\nHe looks rather wistful.<br>\r\n\"Only on holidays.\" He replies. \"I technically live in Italy, but they rent out my body to tourists. Even when I do go back, nowadays it feels more like just another stranger's body.\"<br>\r\n\"That sounds awful.\" I grimace.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well. You get used to it. When's your interview, anyway. If you have some spare time you could have a look around town.\"<br>\r\nYou go to check your watch, but are confronted by nothing but bare, pale skin. Instead you glance up at the expensive-looking grandfather clock in the corner.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It came as a complete surprise that, upon using the bodyport, you would be transferred into the body of a woman. Companies typically made it a policy to avoid gender swaps, but they never guarantee against them. Occasionally you would hear about a comedic circumstance about someone else's gender swap in the news. It was the exception to the rule, a small-probability event. To have this happen to you, a first-time \"flyer\", was very unlikely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed again and tried to ignore the alien sensations coming from your new body. The way the dress clung around the waist and hips. The way it billowed out at the knees and left your slender legs feeling exposed as you walked out of the bodyport, trying to maintain balance on heels without breaking an ankle or falling over. The subtle bounce of the woman's ample breasts despite being restrained by a bra. The wind blowing your hair in front of your eyes and tickling your neck and shoulders. The difference in height despite accounting for the 3-inch heels. The casual turn of the heads of men in your direction, drinking in the beauty that this body seemed to radiate. You would do the same if you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you waited in line in the garage of the car rental area, you observed the behavior of other people. How many were new arrivals at the bodyport? How many were returning home with their original bodies? It was difficult to tell except for a few obvious signs, such as a line of people waiting for car rental, or a family hugging a loved one about to enter a terminal. The woman whose body you temporarily owned wore a wedding ring. Silver engraving with a small diamond affixed to the top. She was... you are... married to a man?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile waiting in line, you realized the need to check the woman's name. So, sifting through her small corduroy handbag (it having been slung around your shoulder this whole time), you found a driver's license and temporal ID to match. Violetta Marinaccio, age 34, 5 feet 2 inches, 115 pounds, brown hair, green eyes. Female. This will be you for the next two weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Your name and ID, please.\" A voice broke through your reverie. You found yourself at the counter, a clerk shuffling papers on the other side of the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Violetta Marinaccio.\" You replied slowly, hearing a mellifluous soprano voice flow out of your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk chuckled, taking the identification cards and jotting down notes on paper. \"Miss, that was a decent attempt,\" He explained. \"But remember, for Italian surnames like that, the stress goes on the second 'a', before the double 'c'. Not after. MarinAccio, not MarinaccIO.\"<br>\r\nSighing again, you wobbled out to the rental car, listening to your heels click against the pavement. You sat down, swung your legs in (making sure to adjust your dress from ruffling upward), and started the engine. Deciding it would be more comfortable to drive without heels, you kicked them off, discovering that the woman's nails, on her hands as well as her feet, were painted bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive was uneventful and had minimal traffic. Thanks to mapping out Violetta's home address before entering the bodyport earlier that day, you knew where to go. What you hadn't anticipated was the height differential, as you really had to sit up straight to see around the car while driving. But soon enough you pulled into the driveway of a modest, single-story house with a grassy front yard and green hedges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom looking though Violetta's handbag, you knew that she possessed a house key, garage door opener and cell phone, among small personal hygiene items like lip gloss, hair clips, perfume, and a tampon. Yet an important question remained: Is her husband at home right now? Will you have to introduce yourself to a Mr. Marinaccio right now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You minced up to the front door and rang the doorbell. No answer. Although you had a house key, and were in a situation where nobody in the neighborhood would suspect otherwise, you felt like an impostor about to break into a random house. In a way, however, you were less of an impostor than the real Violetta would be in this moment. After all, you had her body, her credit cards (cross linked to your bank account), her voice, her husband, and her life. You debated whether or not to call \"Jonathan Rivers\" to make sure 'he' got home from the bodyport safely, or to give instructions on how to live that life for the next two weeks. But considering that nobody had called you since the transfer, perhaps it wasn't really necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened the door and strutted inside the house. Thankfully nobody was inside and no cars were in the garage. You took time to examine the woman's life and, hopefully, find some less feminine clothing to wear when you met up with your high school friends later that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe living room was adorned with a television, pictures of friends and family, furniture and stationery, and a glass tabletop. The pictures drew your attention first. In one, a man and woman were posing together in a wedding photo. The man had jet black hair, rugged features, and wore a tuxedo. The woman, smiling brightly, wore a stately wedding gown with frilled sleeves. Her eyebrows were waxed and face delicately outlined with makeup and blush. In another photo, that same woman was cradling a baby in her arms, with both faces looking toward the camera. The photo appeared relatively recent. The baby had a wisp of blonde hair. You found it interesting that, not too long ago, the body you were currently wearing had conceived, became pregnant with, and bore the baby in that picture. Where was it now? With a babysitter, perhaps?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther photos were of the man or woman's parents and friends. You got the impression that the happy couple had an involved social life despite entering parenthood. In the kitchen, a scribbled crayon drawing was on the refrigerator. In pen, and in much neater writing, it read \"<i>Emilia -- 3 anni</i>.\" Dishes were in the washer and appeared dirty, so out of politeness you added solution and ran the washer. Tomatoes, bread, and wine rested on a granite countertop next to the glass table. You noticed a framed picture of a teddy bear holding the moon in a starlit sky; below it was an embroidered caption in Italian: \"<i>Non fare il passo piu' lungo della gamba, orsacchiotto!</i>\" Most books, papers, letters, and cards you found in the house were written in Italian and, therefore, indecipherable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few questions burned through your mind. Did this family recently immigrate from Italy, or have they lived here for a while? How well does this family speak English? Can Violetta speak English well? If she can't, how will that impact my life she is borrowing? What if I encounter her husband or daughter and cannot communicate with them? It was more annoying than shocking to discover that you had been transferred into a life with such a different background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the master bedroom where Violetta and her still-nameless husband slept, you found a walk-in closet and many drawers of clothing. Trying to avoid staring at her body too long, you manage to change out of her dress, underwire, and heels. You put on boyshorts (being the closest to men's briefs that you could find), struggled with getting in the hooks of a 38D bra, and slipped on a short-sleeved blue top and beige capri pants. Trading the height boost for better comfort, you opted for flip flops instead of heels. In addition, you removed the diamond wedding ring and placed it on the nightstand next to the bed. During the unavoidable inspection of your new body, you discovered a few small tattoos on your shoulder, thigh, and lower back. Flowers, a heart, and a the name \"Lorenzo\" in an elegant font. Your new skin was noticeably darker and smoothly shaved compared to your old body. Being 13 years older, your new body showed the beginning signs of aging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore meeting up with your friends, you decided to take advantage of the privacy by getting something to eat and using the bathroom. Needing to sit down in order to pee was a bizarre experience, having been just fine standing up to do the same job over the past 21 years. You almost forgot to wipe afterwards!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed the car keys and slung Violetta's handbag around your shoulder once again. Is it time to meet up with friends?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Having mapped his location beforehand, you realized that he lived only a few miles from Violetta's house. It was no trouble driving there, but in retrospect it might have been wise to call them in advance about the 34-year-old Italian beauty claiming to be their friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, you found yourself driving through a neighborhood that could be described as exceedingly opulent. To call them \"houses\" would confuse something humble with what you encountered: a series of small mansions. Each one had an enormous front yard, cobblestone driveways, two, three, or four stories, 4-car garages, and had backyards gracing either the nearby golf course or a private lake. The property value could easily be in the millions of dollars. This couldn't be where one of your friends lives, could it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open Violetta's cell phone and dial your friend's number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" A young man's voice answered on the other line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Shawn, this is Jonathan Rivers.\" You said while steering through the neighborhood. \"Is the address you gave me correct? I'm driving through a neighborhood for filthy-rich people. That can't be you, can it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's no mistake, I really live here!\" Shawn replied, the smugness evident in his tone. \"And... dude... you sound like a chick! What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I went to the bodyport and---\" You were interrupted by a guffawing Shawn. \"Don't tell me, they swapped you with a random? That's hilarious! Was it your first time? Do you know how uncommon a gender swap at the bodyport is? You gotta get your ass over here pronto. Zach, Paul, and Matt are already here. We're waiting for ya buddy. Can't wait to see you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet. Don't start the fun without me!\" You chuckled and hung up. You found his house and three other cars parked in the driveway. Parking on the curb, you strolled up to the door and were greeted by Shawn.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You entered into the foyer of Shawn's mansion-like house. This was a moment you hadn't prepared for. For the first time, you felt rather insecure about your appearance in front of the friends you grew up with in high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya Jon. Is that you in there? You sure have changed a lot since high school!\" Shawn laughed, reaching out to shake hands. Not noticing how crushing his grip was in your petite hand, he continued, \"Please, my house is your house. Make yourself comfortable and take a seat. I've got the grill on full blast with some steaks and burgers, and Kelly is preparing the rest.\" Before you could respond, your other three friends appeared and welcomed you into the house. And although you could sense their eyes wandering over your newfound figure, you dismissed it as something you would do if the situation was reversed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, two of the other three friends seemed... different. \"Um, excuse me for asking but who are you guys?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall man with a beard and wearing a bowler hat, plaid shirt, and jeans responded, \"I'm Paul. Yeah, I used the bodyport earlier today and ended up as this guy. Not bad. He's a little on the fat side, but there's some good muscle tone to go with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other man (or perhaps boy) looked to be about 12 years old and wore a Transformers t-shirt with khaki shorts and sneakers. \"And I'm Matt. Nice to see you again Jon. Shoot, at least you ended up with an adult body. Unless we do it in private, there's no way I can legally drink. Or drive, or smoke...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't smoke anyways, Matt.\" Shawn mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I wanted to start? This body isn't mine, who cares what happens to it after I switch back?\" Matt retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure you can't do that. Didn't you read the bodyport policy agreement? No committing your partner's life to destructive habits or activities.\" Warned Paul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The policy? You actually read that boring crap? I just signed it, gave it back to the attendant, and went on my merry way.\" Chortled Matt, as he blew a raspberry with the kid's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what Shawn? I think Matt's new body suits his personality better than his old body.\" Paul smirked. You all laughed at him while he grumbled and disappeared into the living room. You resumed going along to each of your friends and shaking hands or pound hugging them. Each time reminded you of how much smaller and weaker your form was in comparison to your previous stocky, 6-foot-4 frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing that Zach was still his old self, you questioned why. He informed you that he preferred to avoid the bodyport and simply use his own car to travel to this meetup. It was a 14-hour drive on highways that are no longer being maintained by the government, but according to Zach it was worth keeping his own identity. He made reservations for one of the few remaining hotels  in operation in the town. As it turned out, the rental car and hotel industries were not completely wiped out as predicted with the advent of bodyports. Some people, such as Zach, preferred the old way of transportation despite the additional cost and time spent travelling. Even though bodyports were popularized in society just 5 years ago, most people found them to be a convenient, fast, cost-effective, and safe alternative compared to airports or highways. And, thanks to an effective marketing campaign by government and private industry, people had no fears about making the switch (no pun intended).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathed a sigh of relief. Your friends were just like you remembered them, and they were accommodating to the circumstance surrounding your transfer. They might have teased you at times, but it was expected of friends who hadn't seen each other for over 3 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn returned to the grill, Kelly (Shawn's wife) was in the kitchen preparing dinner, and you, Paul, Matt, and Zach sat on the leather sofa watching a (American) football game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Jonathan,\" began Paul, glancing down at your legs, \"Do you know anything about her? What I mean is: Have you had a chance to learn more about the life you'll be living for the next two weeks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Her name is Violetta Marinaccio, she's 34 and lives about 10 minutes away from this house. She's married and has a daughter, but I didn't get the chance yet to meet them. I'm guessing that they came from Italy or something, since I couldn't understand half of the things in their home. It's possible that she doesn't even speak English.\" You explained, sharing attention between Paul and the football game on TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's possible, you say? Haven't you spoken with her over the phone yet?\" He asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shifted in your seat and frowned. \"Well, not yet. But I plan to. Today has just been a busy day, and I wanted to give her space as she gets used to living my life. She hasn't called me either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" relented your friend, turning his focus back to the TV. \"Thought it might be a good idea, considering your situation. Anyway, the reason I asked is because I talked to my partner earlier today while you weren't here. You know, this guy I swapped with. His name is Edward Cunningham, works at the local university as a tenured professor. Thankfully he's on sabbatical right now so I don't have to fake my way through the next two weeks. He said he wanted to go on vacation and become someone else for a little while. He said he thought of it as 'spinning the roulette wheel' of life. A real nutter, this one. We shared information about each other, some of which I repeated here for you, and agreed to keep in contact at least once a day.\" Paul took a sip of beer and wiped his mouth. \"This is my sixth time using the bodyport, so I'm pretty familiar with the whole process. Personally, I think it's amazing that you ended up as a woman on your first time. You can experience things that no man will ever experience. It can broaden your horizons, you know, give yourself a better understanding of the female species.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem more positive about it than me.\" You interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul laughed. \"Yup! That's because I'm not the one wearing panties and getting a period. Don't sweat it, Jonathan. It's just for two weeks. Over before you know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, can you two stop flirting and get a room? The Packers just scored another touchdown.\" Matt interrupted. He took a swig of beer but sprayed it out in disgust. \"Yuck! This kid's taste buds aren't used to alcohol. This sucks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did you get a chance to talk to your swapping partner, Matt?\" Zach asked to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I did.\" Matt responded indignantly. His pre-pubescent voice seemed at odds with his mature mood and mannerisms. \"Do you honestly think I'd let a kid run wild in my body? I told him to keep my pants zipped. If he does something stupid, I'm protected with a comprehensive insurance plan. The premium costs a crapton, but for these two weeks it's worth it.\" He set his beer on a coaster on the table. \"The boy was going to see his grandparents for two weeks during the summer. With any luck, I'm gonna switch back with a mouth full of cavities, a totaled vehicle, and an arrest warrant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou returned to the game. The time passed slowly as you nursed a light beer while waiting for dinner. It became apparent that your new body didn't like the rough, carbonated texture of beer. Oh well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you felt a tap on the shoulder. It was Kelly Wilson, Shawn Wilson's 23-year-old wife. You attended their wedding as a groomsman (usher). Zach was the best man, but it didn't matter much after one hell of a bachelor party. Though it had been a few months removed, you found Kelly just as sexy and alluring now as then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hellooo Jonathan!\" She beamed, leaning forward in a way that showed off the impressive cleavage in her low-cut top. \"I heard you arrive here earlier, but I was so busy making you guys dinner! Just slaving away in the kitchen. You'll love what Shawn and I are making tonight.\" She sighed, as she motioned for you to give her a hug. You got up and awkwardly embraced Shawn's wife, both of your breasts pressing together. It was weird and hot at the same time. While you had towered over her at the wedding, as Violetta you met her only at eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh. Thanks. The trip went fine. Do you need any help?\" You said out of formality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I could use some help in the kitchen.\" Kelly answered, clasping your manicured hand tightly. \"Come on Jonathan, if you're going to experience womanhood you'll need expert guidance. Let's leave the 'boys' to watch their silly football game. Plus, you need to keep me totally informed about this woman's life and family!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced back at your friends for help. They were chuckling with each other, of course. Matt said, \"You should listen to Kelly. Proper women don't bother themselves with football games. Aside from the buff physiques and spandex tights, right Jonathan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just because I'm a woman doesn't make me gay!\" You raged, as the others burst out laughing. Nevertheless, you allowed Kelly to escort you away from the living room. She appeared enthusiastic about showing you the ropes; after all, you were playing for 'the other team' now!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite your reluctance to tag along with Shawn's wife, and desire to talk to your friends instead, you followed Kelly into the kitchen to help prepare tonight's food. Kelly tied on an apron, wiped her brow, and handed you a potato peeler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind boiling 5 or 6 potatoes in that pot over there, honey?\" She asked. \"Then let it sit, mash it up, add pepper and butter if necessary. Set it on the table along with silverware next to the gravy. Also, could you throw together a house salad? It doesn't need to be fancy. Just dice up some carrots, green onions, peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers, and use the lettuce in the bottom drawer of the refrigerator. You think you can do that Jonathan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed and began preparing the side dishes. \"You know Kelly, I'm sure most of this stuff isn't absolutely necessary for tonight. Take it from me, the guys would be happy enough without the frills.\" Referring to the garnish Kelly strategically placed on the plates, along with candles lit inside glass jars placed on the oversized mahogany dinner table beneath a chandelier suspended from the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly brushed off your comment, opening the stove to check on something. \"You're just like Shawn! No understanding about nutrition. Didn't you take a cooking class in high school? An atmosphere of ease and gentleness is the best for digesting food. Beef is great for protein, calories, and the like, but you really need fibers, vitamins, and minerals from fresh produce. Anything we don't finish tonight will be leftovers tomorrow, although I suspect most of this will be gone anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't I spend time with the friends I haven't seen since high school?\" You complained, washing the lettuce in a colander and placing a bowl next to the cutting board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not until you help me with this.\" Kelly said resolutely. \"I really do appreciate it, Jonathan. You might not be aware but it takes a lot of effort to prepare a dinner for 6 people. I've been consumed solely with dessert preparation for the past few hours. It's baked Alaska, my specialty. You'll love it! It's almost done right now. Here, help me get it out of the oven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped what you were doing to don some oven mitts and take the ceramic dish out of the oven. \"Think you can handle that, sweetie?\" Kelly snickered, watching you place the heavy dessert on the counter to cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're enjoying this too much.\" You grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why not? It's about time you men appreciate the finer art of food preparation.\" Kelly said. \"In most households, it's always the woman responsible for keeping the family well nourished. Families rely on the wife, the mother, for something so basic. Without us, you would resort to macaroni and cheese or ramen noodles every night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's wrong with that, exactly?\" You retorted, placing your hands on your hips and cracking a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because men should learn how to cook too. It's super attractive if a man knows how to cook and do other things around the house.\" Kelly replied. \"That way, we women can drink beer and watch the football games for a change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou returned to dicing the vegetables and plopping the potatoes in boiling water. \"That wouldn't interest you anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak for yourself, Jonathan.\" Kelly giggled. \"See how much fun this is? You're getting a new perspective already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to drop the conversation and focus on making the food as quickly as possible. It didn't take too long (mostly waiting for the potatoes to soften) before your contribution to the meal was complete. It was a large table with intricate wood carvings on the side. Its entire surface was filled with bowls, dishes, plates, condiments, silverware, and the food. Shawn came inside with the meat covered by aluminum foil. Setting that on the counter next to the table, he announced to the guys that dinner was ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, I'm starved!\" Matt cried, being the first in line to gather food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're a growing boy after all. Literally.\" Zach rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These mashed potatoes are excellent. Not too flaky, just the right amount of flavor.\" Paul said, pouring more gravy over the top of a generous mound on his plate. \"Thanks for the meal Kelly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, you can thank 'Violetta' for that.\" Grinned Kelly. \"She prepped for a few of the dishes on the table here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a good thing or bad thing?\" Chuckled Matt. \"I won't be in the bathroom all night, will I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, stop it! I supervised Jonathan and made sure he did everything alright. With more of my guidance I think he could become a fine woman.\" Kelly replied, in a half-patronizing tone that made everyone laugh. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so good to see everyone again. Not in the flesh, ironically, but in spirit.\" Shawn added, slicing another chunk of steak to add to his plate. \"Do you all remember Ryan? Ryan Ferguson? Last week I read on Facebook that he passed away after a hang gliding accident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was the center on the high school basketball team, the year we went to the state championships.\" Observed Zach, the mood around the table becoming more somber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that true? Man, that's a tragedy. He and I had a psychology class together senior year. Not the sharpest tool in the shed, but he worked his ass off in everything he did. Made the most of life, you know? Nothing was out of reach to him. My condolences to his family; if I had a Facebook I would have attended the funeral.\" Paul said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a toast?\" Proposed Kelly. \"To making the most of life.\" Glasses clinked around the table, and you downed a glass of red wine in a heartbeat. Apparently, your body was conditioned to prefer wine over beer, as you enjoyed the dry taste of the Chianti.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It approached that point in the meal where the clinking of silverware replaces talking. You, your friends, and Kelly ate and drank in a pleasant silence. But a question lingered on your mind and it had to do with Shawn's newfound affluence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Shawn, I don't remember you being this loaded in high school. You've been prospering lately, no doubt about it. How did all this come to be?\" You raised your hands, referring to the Victorian mansion they called home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, you weren't here when I talked about that.\" Shawn said. Your other friends had evidently heard the story earlier. \"It was shortly after graduating from high school. I had saved up about 2,500 dollars from my summer job working at Dave's restaurant. I considered taking out a student loan to go to college, but I didn't have anywhere in mind. I imagine that most students don't know what they want to study, and I knew that life wasn't for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happened? This house isn't worth $2,500!\" You exclaimed, pouring yourself another glass of wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a minute, I'm getting there.\" Shawn answered. \"Anyway, I ran into a friend I knew from Boy Scouts who I hadn't seen for years. He told me about some new digital currency called Cryptcoin. Said it was the future of money. He laid out a whole philosophy on the subject, but I primarily saw an investment opportunity out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One man's investment is another man's speculation.\" Muttered Zach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet!\" Snapped Shawn. \"So instead of sinking my money into an overpriced, college educational system, I bought Cryptcoins. The price per coin at the time was a nickel, just five cents. $2,500 divided by $0.05 is fifty thousand. That was how many Cryptcoins I owned a few years ago. I'm sure you heard the news recently. I'd love the mass media if I didn't hate it, but their popularizing of Cryptcoins sparked a lot of interest from other users. The short story is this: I rode the speculative wave of investment until I sold all my coins at the peak price of $1,000 per coin. Off the top of your heads, anyone? Fifty million dollars. That's $50,000,000 of tax-free revenue. Naturally such a large trade made news headlines. <i>Caveat emptor</i>, that's my motto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to Gordon Gecko over here...\" Zach said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you commit $2,500 of your life savings in a high-risk endeavor, then you can talk. Okay?\" Shawn replied angrily. \"Can you believe that, Jonathan? I make the best decision of my life and Zach can't see the forest through the trees. I provided a valuable service; by selling my supply of Cryptcoins, I drove down the price and signaled that I thought the price was too high. By selling them at that price, it meant that somebody else wanted to buy them. Somebody else thought that the price should have been higher than $1,000 per coin. When we discard the emotion and misinformation, it really was a simple transaction. Nothing more. No different than speculating in commodities or stocks or bonds or the final score to the Packers game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's change the subject.\" Said Paul quickly, eliciting a nod from you, Matt, and Kelly. \"The main point is that you're thriving. Neither you nor Kelly will ever have to work again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, here!\" Glasses clinked around the table. Yet again, you found yourself downing a glass of wine. In your old body it took quite a lot of alcohol to get you feeling buzzed. As it turns out, you were starting to feel warm and relaxed a lot sooner than you expected. You noticed that your long fingernails clicked against the glass every time you raised it to drink. For some reason, this seemed peculiarly amusing to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many glasses of wine have you had, Jon? Might wanna go easy on that.\" Remarked Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem at all... I can drive back to this chick's place?\" You stumbled over the words slightly. Kelly giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were thinking you would sleep over with us tonight. That goes for you two as well, Paul and Matt.\" Shawn offered kindly. \"Zach, we know you've already made hotel reservations, but the option is open for you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but I think I'll head back to the hotel soon. Gotta check my e-mail. I'll be teleworking for the next few days, since I can't afford to be away from my job for so long.\" Zach stated. \"Some people need to be productive members of society.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he's jealous about Shawn's wealth.\" Paul whispered to you parenthetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you'll change your mind later this week, Zach.\" Said Shawn. \"I'll be rigging up my yacht for a fishing trip to Conifer Lake on Friday. I want all of you to be there with me!\" Referring to a large, freshwater lake about 35 miles outside of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly's prediction about dinner ended up being a bit overstated. There was more food left over than anticipated, due partly to your own decreased metabolism. You felt full after eating just a hamburger and some salad. At least you didn't spill anything on Violetta's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone saved room for some baked Alaska?\" Kelly chirped, setting down the plate of the sweet confection on the table after clearing off the main course. The guys did, naturally, but you couldn't say the same for yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm gonna -- hic! -- give Violetta a call.\" You said, staggering up from the table and stumbling on your feet, more out of unfamiliarity than drunkenness. \"Where is her handbag? I mean... my handbag!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I set it on the desk in the study room.\" Kelly said, pointing out where that was. Wow. Kelly looked amazing in her strapless tube top. Her daisy dukes left little to the imagination, displaying her luscious legs in full prominence. You shook your head and went over to the study to retrieve Violetta's handbag and cell phone. It might be a good idea to call someone before the night is over. Who do you decide to talk to?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Whether it was the need to check in, or the alcohol encouraging you to do so, you wanted to call Violetta and ask about her life. You grab the cell phone, flip it up, and sit on the chair in the study. Rubbing one hand absentmindedly over your smooth legs, and using the other to dial your old phone number, you lean back in the chair and sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA masculine voice answers on the other end of the line. \"Hello? Who is this?\" It asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Jonathan Rivers. Well, I used to be, but now I'm a chick named Violetta Marinaccio. Would you happen to be that chick?\" You said casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>S\u00ec. Il mio nome \u00e8 Violetta</i>. Uh... Mine name is Violetta. You are Jonathan, yes?\" You could tell she had a poor grasp of the English language. Your old voice was unsteady and had a distinct Italian accent to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, listen. I wanted to call and see if you had any questions for me, since you'll be living my life for the next two weeks. It shouldn't be too difficult being me, because I don't have a job currently and I'm away from university for the summer. Do you understand all of this?\" I asked in her lilting, airy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I... <i>come si dice</i>... repeat please? You repeat please?\" She asked. You sighed. This was going to be harder than you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any questions? Do you need help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. No help.\" She responded. You rather doubted that, but continued anyway, speaking as simply and telegraphically as possible. \"What about your life? What do I need to know? Tell me about your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was dead air over the line, as Violetta must have been translating in her mind what to say. You thought you heard typing on a computer. Before long, she responded again. \"I married a man named Lorenzo and have a daughter named Emilia. We moved emigrated from Tuscany to your country 2 months ago. My husband is an engineer and I stay at home to care for our son. However, she will be the nanny for most of it the next two weeks. Lorenzo knows that exchange. I called today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly she was using an online translator. Despite her resourcefulness, you couldn't help but feel sorry for her. Her husband was probably on an extended work detail that required him to move to an English-speaking country. Deciding not to split up the family (and deprive their young daughter from growing up without a mother or a father), they moved together. It is possible that Lorenzo spoke better English than his wife, and that they made enough money to allow her to be the homemaker and raise their child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you traveling?\" You asked slowly. \"What do you want to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother pause. Clicking of keys on a keyboard. \"To visit my sister Simonetta. I have not seen since left Italy 12 years ago.\" She read the resulting translation online, not understanding what it meant but having enough faith to use it anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Maybe she can speak better English than you can.\" You stated matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Che cosa</i>? No, she... Simonetta is <i>italiano</i>, no is English. Uh, <i>spiacenti</i>. Sorry.\" The frustration was apparent in her voice. \"I have class of English... every day. I work in the language very good. You... you go to class, please? I need to go there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" You shrugged your shoulders, figuring that there could have been more challenging obligations for her to drop on you for any reason. Going to her English-language class could be fun, and apparently it was required for Violetta to attend on a regular basis. If you didn't want to go to her class, you could simply explain the swap to her teacher and have her excused from class for the duration of the swap. You figured that her teacher would understand, but why not go just for fun? \"Where is the class?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See in my... bag.\" She replied. You dug around for any clues and found a small business card with someone's contact information. Class hours were from 9:00 to 12:00 every day. Crap! That was way too much time to commit to something so unnecessary. And just when you had had enough of university lectures!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. If you have any problems, just give me a call.\" You sighed again. \"Talk to you later. <i>Arrivederci</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Arrivederci</i>!\" Said your old voice. You placed the phone back into the handbag and rubbed your temples. Why did you have to swap with her, of all people?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you concluded the conversation with your former self, someone had appeared in the corner of the room to catch the last minute or so of dialogue. Unaware of the identity of this incidental eavesdropper, you spun around in the chair to see Kelly, casually leaning against the wall and folding her arms with a studious expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! So you are finished talking to Violetta?\" She said lamely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to call it that, yeah.\" You replied, stuffing the small cell phone back into the handbag from where you first found it. \"She can handle herself for all I care. Honestly I don't know what the bodyport staff were thinking when they linked us two together. What gives?\" Kelly nodded, picking up on the fact that you had slurred your words together slightly. The alcohol at dinner having been perhaps too much for your new frame. She entered the room, approaching you before veering off to examine a painting on the opposite wall. Although her back was to you, you somehow felt her eyes on you all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you enjoyed the food tonight.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, it was great. Thanks...\" Was your reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is good to have all the boys together again. Shawn has told me a lot about his old friends, so I am... happy to finally meet you.\" She said, although you got the impression that wasn't the reason she approached you to talk here, in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what are you thinking about?\" You raised an eyebrow. \"Out with it, already. You've got something else to say right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly turned around and sat on the other side of the desk. Crossing her legs and tucking strands of bleached-blonde hair behind her ears, she bit her lip and pondered a moment. In your booze-induced state, you couldn't help but unabashedly admire the gorgeous vixen sitting across from you. Had you been in your old body (or maybe had a little more to drink), you would have given her a jump right then and there. But before you had a chance to act, she spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Jonathan, two things to come to mind.\" She began. \"First, have you considered all the aspects of being a woman? Things you'll need to do, things you have to pay more attention to now, things that never concerned you when you were Jonathan Rivers? A woman's world is different in many ways. I was just curious if you had prepared yourself for those differences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, ha ha.\" You chuckled nervously. \"Why does it matter, though? I reckon it can't be too difficult if half of the population can get along just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's more than that and you know it, Jonathan.\" Kelly continued. \"Bodyports strongly encourage people to keep up the appearances of their swapping partners. That means shaving your legs and arms, for example. Wearing makeup, putting on a bra when you go out, not travelling alone at night. Using protection during sex, not getting pregnant or getting raped. The way you interact with men and women will be different. Depending on when she last had her period, you might have to experience that also.\" She said in no uncertain terms, making you feel more awkward now than before this 'girl-to-girl' chat began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelly, I'm not going to have sex or anything like that...\" You grimaced. \"Unless you want to with me, right now?\" You found yourself saying. So stupid! She laughed and shifted in her seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As interesting as that might be, I don't think Shawn would approve!\" She giggled. \"Don't get me wrong, Jon. You're very pretty, but I'm more interested in what a <i>man</i> has to offer.\" Her emphasis of the word <i>man</i> was like twisting a knife in a stab wound; as much as you would have liked to please her in your less-inhibited state of mind, the prospect was physically unappealing to her now. Despite being perceived by women as attractive in your old body, that attraction had now ironically reversed itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly noticed your pained expression, and her tone changed to become more businesslike, the mood having become more sober than perhaps necessary. \"Actually Jon, I wanted to ask you a favor. Earlier today, I went out with some of my girlfriends to go clothes shopping. They encouraged me to buy a few outfits. While I thought that they fit my style and looked appealing at the time, I always end up doubting whether or not I really want them. Shawn asks me, every time, why I feel the need to return so many clothes after changing my mind. Why I can't decide on something and stick with it, right? Men don't understand the dynamics to clothes shopping. Sad but true. I suspect that shopping is easier for men in general, since your sizes are less variable and there's fewer things to coordinate to stay fashionable. But I wouldn't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why are you telling me all of this?\" You asked, wondering why you can't spend time with your friends out in the living room already. \"You want my opinion on fashion or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, although I'm sure you have your own beliefs.\" She said. \"Actually, I was wondering if you could try on some of my outfits so I can see what they look like? You know, from a third-person perspective... as if someone was looking at me as I wear them. You and I have similar figures including height. Your bust is slightly larger than mine, but your waist and hips will fit well in my dresses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you asking me to model your own clothes for you?\" You muttered. \"Seriously? I didn't travel hundreds of miles to become your personal mannequin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Jon! Please?\" Begged Kelly, clasping her hands together. \"None of my friends have hourglass figures like us. They can't do this for me, but you can! Think of it as a lesson on women's fashion. Plus, I'll be super grateful if you do this for me...\" Her voice trailed off, and you realized that her tone had become decidedly more seductive. Pairing this fact with her amazing figure, getting to be with her whilst being potentially in the nude, you nodded breathlessly at her request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Thank you Jon, you won't regret it!\" Kelly declared, taking you in her hand and leading you upstairs to an enormous master bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about my friends? What about Shawn??\" You asked, exercising caution so as not to trip on your shorter legs going up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They won't mind if it's just a few minutes. They're outside next to the swimming pool, expecting us to clean up after dinner anyways.\" Answered Shawn's wife. Evidently, the guys wanted a distraction so that Kelly wouldn't bother them for the evening. You were that distraction.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Is this really necessary?\" You asked, finding yourself sitting on a chair in the bathroom as Kelly began applying mascara to your eyelashes. She swished the wand with expert precision. This was after she persuaded you to try some of her foundation, concealer, lip gloss, and other small bottles and tubes that you couldn't care to remember. As it turns out, the more drinks you had, the more agreeable others' ideas seemed to become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. Don't move a muscle. That's perfect, darling.\" Kelly said, satisfied with her work. \"Now Jon, why don't you walk around for me in that outfit? I want to see how I look when I'm wearing that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe outfit in question was a long-sleeved, white top with polka dots, and a black spandex microskirt that showed off most of your body's toned thighs. You staggered on a pair of stiletto heels, constantly feeling like you were about to fall forward. But you manage to strut around the bathroom and master bedroom with less difficulty than you expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! This is... so hot!\" You said in awe, looking down at the cleavage formed by the skin-tight top. Even though you felt ridiculous putting on a show for your best friend's wife, a part of you found it extremely sexy. You made sure to feel up your new body whenever Kelly wasn't looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The girls were right!\" Kelly exclaimed. \"That top will definitely grab Shawn's attention. Do you mind if I take your picture?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought hadn't crossed your partially inebriated mind, but why not? You stood next to the door and struck a pose, using one hand to button up your top and the other to tug down your microskirt. Kelly's cell phone emitted a flash. She showed you the picture, which apparently was a body shot only: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/ROKeyoyl.jpg.\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/ROKeyoyl.jpg.</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't take a picture of my face?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm more concerned with the outfit.\" Kelly answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what was the point of all those cosmetics?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we're not finished yet, Jon! You're going to try out everything I bought recently. You didn't think this was the only thing I got, did you?\" Kelly helped you out of the top and microskirt, leaving you in just a bra and panties. \"Also,\" she added, \"I'm just a bit concerned about the whole legal aspect. From what I know, bodyport policies forbid its users from taking nude or otherwise embarrassing photos of their partners. It is acceptable to take photos without headshots, but there have been many disputes when the person in the photo is easily identifiable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it look like I care? We can worry about that later!\" You said, feeling yourself up once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that! Oh my God, how unladylike of you!\" Kelly laughed at your impetuousness. She looked through her closet, picking out a few articles of clothing with tags still on them, and her expression grew more thoughtful. \"Are you really okay with that? I guess a few photos can't hurt. If I send them to your phone after you swap back, do you promise to keep them a secret? You promise? Okay. Okay, try on these jeans next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you and Kelly hashed through multiple outfits, ranging from formal wear to beachwear to everything in between. Kelly described each of the various cosmetic products on her vanity table while you made catwalks, but you were too buzzed to care. All you could think about was how sexy you looked, and how you would jump at the chance to sleep with this woman despite her being in her mid-thirties. Suddenly, you were in the bathroom again, this time wearing a blue top and skinny jeans. How long had you been here? It appeared that time wasn't the only thing getting blurry for you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say cheese!\" Kelly cried, snapping yet another photograph as you smiled into the camera: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/OEcnkbw.jpg.\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/OEcnkbw.jpg.</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too adorable!\" Kelly said, as the shutter sound of the cell phone camera rang out again: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/Lj1llbfl.jpg.\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/Lj1llbfl.jpg.</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, you heard a rapping at the master bedroom door. \"Hello, Kelly? Jon? What's up? Get your butts out here for a game of horseshoes!\" Shawn's voice rang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a minute!\" Kelly stashed her cosmetics back into the bathroom drawers, hung up whatever clothes remained in the bedroom, and spun around in a hurry. \"Where is your original outfit, Jon? I can't find it!\" She said, rifling through the clothes-strewn room. You had tried on so many clothes that your originals, the ones you showed up to the house with, were nowhere to be seen. Wait, what were you wearing tonight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I don't know, ha.\" You chuckled, finding this whole experience unreal. \"Shawn wants us... the downstairs... going to Shawn...\" You trailed off, as your drunken mind  became fixated on how sexy Kelly looked and nothing else.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Still wearing one of Kelly's outfits -- the blue sleeveless tank top and skin-tight jeans -- you gave up on finding whatever clothes you brought with you from Violetta's own wardrobe. <i>She won't notice it's gone until long after we've swapped back,</i> you thought indifferently. Your body felt warm and relaxed. You needed to hold onto the handrail as you stumbled down the stairs, the stiletto heels still strapped around your ankles and feet. You unceremoniously staggered into the living room, your breasts bouncing with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where... ? Wha?\" You gasped. Your friends. They've disappeared. Your head was in circles, trying to grasp onto the remaining shreds of sobriety your booze-addled brain possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly laughed and opened a sliding glass door to go into the back yard, where your friends must have gone. You stripped off the heels and followed barefoot. The wet summer grass gave you chills as you finally met up with your friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's about time you girls got out here!\" Cried Matt, his voice cracking in the pre-teen's body. \"You remember who the horseshoes champion of our school was, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember a little boy being champion of anything.\" Paul retorted, looming over Matt with the body of the tall, fat professor. \"Looks like you and Kelly get along like a house on fire. Care to join us for a round or two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in high school, you and your friends would play horseshoes whenever there was a bunch of time to kill. Days after school, when nobody was working and football was off season, you five would play horseshoes, forming teams to toss the U--shaped iron bar around two separate metal stakes in the sand. Zach's father, a welder, crafted the horseshoes himself. You had carved out two sections of an abandoned field outside school and filled them with sand. It was better than playing on video game consoles like most of your schoolmates, because it was an activity that, on purpose or by chance, formed the initial bonds of your friendship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jon! You in or not? We got six people here, that makes three teams of two.\" Shawn said, breaking you out of your reverie. You nodded and partnered up with Zach to make a team. Shawn and his wife Kelly made the second team; Paul and Matt, the third.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul and Matt each stood at one metal stake, positioned about 40 feet away from each other. Paul aimed his horseshoe in an underhanded motion. His eyes squinted, he bent his knees slightly, and he hefted the iron bar into the air. It sailed through the air before bouncing ingloriously over the sandbox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pffft! You suck!\" Matt blew a raspberry at his partner. \"Zero points!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know my own strength, okay?\" Paul muttered, scratching his head before tossing the second iron bar into the sandbox. This time, the horseshoe clanged around the metal stake but did not catch around it. Then, Matt made his two attempts. Both of his horseshoes landed in the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's the so-called  'champion' of the school, right there!\" Paul burst out laughing. Matt frowned and stepped to the side to make way for the next team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsurprisingly, Shawn tossed the horseshoes much better than Matt or Paul. He clanged the metal stake on the first toss, then ringed the second shoe completely around it. \"Nice one!\" The rest of you cheered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly had a much more arduous time gripping the iron, much less lifting it into the air. Not wanting to ruin her manicure, she gingerly tossed the horseshoes toward the sandbox. They bounced on the ground before coming to rest at the wooden edge of the box. You sighed. Chances are, when it comes to be your turn, you wouldn't do much better than Kelly, having a physique that resembled hers closer than someone like Zach or Shawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the first two teams finished with round one, it was your and Zach's turn. You trudged over to one sandbox while Zach positioned himself at the other. You picked up the horseshoes from the sand, gasping at how heavy they were! The muscles in your stick-thin biceps flexed. You adjusted your grip on the pieces of iron, holding them against your waist for support. To your chagrin, this was yet another reminder of how you missed having your old body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach tossed his horseshoes into the air, doing almost as well as Shawn in that he made contact with the metal stake twice. Both times the horseshoes clanged away from the stake, but they landed close enough for points anyway. Now, it was your turn. It felt like you were hefting small anchors in your petite hands. You doubted that you could even get as far as Kelly, seeing how her relative height could have helped her arm length to swing forward. Regardless, you had too much to drink to feel self conscious. Carelessly, you swung the first horseshoe <i>backward</i>, turning to watch it skip along the ground rather than glide through the air. It stopped a good 15 feet behind you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone burst out laughing, including you. Wondering why the others found it so funny, you found your head swimming with pleasurable sensations. Why are you suddenly barefoot? Your arm aches a little bit. <i>God, Kelly is so hot, I would show her a good time if I was still me... wait, who was I again?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell on your butt and leaned back against the grass, your hair splayed out against your face. The others rushed up to you, still laughing? <i>Why are they laughing?</i> The sky was dim, the sun having fully disappeared a half hour ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere were you when you woke up?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And after a few policies you needed to sign you were finally free to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, just remember that you must be here in two weeks for your swap back.\" The attendant remembered you while delivering your bodies baggage. \"Have a nice stanza Miss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last \"Miss\" just made you sight conscious of your actual condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weather was nice out of the terminal. Sunny and wet, it was completely different from the cloudy and cold weather of the city. You breathed and enjoyed the subtle salty taste on the wind. You might be a woman, but all the time saved to enjoy that place actually worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled to yourself and walked to the Car Lot to get the car you rented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did you go?</span></div></div>",

You choose your destiation, and you will be given a list of people who you choose to swap with that live in that area you're planning on going to. The two of you then arrive at the terminals at your local bodyports, and a few button presses later by the attendants working there, and swap! You are given full access to the body's house and vehicles, where you will stay, thus making hotels and motels a thing of the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you're done with your travels, just do the same thing, and a few button presses later, and you're back in your own body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA disclaimer: Like airplanes, you may not always get the preferred seat, or in this case, body, that you have chosen.<br>\r\nSo strap in, and swap!</td>",
