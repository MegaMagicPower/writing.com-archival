            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Warily, you closed your eyes, trying to relax. You'd a tough day at school, unsurprising considering that the new school year had began several days earlier. Already, you was wishing for some escape, but a quiet house and time away from your rather girly sisters was the closest thing to it that you could hope for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeast that what it would normally be like. Your eldest sister, Hayley had disappeared about a year ago, sent to some private school which name you didn't even know, and you hadn't heard anything from her since. That was strange, as you were close, Mainly because she definitely was the tomboy of the family. It was the opposite, least in hobbies, compared of your other two sisters. Your youngest sister, Hannah was the stereotypical girly, princess obsessed brat. At seven, she was either doing ballet, or at a friend's house doing dress up or something like that. As for Melanie, she was your twin sister. Ditzy, blond, and vain, she was at least tolerable towards you. It was strange that she wasn't around; you expected that she would be least in her room, pouting about something but you quickly realized she would be either giving moral support to one of your friends (and crush) Megan Thompson, whom just joined the school's cheerleading squad, or pining over your best friend, Harry Rich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling slightly, you headed to the fridge and got yourself a snack. Even mom wasn't around, which was unusual. Normally, she was upstairs in her study, but today, there was no sign of her. As you placed your sandwich on a side table, you felt something hard by the side of your chair. Surprised, you leaned over to see what it was. Much to your surprise, it was an old-looking leather bound book. Opening it, you saw on the first page the words <i>Magic Book</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic book, huh?\" you muttered, wondering what it was doing in your home. Normally, you would had tossed it aside, but there was something compelling about the book. Almost like it called out to you, wanting you to read more of it.</span></div></div>",

Only you placed a shirt over it to hide it as something in the back of your mind was warning you not to let anyone see you with it. You were so preoccupied with the book that you did not notice the strange little girl sitting on your bed until you turned around. You jumped upon taking notice, causing her to let out a low scream of fright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Unnerved, you demanded. \"How did you get into my room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked at you as if she were stunned but looked down at herself and sighed. \"I- I'm Christina.\" Timidly, she said. \"I'm Harry's cousin from out of town. Please, John... I- I need your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry didn't tell me he had a cousin coming for a visit.\" Raising an eyebrow, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's sort of a surprise visit.\" Wincing, Christina said. \"Harry was always telling me how he got into your room so I did it myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the scrapes on Christina's legs and arms, you knew she was telling the truth. Still, you were annoyed she had sneaked into your house and into your room. You sighed. \"It's not safe for a girl as small as you to climb that tree.\" Scolding, you said. \"Also, its very strange for a boy like me to have a little girl in his bedroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina began to tear up so you called for Hayley. When she entered your room, she looked at the little girl in surprise. \"Who...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She says she's Harry's cousin.\" Annoyed, you said. \"She climbed the tree to get in here. She said she needed my help but I don't know for what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley sighed, a bemused look on her face. \"Come with me... Christina.\" Kindly, she said. \"You should not be in a boy's room; we will talk, girl to girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Christina nodded and slid off your bed. She allowed Hayley to take her hand and was led out of the room. After they were gone, you closed the door but paused as you turned around. You had spotted something lying on your bed. Upon closer inspection, you found it to be a pair of antique glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry's cousin must have dropped it when she slid off my bed.\" Muttering, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were going to give them back to her but something compelled you to try them on. Upon doing so, you saw the book you had found glowing slightly. Surprised, you took off the glasses and saw that the glow had vanished. Curious, you put the glasses back on and saw the book glowing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird.\" Curious, you said. \"I wonder...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This happened after I used them to try to read a weird book I got from the same store last week. It was called the magic book, beginner's edition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom's eyes widened slightly before she exchanged a weary look with Hayley. \"Where is this book and these glasses now?\" Looking at Harry, mom demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The book I left at home but I brought the glasses over with me.\" Blushing, Harry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached into a pocket of her dress but froze as it was not there. \"It must have fallen out when I slipped off of John's bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear...\" Worried, mom muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley rushed out of the study and ran to your bedroom to find you...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In fact, you both tried but found you could not move out of your seats and began to tremble. \"What- What is going to happen to us?\" Worried, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fault is not on you... girls.\" Gently, mom explained. \"The fault is upon the one who sold an unsuspecting normal person magical artifacts.\" She sighed. \"However, the council and head witch will want some form of assurance that neither of you will talk about our secret world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They won't be so much worried about you... Lucy.\" Smiling slightly, Hayley said. \"As a member of this family, the likelihood of you becoming a witch yourself is rather high.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The problem is with Harry, or should I say Christina.\" Frowning, mom said. \"Her parents are immune to magic but are fully aware of our world as they serve the witch council.\" She sighed. \"Apparently, that immunity did not pass down to her which means she is likely a first witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Christina's confused look, Hayley added, \"The first born in a bloodline with magical powers; a discussion for another time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will have to call Elvira.\" Shaking her head, mom said. She then turned to you and Christina. \"Try to understand, she will likely want to keep you two as girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Christina turned to each other and began to cry as mom picked up the phone.

Already the walls of your room closest to the door, hence out of your immediate line of sight were pink, and that all your belongings were vanishing, though thankfully not being transformed or replaced into little girls' items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giving this place a much needed makeover\" Hayley said dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it right now!\" you yelled, annoyed that it sounded more like whining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, sis.

All your walls were now pink, and your wardrobes were girlish, white with ounk heart knobs. Apart from a single bookcase, your room looked extremely plain, with none of girlish decoration that you'd expect. You was about to comment about it, but caught yourself before you could utter a word. Too much like tempting fate. Instead, you walked over to the boolcase, deeming it significant. Most were rather girlish picture books, but one book caught your eye enough for you to put it out. It was a think, leather bound book that looked way too old for someone your supposed age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting\" Hayley said, watching you from your bed, which apart from a new pink bedsheet, was largeely unaltered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it Hayley.

As you headed for Hannah's bedroom, you looked back, saw that Robyn was following, and suddenly you suspected why. Robyn was far too mature, far more knowledgeable than a girl her age should be, and you wondered if you weren't the only age regressed, gender swapped person in the house. You pushed open Hannah's bedroom door, and saw your sister playing with some dolls, which instantly made you recoil. Hannah instantly noticed your presence, and Robyn's and stopped her game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy! You've brought Robyn. Is she going to help you? She is really smart and made me realize not all witches are ugly. Only the bad ones\" Hannah gushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So that was her problem\" you mused.  You knew Hannah was princess obsessed, and had picked up on the whole ugly old witch thing. To learn of her own abilities would had been a shock, but Robyn must had put some sort of morality thing into Hannah's mind. Bad magic would make her ugly. Hannah didn't wait for a reply from you; she gushed, \"Wanna play? i had some dresses for you and Lucy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks\" you muttered. You could easily imagine your youngest sister gushing how its better to be a girl. No way you was going to enter her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" Hannah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannah..\" you started, trying to keep you voice level. \"...Just because I look like some girly girl, it doesn't mean I <i>am</i> one. Magic is the only reason why. How would you like to be turned into a boy?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewww\" Hannah said, disgusted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See my point?\" you demanded, but you could see you hadn't gotten through to her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You figured it was due to the fact you'd instantly be the one person your crazed sister would focus on more than Christina.

You know how it is at school, and with Christina...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced at Christina, and she definately was one of the more awkward looking teen girls you've ever seen. Still, Mel needed a lesson of her own. \"Wrong approach, Melanie, or are you too much of a ditzy airhead to know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't call me an airhead!\" Mel snapped. \"Why don't you and your little friend, like, go play with Hannah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Been there, and Robyn is my councilor\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?

Words can hit like a fist; they are having trouble dealing with this change as well.\" Her face then softened. \"Do not worry, though.

If Samantha Forrester can't change us back, what's the point?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The point is you have your entire life ahead of you.\" Serious, Robyn replied. \"I understand you had lost a great deal and very few understand how that feels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you understand how that feels?\" Tearfully, you challenged. \"To go from the strongest boy in the state to the weakest little girl on the block? To go from high school to kindergarten?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn nodded, tears forming. \"Actually... yes; I do know how that feels. That is why I am now a councilor to witch boys who go through this very same difficult transition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis surprised and startled you. \"What....?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only mom had told you both that Luke would bring trouble upon himself without you or Christina having to do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were snapped out of your thoughts when Luke yelled out, \"You sold this thing to me knowing it needs a key to remove just to get more money out of me!

It was not long before you were both pummeling Elena Kruse with energy blasts, spells and magically strengthened punches and kicks. Terry looked on in disbelief which was all Hayley needed to fire a powerful electric jolt that sent the young rogue literally flying into the wall! She slid to the floor, unconscious then turned to aid you and Christina only to find that mom, Samantha, and Elvira had arrived.

Harry was like the son she never had; he had put faith in her that no one would give. It was because of him that she worked so hard to reform herself, though it was an up hill climb as her rivalry with mom ran too deep to simply let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, or rather Lucy was an unexpected bonus.\" Sneering, Elena continued. \"Natalie's rivalry with Samantha was the perfect cover. Posing as Robyn Masters and Susan Rich allowed me to infiltrate the house and learn enough to to push the right buttons to lure you away.\" her smirk twisted into a look of disgust as she eyed you and Christina. \"Only I did not count on the little brats having near adult strength magic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy is gifted.\" Angrily, mom said. \"She is also very protective of this family. Christina is the same way; she and Lucy were like brothers and now they are like sisters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here is the source of Elena's renewed magic, madam head witch.\" Calmly, one of the police officers said. She handed Elvira a strange looking pendant Elena had around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira sighed upon looking at it. \"The gift pendant; used to grant a non-magical girl or transformed boy magical power, making her a witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother officer took Terry Hickory into custody. \"What will happen to her?\" Morbidly curious, Hayley asked. \"Trial then sentencing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police officer sighed. \"She will get her day in court.\" Calmly, she replied. \"However, her fate is up to the rule of law.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Elena and Terry were escorted out while you continued to cry in mom's arms. You were angry, frightened, and confused.

You opened your mouth to protest but mom quickly said, \"We'll talk somewhere Christina can get some sleep; she had a rough night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou huffed at that but reluctantly followed mom out of your bed room to the sitting room where Hayley was waiting with a tea set with freshly brewed tea in three cups. \"I take it Lucy is still grumpy in the morning?\" Half teasing, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moaned at that but said nothing as mom urged you to sit down. \"Before you jump into your rant, understand that no one in this family wanted this to happen.\" Calmly, mom said. \"Still, what is done is done and it cannot be reversed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what am I supposed to do?\" Pouting, you asked. \"Assume the role of a six year old girl and act as if thirteen years of my life never happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No but you will slowly adapt to the life of a little girl and the past thirteen years will fade into memory as it would have if you had stayed a boy.\" Offering you a cup of tea, mom replied. \"That is the transition and, as i said, it will not be easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a sip of tea, not knowing it was laced with a calming potion. \"Are you planning to give me 'girl' lessons?\" Frowning, you asked. \"Christina's mom seems to be doing just that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is between Christina and her mother.\" Firmly but kindly, mom said. \"As for you, I have a more subtle idea in mind to help you adapt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to understand that we want to make the transition as smooth as possible for you.\" Jumping in, Hayley said. \"If you were do it alone, you would suffer nightmares for quite some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know this?\" Wincing, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr Katie Thompson is a doctor who specializes in, shall we say, special cases.\" Smiling, mom said. \"She treats witches of illnesses and injuries. She briefed us on what you would be facing and offered us some options.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took another sip of the tea. \"What sort of options?\" Softly, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One is a video which was made to help a transformed boy act and sound more feminine.\" Lightly, Hayley replied. \"It's more of a self help documentary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sound like something that would put me to sleep.\" Sighing, you said. \"What else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there are potions and spells that can help shorten your transition.\" Softly, mom said. \"Only a few of them require special permission to use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They must be potent.\" Wincing, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could try to tough it out without help but I don't recommend it.\" serious, Hayley said. \"The nightmares alone will drive you crazy and then there is the struggle of just getting you to wear the slightest feminine clothing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because of the 'no tomboy' rule.\" Frowning, you said. \"Don't I get any choice in how I dress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget, I had some strict rules about clothing when you were 'John' as well.\" Serious, mom said. \"You do get a choice but, like all things, there is a limit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are giving you the chance to pick how you want to tackle your transition, Lucy.\" Serious, Hayley said. \"You can do this easy or you can do it hard; it is your choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, then moaned. \"It's too early in the morning for this...\" Wearily, you complained. You then turned between mom and Hayley before saying, \"I'd rather...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

These are things your new sister took for granted and now are all gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can we help her?\" Wincing, mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Showing her the documentary on the transition would be a great first start.\" Serious, Raven replied. \"Also, I strongly recommend you do not just dive into treating her as a little girl. This is a common mistake that has caused a rip in many families that took years to heal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How slow do you suggest we take this?\" Worried, Hayley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven smiled. \"Treat her as a shy tomboy slowly coming out of her shell.\" Kindly, she replied. \"Tell her that the redecoration of her room was a suggestion; something to build upon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giving her a sense of choice.\" Catching on, Hayley said. \"Clever...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have had years of experience.\" Smiling, Raven said. \"For now, I will be only observing from the shadows and I will step in only when i feel the timing is right or Lucy senses me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your thoughts on her power?\" Wincing, mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven sighed. \"Although she is physically only six, she is magically thirteen.\" Serious, she replied. \"Once she understands how magic works and how to properly yield it, she can progress herself to her rightful age.\" She then frowned and added, \"Do not tell her of this; it will only make her hell bent to learn the spell without learning anything else and that always leads to disaster. There are no shortcuts to magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Raven vanished from sight just before you peered into the room. \"Is anything wrong, mom?\" Wincing, you asked. \"You've been in here a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just answering a question for Hayley.\" Lightly, mom replied. \"She may have graduated from witch school but there is still a lot she does not know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded at that as mom walked into the kitchen to make you breakfast. Meanwhile, Hayley escorted you back to the sitting room. \"We have a video on what happens during the transition.\" Serious, she said. \"I think it might help you make an educated decision on what you want to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense, I guess.\" Wincing, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley then setup the television and put in the DVD before hitting the play button.

Hi; I'm Pi Cutie.\" Nervously, he said. \"My family and I just moved here a few days ago and I'm hoping to make a lot of new friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class politely applauded as Pi returned to his seat.

Princess Cootie\" Tim offered, using his favorite insult for hannah, on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are we standing here? Shouldn't we help Lucy?\" Hannah whined as she and Hayley watched your unwanted talk with Tim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, princess. Tim just needs to let off some steam. You'll know why when you get to class\" Hayley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Tim is being mean. What if others see this?\" Hannah whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our cousin has a reputation, unfortunately. They'll just assume Tim is being a jerk. Besides, putting a spell on Tim is pointless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't suggesting that\" Hannah protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You was thinking of it. Your powers are far weaker than you think and Tim has natural resistance to magic. He doesn't have outright the immunity he thinks he has, though. Only a small number witches can change Tim, and I fear our little sister might be one of them.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yes, yes it was, you tried to tell yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour turned to the girls who had helped you. You didn't feel you had needed them, but you might as well thank them anyway. \"Thanks for your help. My cousin is so annoying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark haired girl's nodded. \"I didn't know he was your cousin. That must be awful. He''s the most annoying boy in the school and there are a lot of annoying boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your mouth to defend your former gender, but since you turned into a girl, you haven't witnessed boys do much that deserved defending. Instead, you find yourself agreeing with her. \"I think he's just jealous. None of the girls in my family like playing with him and that makes him mad.\" You smile, finding yourself enjoying making fun of your cousin after all the trouble he's caused you the last couple days. \"I'm Lucy, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark haired girl returned your smile. \"I'm Ellen.\" She pointed to her red-haired friend. \"And this is Keira.\" Keira waved at you as Ellen introduced the other four. \"And Jennifer, Liz, Becky, and Tammy.\" You smile at each of them, though you remember that this group of girls are the girly girls of your class. Obsessed with princesses, pink, and ballet, and everything your sister Hannah loves. You saw them playing a game where they pretended to be fairies during recess yesterday. They seemed nice enough, but perhaps you should be wary of them. You didn't want to end up as one of them, although the little girl inside you was eager to talk with them more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like your dress. It's really pretty,\" Becky added, pointing toward your purple floral print dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush in response, and instinctively swish your dress shyly. \"Thanks. I don't usually wear stuff like this. My mom picked it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy giggled. \"Right. You're a tomboy, aren't you? You should wear dresses more often. You look great in one.\" You blush deeper, unsure how to respond, but enjoying the compliments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen smiled. \"Well, we were going to play together before the bell rings. Would you like to join us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate. The little girl inside is eager to make friends, but the teenage boy inside you is scared to hang with what he would have called girly girls.

Not only it was a sign of you becoming increasingly more like a little girl, it also would cause problems with magic. You didn't want to be a normal girl, your powers taken away. Looking around, you saw little in the way of options. Climbing was out; all the girls, yourself included were in skirts or dresses, and these girls weren't the type anyway. You certainly didn't want to run around playing 'fairy' or something like that. Though maybe you could appeal to their sporting nature, small as it might be. They did do ballet after all....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any ideas?

Sure, you still \"learnt\" everything as soon as it was taught, but Ellen and her friends continued talking to you and including you throughout the morning, which much to your surprise, made things considerable less boring. Keira and Tammy turned out to be strong readers like you, and the three of you actually enjoyed reading to each other during quiet reading time. You ate snack with them and discovered Tammy and Jennifer were two of the funniest girls you had ever met. Becky and Ellen were super kind and helped you clean up when you accidentally spilled your juice. You played a math game with Liz and Becky, which was much more enjoyable thanks to the company. You were rediscovering a truth about school, it was much more bearable when you had friends and by the time recess rolled around, you had trouble not thinking about these girls as friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result, when your class poured onto the recess playground, you joined Ellen and her friends without hesitation. Sure, they were the girly crowd, but they were still fun to be with, and you told yourself you would be able to resist anything too girly that they suggested. As the girls settle down on a bench, Liz was asking you questions about yourself. \"Your big sister Hannah is in the same ballet class I'm in. How come I never see you there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were able to restrain yourself from remarking that ballet is for girls, not because you didn't believe that, but you knew that in context it would only result in confused looks. Instead, you shrugged. \"I don't know. Just always seemed kind of boring to me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz looked aghast, though not insulted. Ellen giggled, on the other hand, giggled. \"Yeah, I have always thought the same thing. I don't do ballet either.\" Now it was your turn to look surprised. You had just kind of assumed that since these girls dressed a certain way and avoided playing with the boys that they must like ballet, but you realized that was probably unfair of you. You soon discovered that Jennifer didn't like ballet either. Tammy, Becky, and Keira all took ballet together as well, but Becky only did it because her parents wanted her to have some physical activity after school and Tammy only did it because her older brother was obsessed with ballet and it was just easier for her parents to have their children do the same activities after school. Tammy was slightly envious your parents were making you do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess there is more than one way to be a girl,\" you said to yourself, a little louder than you had intended. The full group of six looked at you like you were crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, duh,\" Keira responded in surprise. \"Why would you think there is only one way to be a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed deeply, realizing your mistake. Of course, considering how different your sisters were, you should have known better than to say something like that in the first place. You quickly think of a cover. \"Oh, Hannah told me all girls do ballet. I guess she's just trying to get me to be more like her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis answer seemed sufficient, as you noticed a few of the girls nodding in understanding. The ones who had older siblings you guessed. Liz smiled at you. \"Well, I hope you try ballet sometime. It'd be nice to have a friend join my class. All the others take ballet at a different studio.\" You found yourself smiling back. You had no plans to join a ballet class, but buried in Liz's comment, she said something that touched you. She called you a friend, and hearing her say that meant more to you than you realized. Liz seemed like the quietest and shyest of the six girls, but she was taking a really liking to you and you found yourself really liking her too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew what you were doing you pulled her into a hug. Stupid little girl impulses, you thought to yourself. But the hug was actually kind of nice. \"You're so sweet, Liz,\" you found yourself saying. Liz smiled back<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you hugged Liz, you blushed at the others, embarrassed by your display of friendship. \"So...umm...do you all want to play something?\" you asked, trying to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen shrugged. \"We could. We also like to sit around and talk sometimes. But since you are our new friend, why don't you choose?\" Hearing Ellen call you a friend too made you smile again.</span></div></div>",

The others ether giggled or grinned at Tim's unflattering discription.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as bad. Other than the names, a couple of weeks ago, he put worms onto my sisters' hair\" you said truthfully. You didn't want to add in that he had different taunts for you, pre-transformation. Assuming you didn't scare him with your usage of magic, he'd be a bigger pest towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eww. Thats gross\" Ellen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but why are we even talking about him?\" you demanded.

There's no school tomorrow cause of parent-teacher conferences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned internally. The last thing you needed was your mom talking to your new teacher and learning all about how you were adjusting to your new class. Plus, a sleepover with a little girl sounded like the opposite of maintaining your male identity. Still, Liz's face looked so hopeful and you couldn't say no to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure,\" you say hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz looked like you just told her she was going to Disney World. \"Oh, that's awesome, Lucy. We're going to have so much fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of day wasn't so bad. You got to hang out more with your new friends and they helped you keep away from Tim when you walked down the halls and during lunch. Hanging with the girls made you feel better about your own problems. You even found yourself thinking that staying a six year old girl wouldn't be the worst thing in the world at one point, though you quickly tried to banish that thought from your mind. You managed to get a message to Mom through Hayley that you wanted to sleepover at Liz's house. Mom thought it was a great idea and made arraignments for Haley to bring you a bag of sleepover supplies, toothbrush and night clothes and such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty soon the day was over, and you found yourself sitting with Liz on the school steps waiting for her mom to pick you two up. She was running a bit late, so you were the only to left. Liz looked apologetic. \"Sorry, I should have mentioned my mom's usually late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" you assured her, but you were honestly a little worried Tim was hanging around waiting to jump out at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want to do when we get to my house anyway? We could watch TV, play board games, or I have legos...\" That all sounded pretty normal and not super girly. You could use a night like that. Getting away from Tim and your sisters. You could just relax with your new friend. Of course, the next thing she said floored you. \"Or we could talk about witch stuff...\" Liz said this very casually, as if it were the most normal thing in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head whipped toward her and your mouth went wide open in surprise. \"Wait, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz looked at you confused, but then, something occurred to her. \"You...didn't know I'm from a witch family? But my last name is Belacourt. Haven't you heard of the Belacourt witch family?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. \"No, I didn't and I haven't. I don't really know any of the witch families.\" Of course, you couldn't escape it. You had about a million questions for her, but didn't know where to start. \"Are the other girls from Witch families too?\" Ellen had led the charge against Timmy earlier that day. You suddenly wondered if she had an ulterior motive for standing up for you. However, Liz's answer reassured you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just me. I'm actually really excited to have a friend I can talk to about that stuff with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, but fired off another bunch of questions. \"Do you know about me? Have you always been a little girl? Your family isn't evil like the some witches, right? Do you have powers yet? Can you turn me back into a boy?\" You noticed her face looked overwhelmed. \"Sorry. That was a lot of questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, but answered as best she could. \"It's okay. I thought you knew all this and just weren't talking about it in front of the others. Well...ummm...yeah, I know about you having been a teenage boy before, and I've always been this age. Or at least, I have been ever since my birthday. You know what I mean. You couldn't change me with magic if you wanted to anyway. My dad's side of the family is super immune to magic, so I got that too.\" You nodded and she continued. \"My family isn't bad or anything like the Banes. My mom is a witch librarian. She collect magic books and stuff and researches spells. She helps other witches find stuff in books. We're witches too, but we don't have very strong magic. We can't turn people into boys and stuff. The most my mom can do is move objects around and change people's hair color and I haven't started learning or anything.\" She paused before turning a question back at you. \"Do you really hate being a little girl that much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew you had to tread carefully, not wanting to hurt Liz's feeling. You made sure to answer honestly though. \"I miss my old friends and the stuff I used to be able to do. This is all so different.\" You smiled. \"But I like hanging out with you and the other girls. You girls are really fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz smiled back. \"I like being with you too.\" She paused for a minute. \"How come Tim is mad at you anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \"You know how Stephanie and Rachel used to be Steve and Rick?\" Liz nodded. \"I'm the one who turned them into girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz started giggling. \"That was you? That was so funny. They've been chasing Tim around and he's so scared of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and then started giggling too. \"I guess it was kind of funny. And it did serve all them right. It was a karma spell or something. But I didn't mean to do it, and I don't want them trapped like that, and I've been trying to find a way to turn them back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded. \"Maybe my mom can help you. She helps all sorts of witches find spells they need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, maybe...\" You don't feel super excited by the idea. Yes, you wanted to turn Steve and Rick back, but you had actually been looking forward to just having a normal, non-magic, sister-free sleepover, even if it involved little girls. Witch stuff always got so complicated. As Liz's mom's car pulled around the corner, you made a decision.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"We're doing ballet?\" you asked, trying not to sound so displeased by the idea you insulted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz looked at you confused and then looked back at the leotards, and then giggled. \"No, you didn't seem excited about ballet at recess, so I wouldn't make you do it. I just thought we could play in the back yard while the sun is still up. I like playing in leotards cause it's easy to practice cartwheels and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" You felt embarrassed that you immediately assumed she was trying to dress you up. \"So the second one...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was trying to decide whether to wear the plain leotard or the one with writing.\" She held up the two leotards. Indeed one leotard was plain pink, while the other had 'Ballet Princess' written across it in sparkly writing and frilly shoulders poofs. The tights also had subtle differences. \"The ballet princess one I just wear for fun. They want you to wear plain-color ones in my ballet class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \"Sorry. My sisters and mom keep trying to get me to dress up. Seems like everyone is trying to tell me who to be.\" Your mind flashed to Elena and Tim, both of whom had different designs of what your fate in life should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded. \"I won't do that. That's not what friends do.\" You smiled. \"I mean if you do want to borrow one of my leotards you can, but I figured you'd rather wear shorts or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a look at your suitcase, sitting in a corner of her room. A pessimistic part of you guessed that within there lay no shorts. \"Do you have shorts I could borrow?\" Liz nodded and went into her closet to find some, but you quickly changed your mind. If Liz wasn't trying to force anything upon you, that meant her house was a safe space where you could feel free to experiment a bit, and you were admittedly curious about how being in a leotard would affect your range of movement. \"Actually, maybe I will borrow a leotard. But do you have a different color?\" A leotard was an experiment enough. You didn't need to add the pink in too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. I wore my black one to ballet yesterday, so it needs to be washed, and my blue one has a rip in it.\" She looked apologetic. \"I have a purple one,\" she added helpfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPink or purple didn't seem like much off a choice. \"I'll take the pink one.\" Liz handed you the plainer of the two pink leotards, correctly assuming you didn't want to be identified as a ballet princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can use my bathroom to change if you want,\" Liz offered as she got ready to get changed. She stopped when she noticed you weren't moving. \"Ummm...is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed. \"I...um...don't actually know how to put all this stuff on. I've worn this kind of stuff before, but only because my sister put it on me with magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz giggled. \"Sorry. Let me get my mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later, you and Liz were dressed in your leotards in the backyard, ready to play. Mrs. Belacourt had helped dress you, showing you along the way how to do it yourself. She was very kind about the whole ordeal, recognizing that learning how to put on a leotard and tights was a little overwhelming for a first-timer. She didn't even get upset when you realized you had to use the bathroom after putting it on, and she had to take the whole ensemble off, then on again. Despite the way, you two met, she seemed like a really sweet lady, who was only worried before that you were using her daughter as a way to get out of your predicament. Now, you appreciated her kindness and she seemed to think you were very polite and sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's it feel?\" Liz asked as she cartwheeled past you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed as you plucked the side of your leotard. \"I actually kind of like it. Feels smooth and it's easy to move around in.\" You never would have admitted that to Mel or Hannah or your Mom. Maybe not even Hayley. You didn't really get to enjoy the leotard last time, because you were mad Mel forced you into it, but here you were free to just let go of that frustration and enjoy yourself. \"It was a real pain getting it on, but now that's it's on it's really comfy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz grinned as she came back next to you. \"I'm glad you like it.\" She then practiced doing a split on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do gymnastics?\" you asked as you poked at the ballet bun Mrs. Belacourt had tied on the back of your head to keep your hair out of your face as you played. It felt strange, but not bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded. \"Yeah, gymnastics and flute once a week. Ballet twice a week.\" She smiled up at you. \"So what do you want to play? I've got a frisbee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't answer at first, as you watched Liz doing the split. Megan used to take gymnastics as well and she had tried to teach you how to do a split like that when you were a boy. You were never able to do it. You weren't great at cartwheels either. Maybe you could learn to do them now. Or maybe this was a chance to see what ballet was like without your sisters or Tim there to give you grief about it. You liked the leotard, maybe you could see what else you liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" you blushed deep red as you talked. \"Maybe you could teach me some...</span></div></div>",

Besides...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy, you're looking secretive\" Liz said, interupting as she saw a slight smile forming on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..I can use it to fight.

Handstands, or cartwheels?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cartwheels\" you said, as Liz did a flip. It was't perfect, but it was decent enough. You paused, tried one.. and overbalanced. Falling onto your shoulder, you gave Liz an annoyed look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fall all the time. Try again\" Liz urged. You nodded, and tried again. After thirty minutes, you had improved slightly, but was still mostly falling. Still, it was enjoyable. \"Liking it, Lucy?\" You nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We better get inside.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of the evening went well. You and Liz watched Aladdin, and the two of you ended up singing and dancing around to the songs. You met Mr. Belacourt when he came home from work. He was a quiet, but sweet man, who was happy to see that his daughter had made a new friend who seemed so comfortable with. It turned out Mr. Belacourt was a great cook too, making you some the most delicious mac and cheese you had ever had. After dinner, the two of you finally got changed out of your leotards and into your nightclothes. Mom had packed your a powder blue nightgown with lace trim, which wasn't the worst thing you could have worn, you supposed. After that you and Liz stayed up for another hour just talking about anything you could thing of: friends at school, favorite movies, witchcraft, whatever. Eventually, it was time for sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you fell asleep, Liz turned toward and said with a smile and a yawn, \"I'm really glad you came tonight Lucy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and smiled. \"Me too. If I'm going to be a girl, I'm glad I have a friend like you.\" You paused. \"Please never tell my sisters I wore the leotard.\" You looked at Liz only to see she was already asleep. You weren't sure how much of what you said she heard. You smiled and stared up at the ceiling, thinking about what a good day it had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround eleven, just before she went to bed, Mrs. Belacourt peeked into Liz's room to check on the two of you. She found Liz fast asleep in her bed, but you were in a nearby armchair, producing a green flame in your hand. You stared at the flame transfixed, watching the fire dance. Mrs. Belacourt frowned and approached you. You noticed her and blushed, but didn't put the flame out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing, Lucy?\" You had expected her to annoyed at you for being awake or for using magic unsupervised, but her voice was kind. She seemed concerned, not mad, and you felt like you could confide in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I couldn't sleep, so I was just practicing making a flame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Belacourt smiled. \"Well, that much I can see, but why?\" She noticed you glance over at Liz. \"Don't worry about waking her. She can sleep through anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded in understanding and shared what was on your mind. \"Well, I really had fun today, you know? Liz is so nice and I really like being with her. I could just have fun without worrying about what my sisters or stupid Tim might say about me or tell me who to be. Turning into a girl has been really hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Belacourt nodded. \"I would certainly think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued. \"But since I had so much fun today, I thought maybe it would be easier if I just enjoyed being a girl and wasn't thinking all the time about the fact that I used to be a stupid boy.\" You looked back at the flame. \"And my mom said, the more I use magic, the more I'll start to think like a girl, so I thought...\" You stopped there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You thought you'd get rid of all those boy feelings that are making you frustrated.\" You nodded, feeling embarrassed. Mrs. Belacourt stroked your hair. \"Oh, sweetie. It's okay.\" She collected her thoughts, deciding how to approach this. \"Feel any girlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. \"Not really.\" You sighed and let the flame go out, giving up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Belacourt smiled. \"I wouldn't think so. Lucy, I've done a lot of research on witch boys who become girls, and while a lot of people do think that simply using any kind of magic will make a more...feminine frame of mind take hold, I don't believe that is the case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't?\" You were sure how you felt about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Magic responds to the wishes we have. So I believe a lot of witch boys unknowingly used magic to change their minds into something more suited to their new form. It was a subconscious wish, and if a transformed boy wished to be more like a girl, their magic would make it so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took the information in. \"So why's it not working for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you don't really want that. You seem like a very free-thinking and thoughtful kid, Lucy. I don't think you want to just magically think like a girl. I think you want to discover who you are as a girl, without the help of magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...guess that makes sense,\" you decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \"So tell me...what have you found out about yourself today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about it and began to make a list. \"Well, I like wearing leotards. There are girls at school I like talking to. Liz is really fun and a good friend. And I want to get good at gymnastics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Belacourt ruffled your hair. \"Now that sounds like a lot of great stuff you learned about yourself, don't you think? And that will help you going forward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at this realization. \"I guess that is pretty sweet. And I can always learn more about myself tomorrow.\" You felt so much better. \"Now if I could just get my sisters to stop bothering me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Belacourt chuckled at that last comment. \"Believe me, Lucy. I had 4 sisters myself. They never stop bothering you, especially when you're the youngest. But you love them anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's true.\" You yawned, finally starting to feel sleepy. \"Thanks, Mrs. Belacourt. That really helped. Liz is really lucky to have a mom like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Belacourt picked you up and placed you in the bed. \"That's sweet of you, dear. And your mother is very lucky to have a kind, thoughtful daughter like you.\" She pulled the covers over you, tucking you in. Almost immediately, you fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

Has she had her usual nightmares?\" mom said, frowning slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a way as her boy side is conflicting poorly with her growing girlish side, but she seems to be coping better than most\" Clara Belacourt said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it. I wish the sleepover here was going better\" mom said crossly,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened? Oh, I see. The one that transformed with your daughter, but remained a teen. You've got her over? Still, you have one advantage over me; you call magically put them to sleep if you wished\" Clara said. Clara knew her magical abilities were more suited to theory than any practical magic, which lead to many dismissing her as a glorified libarian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. With Lucy having a sleepover, her former twin decided to have one of her own, and with eight teen girls in the house, eventually they decided that 'Mel's and Megan's tomboy friend' needed an urgent makeover.  The poor girl has it bad with talk about boys as it is, but the dress the girls but her in really makes Christina look like a princess\" mom said, as she stared at Christina's sleeping form. Christina's rosewood colored hair was slightly curled and loose, flowing to the back of her pink gown. Despite having slightly puffed sleeves, Christina's shoulders were bare, though her arms were covered by pink gloves that perfectly matched the dress. A green and silver pendant that matched Christina's eyes dangled from her neck, along with matching earrings. \"I did what I could, but with so many non witches and non awaresin the house, I couldn't really act. Melanie is the problem. Her method of 'helping' is not doing Christina or her sister any favors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can guess. I'm not surprised Lucy was initially embarrassed to be dressed in a pink leotard, though both girls enjoyed themselves\" Clara said<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I will see you tomorrow. Have a good night, Natalie.\" And with that, the two hung up the phones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, you woke up a bit late. Mrs. Belacourt had let you sleep since you were up so late. It was nice, but it felt a little weird waking up in Liz's room without Liz there. It looked like she had gotten up already. You stretched and gave a quick good morning squeeze to Mr. Fuzz, who Mom had known to send alone in your suitcase of overnight things. You were glad, as sleeping with him did make you feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHungry and curious to see where Liz had gotten to, you jumped out of bed and took a look in your suitcase for new clothes. \"Okay, experiment time,\" you said to yourself. \"Let's see if I like anything.\" Mom had only packed dresses, but that was alright. You settled on a green floral print dress, girly, but casual, and paired it with a red hoodie Mom had packed in case you got cold. Checking yourself out in the mirror, you smiled. You looked okay. You were getting better at this. Maybe you could get Mom to take you shopping. Then, you'd at least get some say in the clothes you wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you descended the stairs, the smell of waffles caught your nose, making you hurry a little quicker to the kitchen area. Mr. Belacourt was there making waffles as Liz watched eagerly. Liz, also dressed, smiled when she saw you. \"Hey, Lucy. I'm glad you are up. I was worried you were going to sleep all morning. But Mom said not to bother you cause you got to sleep so late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed and noticed Mrs. Belacourt reading a book at a nearby table. \"Thanks, Mrs. Belacourt.\" She smiled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you nervous about being in a different house?\" Liz asked. \"I bet that's scary. Becky tried to sleep over a couple weeks ago, but she had to have her mom pick her up, and I've never tried sleeping at someone else's house before. It must be weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded as you climbed up on the stoop next to her. \"I guess so. I used to sleep at other people's houses all the time when I was a boy, but I used to be able to sleep without Mr. Fuzz when I was a boy too, so I guess I feel more nervous than I used to. But your mom was really nice and helped me get to sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Belacourt plopped two plates full of waffles covered in powdered sugar and maple syrup in front of you and LIz. It look delicious. \"That sounds like my wife. She helps me sleep all the time too.\" He smiled over at his wife, who returned the smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is the plan for the day?\" you asked Liz's parents as you took a bite of the delicious waffles. \"Is my Mom coming to pick me up soon or do Liz and I have more time to play?\" Hanging with Liz was your main desire at the moment, and you weren't ready to face your sisters again quite yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's going to take you home after Liz and Hannah's ballet class,\" Mrs. Belacourt informed you. You heart skipped a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ballet? You two have ballet today?\" You remembered it was Friday and that was indeed one of the days Hannah had ballet, and since Liz was in the same class, it made sense, but you still didn't feel like you wanted to suffer through a ballet class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. You don't have to join in,\" Mrs. Belacourt reassured you. \"It was just the most convenient time for both of us to hand you back over and we figured it would give you and Liz plenty of time to play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I guess that's okay then,\" you responded hesitantly. It still meant sitting through ballet, but it sounded unavoidable, plus more time with Liz felt like a pretty good trade-off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz suddenly got excited and pushed her waffles aside for a moment. \"Guess what?\" she asked with a smile. \"I made you something this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her curiously. \"What did you make?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a huge grin, she held out a small bracelet decorated in rainbow colors. \"I made you a friendship bracelet. I know we haven't been friends long, but I really had fun yesterday. I just wanted to you to have a reminder of all the fun we had together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took the bracelet from her and looked at it closely. \"Thanks, Liz. I wish I could make one for you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have all the materials you need. I could teach you how after breakfast,\" she offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put the bracelet on and smiled at your newfound friend. \"Sounds like fun. I'll try to make you a good one. But first, more waffles.\" You continued to happily consume your waffles.</span></div></div>",

Only as she was about to explain the first step, you felt a cold chill just before you found yourself somewhere dark.

The girl in front was fairly attractive with an average build, shoulder length red hair and hazel eyes. The girls behind her were too out of focus for you to see clearly and you guessed there was a reason for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, you were not teleported anywhere.\" Smiling, the girl said. \"I am Cassy Bane, leader of this small coven and we would like to extend an offer to join us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to be a part of your coven?\" Worried, you asked. \"I...

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You told the whole story to Mrs. Belacourt and Liz, sparing no detail. Though maybe you should have. Liz looked a little freaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Belacourt nodded. \"They've noticed your power. This isn't going to start to happen I'm afraid. As you grow stronger, witches are going to want you to be part of their coven to grow they're own power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz looked at her mother. \"Didn't you say to stay away from Cassie Bane though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassie Bane is not someone you want to associate with. She enjoys using her magic to tease and embarrass others. You can't really what she says either. It's a well-known secret that she likes to keep her non-magic brother trapped as a little girl. If she heard about what you did to Steve and Rick, I would wager that she is more interested in teaching you how to keep their forms locked as girls.\" Mrs. Belacourt sighed. She had been hoping her daughter's weak magic potential would keep her save from this world, but she didn't regret letting you be her friend. It would just cause complications.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked surprised. \"Wait, locked? You mean Steve and Rick aren't trapped as girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Belacourt hadn't realized you weren't aware of that part. \"Karma spells are only temporary. They'll probably turn back in the next day or two. I guess you're mother wanted you to work on fixing it yourself though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. Your mother had to stop keeping things from you. Though, she was right. Even if the spell was temporary, you needed to take responsibility. \"Yeah, I still want to change them back myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Belacourt smiled. \"I'm glad to hear you say that. You're really are turning into a responsible little witch.\" You blushed, enjoying hearing yourself described as a witch. \"Liz had told me this morning about Rick and Steve and I've actually been doing a little research to find a spell that should help you fix them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes brightened. \"Really? That's great. Though Mom sort of wanted me to find the answer myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Part of finding the answer is making use of your resources. Since I'm a witch librarian, asking me for help is perfectly fair. This is what I do.\" Mrs. Belacourt stood up. \"Give me a few minutes. I need to gather a few supplies and call your Mom to let her know about Cassie. Why don't you two work on your bracelets in the meantime.\" With that she left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Liz set to work, though she looked a little worried. Eventually, you asked her how she was. \"You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just worried. Cassie Bane scares me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put the final touches on the friendship bracelet you were making for her. \"Don't worry. I'm not going to join up with her and I won't let her hurt you either.\" You felt sure of that. You had met way scarier witches after all, but you didn't tell Liz that part. No sense in scaring her more. Either way, you felt sure that your friendship with girls like Liz would keep you walking the path of good magic. You smiled as you handed her the completed bracelet. \"This bracelet is my promise to you, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and admired the bracelet. \"You're pretty good at this. How about we make some for Ellen and the others too? I'm sure they'd love these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned, happy to see your friend in better spirits. \"Sounds like fun. Let's do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in her house, Cassie Bane frowned as she thought about her encounter with you. A blonde hair girl, about her age, sat on her bed, waiting for Cassie to say something. Finally, the blonde girl spoke instead. \"How do you think it went? Think she'll go for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie sighed and shook her head. \"I think we got to her too late. She's making friends on her own and after her encounter with Elena Kruse, I doubt she'll be so easy to trust strange witches. She'll probably tell her mom what happened. Not that Natalie Harrison can do much. We were just talking, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde nodded. \"So we move on to the next two candidates?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that sleepover at the Harrison house provided the perfect opportunity for us to get plenty of information on them. Mel can be easily manipulated, and she's got a bit of a bad girl streak. She enjoys girlying up her former brother as much as I enjoy doing the same to mine. And Christina is lost and confused. She's having trouble adjusting to her new form, and her best friend has basically moved on, making new friends, like the Belacourt girl, without her. We can use that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde rolled her eyes. \"What Lucy sees in that low-magic family is beyond me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie laughed. \"If that's who she chooses to be friends with, we don't need her anyway. Come on, let's work on the others.\"</span></div></div>",

Mel said defensively before mom cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was your business, and you have to deal with the consequences, but what has really made me angry is you telling Megan about Christina! Then giving her a full makeover anyway!\" mom snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs H...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm thankful that only you heard, and I don't have to deal with seven.

She was now in overalls, a white t-shirt, and looking her usual tomboy self. The girls were dressed as princesses, with Megan as Belle, and Mel as Cinderella.

She had just been joking around with Christina. There had been no need for everyone to freak. The girl was definitely becoming a teenager, and her defiant, rebellious streak was kicking in. She didn't like being cut down by her mom. Suddenly, she heard a noise, a tapping at her window. She looked over to see the face of Cassie Bane at the window, looking to be let in. Mel bit the bottom of her lip and considered getting Mom, but she decided against it. No harm in seeing what she had to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel locked the door to her room, then went to open the window, allowing Cassie to hop in. \"How'd you get up here anyway?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie smirked. \"I'm not just a skilled witch, but an excellent tree climber. Easy enough to get to your bedroom window. I figured your mom would be on the look out for magic, so the low-tech way seemed the best way to talk to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel nodded, unsure about letting Cassie in, but curious about what she had to say. \"Well, my mom is doing the dishes downstairs, but she's coming up soon to help Lucy with a project. So let's keep this quiet. Anyone of my sisters could be walking by too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll make this simple then. I'm recruiting for my coven and I think you'd be a good fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right. It's not like you've ever said two words to me before,\" Mel pointed out. \"You don't want me. You want Lucy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie shook her head. \"I thought I did. That girl's power is really something, but she doesn't seem fun at all. Not like you. And you have just as much potential. I really admired what you did to Ms. Rich last night. Reminded me of games I play with my brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel looked shocked. \"How'd you know about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got friends everywhere. You could to. We could show you how much fun magic can be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel considered this for a second. It was really tempting. She was sick of being told what to do with her magic all the time. She was a blossoming witch, and she wanted to explore and experiment with her magic. \"My mom would kill me if she found out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First thing I'll teach you is how to cover your tracks. Mom never needs to know. And if she does, so what? No law against joining a coven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel nodded. \"What do I have to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie grinned. \"Swing by my house tomorrow. I'll introduce you to some of the girls.\" And with that she slipped out the window again. Mel watched her sneak back to the street and disappear into the night. Mel smiled, eager to have the opportunity to practice magic without Mom looking over her shoulder. She shut the window and returned to her bed, thinking happily about what tomorrow would bring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat in the middle of your room, dressed in a nightgown, magic book open before you. You nervously made sure you had all the proper ingredients you needed for the spell. You looked up at your mom who was staring at the wall. \"Everything okay, Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom turned her attention back to you and smiled. \"Just thought I heard something, but I think it was just Mel closing a window.\" She sat down next to you. \"I'm excited to see you cast your first real spell. Thank you for waiting to do this until I could be with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed as your mom got all mushy. She had asked you to wait to try the spell Mrs. Belacourt found to turn Tim's friends back into boys again and now was your first chance to actually try it. \"I've done magic before, Mom,\" you reminded her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was impulsive magic, responding to your strong emotions. This is something different. My daughter's first spell.\" She beamed proudly, embarrassing what remaining teenage pride you had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to chant, summoning flame and focusing it in a small bowl you had placed before you. You then picked up pictures of Rachel and Stephanie taken from a school yearbook and tossed them in the flame. \"The punishment done. Return daughter to son.\" The flame glowed purple and then went out. You tilted your head and looked at your mother. \"Is that it? Did it work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"I think so.\" She pulled out the pictures, which had not been burnt. They now showed Rick and Steve instead of the girls. \"I can have Hannah call them tomorrow to make sure. She can pretend to be asking about homework since she's in their class.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took the pictures of the two boys from her and marveled at them. \"That is sooooooo cool. Magic is awesome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled at you. \"Sounds like you are beginning to enjoy yourself, Lucy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged. \"I've been having more fun, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It shows. Your teacher was very pleased that you were making more friends yesterday.\" You blushed suddenly remembering the parent-teacher conference, but Mom quickly reassured you. \"Don't worry. She said only nice things.\" You sighed in relief. \"Come on. Let's get you to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and stood. In a minute, Mom was tucking you in. You went deep into thought for a moment and looked at her. \"Hey, Mom. Can you take me shopping tomorrow? I want to get some of my own clothes.\" You had been mostly using hand-me-downs from your sister since you had transformed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom looked surprised. \"Six-year olds usually let their mothers handle to clothes buying. Plus, there's the no tomboy rule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. But hanging with Liz and the others got me wanting to experiment a bit. I'm learning there are many ways to be a girl. If I'm going to be a girl, I want to find my own way to be one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded and brushed your hair. \"I understand. I'm so proud of you, sweetie. I'll take you to the mall tomorrow. Just you and me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled. \"Sounds great, Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood to turn out the light. \"Let me know if you get any more offers to join covens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled. \"I'm not joining any coven. I'm going to start my own someday. And it will be way better than Cassie's coven. Just you watch.\" And with that, Mom turned out the lights and you fell asleep, Mr. Fuzz cradled in your arms.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day was Saturday. Mel got dressed in something nice but casual. She wanted to impress Cassie and whoever else was in the coven. She nervously got a bag together and head down stairs. As she reached the bottom floor, she could hear giggling and the television. It sounded like you and Hannah were were watching something. She poked her head into the living room. Indeed some cartoon show with pastel ponies was on the screen, with you and Hannah sitting in your nightgowns, watching transfixed. Neither of you seemed to notice Mel. Mel couldn't remember the name of the show you two were watching, something with Ponies in the title, but she had always been a girl who liked to feel older than she was. Cartoons hadn't been her thing since she was 4. She recognized it as one of Hannah's favorites though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another fit of giggles, you turned to Hannah and smiled. \"You were right, Hannah. This show is hilarious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See,\" Hannah said triumphantly. \"Just cause a show is for girls doesn't mean it's bad. I bet you would have even liked it as a boy, if you hadn't been so afraid to do anything I liked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed, realizing you had been pretty gender stereotypical back then. You felt a bit of guilt. \"Yeah, I guess you are right.\" You paused. \"I still think ballet is kind of boring though.\" Watching Hannah and Liz's class yesterday hadn't changed your mind on that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah smirked, and started tickling you, causing you to burst out laughing. \"Oh yeah, little sis. I bet you'll be joining us soon enough. You'll be such a pretty ballerina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begged Hannah to stop between laughter. She was enjoying the big sister role a bit too much for your taste, but the two of you had been getting on better than you ever had, and that was nice for both of you. \"Hannah...come on...we're missing the show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel frowned at the sweetness of the scene before her. It was starting to annoy her that you were adjusting okay. Mom, Hayley, and Hannah seemed to completely adore the new you and Mom, in particular, was very proud of how responsible you were starting to be with your magic. Mel, on the other hand, felt like she could do no right. She also just started with her magic studies. Why wasn't anyone as proud of her? She felt a strong desire to knock you down a couple pegs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Mel. Where are you off to?\" Mel almost jumped. She hadn't realized Mom had come up behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, library. Got a history paper on the French Revolution due Monday.\" Mel wasn't lying. The paper was real, and she'd swing by the library before going to Cassie's. Mom was supposed to be a the mall most of the day with her new favorite daughter, so Mel would be able to come and go as she pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An interesting topic,\" Mom said. \"I look forward to talking to you about it later.\" She then turned to you and Hannah. \"Girls, eggs are ready. Come and get them while they are warm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww Mom. Do we have to now? Can't we wait until the shows over?\" It didn't matter if you were a 6-year-old girl or a 13-year-old boy. You always asked this, even with a DVD player and a DVR.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom rolled her eyes. \"No, you can record it. Come on. And I expect a little more appreciation for cooking you breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed as you hit the record button on the remote and got up, following your Mom and Hannah to the kitchen. \"Sorry, Mom. Thanks for making breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled and tussled your hair lovingly, which gave Mel a queazy feeling. To Mel, it felt like Mom was letting you off the hook. It wasn't fair how much easier she was on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom turned to Hannah. \"Oh, Hannah, were you able to call Rick and Steve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah nodded. \"Yeah, I called both their houses and asked what the homework was, and both of asked me why stupid girls couldn't keep the homework straight. It's like they share a brain.\" She turned to you. \"You should of left them as girls. I liked them way better that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged. \"Yeah, but that wouldn't have been the right thing to do. Not like they are witches or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom tussled your hair again. \"Well, I'm so proud of you, my responsible little witch.\" Though embarrassing, you couldn't help but smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel rolled her eyes, annoyed at you being Mom's goodie-two-shoes little daughter and the praise you was getting. This morning had only made her more convinced she needed to take Cassie up on her offer. She needed to join Cassie's coven. With that, Mel left without saying goodbye, which she was sure Mom would scold her about later.</span></div></div>",

Normally someone Hannah's age is not exposed to magic; look at her comments regarding Rick and Steve. Even if they're in jest, it shows her desire to 'improve' those boys. As for Mel, she must think I'm an idiot. Even though I personally hate the idea of covens, and use my magic alone -mostly-, I know what is happening.

Whether she does it before, after or during her trip to the library, I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would she do something so stupid?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"Melanie always had something of an ego, and recent events may have damaged it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May?\" you said, resisting the urge to giggle.

I'll just have to watch her carefully, and make sure to stop her before she does anything the Witch Council might frown upon.\" Mom sighed as she spoke. It pained her, but she believed she didn't have much of a choice. Mel was thirteen and desperate to make her own decisions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Mom concerned. \"You sure that's the best idea? Letting her learn from her mistakes?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head. \"With teenagers sometimes that is the only way.\" She smiled at you. \"Worked with you when you and Harry brought home those cigarettes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed deeply, not realizing Mom knew about that event. You and Harry had tried them and immediately decided never to try smoking again. It was awful. Seemed like a lifetime ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, to the mall.\" Mom started the card, as you considered that even if the car seat was embarrassing, maybe there was some upsides to not being a teen anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is cool,\" you remarked as you moved your hand over a shirt with a sequin unicorn design. As your hand flipped the sequins, the color of the unicorn changed. \"I want to get some of these ones with the color changing things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"They're called sequins. And if you like those, I guess I really don't have to worry about you disobeying the no tomboy rule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tilted your head in confusion. \"What do you mean? They have ones for boys too. Look over there.\" You pointed down the aisle toward the boys section of the clothing store you were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom followed your eyes and, sure enough, there were shirts for boys with sequin flip designs, including Star Wars, Lego Ninjago, and Pokemon characters. Mom made a puzzled expression. \"Boy's styles have changed since I was a kid. Boys you know actually wear those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Pi has a couple. So do a few boys in my class and I think I've even seen Rick wear one. They're pretty popular.\" You handed a couple of the girls sequin flip shirts to Mom, including the unicorn one and one with a cat with heart shaped eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom looked them over. Even if boys were wearing similar ones at school, she was surprised you were so willing to accept the ones with feminine designs on them. She considered asking you about it, but was worried it would cause a negative reaction. Of course, your next choice surprised her even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think of this dress, Mom?\" You held up a cream-colored dress that was a knit sweater on top, then turned into a layered tulle shirt on the bottom. It looked like it might work for both casual and formal occasions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's very pretty.\" That was all she could think to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, should I get some matching tights to go with this? Or would it look better in red? And are you scanning me to see if I'm under a spell?\" You had noticed Mom's hand glowing purple as you talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a rare occasion you saw your Mom get fluster. \"Well, yes, honey. This is just...more than I expected from you today. I mean, you told me you wanted to go shopping, but I didn't expect this.\" Her hand glowed again for a second. \"But you don't seem to be under any magical influence. So I'm just confused. Confused and surprised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned. \"I thought I told you last night, Mom. Hanging with Liz just got me thinking. Rather than being so negative about my change, I should experiment and see what I like. If I'm going to be Lucy, I want to know who Lucy is. What I like. Mrs. Belacourt helped me realize that too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded dumbfounded. Both you and Mrs. Belacourt had indicated this all before, but seeing it in action was a completely different matter. \"It's just the first time I'm really seeing it firsthand, I guess.\" She reached down and hugged you. \"I'm so proud of you.\" She paused and looked at the dress. \"I say get the red one and pair it with cream colored tights.\" You smiled and swapped the cream dress for the red one. \"You do seem much happier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel happier. And there is tons of stuff I want to try today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, such as?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, ready to blow Mom's mind again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a bit more shopping, including clothes, both causal and dressy, a swimsuit for the summer, and a couple of leotards, you and Mom found yourself at a kids salon in the mall, where you made a request you almost immediately regretted. You wanted to get your ears pierced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"#*@$!\" The pain had surprised you. You immediately shot an embarrassed and apologetic look up at Mom and the salon worker who was currently holding the piercing gun. The salon worker, an older woman whose name was Sally, looked particularly shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I didn't realize girls her age knew that kind of language,\" Sally finally said in surprise. You blushed deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head. \"She's spent a little too much time around 13-year old boys.\" Sally nodded in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Ma'am,\" you apologized. \"I didn't realize it was going to hurt that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still want the other one done?\" Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought for a second, then nodded. \"Yes, please. The girls at school will think I'm a chicken if I show up with just one earring.\" Mom chuckled as the reason you wanted your ears pierced became apparent. All your new friends had them. \"I'll try not to curse this time,\" you promised Sally, but it was a promise you would fail to live up too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes later, you and Mom walked out of the salon. Your ears still hurt, but not as badly as they did initially. And you had some ear studs to show for your endurance. Still, you were a little disappointed. \"We're not going to get my nails painted?\" You asked Mom, feeling a little disappointed. You did find yourself curious about what it was like to have sparkly nails. In fact, coupled with your new sequin interest and your choice of leotards, sparkles seemed to be a recurring theme with the new you. It felt nice to know you liked sparkly things in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head. \"Sorry, sweetie. Hannah has a lot of sparkly nail polish at home. I can do your nails myself there. I just had to get out of that salon. I felt like people kept judging me as the awful parent who lets her six-year-old daughter curse. It was a little embarrassing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"Yeah, sorry about that. I guess it was out of habit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom patted your head. \"I understand, sweetie. Just promise you won't do that in front of your friends. The last thing I need is other mothers getting on my case. And some mothers get very picky about who they let they're daughters play with. You don't want them to get the wrong impression of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou understood what she was saying. You were sure Liz's mom would understand, but you didn't know the moms of Ellen, Keira, or the other girls yet. You voiced your agreement, then braced yourself to ask Mom your final mall day request. It wasn't something you were sure she'd agree to. \"So you know how I've been studying the magic book?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes. You seem quite interested. It's very exciting, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's great, Mom, but there was a spell I found there that I wanted to try. A simple protection spell.\" You looked the friendship bracelet around your wrist. You wanted to enchant to ones you made for your friends, so they'd be safe if Cassie or Elena or anyone like that tried to get at you through them. Your friends didn't have to know about it either, well, except Liz, of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"That's a nice and easy one. Good beginner's spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I checked at home and we don't have the ingredients I would need, so...\" You eyes drifted across the mall toward Samantha Forrester's store. Mom followed your eyes and you could tell she recognized what you were requesting. \"I know you don't like Samantha, but I don't know of any other store that has magic stuff, and I figured you'd be with me to whole time we're in there, so you can make sure I'm safe. I won't even talk to her if that helps. Please, Mom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. You made a few good points, but she really wanted to avoid you being exposed to Samantha as much as possible. After a second, she made her decision.</span></div></div>",

You weren't aware Samantha had been saying that you might be a witch princess of some sort, whatever that meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, sweetie. We'll have to talk about it later.

Michelle didn't look pleased about the forced makeover she had received from her sister's new recruit, but she knew better than to say anything. The more obedient she was, the sooner the girls would let her go back to being Mike, or so Michelle believed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Mel said with a grin. \"I have to admit, I wasn't sure at first. Doing this seemed a bit mean, but it was really fun changing your brother into a little girl with my magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie smiled. Mel really was as impressionable as Cassie had expected. It wouldn't take much to make Mel a loyal member of her coven and an eager student of darker magic. \"That's what your mom doesn't want you to realize, Mel. Magic is our birthright and it gives us great power. It's silly not to use it for our own amusement. Worrying about the ethics of its effects on others is ridiculous. The world is our playground. We should use it that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel nodded, but Cassie could tell her new recruit wasn't entirely convinced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you sick of your Mom telling you what to do? Aren't you sick of your new sister's holier than thou attitude? Don't you wish they'd just leave you alone and let you do whatever you wanted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel smiled at the thought. \"That'd be pretty sweet. I'd love to dress up Lucy like this. Knock her down a few pegs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie giggled. \"I could teach you spells that would make that girl idolize and emulate you. Watch.\" She chanted something under her breath and sparks of purple magic flowed from her hand and into Michelle's mind. The young girl's eyes glazed over for a second, then she shook her head quickly, as if trying to clear her mind of a haze. Cassie patted her sister's head and asked, \"How we feeling, little sis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle looked up at her sister and grinned widely. \"Pretty great. Thanks for sending those nasty boy thoughts away. You're the best, Cassie.\" She hugged her big sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can go and play in the backyard for a bit. Mel and I will be out to play with you in a few minutes,\" Cassie told her sister. Michelle grinned and rushed downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel quickly turned to Cassie. \"Mind altering magic could get you in a lot of trouble with the Witch's Counsel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie grinned. \"Only if I get caught. My mom has friends on the Witch's Counsel anyway. They've swept stuff our family has down under the rug before. Anyway, mothers have permission to use that kind of magic on their children if they think its in the child's best interests. It's easy enough to say my mom just did all that to Michelle. Mom would cover for me anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel nodded, finding herself impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Join my coven and you get to benefit from my family's influence. Even if your mom disapproved, she wouldn't be able to stop you. You'd be a member of my coven and we'd be ones in charge of your magical education and exacting any disciplinary action upon you.\" Cassie grinned. \"Which we obviously wouldn't do if you were just using magic the way it was intended.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sounded like a dream come true to Mel, a chance to learn new magic and get her Mom off her back. \"I'm in. What do I do? Is there, like, a witch contract?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie shook her head and rolled up the sleeve on Mel's left shoulder. \"No, just a simple runic branding spell. It joins you to our group, but it only works if you want to join.\" She chanted something under her breath and a symbol appeared on Mel's shoulder. It looked like a tattoo of a runic symbol. Mel noticed that a matching one sat on Cassie's shoulder as well. The two tattoos glowed and Mel felt feelings of loyalty and sisterhood grow toward Cassie. \"Welcome to my coven, sister. We're going to have so much fun together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel smiled. \"Thank you. I can't wait to learn from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie grinned. \"That's the right attitude.\"</span></div></div>",

You had been so proud of the reversing the spell you have put on Rick and Steve that turning the two back into little girly girls sounded like the perfect way to bother you and cut at your confidence as a promising young witch. Plus, Tim would definitely blame you as well. \"Let's do it,\" she said eagerly. \"Lucy has been annoying me so much lately. If we can annoy her and my bratty girl-hating cousin all at once...well, that's just awesome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie smiled. \"This is going to be fun, Mel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at home, you were seated at the dining room table, a wood bowl placed before you with your friendship bracelet within. Hayley was sitting on the other side of the table watching you intently, while Hannah sat next to her bored. You were deep in thought, mixing all the ingredients you needed for the protection spell. Mom had been right. You were able to get everything you needed without relying on Samantha's store. Hayley had friends at Witchbloom who were quickly able to send over the magic items. Mom had gone off to Cassie's house to make sure Mel wasn't doing anything too stupid, so Hayley was left to oversee your spellcasting. Hannah, on the other hand, just wanted to get you to play with her and was annoyed she had to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a puff of purple sparkles as you finished the incantation, imbuing the bracelet with protection from malicious magic. \"There. That should work.\" You smiled as you placed the friendship bracelet back on your wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley smirked. \"I'll be the judge of that.\" Her hand glowed for a moment and you suddenly realized she was launching a spell right out you. You braced yourself for the impact, but after a moment nothing had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hayley!\" You shouted at her in protest. \"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hair loss curse,\" Hayley said non-chalantly. \"We needed to test that protection spell somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed your hair protectively. Boy or girl, you loved your hair and you didn't want to loss it. \"Don't curse my hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down. The protection spell clearly worked. You should be proud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned, but let yourself relax a bit. \"I guess, but you should have warned me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah sighed. \"I don't get it. What do you need protection from anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned toward your other sister. \"Witches keep wanting me for some reason. Elena, Samantha, Cassie. I just want to make sure they can't curse or mind control me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a good idea,\" Hayley agreed. \"It won't protect your from offensive magic, but it should protect your from curses. It will be hard to manipulate you with any kind of magic. These protection spells use the natural magical ability of the spellcaster to grant that protection. Since you have pretty strong magic, Lucy, it should offer you pretty strong protection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Hannah looked at each other not entirely sure what Hayley meant. You found this happening more often as you were becoming more used to your six-year-old form. It was harder to think like a 13-year-old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley sighed. \"It means this bracelet will a lot of bad magic, but not all magic.\" You and Hannah nodded, understanding that better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned as you pulled out the friendship bracelets you'd made for your new friends. \"Once I cast a protection spell on these, I can give them to my friends, and they'll be safer too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah groaned. \"Come on...you promised you'd play with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. \"Hannah, this is important.\" She made a hurt face, and you fell for it hard. \"Tell you what. Let me do this first and, then, I'll play anything you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah's immediate grin told you quickly that you may have made a poor decision. \"Anything?\" she asked excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou resigned yourself to your fate. \"Yeah, anything.\" This would be interesting.</span></div></div>",

Cautiously, she approached Michelle; there were no security based spells to block her approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you talk?\" mom asked as she stared at Michelle, who seemingly was happily playing tea party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle smiled and happily said, \"Wanna...\" It was far as she got.

It was a fairy costume Hannah had worn two years ago for Halloween. She had kept it for sentimental reasons. you guessed, but now it was a perfect fit for you. It was...girly to say the least, but at least it wasn't pink. It was a remnant of Hannah's rainbow phase, where she enjoyed wearing outfits of bright, neon colors. The costume consisted of a tutu dress with a white short sleeved top and rainbow colored tutu. Your legs were clad in white tights and rainbow leg warmers, and you wore sparkly silver slippers on your feet. Rainbow colored fingerless gloves were on your hands and your hair sported a frilly rainbow headband. Of course, the outfit was completed by rainbow-colored fairy wings and a sparkly wand with a rainbow poof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at your sister as she finished dressing you and a single defeated word left your lips. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah giggled. She was wearing a more traditional pink fairy gown. More flow-y, less poof-y. \"Well, your new friends pretend to be fairies at recess all the time. I thought this would help you learn how to play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged as the two of you descended the staircase and headed toward the backyard. \"What's there to learn? You just pretend to be fairies or whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but you promised to play any game I wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed and nodded. She wasn't wrong. \"Yeah, I guess I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's the outfit feel anyway?\" Hannah opened the door to the backyard for you and you stepped outside into the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around to make sure no one was in earshot. \"Promise you won't tell anyone?\" Hannah nodded. \"It's embarrassing, but I actually feel pretty comfy...and cute.\" You blushed deep read and Hannah giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stick with me, little sis. I'll show you how awesome being a girl is.\" She wrapped her arm around you and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe that's what I'm afraid of,\" you teased. \"So what is the game anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm a fairy princess and you are a girl who just discovered you're really a fairy too. I teach you how to be a fairy, and, together, we team up to fight off some nasty goblins who want to use fairy magic for evil.\" Hannah's scenario was intricate and creative, and disturbingly similar to real life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you smiled at the idea. \"Cool. I like fighting bad guys.\" Hannah grabbed your hand and soon the game began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were hesitant at first, but after about ten minutes, you really got into it. The pretend play was exciting and you got to move around a whole lot. Plus, Hannah had really good story ideas, which matched pretty well with what you had in mind. You didn't even get bother when Hayley came out and snapped a few pictures of the two of you playing together. Finally, after about 45 more minutes, the two of you had come to the climax of your adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did it, Rainbow Jewel. You stopped the goblin king!\" Hannah cheered, pulling you into a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou returned the hug and stepped back and curtsied to the fairy princess. \"Thank you, Princess Pinkwing. I wouldn't have been able to do it without you teaching me how to be the best fairy I can be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a voice came from behind you. \"What the hell is this?\" You whipped around, only to find Christina had appeared coming through the doors to your backyard. Hayley must have let her in. Your face twisted into a look of total horror and embarrassment. Christina was one of the last people you wanted seeing you actually having fun being a young girl. \"You seriously playing pretend, John? If I didn't know any better, I'd say you like what's happening to you.\" The use of your old boy name served its purpose, making you feel ashamed of what you were doing, even though you weren't sure why. You were having fun. Why should you feel bad about that? You weren't sure what to say, but you could tell this was going to get awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...</span></div></div>",

With a wave of her hand, the mark of Cassie's coven reappeared on her arm. She had simply covered it up with a glamour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice work.\" Cassie's voice echoed in Mel's head. \"I think your Mom actually bought it. She'll be more likely to let her guard down now, and we can operate without her getting in our way.\" Being part of Cassie's coven allowed the two girls to communicate telepathically. It was one mode of communication Mom couldn't track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll show her for underestimating me,\" Mel responded in her mind. \"What next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does your Mom know who we were targeting?\" Cassie asked.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mom shook her head in disgust. \"This book would have corrupted Cassie's magic. Any spell she used would have would have had unintended consequences that could have easily harmed those around her.\" The witch council would have blamed Cassie for it and Cassie could have gotten into a whole lot more trouble than she actually deserved. Samantha could be cruel when she wanted to be. Her mother's influence. Fortunately, it was coded to Cassie's magical signature, which meant the book's curse wouldn't affect any other witch, but Mom knew this was only the beginning. \"Those two are going to go to war,\" she said to herself. And of course, she had a feeling her family was going to be cleaning up the resulting mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you moved back into the living room and slumped back onto the couch. You were still wearing the fairy costume Hannah had dressed you in earlier. You hadn't felt like changing after your fight with Christina. It had been bad and you still felt very angry at your oldest friend. She had been such a jerk. Your mind drifted back as you recalled the argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours earlier, you had stood before Christina unsure what to say. Hannah, however, had spoken up to defend you. \"Maybe Lucy does enjoy being a girl now. What's wrong with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina had looked over at Hannah. \"Stay out of this, Hannah. Just cause you want John to act like a girl, doesn't mean he is one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping at your sister had angered you and you finally spoke up. \"Don't talk to Hannah like that. She didn't do anything wrong. And stop calling me John. That's not my name anymore, <i>Christina</i>.\" You said her name now pointedly and icily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina turned her attention back to you. Your comment had just made her more annoyed. \"Yes, it is. We're both boys and I'm not going to let you forget that. We're supposed to find a way out of this mess together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the one who got us turned into girls in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're blaming me for this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no. I know I probably would have gotten turned into a girl at some point anyway. I'm have magic and I want to use it. I'd hate to turn back into a boy and lose my powers. Besides, I'm having fun as a girl. What's so bad about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so bad is you aren't supposed to be one. You should be more upset about all this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat infuriated you. \"Just cause you want to be all miserable about being a girl doesn't mean I have to be. I'm sorry you're having trouble fitting in, but don't take it out on me. You chose to go back to being 13. You could have stayed 6 like me. I'm having fun this way, maybe you could too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DON'T WANT TO BE A GIRL LIKE YOU!!!!\" Christina shouted, surprising both you and Hannah. Her forcefulness brought the beginnings of tears to Hannah's eyes. You felt yourself getting really angry. Your magic beginning to flare up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out,\" you said trying to keep calm. \"Get out before I put a spell on you. And don't bother coming back if you can't be a good friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina snorted and turned around. \"Oh, don't worry about that, <i>John</i>. We're not friends anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine with me!\" You shouted, though, of course, it wasn't. You had hoped you and Christina could still be friends, but after this, that felt impossible. You watched her leave and felt your anger grow. Before you lost control of your magic though. Hannah wrapped her arms around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy, it's okay. It's over. She's gone. You can relax.\" Hannah's voice and hug had calmed you and you felt yourself gain back control. Though the pent up emotion started coming out as tears. Soon, you were sobbing and Hannah continued to comfort you. Soon, Hayley appeared, coming to check on what all the noise had been about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis argument had left you in a vulnerable state, doubting yourself, hence your mood and your fear that something else could go wrong. Everything had been going so great. You had wanted to tell Mom about the fight, but you didn't want to bother her when she was dealing with the Cassie thing. After a few minutes of reliving the argument, Hannah poked her head in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom says we got to get ready for bed. Want me to help you change out of that costume?\" She looked at you sympathetically. One side effect of the argument is that you two felt closer than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got up slowly, nodding. \"Yeah, Hannah. Thanks.\" You gave your sister a hug and followed her up the stairs, but you still looked sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah's mind race with ways to try and cheer you up. \"Wanna sleep in my room tonight? I got that second bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about it for a second, and as the idea started to appeal to you, a smile began to form. \"Yeah, that could be fun.\" It was funny. Hannah and you had never been this close before. You had always thought of her as kind of a brat, but the more time you spent with her, the more you realized she was one of the kindest people you knew. You gave her another hug. \"You make a really good big sister, Hannah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \"Thanks. And you make a really good little sister.\" You blushed, strangely proud to hear her say that. \"And you can keep that costume for yourself if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes brightened. You had grown to really like the rainbow fairy costume. \"You mean that? You're the best sister ever.\" You pulled her into another hug. You smiled. Christina was wrong. You may not have wanted to be a little girl originally, but you were growing to love being Lucy Harrison. You felt happy and you weren't going to let Christina take that away from you.</span></div></div>",

A change of mentality was necessary, especially after changing two boys with nothing more than a stray thought.\" Christina turned to her mom, startled to which she nodded. \"Yes, her mother changed her mentality to prevent that from happening again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, the person I knew is gone?\" Fighting tears, Christina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is John inside... when he was six years old; just with the mind set of a girl.\" Bemused, Sarah replied. \"Our immunity to magic protected you from becoming the same age as well as your more cautious nature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina pouted further, feeling guilty. \"I guess I dropped the ball on that one, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah giggled. \"You both dropped the ball.\" Calmly, she said. \"The question is, who will be the first to pick it back up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina looked at her mom, thoughtful then asked, \"Do you think...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When you were turned into a six-year-old girl originally you hated it. You seemed so relieved to be thirteen again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina nodded. \"Yeah, that's true, but I didn't realize how hard it was going to be. Lucy's adjusted much better than I have. Maybe she went about this the smarter way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked at her new daughter, thinking about what she had just said. Was this really the right call? \"I understand you feeling that way, but it is a big decision. Why don't you take a day or two to think about it, and, then, if you still want to be six like Lucy, we can talk to Natalie.\" Christina thought about this, then nodded again. That seemed fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Mom.\" Christina knew though that her mind was already made. She was miserable like this. Maybe by following in Lucy's footsteps, she could find a new way forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feared this moment would come,\" Mom sighed as she faced her next great opponent. Well, two opponents technically. You and Hannah stood before her in your respective nightgowns arms crossed, faces full of a pouting expression. It was the next morning, Sunday, but any further work dealing with Samantha and Cassie had to be put on hold by the two stubborn girls in front of her. \"It was only a matter of time until you two teamed up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lied to me,\" you accused Mom quickly. \"You said girls only started gymnastics when they turned seven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I started when I was much younger than that,\" Hannah interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Liz takes gymnastics and she's six,\" you added. You couldn't believe you hadn't thought of that when Mom first rejected the gymnastics idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My gymnastics class has six-year-old beginners in it too,\" Hannah continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I looked it up online. Most girls start gymnastics at five or six. So why won't you let me take it? I could be in the same class as Hannah and Liz. It would be so much fun.\" You didn't get what Mom was thinking, but you didn't like her not letting you do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom couldn't help but chuckle. The two of you were adorable when you worked together. \"I should have known you two would start start talking and that my six-year-old daughter still had the internet research savvy of a thirteen-year-old. I've got to lie a bit better next time.\" She sighed. It was time to come clean. \"Okay, you got me. I had a completely different reason for saying no to gymnastics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" you and Hannah demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most six-year-old girls have had their whole lives to get used to their bodies. They know their limits and their weaknesses. Lucy, you've only had that body for about two weeks. You're still not used to it yet. Gymnastics is great, but I was worried that it might be a bit to...active for you so soon after your transformation. I didn't want you to hurt yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head in protest. \"Mom, I can handle it. I promise. Please let me do gymnastics. It looks like so much fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Mom. It would be great to have Lucy in class with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sat back in her chair and thought for a moment. \"Tell you what. I'll make you a deal. You can join Hannah's gymnastics class, if you join her ballet class too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a surprise. Hannah couldn't have been happier with the idea. She loved the idea of you joining ballet too, but you weren't nearly as enthusiastic. \"What? Why? Ballet is boring. Why do I need to do that too?\" Come to think of it, Mom had been trying to nudge you in the direction of ballet at the mall to. Why ballet over gymnastics?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, ballet's not boring. You'll love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shushed you both before you turned on each other in an argument about ballet. \"Ballet is a bit slower and more subdued. It's the perfect way for you to learn how to handle that new body of yours. If you take ballet as well, I will trust you to handle yourself in gymnastics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned. Mom's counteroffer had put you and Hannah on different pages. You felt alone in your position, which was annoying. \"But Hannah takes ballet twice a week and gymnastics once a week. I'd be doing more ballet than gymnastics. That's not a fair deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom held firm. \"That's the deal. Take it or leave it. Though if ballet is completely unbearable after a month, we can try to think up a different way to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou considered your options for a moment. You looked over at Hannah, who clearly was hoping you'd agree. You had been so bored when visiting Hannah and Liz's ballet class on Friday, but maybe actually doing it would be a little less awful. Still, you had always seen ballet as one of the most girly activities known to man. It might be a point of no return. Not that you had much intention of being a boy again. And hanging with Liz and Hannah would be fun. Finally, after a minute deep in thought, you made your decision. \"Fine,\" you uttered very begrudgingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah cheered and hugged you, while Mom smiled. \"Thank you, Lucy. That puts my mind at ease. I'll sign you up for both first thing tomorrow morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. This confrontation had not gone as you had expected, but whatever. At least, you could take gymnastics with Liz now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour train of thought was interrupted when...</span></div></div>",

She tumbled twice before hitting the wall and looked up at Elvira with a sense of terror; this was a side of her grandmother she had never seen. \"I am the head witch.\" Irritated, Elvira snapped back. \"As such, I command <i>all</i> witches, including <i>you.</i>\" She frowned down at Mel, who was now literally shivering in fright at the sight of her power. \"Do not <i>ever</i> challenge me again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie turned to mom for help only to see her gulp. \"I had hoped you would not repeat my own mistake.\" Her voice quivering, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira sighed then closed her hand, causing the flame to vanish with a low thunderous boom. \"Eva Morgana and her sister, Helena young have been spotted in the area.\" More calmly, she explained. \"They prefer to work under the cover of darkness so, unless you wish to forever disappear or never see your sisters again, be home before six PM without fail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie quickly nodded but said nothing as Elvira then turned to mom who sighed. \"I am trying to help her see what she is doing is wrong but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira hushed mom silent. \"All witches fall into their rebellious stage.\" Smiling, she said. \"Even Hayley had challenged me once only it was under stress of a witch test.\" She looked at Melanie and added, \"Your mother joined a coven to spite me as you are doing to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What- What happened?\" Nervous, Melanie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira shook her head. \"Your mother came very close to losing her magic forever.\" Sadly, Elvira replied. \"It was not from breaking the law but from the coven wanting to steal her magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A witch can do that?!\" Startled, Melanie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira grabbed Melanie's hand and pointed to the mark on her arm. \"This mark is not just a fashion statement.\" Gravely, she said. \"It will grow and, once it is all over your body, your magic will be gone.\" She then sighed. \"Don't believe me... chapter seven, lesson eight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Elvira vanished from the room, leaving Melanie more than a little shaken...<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cassie snorted dismissively over the phone. \"Mel, I promise I'm not trying to steal your magic. It wouldn't serve me to. I want to change the way the magic community thinks about magic. I don't want it all for myself. Stealing another witch's magic goes against my philosophy and would just piss off the Witch's council. Even with my mother's allies there. Elvira and your mother are just trying to divide us. Why are you calling me anyway? We can just communicate mentally.\" She sounded sincere, but Mel felt unsure who she could believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel sighed. \"I don't know...I feel like Mom picked up on that somehow. At least with my cell I don't send out any magical trace. Just normal hiding things from my Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense. You can be crafty when you want to be, though I wouldn't put it past Natalie to have picked up on this too.\" Cassie paused as she collected her thoughts, then jumped back to Mel's concerns. \"But, if your worried, you can take a look at chapter seven, lesson eight. It clearly states that the rune mark can have that effect, but it requires a lot of dark magic, that frankly I'm not capable of yet. Besides, you would have weeks in that scenario to counter the effects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, why was it such a close call for my mom?\" Mel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie shrugged even though Mel couldn't see it. \"Maybe she got wrapped up in a witch cult when she was younger. It was pretty common 25 years ago. Powerful witches with strong personalities would prey on the young to cultivate their own power. Many of them tried to steal magic. My mom hated them. She called them a complete perversion of the coven system, but you'd be surprised how many witches of our parent's generation belonged to one at one point or another. Elena Kruse ran one, but I don't think she was one of the power suckers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel flipped through the pages of her witch book as she listened. \"Mom's never mentioned any of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's probably ashamed. It was a rough period in our history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel came to part of the book she was looking for. \"Okay, found chapter seven, lesson eight.\" She took a moment to read it over. \"Yeah, seems to be pretty much what you said. Witch cults, power sucking, some totally dark stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's a betrayal of witch practice in my mind. Covens are supposed to be beautiful havens of sisterhood. Those were betrayals of that trust. Frankly, if your Mom was part of one I don't blame her for freaking out about you joining a coven. She's probably pretty scarred and a little concerned about my motivations.\" Cassie actually felt a bit of sympathy for Natalie, not that she would ever tell her that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooooooooo...what are your motivations then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie chuckled. \"Fair question, I guess. I'm honestly pretty simple. I think women are better than men and witches are better than humans, and think witches should live their lives according to that philosophy. Cause frankly, men and humans suck. They hunt us and try to control us. I refuse to live that way.\" She paused, then spoke again. \"Plus, I'm a rude bitch and I don't have patience for people that cross me.\" Mel giggled. \"Listen, power is great and all, but I'm more powerful with other witches who share my worldview around me. Witches like you. Believe me, there are much more dangerous people than me out there in the dark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel nodded, remembering Elvira's warning. \"Like Eva Morgana and Helena Young.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie felt a chill hearing those names. Her mom had taught her when she was little about witches to watch out for. Those two were mentioned a number of times, but knowledge of them was scarce. \"Yeah...I don't know much about those two, but I do know even my Mom is wary of them. Take Elvira's warning seriously. If I had know they were spotted in the area, I wouldn't have kept you at my place this late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel was silent for a moment as she considered this. \"Anything we can do to protect ourselves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie paused, which Mel found chilling. Finally, Cassie spoke. \"Stay inside at night. Don't go out for any reason. That's really all I can think of.\" She paused again. \"Listen, can we talk about something else? Talking about those two unsettles me, and we've got enough to think about, especially with Samantha coming after me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie's fear definitely was making Mel anxious about these two women, but Mel obliged. \"Yeah, sure. Why is Samantha so mad at you anyway? You both like turning boys to witch girls. Shouldn't you two get along great?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd think so, wouldn't you? But my stunt with the glasses that turned Harry and your brother into Christina and your sister put the scrutiny of the witch council on her. Even though I sold it all, they figure why was that stuff even if her store to begin with. So she's in the doghouse and she's taking it out on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel giggled. \"As much as Lucy annoys me, she annoyed me more when she was John, so I'm glad you pulled that stunt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Then, Cassie remembered something. \"Oh, by the way I heard from Magenta. She took care of the boys. Tim and Lucy are in for a rude surprise when they go back to school tomorrow. Should be fun.\" Magenta was another girl in the coven, a blonde, who Mel had been introduced to at Cassie's during the afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is her name really Magenta?\" Mel asked. She hadn't wanted to ask earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, it was Cassie's turn to giggle. \"No, it's Bess, but she thinks being called Magenta makes her sound more elegant and mysterious. I think it's silly, but she's a good friend, and very good at leaving no magical trace. It won't come back to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome,\" Mel said. Suddenly, she heard her name called from downstairs. \"Crap, I got to go. Mom's calling me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kay, see you at school tomorrow. I hope I put your mind at ease.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did.\" At least about the coven stuff, but now Mel felt like she was going to have nightmares about the witch sisters. She didn't want Cassie to know she was freaked about it though. \"Later.\" Mel hung up the phone and rushed downstair to see what Mom wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were dressed in purple leggings and a grey tee with a picture of a cat on front, one of your purchases at the mall yesterday as you like cats. Hannah sat next to you and you looked at each other nervously. Mom sounded really serious when she called you all down and you felt you had a feeling you need what was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, did something happen to Christina?\" Hannah had just asked the question you were afraid to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom looked confused and then shook her head. \"No, Christina should be okay. And she just became the least of our worries.\" Mom then proceeded to tell you all about Elvira's warning, including the two names, Eva Morgana and Helena Young. The nervousness in her voice told you it was something serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...these sisters...are they worse than Elena Kruse?\" You asked with trepidation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom bit her lip than nodded. \"Yes...I'm sorry I have to tell you all this, I know it's scary. But you have to understand why we're going to be taking certain precautions. I don't want them getting anywhere near you four.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come I've never heard about these two?\" Hayley asked. \"I heard a lot about bad witches both from you and at Witchbloom, but these two are completely new to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed, then spoke. \"We had hoped they were dead, honestly. We thought they were after our last encounter with them 20 years ago, but we never found the bodies and some suspected that they were still out there somewhere. Still, they weren't the sorts of women we wanted recorded in our history, so the stories were swept under the rug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandmother said they hunt in darkness,\" Mel added. She wasn't particularly happy with her mother or her grandmother, but she did recognize that this wasn't a time to fight with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"Exactly, so until these two are dealt with you all are to be home by six.\" That sounded okay to you, your new after school activities would be done by then and you and Hannah were in bed by eight anyway. Hayley seemed less pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, that's crazy. The days are getting shorter this time of year. That curfew is going to start getting earlier and earlier. We turn the clocks back in early November and that's less than a month away. and then we'll lose a whole nother hour. I often stay at school until about six. That's just not sustainable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom raised a hand to stop Hayley. \"Hayley, believe me, I understand. This curfew will last only until Eva and Helena are dealt with. The full force of the Witch Council is looking into this. I hope this will only last a week or so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley reached her hand up to her face and pinched her nose as she thought. \"I guess. This still sucks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does, but now I need you all to promise me, you'll follow my instructions in this matter.\" Mom looked at Mel. \"My bet is even Cassie would tell you to fear these two. Her mother certainly does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel nodded and quickly promised she'd followed the curfew. Mom could tell she was sincere too. Mel wasn't a great liar, as the past few days had demonstrated. You, Hannah, and Hayley quickly followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour curiosity compelled you to ask though. \"Mom, who are these two? Why is everyone so scared of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's better that you don't know. I don't want to give you girls nightmares.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, we're already scared. And personally, I'd feel, like, a lot better knowing what we're dealing with.\" Mel made a convincing point. Hayley and Hannah nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed and decided to share despite her better judgment. \"Fine. But this story may change the way you see me...I haven't always been as responsible as I am now.\" With that she began her story.</span></div></div>",

We all took pleasure in throwing mischief at our brothers and friends with our magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel raised a hand to her mouth in shock. Her mom was friends with them?! It was certainly a scary thought if the two were now the most feared witches around. \"Why were you friends with them?!\" Shocked, she demanded. \"It, like makes no sense!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you, I was offered to join their group during a time I was trying to get a foot hold in controlling my own life.\" Sadly, mom explained. \"I did not suspect how dark Eva and Helena were until it was almost too late.\" She shook her head, a pained expression on her face. \"The two had hatched a plan to permanently turn all of the boys within their families into girls and witches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Worried, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I opposed the plan as it would have made my brother, Jack the next head witch ahead of myself.\" Hurt, mom replied. \"Call it vanity, call it what you like but I did not want to give up all the power that came with that position. Eva and Helena used a dark side to the loyalty mark to strip me of my powers for breaking the loyalty bond and take it for themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the loyalty mark is like a contract?\" Worried, Mel asked. \"I did not read that anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded, shedding a few tears. \"If it was not for my brother's insane resistance to magic and colossal strength, they would have succeeded.\" Sadly, she said. \"He stormed the Kruse house and busted all of their heads before he carried me home to mom where the mark was removed... I was lucky he still cared so much for me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uncle Jack is that strong?!\" Stunned, Mel asked. \"What happened to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He married Samantha Forester's little sister, Sara.\" Softly, mom said. \"Shortly after, they went into hiding to live a normal life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is the contract not mentioned in the magic book?\" Wincing, Mel demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The contract curse connected to the mark is now a forbidden technique.\" Serious, mom replied. \"Anything deemed forbidden is not taught in the magic books of today but they do warn of them.\" She sighed. \"I am not denying you membership in this coven, Melanie. I am simply trying to protect you from the mistakes I have made growing up; they cost me dearly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to Samantha Forester and this Lilly Sweetie?\" Curious, Hayley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samantha Forester quit the coven the same time I did only she had blocked the mark contract from holding her.\" Frowning, mom said. \"She never warned me about it and it sort of divided us ever since.\" She sighed. \"As for Lilly Sweetie, she simply vanished. No one has seen or heard from her since that night my brother came to the rescue. I can only assume she lost her magic and became normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is more to this... isn't there?\" Wincing, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"Yes but it was dark times; an era of my life I would rather forever bury in the past.\" Softly, she said. \"I came close to throwing everything away for my pride and power and I will not allow any of you to stumble down that same path.\" She frowned deeply. \"Know this; Eva and Helena target people close to those they hate to make them suffer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meeting ended with everyone feeling rather shaken. You and Hannah were the most shaken, due to your ages and mom offered you both a cup of tea to help you sleep. Hayley remained behind to question mom further while Mel went to her room with a lot to think about. \"So mom nearly went rogue due to a bad coven.\" Shaken, she thought. \"That explains a lot. She doesn't want me to make the same mistakes.\" She sighed, shaking her head. \"She's just being over protective;  I'm more careful than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Or are other people in danger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom considered this question, not sure how to answer. \"They might want revenge on me, Lucy, but more than anything, they want to cause chaos and fear in the witch community that cast them out. There is not a witch who shouldn't watch her back. But don't worry, we're save in this house. Elvira and I put up enough protective charms around this place to keep an army out.\" She patted you as you fell asleep with that reassuring thought. The house would be safe. It was the rest of the world that scared her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night passed without incident and the next morning, you and your sisters went back to school. It was nice to return to normalcy. You gave Ellen and the others their friendship bracelets with the protective charms, which they were excited about (though they didn't know about the protection spells). Classes also seemed more enjoyable than they had last week. You figured your mind was readjusting to being six, which made the classes less boring. Plus, you're friends made everything better. You wanted to talk to Liz at some point about Eva and Helena, but it was hard to find a moment when the two of you were alone. You did get to tell her you would joining gymnastics and ballet, which made her super excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne troubling thing you observed was Cassie and Mel hanging out together. The two looked like they had bonded over the weekend, and could be seen laughing and talking through the halls, sometimes with other girls as well. Other members of Cassie's coven, you guessed. Still, you had bigger problems than Cassie and Mel becoming friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, at recess, you and Liz found a moment you could be alone together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much did your mom tell you?\" you asked Liz after you told her your story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that much. She said she wasn't part of any cults like other witches were. She wasn't strong enough to get their attention. But she told me enough to scare me.\" Liz yawned. \"I barely slept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. It had been the same way with you. Suddenly, you noticed someone coming toward you and he didn't look happy. Your cousin, Tim. You groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look out, Liz. A dumb-headed boy is approaching,\" you called loud enough to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to hear it, cootie-brain,\" Tim yelled. \"Rick and Steve turned back to normal over the weekend, but now they're back to being silly girls with heads full of fairy dust or whatever. What did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced. Rachel and Stephanie were back? What had happened? Had your magic gone wrong or was someone else responsible? \"What makes you think I did something?\" you asked, trying to defend yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it was you last time. You clearly love being a girl now, so of course, you're trying to find ways to torture me just cause you want me to join your club of pretty prissy princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz rolled her eyes at that. \"We don't want you playing with us, Tim. We're not going to do that to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who asked you?\" Tim shouted at Liz, which annoyed you to no end. What gave him the right to yell at your friend?

You nodded and she sighed. \"It took me years to reestablish my reputation so I would be grateful if you did not tell anyone.\" She smiled. \"As far as anyone else is concerned, I am Miss Sweets, a humble grade school teacher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then walked away as Mel and Cassie ran up to you while Tim hurried off with Rick and Steve. \"Are you, like okay, Lucy?\" Worry in her voice, Mel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was Eva and Helena!\" Panicked, you whispered. \"They were here! Here at the school!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel and Cassie turned to each other then turned to you and Liz. \"There is always safety in numbers, Lucy.\" Sounding sincere, Mel said. \"You may not want to be a part of Cassie's coven right now because you are, like scared or something but there is no harm in you both tagging along with us for protection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will not do anything to make my mom look bad; the law is on her case as it is.\" Calmly, Cassie added. \"This coven is legit; hang out with us for a while and then decide for yourselves.\" She smiled. \"You might like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to Liz who merely shrugged, not knowing what to do. Finally, you replied...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The goal was to not let anyone see the bright pink ruffled socks, Tim was now wearing. \"Just be glad I only changed your socks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you kids going? You still have 20 minutes of recess left,\" a recess teacher questioned you as you went inside the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bathroom,\" you and Liz quickly said in unison.

You opened his locker. \"Now where are your change of clothes?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim pointed in his locker. His face looking miserable. He was milking this for all it was worth. No way was your mom not hearing about this. You fished around in his locker until you found a small bag with a change of clothes. Right on top were a pair of boys socks and you pulled them out and tossed them toward Tim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go. Now, you can put them on and there'll be nothing to be upset about okay. I'm sorry I lost control. Honest, Tim, I don't want to turn you or your friends into girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why do you keep doing it?\" Tim accused in a hurt voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you all keep picking on me? Being a jerk to me seems to trigger my magic. Why do you keep doing it anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim didn't have an answer for that. He looked at the socks from his change of clothes bag and blushed. \"Ummmm...my socks wasn't the only thing your magic changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Liz looked at each other confused. Nothing about the rest of Tim's clothes seemed changed, when suddenly the answer dawned on you. You couldn't resist giggling. \"Here.\" You tossed Tim his change of clothes bag. \"I'm not touching your underpants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim blushed one more time and took his change of clothes bag toward the bathroom to change, muttering under his breath, \"Stupid cootie-brains.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he left you and Liz immediately started laughing.

You didn't want to keep losing control of your magic and Tim's teasing was clearly a trigger. After a couple minutes, Tim returned from the bathroom, having changed out of the clothes you transformed and into new ones. His pride and ego had clearly returned as he starred daggers at you and Liz the second he saw you two still waiting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you cootie-brains want now?\" Tim asked as he returned his clothes bag to his locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truce?\" you asked hopefully, holding out your hand to shake his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim looked you over suspiciously. \"You sure you only changed some of my clothes? I'm not going to wake up tomorrow dreaming of being a princess, am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonesty seemed like the best tactic. \"I really can't be sure. If you do, I didn't mean to and I promise to find a way to fix it.\" Liz shot you a look. Tim was a witch boy, which meant turning him back into a boy wasn't something you could promise. Universal magic might have other designs for him like it did for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Tim accepted this and shook your hand. \"Fine. I'll try to stop bothering you, if you can help me change my friends back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, as the three of you walked back to recess. \"Tim, I don't know if I can. I turned them back to boys over the weekend, but if they are girls again then maybe my magic wasn't strong enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded. \"But didn't my Mom say you only made them girls for a little bit. Just until they learned what it was like to be on. They should turn back on their own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you went back outside. Sure enough, you spotted Rachel and Stephanie playing with Hannah and her friends across the yard. Tim watched them for a moment before speaking. \"I need my friends back, Lucy. You did this, please fix it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe request took you aback. You couldn't remember Tim ever speaking so kindly to you before, or using your name. Even when you were John, you weren't sure he ever called you by your name. \"I'll try my best, Tim.\" If it was because of you that Rachel and Stephanie were still girls, you did want to fix it. You'd focus on that, and try not to think about the evil witches hiding in the dark.</span></div></div>",

I saw the whole thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shot Hannah a disapproving look. \"Then you should have reported it immediately, young lady. As it turns out, the witch council didn't find out until hours later when Tim informed his Mom about it.\" She shook her head. Sometimes, she worried her daughters were too strong-willed and independently minded. It was a good thing in many ways, but it also meant they could be very mischievous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah became flustered, but defended her actions. \"They wanted to play with me and they were fun. I still like them better this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Mom could come down on Hannah again, you spoke up. \"So this isn't temporary like the karma spell I put on them last week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. They will remain girls until the spell is broken, and that's proving problematic. Normally, we would trace the spell back to the witch who cast it and force them to remedy it, but whoever did this is an expert at not leaving a magical fingerprint. Fortunately, we could at least determine it wasn't your magic that was responsible. It's the only reason the council hasn't forced you to go to Witchbloom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Witchbloom?\" you said in surprise and a hint of panic. \"I don't want to go to Witchbloom. I want to stay at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me, I agree. Six is a little young to go to a boarding school, and I honestly don't feel like it's safe there right now. But the Witch Council will not allow a witch who doesn't have control of her powers to remain in the company of regular humans. Fortunately, they've been too busy to notice the sock incident today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed deep red. You had forgotten to tell mom that part. She must have heard from somewhere else. \"I'm really sorry about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. From the sound of it, you handled the situation perfectly, but we must do more to help you learn about and control your powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid that mean MAGIC LESSIONS???!!! Your face brightened when you heard that. You were very excited about that prospect. \"Are you going to teach me, Mommy?\" In your excitement, the word \"Mommy\" slipped out. You didn't notice, but Hannah did and smiled to herself. She enjoyed any sign you were turning more and more into her girly little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head. \"I'm sorry, but I won't be. You four girls are keeping my hands full as it is, and given her new friendship with Cassie, I think I need to give Mel more of my attention.\" She noticed your face fall, so she was quick to reassure you. \"But don't worry, I have a teacher in mind for you. I was thinking maybe Mrs. Belacourt could teach a few days a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded slowly thinking it over. Mrs. Belacourt wasn't a bad idea. She had helped you with your magic before during your sleepover with Liz, and having her as your teacher meant you'd probably get to spend more time with Liz. There was just one thing that bothered you about it. \"But I thought the Belacourts didn't have very strong magic. Will Liz's mom really be able to teach me anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely. Her knowledge as a researcher of witchcraft makes her an expert and she's a wonderful teacher. She'll help you even more than I could. I've already spoken to her and she'll be happy to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped in the air excitedly. \"Woo-Hoo, I get to have magic lessons!!!!\" You couldn't wait to tell Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"I'm glad you're excited about it. I'm glad to have some good news after this rough day.\" She slumped back in an arm chair exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you remembered something Mom had said. \"Wait, Mom. You said Witchbloom wasn't safe right now. What do you mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom gritted her teeth. She had been hoping not to have to tell you about this, but realized she had slipped up. \"Eva and Helena struck last night. A Witchbloom student went missing, a friend of Hayley's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Hannah looked at each other with wide eyes and then back at Mom.</span></div></div>",

You're on your way to becoming a wonderful, powerful witch, and you are so responsible for your age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed. \"Thanks, Mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom pulled out a small jewelry box. \"When I was a little girl, my mother bought me a beautiful gemstone necklace that I still treasure to this day, and when I had Hayley I decided to continue the tradition with my daughters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah. I think, I've seen both Hayley and Mel with necklaces like that. Hayley's got a red one and Mel has a green one.\" Your two older sisters would wear them to many a formal occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Hayley's is a ruby and Mel's is a emerald.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have one too,\" Hannah added, not to be outdone. \"But Mommy holds on to it because I'm not careful with my jewelry. It's a sapphire though and really pretty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom gave Hannah a look. \"It was expensive, Hannah, and you almost traded it to some other girl for a light-up pen.\" Hannah blushed, but smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly realized what was happening. \"Your...your giving me one too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded and opened the box. Inside was a beautiful necklace with a shiny purple amethyst at the end. The clasp had your name \"Lucy\" written on the gold chain. \"Well, you are a Harrison girl now and my daughter. It only makes sense that you should have one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were transfixed by the shine. \"It's beautiful, Mommy. And I'm really starting to like purple.\" Suddenly, you looked up at her with excitement in your eyes. \"Can I put it on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom's face shined. She was so happy you liked the necklace. \"How about I put it on you? Turn around.\" You turned around and lifted your hair up, so Mom could put the necklace on you. As she did, Mom continued talking. \"I actually bought this when you first turned, but I wasn't sure if you were ready to receive it. But events recently have made it clear that you really are taking to being Lucy, even if I still see flashes of John sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled as the necklace tickled your neck. \"Yeah, but I'm really liking being Lucy now. It feels like its who I'm supposed to be. I'm having so much fun, and I'm not sure I'd like being a boy anymore.\" You noticed Hannah looked overjoyed to hear you say that, making you clarify. \"I just couldn't be without my magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom finished clasping the necklace. \"I'm glad to here it. You make a wonderful daughter, Lucy.\" She held up a mirror before you and you admired the purple necklace sparkle on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Mommy,\" you smiled at her. \"It really is a beautiful necklace. I really love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom patted your head. \"Well, not quite as beautiful as the girl wearing it...\" You blushed. \"...but I'm glad you love it.\" Mom stood up. \"Well, I should get dinner started. I'll call you two when it is ready.\" She headed back downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah was now admiring your necklace. \"It's really pretty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" you answered. \"Wanna play until dinner or something?\"</span></div></div>",

What about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah looked a little nervous, but found her words. \"Are...um...you planning to turn Stephanie and Rachel back into boys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah. It's going to be a little harder than last time, cause it's a different spell, but I'm going to whatever I can to turn them back. I promised Tim I would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...could you not?\" Hannah asked a bit pleadingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked surprised. \"What do you mean? They didn't want to be changed. Some witch did that to them and that's not okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah nodded. \"Yeah, I know. But Rick and Steve were such jerks, but Stephanie and Rachel are really sweet and cool. They played with me all recess and they don't think princess stuff is too silly to play.\" Many of the girls in Hannah's class were growing out of the princess-obsessed phase. You knew Hannah was a little hurt by it, since she was still very into princesses. Having other girls her age who were into it probably did mean a lot to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought suddenly occurred to you. \"Hannah, you didn't put the glitter bomb there, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah shook her head. \"Of course not, but...when I saw it turn them into girls, I was really glad someone did put the glitter bomb in their lockers. I...I really do think those two are better as girls. They were such mean boys. You hated them too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"I do hate them, but that doesn't mean it's okay for someone to use their powers on them to make them nicer. They are under a spell. They probably don't actually want to be girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't want to be a girl either,\" Hannah pointed out. \"And now you like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" You weren't sure how to respond to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really glad you are a girl now. We have so much fun together and I love having a little sister. Don't you like it too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded slowly. \"You're a great big sister. You're the best big sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah continued, feeling like she was winning you over. \"But we never used to get along when you were a boy. You thought I was too bratty and girly.\" You blushed, not realizing that Hannah had known you felt that way. \"You changed and it was better. Why can't it be better for Stephanie and Rachel too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Hannah...I made a promise to Tim...Besides, even if I don't find a way to reverse the spell, someone from the witch council might.\" You felt very unsure of yourself suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The witch council seems to busy with all this Eva and Helena stuff. I know you promised Tim, but can't you trust your big sister...I was right about playing fairies, wasn't I?\" She had been. That was true. You did want to trust her. This seemed really important to Hannah, but it was really important to Tim too, and you did promise him first. The funny thing, though, was you weren't sure you could do anything at all. Who knew if you could even find a way to break the spell? Even so, you had to make a decision.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The night had been a long one. Despite your efforts, Hayley's friend had never been found, but the Witch Council was more optimistic about finding her after the new information you had found. You all just had to keep hoping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you and Hannah walked into school, the subject of Rachel and Stephanie came up again. \"Even if the magic that turned Rachel and Stephanie into girls is too powerful, I still feel like I should do anything I can to help change them back,\" you told Hannah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah sighed. She still thought Rachel and Stephanie were better as girls, but she understood you felt a sense of duty to Tim. \"I guess so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt bad. You felt a lot of sympathy for your sister's position, so you tried to cheer her up. \"You heard Mom though. Whatever I do probably won't work. Rachel and Stephanie will probably be around for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Hannah could respond, a familiar voice spoke from behind you. \"Is that what you think?\" It was Tim's voice. He was probably going to yell at you for giving up so easily or something, even though you hadn't given up. You and Hannah turned around slowly, knowing you were about to face his wrath, but as soon as your eyes fell upon him, both your jaws dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim was standing there with Rachel and Stephanie, both of whom were wearing poofy dresses. The most shocking thing was that Tim wasn't a boy anymore. He, or she, now had long, well-groomed hair with a pink glittery headband. She had on a purple sequin shirt that read \"girls rule,\" and a pink tutu skirt. The socks he wore were the same pink frilly pair you had given the day before, which made your mind jump quickly to a conclusion. This was your fault somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim...\" you said as you recovered your thoughts. \"Is...is this because of my spell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim giggled and shook her head. \"No, this wasn't you. And my name is Tiffany now. Tim is a stupid boys name.\" Tiffany looked at Rachel and Stephanie. \"You too go ahead and get things ready. I just want to talk to my cousins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel and Stephanie giggled. \"Sure thing. We're going to have so much fun,\" Rachel said as she walked off toward her class's lockers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see you in class, Hannah. It should be awesome today,\" Stephanie added. She and Rachel were, then, gone, leaving you and Hannah with Tiffany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Hannah looked at each other. You both felt totally confused. Tiffany herself finally spoke again. \"Actually, I'm a little disappointed your spell didn't change me, Lucy. It's so much better being a girl and not some cootie-brain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But aren't girls cootie-brains?\" Hannah asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I used to think so, but now I realize it's boys who have cooties. Fortunately, I got cured, and now I'm a pretty girl like you two.\" Tiffany's personality seemed exactly the same as Tim's, except now it was boys she hated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How exactly did that happen?\" you asked worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesterday afternoon. I had just gotten home when my doorbell rang. I answered it to see Stephanie and Rachel standing there with a package for me. They opened it before I could stop them and it turned out to be a device that released more of that powder that turned them into girls yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another glitter bomb?\" Hannah asked in surprised. It was weird. Where had Stephanie and Rachel gotten another glitter bomb? They weren't witch girls. They wouldn't have known how to make them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany smiled at Hannah's choice of words. \"You're calling them glitter bombs? That's a good name for them. I think I'll use it from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did those two get another glitter bombs?\" you asked Tiffany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany shrugged. \"Don't know. Don't want to know. Probably whoever put the glitter bombs in their locker in the first place. Whoever it was will get in a lot of trouble if they are caught, and I don't want them to be. This is the best thing that ever happened to me. I'm sure you understand, Lucy. I'm a witch girl now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded slowly, but you weren't sure you agreed. It took you a lot of time to come to terms with being a girl, yet Tim, who had hated girls, seemed to have adjusted instantly. Maybe whatever spell was put on him was messing with his brain too. \"So what happened after you got hit with the glitter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it went slower for me cause of my resistance to magic, but this spell was to powerful even for that. It took me an hour to fully change, and I tried to fight it the whole time. Stephanie and Rachel stood by me until it was over and I started to realize how much better being a girl was and how much boys suck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does Aunt Catherine think about all this?\" you asked. She couldn't be okay with the way Tim was transformed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She doesn't know how it happened. She thinks my recent exposure to magic finally turned me into the witch girl I was meant to be.\" Translation: Aunt Catherine thinks spending time around you turned Tim into Tiffany. You hoped she wouldn't be mad at you. \"Anyway, Lucy, don't worry about your promise. I don't want Rachel and Stephanie to be boys anymore. In fact, I'm going to help them make sure there aren't any boys at school anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes went wide. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany giggled. \"Oh, whoever turned them into girls left them a few more glitter bombs this morning. Rachel and Stephanie are putting them in some boys' lockers right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Hannah turned around just in time to see a boy in Hannah's class open up his locker only to be greeted with a shower of sparkles. In an instant, the boy had turned into a well-dressed girl, who happily skipped into her classroom. You turned back to Tim. \"Tiffany, this isn't okay. This spell is doing something to your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany shook her head. \"Maybe, but I don't care. I want to help cure boys of being stupid cootie-brains like I was cured. By the end of the week, there won't be a stupid boy left in this school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell by Hannah's face that even she thought this was going to far. You guessed she realized that Mike Cutie would also be transformed if this kept up. You looked at Tiffany. \"I can't let you do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany smiled. \"You will, or you'll get a faceful of glitter too. You two are already girls, but the glitter will make you at least she things my way. You'll help us get rid of all the boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure what to do. You didn't want to let anymore boys get turned into...well...basically, girly glitter zombies, but Tiffany would almost certainly put you under the spell too if you tried anything. You could also retreat and get in touch with Mom, but that would allow more boys to be turned in the meantime, including possibly Mike Cutie, who you spotted headed toward his locker down the hall. Who knew if there was a glitter bomb waiting for him there?</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, holding Tiffany required most of your focus, and you and Hannah weren't able to intercede as a couple more boys found glitter bombs in their lockers. Fortunately, Rachel and Stephanie never returned to see what was holding up their friend and, to Hannah's delight, Mike Cutie was not one of the boys who had been glitter bombed. He remained a boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley immediately called Mom, who called the witch council. The regular humans were put under a spell, so they didn't notice all the witches swarming over the school investigating the incident. You and Hannah sat in the school office with Hayley and Mom waiting for the witch council investigators to come talk to you all. Liz had come to keep you company. You kept looking at Hayley. She had a very angry expression on her face. You could tell she wasn't pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Hayley?\" you asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley sighed and pinched the bridge of her nose. \"This couldn't have happened at a worse time. The Witch Council is busy dealing with this, instead of looking for...\" She trailed off before she finished her sentence. Her friend from Witchbloom was still missing, and she understandably wanted them to be found. But a thought had occurred to her. \"Maybe that's what this is. Eva and Helena might be trying to distract us while they steal...steal power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head. \"This isn't their style. If they were going to distract us, it would have been a lot more explosive than a bunch of mind controlled boys turned girls. This was someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz sighed. \"I hope Tim's okay. I know he's annoying, but that must be awful having your mind controlled. And now he has to deal with being a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He might not be. Magic doesn't change him easily. Maybe the glitter just made him think he had become a girl.\" For some reason the thought of Tim becoming a girl especially bothered you. You weren't sure why though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom patted your head and pulled you close. \"That's possible, Lucy, but I wouldn't get your hopes up. He's been exposed to a lot of magic recently. Even if he somehow managed to resist the glitter's transformative effects, Tiffany is an inevitability at this point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah nodded. \"Well, at least, the Witch Council people can fix the mind control. It was creepy seeing him, or her, like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"You girls did well, but in the future, please walk away from a situation like that if you can. I know you especially like to play hero, Lucy, but in this case, walking away and calling me would be just as effective. I just don't want the council questioning your use of magic, appropriate as it may have been.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked embarrassed. \"Sorry, Mommy. I know it would have been better to just get away and call you, but it was so hard to walk away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stand up when you see others in trouble,\" Mom brushed your hair. \"For that, I'm proud of you. I know you'll make a great...\" She paused as if she was stopping herself from saying something. \"...You'll make a great witch someday, but until then, try to be more cautious about things like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, though you also knew this kind of thing seemed to continue to happen. Why would next time be any different?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Mel was just sitting down Cassie and Magenta in the library. The three had been looking for each other in the chaos and had finally been able to meet up. The three checked to make sure they weren't being overheard by any prying investigators. They were clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel looked at Cassie confused. \"What happened? I thought we were just turning Rick and Steve, so they'd, like, keep Tim and Lucy out of our hair for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie's face looked freaked. \"That is all we did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagenta nodded in agreement. \"Yeah, I only put the two glitter bombs in Rick and Steve's lockers yesterday. Where they got the rest of them to turn Tim and the others, I have no idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I do,\" Cassie said. \"There's one person who would love to get me in trouble with the witch council, Samantha Forrester. She probably found out what we were doing, and then made sure it all went to hell.\" Both Cassie and Samantha enjoyed turning boys into girls. This meant Samantha probably had her typical fun and made sure Cassie would be blamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel gulped. \"So we got lucky this didn't turn into a bigger thing.

She wouldn't have done all this.\" Despite this being your first time seeing Christina since your fight, you were quick to defend her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch investigator who brought Christina in shook her head. \"I'm afraid she was definitely involved somehow. We have strong evidence showing she was the one who gave the glitter devices used today to the two transformed boys, Rachel and Stephanie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina hung her head in shame. You couldn't believe it. Why would she be involved in this? You remembered your fear that Christina was bound to do something stupid. Looks like it had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n24 hours earlier...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina stepped into Samantha Forrester's shop, looking back to make sure not one she knew was there. She was skipping school and she didn't need anyone ratting her out. All clear, she made her way to the counter with purpose. Samantha was there, smiling with curiosity as the girl approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if it isn't the former Harry Rich. What brings you to my place of business?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina frowned. \"I want to you to make me a six-year old girl, like Lucy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha looked surprised to hear this, but then a wicked smile spread across her face. \"Now why would you want that? I figured you wanted to be a boy again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina shook her head. \"Of course I do, but I've been told a bunch that will never happen. But being 13 as a girl is the worst. I can't make any friends, and I have all these weird feelings I can't control. At least if I were six again, I could have time to adjust, and I could be with my friend again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Well, those glasses you bought from me were cursed to turn boys into six-year old girls. You should have stuck with that age when you had the chance if you miss it so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina sighed. \"If I had realized, I was going to be this miserable I wouldn't have let Mrs. Harrison return to being 13. It was a mistake. Now I'm asking you to fix it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why me?\" Samantha asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Harrison says she can't. and it might be dangerous, and my Mom is listening to her. But you were famous for turning boys into girls back in the day. I know you still enjoy doing it. I figured you were the person to turn to,\" Harry responded. Samantha smiled. Harry wasn't wrong. She could definitely do it. Of course, they'd be a price.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do it, but I don't do things for others for free, Ms. Rich. If you want me to turn you back into a six-year-old, you have to do a favor for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina nodded. \"Anything. I'll do anything. I can't take another day like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wicked smirk grew across Samantha's face and she reached down and pulled out a glitter bomb. \"A member of Cassie's coven just used two of these to transform a couple of boys in Hannah Harrison's class into girly girls. I want you to give these new girls a few more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the present...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina looked around nervously. She could get in real trouble here. She had been desperate and sloppy, and now she had been caught. Samantha had wanted her to frame Cassie's coven, but it seems she hadn't been very adept at that. They had her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She doesn't appear to be under any form of mind control,\" the witch investigator explained to Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head. \"No. Nonetheless, I do not believe she would do this on her own. Someone must be pulling the strings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she joined Cassie's coven,\" Hannah tried to suggest helpfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom considered the possibility, hoping Mel wouldn't have gotten involved in something so stupid. She, then, turned to Christina. \"Christina, who put you up to this? I can help you, but you must be honest with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina thought for a moment. Even though she got caught maybe Samantha would still honor her part of the deal. Especially if she could still push the blame on Cassie's coven.</span></div></div>",

You couldn't believe Christina would do something like this, but you took what she said at face value. \"Why would you want to join up with Cassie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina paused for a moment before answering. \"After our fight Lucy, I just wanted to make some friends, who would look out for me.\" You were about to object to that, but Mom shushed you. She wanted to here this. \"Cassie came to recruit me pretty quick after that. I was ready to do anything she asked. But I see it was a bad idea now.\" Christina looked over the faces in the room. She could tell you, Liz, and Hannah were completely buying it. Hayley too, which frankly surprised her. Hayley was normally less quick to judgment. The witch council investigator and Mom, on the other hand, couldn't be read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom didn't say a word. She was just listening carefully, weighing every movement and utterance. The witch council investigator spoke up. \"This is a very serious matter. You sure you're telling me the truth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina paused, then nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch investigator took a moment before turning toward Mom. \"What do you think? You know this girl very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom frowned. It was true she did know Christina very well, and she could see through the lie with ease. The pauses before she answered, the fact that Mel, who was in Cassie's coven, had humiliated Christina the previous weekend, and the non-sensical motivation all told Mom this was a total fabrication. Cassie wasn't the one who put Christina up to this, but she had to wonder what the best play was. Christina clearly didn't want to give up the true mastermind, so calling her out as a liar might not be the best way to go. Maybe they could pretend to believe Christina and see what she does next.</span></div></div>",

While you were doing this, Mom and Hayley were moving Christina in back at home, and you were personally thankful to away from that chaos. You were working on control first and foremost. Making sure you were channelling your magic only as intended and not simply because you were upset. Mrs. Belacourt was teaching you several exercises to help with that. Currently, she was having you levitate an egg, which was proving to be rather difficult. Moving stuff about was easy, doing it without breaking the object was quite hard, and the counter already had some egg yolk upon it demonstrating as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drat,\" you said in frustration as another egg exploded in midair and splattered on you. Fortunately, Mrs. Belacourt had given you one of Liz's raincoats to wear in foresight. It was pink and princess-y, but you were glad to have the protection. \"This is hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're definitely getting better, Lucy,\" Liz said encouragingly. She was at table behind you reading a picture book. This was practice time for her as well, though she was practicing reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right. You held that egg for a full minute. That's a new record,\" Mrs. Belacourt said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled. \"I guess I am getting better. It's just really hard to keep focused.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Belacourt nodded in understanding. \"Believe me, I understand. You've had a lot to think about the last few days. Everything with Christina, this spat between Cassie and Samantha, and Eva and Helena are still out there. I wish things were simpler for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bit your lip then nodded too. \"Yeah, every time I think things are going to get easier some new crazy thing happens. And I keep having new questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did that witch investigator mean when she said Mommy was heir to the magical throne?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Belacourt paused before answering. \"Well, you know how your Grandmother is the head witch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I figured she was elected to be one like mayors or presidents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Belacourt shook her head. \"No, the family in charge stays in charge, unless there is a coup.\" She noticed your look of confusion at the word coup. \"Someone else takes control, usually by force.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about all this new information. \"So Grandma's like a witch Queen...and Mom's like a princess...\" Your eyes went wide. \"But, wait, then that means...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz had a big grin on her face as she finished your thought. \"You're a princess too, Lucy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned. \"But I don't want to be a princess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Lucy. Being a princess would be awesome,\" Liz encouraged you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if you like Princesses. But I don't. Plus, it means I'll have a lot of responsibilities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Belacourt patted your back encouragingly. \"Well, it's part of the reason your powers are so strong. You have royal witch blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made a face. You would have to talk to Mom when you got home about all this. But in the meantime, you wanted to think about something else. \"Let's try the egg thing again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the lesson went well. By the end you were able to levitate the egg for about 2-and-a-half minutes without crushing it, which Mrs. Belacourt said was a remarkable improvement. She brought you home after the lesson and a little playing with Liz. You were eager to talk to Mom about the whole Princess thing, so you were hoping Mom was free to talk. When you arrived, you found...</span></div></div>",

Mom was clearly frustrated, so now probably wasn't the time to ask her about the whole witch royalty thing, but you thought of something that would probably relax her. You looked over the nail polish Mom had set aside, before choosing a sparkly purple color. You picked it up and showed it to Mom. \"Could you do my nails while we wait?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"I wish Christina was as open to all this as you are. Sit. I'll do your toes too.\" She sat you down and took off your shoes and socks. Already she seemed to be calming down, which made you smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fun,\" you said matter-of-factly. \"Being stubborn about it is just going to make me miserable, besides being a witch girl is pretty awesome.\" You paused for a second while Mom focused on putting a coat of polish on your toes. \"Hey, Mom. Am I going to like boys someday?\" Christina's protest on the subject got you wondering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom paused, unsure how to respond. \"I suppose so, though sometimes girls prefer other girls as you know.\" She took a second to think and then presented a question of her own. \"Does that bother you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged, honestly unsure what to think. \"I don't know. I guess it should, but it doesn't really. I mean, I feel pretty weird and gross thinking about it, but it also sounds...kinda...\" You trailed off, unsure of where you were going with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom finished your toes in silence, before moving on to your fingernails. Finally, she spoke again. \"You sound like a regular girl your age and it's probably similar to how you felt about girls as a six-year-old boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. You guessed that made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you sat for another couple minutes until Mom finished your nails. \"There we go. You should give them a minute to dry, but how do they look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held out your hand and admired her work. \"It's really pretty, Mom. Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom ruffled your hair. \"I just wish Christina was as open to this as you were. If she was six, you could show her the ropes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made a face. You had only been a girl for a few weeks, you couldn't imagine being a mentor for another transformed girl. \"Really?\" You tone was disbelieving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"Really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought for a moment. \"Maybe she should be six like me then. You're looking after her, right? So you're allowed to transform her if you need to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head. \"Yes, but it would be danger...\" She stopped suddenly. Her face had an expression you recognized. Mom had an idea.</span></div></div>",

Christina, shocked at seeing the locked door opening, said, \"How did you get in?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled almost ruefully. \"Witch remember, but I'd appreciate if you kept the whole 'ignoring the locked door' thing to ourselves. Its considered impolite, and more importantly, against one of my rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want your 'lessons'\" Christina said, as she struggled to remove her bra.

I've realized something\" mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is?\" Christina demanded, as she still struggled with the clasps at the bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Treating you like Lucy and the others was a mistake. No offense intended, but you're weak, magically speaking compared to them. Feeding them knowledge slowly is much safer for them. Not so much for you. I need to tell you more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on\" Christina said cautiously, her struggles with her bra momentarily forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were advanced to your normal age to disrupt your life as little as possible. Unfortunately it is almost impossible to reverse any of it, no matter what Lucy, or Forester, or anyone else might say. Any attempt to 'regress' you would probably end up like this\" mom said, pointing to one of Mel's cans of shaving foam. Instantly, the can crumpled, crushed by an unseen force, with some foam oozing out. Christina looked slightly horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not doing this out of malice, or self amusement, like some have\" mom said. \"I want you to be able to function normally, and not to be a target of .mean girls. which unfortunately is the clique that Mel has foolishly joined. As for the stuff I've tried to teach you, they're kind of the basics. You have to know how to get out of... and into our own bra, unless you want backache. As for my 'no tomboy' rule, its there to act as a dampener on the girls' powers. Not a problem for you. You can dress however you want, but I insist you wear proper underwear, and no boys' clothes. I need you to be a role model for Lucy. I'll leave you to get dressed.</span></div></div>",

Today, there was no magical crisis or evil witches afoot. Sure Eva and Helena were still out there, but that didn't stop this day from feeling weirdly normal. You were just hanging out at the lunch table at school with Liz and your normal human friends, Ellen, Keira, Jennifer, Tammy, and Becky. Just talking about normal stuff, like what you were doing after school. The group had been having fun together, but you had gotten lost in thought and lost track of the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up to see Ellen and Keira looking at you. The two had asked you a question, but you hadn't heard what it was. \"Sorry, spaced out. What did you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen repeated the question. \"I asked if you knew what your costume for Halloween was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou honestly hadn't thought about it, and Halloween was just a couple weeks away. John had gotten too old for dressing up, but now, as Lucy, you were pretty excited about the idea of trick-or-treating again. Still, with all the chaos going on you hadn't given it much thought. \"I don't know yet. I guess I should figure someone out soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeira and Ellen looked at each other and grinned. \"You should join us,\" Keira said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"That would be fun. But I still have no idea what my costume should be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen shook her head. \"You don't understand. Every year since Pre-K, the six of us have been doing a group costume and trick-or-treating together. Like, last year we were all the characters from My Little Pony. I was Twilight Sparkle. Keira was Applejack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz, who was sitting next to you, piped in. \"I was Fluttershy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled. \"So you want me to be part of this year's group costume? Sounds like fun.\" You were getting excited about it. \"What's the costume this year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Disney Princesses.\" Keira said this very matter-of-factly, but you winced a bit. Princesses were still a little too girly for your tastes, but as long as you weren't stuck wearing a poofy pink gown, you could probably manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So can I be whoever i choose? Or do we just get whoever we can find in the store.\" you asked hesitantly. You tried to think of who would be the least objectionable princess to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my mom made most of the costume a couple weeks ago,\" Keira explained. \"She's makes costumes for local plays, so she makes the best stuff. But I told her we had a new friend in our group and she said she could make one more princess dress before Halloween, so you just have to figure out who you want to be and she can make it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which princesses are taken already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to be Belle,\" Liz said. \"Ellen chose Elsa, Keira chose Ariel, Becky chose Aurora, Jennifer chose Tiana, and Tammy is going to be Anna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at least all the pink dresses were already spoken for. Then Keira had an idea. \"How about Cinderella? I bet you'd make a beautiful Cinderella and her dress is so pretty. Mom would love to make a Cinderella dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitated. Cinderella's dress wasn't pink, but it was pretty poofy and girly. You weren't sure about that. Still, you wanted to join your friends and Cinderella's dress was pretty sparkly, which you did like.</span></div></div>",

I think they couldn't break the spell on any of the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samantha's spell must be powerful,\" you remarked.

I'm sure you'll get used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got your ballet clothes right here,\" Mom said. \"Let's go change in the bathroom.\" She thank Madame Sokolov andled you toward the nearest bathroom.

I'll survive not knowing the difference between a tutu and a ballet shirt,\" Christina retorted as she rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat struck a nerve. You couldn't help but feel she was talking down to you. \"Right back at you. Stop whining about your clothes and start learning to enjoy yourself,\" you snapped at her. \"When are you going to realize how lucky we are to not be stupid boys anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly realized there was a presence behind you, and you turned around fearing that Mom or Hannah had just heard you. Fortunately, it was just Liz, who had just caught up with you. You looked back at Christina, awaiting a response from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Christina was basically speechless. Your loyalty to your new gender and your growing rejection of your old one she simply couldn't understand.  Triumphant, you took Liz's hand and pulled her toward your room, leaving Christina to consider what you said and how to get out of her current predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz giggled as you pulled her into your room. \"Nothing's ever boring with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded in agreement. \"Yeah, but I wish it would be sometimes.\" Now was your chance to ask Liz about what Mom had overheard. \"How much did Mom hear me say back in the ballet studio?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz shrugged. \"I don't know, maybe all of it. She was smiling when I noticed her.\" You sighed depressed by this news. \"Is it really the worst thing that your Mom heard you say you're glad you're a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess not,\" you admitted. \"And she probably knows it already. She's really good at knowing stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the sooner you tell them you like being girly, the sooner Hannah will stop trying to pressure you to be girly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to admit Liz had a point, but it wasn't easy to crush your old ego, even though you really wanted to. \"You wanna sleepover tonight?\" you asked, changing the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to, but Mom won't let me on a school night,\" Liz said. \"She'll be here to pick me up soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you decided to make the most of your time. You spent the next ten minutes showing Liz all the clothes you had bought over the weekend. Finally, it was time. You heard Mrs. Belacourt come in downstairs and soon after that, you and Liz were called downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled as she say you and you knew why immediately. You hadn't changed out of your ballet clothes. Your pink ballet skirt hung around your waist like an admission of guilt. You tried to ignore her approving gaze, but it was hard to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thank you for taking Liz to and from ballet, Natalie,\" Mrs. Belacourt said. She turned to you. \"I'll see you for more magic lessons tomorrow.\" You smiled. You did love improving your magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye, Lucy. See you in school tomorrow,\" Liz waved as she left with her Mom. You waved back with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the door closed, Mom turned back to you. \"Well, my daughter, anything you wish to talk about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed. \"No...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom had a knowing grin on her face. \"You look very pretty in that outfit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face got even redder. \"Thanks...I...I feel pretty in it.\" This was bad. It looked like Mom had your cornered. If you didn't get out of this, you might end up having an honest conversation with her.</span></div></div>",

I'm glad I don't have some stupid boy brain that makes me believe anything Mel tells me.\" Christina blushed, realizing it was foolish to take Mel at face value.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy, be nice,\" Mom corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Mommy.\" Christina just had a way of making you so frustrated and annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Lucy is right,\" Mom told Christina. \"You shouldn't believe what Mel tells you. She's doing it to get under your skin. Frankly, I don't blame her for doing so. You've been doing everything you can to annoy and frustrate my daughters since you've been here.\" She pointed to Hayley. \"Hayley is one of the most patient young women I've met, and you even have her wanting to dress you up just to embarrass you.\" Hayley nodded. She wasn't proud of it, but it was true. \"Witches are allowed to physically or mentally change their children if it is in their best interest. When the witch council sent you here, I was given similar power over you, and if you keep up the way you've been going, I won't hesitate to give you a more feminine outlook on life. I don't want to, but I will if necessary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina frowned at that. \"So you did do something like that to Lucy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head. \"I honestly never had to. Lucy adjusted all on her own. Even in the beginning she wasn't as panicked and angry as you are now. She became my daughter so quickly that I honestly wondered if someone else had cast a spell on her, but I kept a close eye and I'm certain no one ever did. Lucy is simply who she was always meant to be. That's what I want for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"I like who I am. Even if someone did cast a spell on me, I'm happy now and I never want to go back to being a boy.\" The thought of being John again was truly abhorrent to you at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom chuckled as she patted your head. \"Christina, you are lucky I've been having Lucy take magic lessons. She's been learning to control her powers and emotions. I'm guessing if she hadn't, you would be thinking much more girlishly at this point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled in response. Mom had you pegged. Even though you believed in not using powers to turn boys into girls against their will, Christina had tested the limits of that patience just like Rick and Steve had done before. \"I only want what is best for Christina, Mommy,\" you responded innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina looked confused. \"I don't get it. Why are you telling me all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To point out that if we wanted to transform your mind to match your body, any one of us in this household easily could. Except Hannah. You should consider yourself lucky her magic hasn't awakened yet. And again, I'm not taking the transform your mind option of the table, but we are trying to do what's best for you. Believe me when I say that,\" Mom assured Christina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why try to dress me up?\" Christina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because all you do is snap and yell at us,\" Hayley explained. \"It's a way to get back at you. I'm not proud of it, but that's the reaction you're getting to your behavior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you are stuck in this form,\" Mom added. \"You should explore what comes with it and see if there is anything you can like and enjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"Yeah, opening myself up to trying things really helped me a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't want to end up like you, Lucy,\" Christina shot back. \"You're way too girly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because that's who I want to be, Christina. I want to wear dresses and play with dolls and do ballet.\" You blushed realizing you had just admitted to liking ballet in front of your mother. \"But you don't have to. You could be a total tomboy if you want. Girls can be anything they want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I want to be a boy,\" Christina responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only chance you have of ever being a boy again will be if you relax and come to terms with your new form. Your internal resistance powers the curse and keeps your form locked,\" Mom explained. \"You accept the help we give you, and there may be a small chance you can be Harry again. Though no promises. If you force us to transform your mind, you'll be a girl for life and it won't bother you in the least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I have to learn to be a girl, if I ever want to be a boy again?\" Christina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like Lucy said, you don't have to be the girliest girl who ever walked the face of the earth. There are many ways to be a girl. All my daughters are very different,\" Mom pointed out. \"So you Christina, have a choice to make. How do you want this to go?\"</span></div></div>",

Maybe you should use magic on her? Get rid of that stupid boy brain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I kind of really want to.\" You thought for a moment. \"Boys are so stupid. They tease me for being being happy as a girl, but all they do is prove how mean and annoying boys are. Why would I want to be one of them? I can't believe I ever was one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded, completely understanding your logic. \"Yeah, I see what you mean. So what are you going to do about Christina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought back to last night and chuckled. \"Christina was right. I'm thinking that icky, gross, boy stuff has to go. I'm not letting her live in my house and make my Mom and my sisters' lives miserable. If Mom won't get rid of Christina's boy brain, I will do it myself tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice came from behind you. \"Oh, is that so?\" You closed your eyes in embarrassment, recognizing the voice behind you. You turned around to she Mom standing there with Hannah close behind her. Hannah was grinning widely. How could this happen again? Mom always seemed to be listening when you didn't want her to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...hi, Mom,\" you said with a blush. \"What are you doing here? Mrs. Belacourt is picking me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom chuckled to herself. \"I do have other daughters I have to pick up, you know?\" She pointed to Hannah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much did you hear?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you said about boys and what you are planning to do to Christina.\" Great, you were in trouble now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Mom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cut you off. \"I don't want to hear it, young lady. You are not to go behind my back casting spells on Christina. You know better than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Mom. I just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, she stopped you. \"I don't care. You don't do it.\" You face fell. \"That said, you are right that something needs to be done. I will not stand for my daughters being treated the way Christina has been treating you girls the last few days. She made her choice last night and there will be consequences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up excitedly. \"Really? You mean it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded and she crouched down to your level and scooped you up into her arms. \"I'm sorry if you feel like I wasn't doing enough to protect you girls. I'll keep you more informed from now on, but believe me, I'm not standing for Christina's behavior any more than you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and wrapped your arms around her. \"Thanks, Mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you think you're so protective of your family, sweetie? You got that from me.\" She kissed your forehead and put you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you going to do?\" Hannah asked curiously. \"You could have put a spell on her last night. Why didn't you?\" It was a fair question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The witch council may have given me full authority to do whatever I need to do to Christina, but I don't want to cut her mother out of the process entirely. That would be wrong,\" Mom explained. \"I didn't want to do anything before I talked the options over with Susan Rich, but I'm on my way there right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if she doesn't want you to do anything?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"Then I'll still do what I have to do. Like I said this can't continue. Christina is currently a danger to herself and others. Something must be done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you with whatever spell you cast, Mommy?\" you asked. \"I really want to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, we'll have to see how complicated a spell we're talking.\" Mom looked up. \"Your ride is here.\" You turned around and sure enough, Mrs. Belacourt was pulling up in her car. You and Liz began to head down toward it after saying goodbye, but first Hannah pulled you into a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so proud of you, Lucy,\" she said, causing you to blush. Her approval meant the world to you, as you were starting to idolize her just a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What for?\" you asked, at little unsure what brought this on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah smiled. \"We'll talk about it later. See you at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, but feeling good, you bounced off to Mrs. Belacourt's car.</span></div></div>",

Cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. Maybe bringing Hannah wasn't the best idea. \"Not exactly, Hannah. We'd have to be careful about how we do it or she might catch. Little things, like saying she has nice hair after she combs it. Or commenting on a blouse she's wearing. We subtly encourage her to be more feminine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan thought for a second. \"That doesn't sound too bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"It's pretty harmless, but there is one risk. If it works too well, Christina may end up enjoying her situation a little too much. She might no longer want to be a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan leaned back and paused again to think. \"I'd rather have a happy daughter than have Christina keep doing stupid and dangerous things that will end up harming herself and others.

Let me sleep on it tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"I understand, but we can't wait too long. Christina's attitude in my house has been toxic, and I will not allow my daughters to suffer it any longer. I can't promise I can hold off taking more drastic action if we wait. I'm coming to you as a courtesy. Witch law states I have full authority to use magic as I see fit on Christina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, and I do appreciate you keeping me involved.

Mom bit her lip; it was obvious that Christina had used some kind of spell, and had collapsed with exhaustion. It must had been done after she had arrived home from school, as Christina was still in her cheer uniform, which was something mom knew Christina disliked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you get a book?\" mom said to herself. She glanced, and frowned. \"Melanie\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with Melanie?\" Hannah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a slight magic signature on that book, meaning its Mel's.

Anyone could had stolen it, and Christina is especially stupid for being the one who did! Especially since this book isn't one that I gave to her. Melanie must had gotten one from her 'friends'.

As Christina pulled herself up, Mom got a clear look at what spell the  boy-turned-girl had cast. It was as she feared, a gender spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, it didn't work, you foolish girl,\" Mom scolded. She felt furious. \"I told you your form is locked. I just hope your spell didn't transfer onto someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina groaned. \"I don't care. I had to try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom looked shocked at that response. \"You don't care if some other poor person suffers the same fate you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't. No one cares what I want, so why should I care about anyone else?\" Christina shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom's eyes flashed with anger. \"Of course, I care about what you want. All I've been trying to do is help you that MAYBE you have a chance to be male again. But this incident just proves that allowing you that is dangerous, especially to my daughters. One of them could have been hit by the gender changing spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina chuckled. \"That would serve them right after everything they've put me through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took all of Mom's restraint not to cast a spell on Christina right there, but she held back. It would be against her principles to react in anger against a child. She'd have to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina noticed Mom's hesitation and grabbed Mel's book of the table. Scoffing, she headed toward the stairs to go up to her room. \"You can't stop me from trying, Mrs. Harrison. I don't care what you try to do to me. I'll never stop trying to be a boy again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom punched the table in frustration as Christina went up the stairs. She knew that Christina wouldn't have the energy to cast another spell for a few hours. The girl still wasn't trained in her magic, so Mom would have some time to calm down and think before she acted. It was at this moment, you returned from your magic lesson. You moved to her as soon as you saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mommy? Did something happen?\" you asked a little concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom looked at you with surprise. Was her frustration that obvious? \"Well, why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Donny Johnson, the boy next door?\" Mom nodded in response. Donny was the son of your neighbors, a sweet pre-school aged boy, who Hayley babysat for sometimes. She had a feeling she knew where this was going. \"Well, he's looking a little...girlier,\" you explained to her. \"I just saw his parents taking him to the Doctor. They looked really worried about what was happening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom groaned. \"Christina's spell...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes turned fierce, wanting to protect your family. \"Christina cast a spell? Anything could have happened!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young lady, don't you dare use any magic on her. She's drained from her attempt earlier and she won't be able to do anything until I get back and deal with her myself.\" Mom started to grab her things to go out. She had a different fire to put out first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked confused. \"Wait, Mommy, where are you going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom looked around to see where she left her car keys. \"I've got to go after the Johnsons. They're regular humans, if they are taking their gender transformed son to the doctor, we run the risk of being exposed as witches. I've got to turn the boy back and erase all their memories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Mommy, it's almost dark and the Morgana sisters are on the loose. It might be dangerous. Can't you call the witch council?\" You were getting worried now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head as she found her keys. \"They wouldn't be able to respond in time. I'll be careful sweetie, don't worry. Hannah and Christina are upstairs. Stay out of trouble.\" She kissed your forehead and headed out the door, passing Mel and Hayley on her way out the door. She shot Mel a look. \"You and I need to have a talk later.\" She quickly got in her car and drove off hoping to catch the Johnsons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's her damage?\" Mel asked. You explained what you knew, that Christina had cast a gender spell on the neighbor's son, but you honestly weren't sure why she was upset with Mel. Mel shrugged, unconcerned, as she shut and locked the door. \"She's probably just still totally annoyed I'm hanging with Cassie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With good reason...\" Hayley muttered under her breath. Mel heard, but chose to ignore her older sister. \"We should check on Hannah and Christina,\" Hayley added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you began to walk up the stairs. As you reached the top, Hannah poked her head out of her room. \"Everything okay?\" she asked worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Mom just had to go out for a bit,\" Hayley reassured her. \"She'll be back soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Christina?\" Hannah asked. \"I heard her storm into her room. I heard her shouting at Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four of you sisters had your disagreements, but one thing you were all sure of was that Christina was a problem. One that needed to be dealt with. \"Mom said not to do anything to Christina while she was gone,\" you informed the others, but you weren't sure you were okay with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley and Mel looked at each other as they considered this. Finally, Mel turned back to you and asked, \"You always do what your Mommy tells you like a good little girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glared at Mel. \"No, I'm a big girl. I make my own decisions,\" you responded defiantly, even if, in reality, you mostly indeed did what your mother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear it, Sis,\" Mel said as she messed with your hair. \"Let's go pay Christina a visit then.\" She started off toward Christina's room. You and Hannah trotted after her. Hayley paused for a second, but then followed as well.</span></div></div>",

You could set up a trap with, like, the entire witch council lying in wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to use your little sister as evil witch bait?\" Hayley responded in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, why would we leave Lucy alone after this? The Morganas would never buy that,\" Elvira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel shrugged. \"I said it was a dumb idea. But I'm just saying, Lucy has, like, a known history of running off half-cocked and taking on big bad witches. It wouldn't be so unbelievable.\" The room was silent. Mel actually made a decent point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira shook her head. \"I'm still not endangering my Granddaughter like that. She's only a child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I want to do it?\" you asked suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel, amused, patted your head. \"See what I mean?\"</span></div></div>",

In front of her two tall and slender women stood, sizing her up. Eva was the eldest with long red hair and hazel eyes while Helena had long strawberry blond hair and green eyes. Both were wearing long black dresses and flats. They watched in bemusement as Christina struggled against her bonds, throwing death glares at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my are you feisty.\" Amused, Eva said. \"Clearly you are a transformed boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what we had gathered, you are on a quest to return to your boyish state.\" Grinning, Helena added. \"We can help you with that as we had helped many others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina stopped struggling, looking at the two women with a distrusting eye. Eva removed the duct tape with a painful pull then took the cloth out of Christina's mouth. \"What do you say, kid?\" Calmly, she asked. \"Do you want to become a boy again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already went to an expert in gender spells and she double crossed me for some mischief.\" Angry, Christina snapped. \"What guarantee do I have that you won't do the same?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't.\" Simply, Helena replied. \"It's take our offer or take a hike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why kidnap me then?\" Worried, Christina demanded. \"Why not talk to me on the street?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"i'm certain Elvira Strange told you.\" Coldly, Eva said. \"We are wanted by the witch council for working outside of their silly laws.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We give help to transformed boys who decide they do not want to be witches by ensuring they will never be witches again.\" With a smirk, Helena said. \"The only catch is, the witch in question has to want it to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina remembered mom talking about how she nearly lost her powers due to these two women and realized that her brother had stormed the house before she could say 'yes' to whatever offer they had tried to trick her into. She bit her lip, not certain of what to do. On one hand, she had an opportunity to become a boy again. On the other hand, she had no guarantee that they were trying to trick her just as they almost did to mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your answer!\" Forcefully, Eva demanded. \"We don't have all night!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We should steal her magic, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" agreed Helena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we also may want to turn her into the happy girl she so fears being. Mind so focused on boys and looking pretty. Of course, that's not all there is to being a girl, but since it is all she seems to think it is than perhaps that's all it should be for her.\" Christina made another move to get free hearing Eva suggest this option, but it was to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena nodded. \"That could be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then again maybe leaving in her mind intact while trapping her forever as a girl would be more appropriate punishment for her rudeness. We could even age her down, so she could be reunited with her old friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, that one you can't do,\" Christina responded quickly, desperate to get some power back in this situation. \"Mrs. H said my age is locked. She was only able to make me 13 again with a lot of struggle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sisters laughed at this show of defiance. Helena quickly deflated Christina's retort. \"What do take us for, child? We've been stealing magic from transformed boys in the area for a week, and we stole magic from many more in other regions before that. We've got more power than Natalie Harrison could ever dream of possessing. If we want to make you six, or eight, or one-hundred and three, we can do it with ease.\" This shut Christina up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEva continued to think. \"You know, sister, we could also turn her into a cat, like we did those other transformed boys we've captured. Though I suppose we've collected a bit too many at this point. They can be ever so troublesome to take care of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena shrugged. \"I still say we don't need to keep every cat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEva made a pouty face. \"Oh, but they are sooo cute, sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lightbulb suddenly went off in Helena's head. \"Wait a second, sister. This girl was friends with the new Princess.\" Christina perked up. Princess? Who was a Princess? \"She's been living in the Princess's house after all. The Princess was even there at the window as we took this wretched one. You know how we've been waiting to get our hands on the Princess. She's got more magic of any transformed boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina couldn't help herself. \"Are you saying Lucy's a Princess? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena ignored her. \"We could turn this girl into our mindless agent, tasked with the soul purpose of bringing the Princess to us. She could get closer than Elvira will ever let us get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina suddenly had an idea, but what she was about to do was a total betrayal. She wasn't sure she'd ever be able to look Mrs. Harrison in the face again for even suggesting this, but she was desperate to be a boy again, and, as far as she was concerned the Harrison family had turned on her first by trying to have her accept her new form. \"Wait. You don't need to put any spells on me. I'll bring you Lucy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caught the sisters' attention. They seemed assumed by the idea. \"You'd betray them all? Why? To keep your magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina shook her head. \"No, you can take my magic too. It's brought me nothing, but trouble. But if what you say about having enough magic to change my age is true, you must have enough to turn me into a boy. Take my magic, make me a boy, and I will bring you Lucy Harrison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sisters looked at each other unsure. It certainly was a tempting offer, but this child had been obnoxious to them, and they would so like to torture him accordingly. And what assurance did they have that Christina would do what they ask once she got what she wanted. Besides, even if Christina would have an easier time getting to you, the two were confident that they could find a way to do it themselves. It just might be more troublesome.</span></div></div>",

You rubbed your eyes trying to wake up. \"Is it time for school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm keeping you home from school today,\" Mom said. \"You missed a lot last night and I really need your help today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis got your attention. \"What with? How'd it go with the Johnsons?\" you asked hopping out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. She clearly hadn't slept much last night. \"I made it just in time. They have no memory of last night and their son is back to being their son, but that's not the reason I need your help. It's about Christina. Come on, you can change later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Mommy\" you said as you followed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard about your adventure last night. I'm very proud of you. Proud of Mel too, oddly, even though I am very glad you didn't end up going with her plan. But you were very brave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled hearing this. \"Thanks, Mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, after you went to bed last night Christina faced Elvira's judgment. She decided that Christina's out-of-control behavior recently has been so extreme because Christina doesn't have you as a friend anymore. When you were John and she was Harry, you kept him grounded. You kept him from falling apart like she is now,\" Mom explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he still bought magic items, which is what started this whole thing in the first place, so I guess I didn't do that great a job. Even though I'm glad it happened. I wouldn't be a girl otherwise,\" you pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure about that. I have a feeling you would have become a girl somehow anyway, but that's not the point.\" Mom got back on topic. \"The point is that Elvira feels that restoring that friendship is key to helping Christina, and with the current age gap between you that is impossible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Liz is my best friend now, and she's a way better friend than Christina ever was.\" Your eyes went wide in horror. \"You're not going to make me 13, are you? I want to grow up normal, Mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom was quick to reassure you. \"No, we know how you enjoy you're knew life and we wouldn't punish you to help Christina. That girl is in a lot of trouble.\" She decided not to mention that Christina had been ready to sell you out to the Morganas to reclaim her boyhood, but Elvira had been very displeased about that. \"And I'm not asking you to give up your friendship with Liz. I'm just asking you to show Christina the ropes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ropes for what?\" you asked as Mom opened the door to the guest bedroom. Inside sat a girl, about your age, wearing yellow pjs. \"Christina?\" you said in surprise. You turned to Mom. \"I thought you said her age was locked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said only Elvira could possibly have enough power to change it. Turns out I wasn't wrong. This is part of your Grandmother's judgment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Lucy,\" Christina said meekly. You couldn't get a read on her. She seemed frustrated, angry, but also guilty and sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Christina,\" you responded cautiously. You turned to Mom again. \"So she's my age now? I'm supposed to teacher her how to be a girl like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina made a face that seemed to disapprove of that idea, but she didn't say anything. Mom spoke instead. \"Go slow, like we did with you. If she wants any hope of being a boy again, she needs to be at ease with her situation. We've seen I can't do that for her. Neither can her parents. Only you can reach her, Lucy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and turned back to Christina. \"Don't worry, Christina. If you really want to be a boy again, I'll help you. I promise. But you're going to have to trust me, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina sighed. \"Yeah, but Elvira says she won't make me 13 again. I have to age up naturally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded again. \"Well, we can be friends again now, I hope. Even if you want to be a boy again.\" Though the thought of being friends with a boy was strange to you, but for Christina, you would try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled approvingly. Maybe this would work. \"You two are going to stay home from school today so you can get used to this.\"</span></div></div>",

Behind her was Hayley with a worried look on her face with Mel behind her, curious and Hannah behind her gripping her teddy bear nervously. \"Do you think this will really work?\" Wincing, Hannah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It better.\" Frowning, Mel said. \"Christina is more stubborn than Harry ever was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If anyone can get through her thick head and ego, it's Lucy.\" Smiling, Hayley said. \"They had a special kind of connection when they were boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush.\" Whispering, mom scolded. \"I'm trying to listen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you got your first wish.\" Managing a smile, you said. \"You're my age now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was like pulling teeth with pair of pliers to get it though.\" Pouting, Christina countered. \"Now, its gong to be even harder to be a boy again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought back to when you went through your own transition, though it was not easy. It all seemed more like a distant dream then, only bits and pieces came to mind. Finally, you remembered something important and smiled a little more. \"Girl trending a left turn off, what the deal-e-o?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina turned to you, surprised then frowned. \"False advertising, not the deal of the century and so not my style.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are they doing?\" Wincing, Hayley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"It's nonsense language.\" Bemused, she said. \"She and Liz made it up together to drive us all crazy when they wanted to talk in private.\" She chuckled. \"When she and Christina were John and Harry, they had a similar secret language which is why she picked up on it so fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour smile did not diminish. \"By George, Ke-mo-sah-bee I'll have my mixed up friend good as new before you can say Abracadabra.\" Lightly punching Christina's shoulder, you said. \"It's all the latest craze. Hurry on down, limited time offer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tint grin touched the corners of Christina's mouth. \"You are so weird.\" With a half chuckle, she said. \"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are afraid of the same things I was afraid of.\" Turning serious, you said. \"Only you had it worse because you felt you had to deal with it alone.\" You sighed. \"Mommy told me that when you and I were boys, I kind of kept you grounded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were the only one who understood what I was going through.\" Looking hurt, Christina said. \"Then they took that away from me and I was completely alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you just were scared to ask for help.\" Scolding, you said. Sighing, you touched Christina's shoulder. \"Mommy told me that I reached out to you before so I'm reaching out again. You just have to let me help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina began to cry and you pulled her into a hug and began to cry yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a start.\" Sighing, mom said. \"Only, like before, its going to take a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Worried, Hannah demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom turned away from the door and urged everyone to the sitting room, out of ear shot. \"When John first reached out to Harry, it took weeks for him to completely get through to him.\" Softly, she explained. \"He had placed some rather thick walls around his heart and mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As Christina, those walls are back and stronger than ever.\" Serious, Hayley said. \"Mom and I sent John to try to get through to Harry because he was acting out at school and at home being left alone for weeks to months at a time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember that.\" Worried, Mel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of that was wiped from your memories.\" Serious, mom said. \"Harry's actions were bringing unwanted attention to this house and his obsession with collecting magical artifacts made it worse. John eased Harry's anger and helped mold him into a better person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, as Christina, she fell into that loneliness all over again.\" Wincing, Mel said. \"Is she really in serious trouble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not any more than the trouble she was in as Harry the first time.\" Bemused, mom said. \"Only this time, she knows about magic and witches so she is on much thinner ice now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully Lucy can get through to her.\" Serious, Hayley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"Time will tell.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You frowned as you shifted through Christina's closet. \"There aren't any kids clothes here. Only teenage stuff.\" Most of it was boy's clothes Christina had refused to give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina nodded. \"Yeah, I only have the clothes I'm wearing. Elvira didn't bother to change anything else.\" She shifted uncomfortably in her pjs. Even they must be too girly in her mind. Probably the sunny yellow color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou considered changing all Christina's clothes with magic, but you knew from experience she'd just refuse it all on principal, saying that the clothing was be too girly or worried that they'd make her think like a girl. Wow, you had a lot to teach her. \"Let's go to my room. You can borrow some of my stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsurprisingly, Christina froze up. \"Your clothes? But you've gone all girly-girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes. \"You really need to stop saying that. You don't actually know anything about girls.\" You took Christina's hand. \"Just trust me and come on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina reluctantly followed. You liked her a lot better without all the raging teenage hormones. She was less resistant, though she still seemed concerned. \"What do you mean I don't know anything about girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you seem to think that all girls like pink and princesses and whatever,\" you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only recently, when I realized how much fun they could be. But actually Christina, I started liking those things after I started liking being a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina was surprised to hear this. You and her hadn't spent much time together before she moved into your house, so she didn't have firsthand knowledge of how you had moved from deviant boy trapped in a girl's body to happy ballet-taking 100% girl who dreaded the idea of being a boy again. \"Well, what made you want to be a girl, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The more I thought about it the more I realized I felt more comfortable as a girl than I ever did as a boy. My friends, my magic, and my love for sparkles helped too.\" You giggled at this. Christina did not. She was deep in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you came to your room and you pulled her over to your closet. \"The point is,\" you continued. \"I learned that being a girl doesn't just mean you like princesses and stuff. It can mean anything you want, and that includes how to dress.\" You pulled out a pair of pants and a t-shirt. \"See, girl's clothes, but not pink and princess-y.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina reached forward and looked at the shirt. It was light green with design of cheetahs running on it. The pants were basic black, but they did flare out a bit at the ankle. She was quietly thinking about it, while you wondered whether she'd go for it. You were pretty sure you'd hooked her with the shirt, since Cheetahs had been one of her favorite animals since she was a young boy, but the pants could go either way. You hoped she'd go for them though. You didn't have many pairs of pants, preferring leggings, and the other ones you had were bejeweled. You did like sparkles after all. Finally, Christina spoke. \"I guess these are okay, but what about your mom's no tomboy rule?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged. \"She put me in charge of you. I have no such rule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in a while, you saw Christina flash a genuine smile. \"Thanks, Lucy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled back. You liked it when Christina called you Lucy, and not John. John was long gone, and hopefully Christina was starting to recognize that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the two of you were dressed for the day, Christina wearing the cheetah shirt and blank pants. You wearing a purple shirt that spelled out \"Girls Rule\" in sequins and grey leggings. Somehow you had convinced Christina to let you brush her hair. She seemed to be regretting that choice. \"Ow, that hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, you got tons of tangles in there. It's like you have brushed your hair once since we became girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I probably haven't,\" Christina admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I promise it will feel better once it's brushed,\" you assured her. \"Maybe we can get Hayley to take us to the mall today. We could buy you some new clothes so you won't be stuck borrowing mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina scoffed at that suggestion. \"I've been there enough times already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not with me,\" you pointed out. \"I won't force anything on you. You can choose what you want.\" Christina smiled hearing this. \"Except boys clothes,\" you added, sensing what she was thinking. Christina's smile quickly turned into a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to be a boy again, you have to be comfortable with your girl self,\" you explained. That wasn't exactly right, but it was as close an explanation as you could muster. \"Boys clothes are hiding from what you've become. You want to be something else, you can't hide from this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina sighed. She didn't like hearing that, but it was a better offer than she had been getting from anyone else. \"Fine. But only if we go to the arcade there too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned at this. \"That's fine with me. I still love beating you at video games.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On this rainy day, Hayley brought you and Christina to the mall while Mom got some sleep at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShopping with Christina was a mixed success. Anything that was too tight, she refused. Anything that was two loose, she refused. And it goes without saying that anything pink, purple or at all feminine, she refused. Even so, you, Christina, and Hayley managed to find a decent collection of clothes that Christina was able to stomach. Mostly tee shirts with unisex slogans and pants. Girls shorts were too short for her liking and skirts and dresses were out of the question. Socks and underwear were a bit trickier, but Christina eventually agreed to some plainer pairs of each. You didn't force anything on her, but you knew this was the first tiny step in a long journey. She seemed skittish and terrified that you were going to trick her into going further than she was comfortable with though. When you found a sparkly dress you wanted for yourself, Christina freaked a bit, but once you explained it was for you she calm down somewhat, but still didn't look happy with your excitement over the outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result, you were somewhat afraid to tell Christina that Liz was supposed to sleep over tonight. You didn't know how she was going to react to that news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the new clothes were put in the car, the three of you returned inside the mall to visit the arcade, when Christina discovered a new drawback to her new age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit,\" she shouted as her last Pinball went flying past the flippers. \"I used to be better at this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't curse like that,\" you chided her quietly as you looked around to make sure no one had heard. Fortunately, no one was close. Hayley was sitting quietly on a nearby bench reading a book, but even she didn't hear. Christina's language was not surprising though. You had a similar tendency to curse before you mind had adjusted to match your current body. Now it felt...wrong. \"Of course, you used to be better. You've got a new body and you're not used to using it yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina sighed, frustrated. \"It's like I'm playing for the first time again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are. So am I.\" You tried to be reassuring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got a higher score than I did,\" Christina pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned. \"Well, I was always better at pinball than you.\" There was silence for a moment, then Christina started to giggle, which made you happy . \"See, we can still have fun together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina nodded. \"I guess so. Feels kind of like when we were little kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christina, we are little kids.\" This resulted in more giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you two dweebs giggling about?\" You and Christina turned to see a boy about a year older than you standing behind you. You didn't recongize him, so he must have gone to a different school. Though what he was doing skipping school on a Friday, you didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. Just having fun with my friend playing pinball,\" you responded politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, get out of the way.\" He pushed past the two of you. \"What do a couple of dumb girls know about pinball? It's a boy's game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina was shocked into silence by this behavior, but you weren't one to stand for being insulted. \"Oh yeah, I bet I could get a higher score than you,\" you challenged him. At this point, Hayley looked up from her book to see if you needed help, but decided you could handle it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy looked at you like you were talking complete nonsense, but proving your ineptness appealed to him. \"You're on, sparkle-boots.\" He was referring to rain boots you were wearing, which were purple and sparkly. Christina had groaned when you chose them for yourself at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to be out done you responded, \"Bring it, blondie.\" He clearly didn't like being called that, though his hair was indeed quite blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next five minutes, the battle raged (honestly, despite the heated competition neither of you were that good at pinball). It was close, but eventually you emerged victorious by 50 points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!\" you shouted at the blonde boy once the your run ended. \"See, girls can play pinball.\" Christina rolled her eyes, well aware, that the scores both you and the blonde boy got paled in comparison to what John and Harry had achieved last summer, but they were 13 and better practiced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" the blonde boy rolled his eyes and began walking away. \"Girls are the worst.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a slight rage come over you. How dare this boy? You managed to control your magic so as not to be curse him unintentionally, but you also weren't going to let that insult go. With a wave of your hand and a quick chant under your breath, you cast a fabric alteration spell on the boys visible socks, making them pink and ruffled on the top. Total girl socks. The best part, he didn't noticed. He walked off, sure to be embarrassed and confused down the road. You noticed Christina watching you. \"You have a problem with what I just did?\" you asked as soon as the boy was out of earshot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina bit her lip and thought, but then shook her head. \"No, he was a jerk and it isn't like you turned him into a girl or anything. You just messed with his socks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see why I think boys are annoying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina took a little offense to that. \"Come on, not all boys are like that.\" You didn't dignify that with a response, choosing just to roll your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley walked up to you two. \"If you two are quite done getting into trouble with boys, what do you say to some lunch and ice cream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Christina looked at each other and smiled. \"Let's get burgers!\" you both said in unison.</span></div></div>",

Hayley had gone out and Mom was still asleep after her long night. Christina was also back in her own room napping. The day had been a lot for her and she had also had a tough night before, so some rest was very much needed. You still hadn't told her Liz was sleeping over tonight, and were worried how she was going to react when she found out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a knock at your door. You looked at the clock, it was a little too early for Liz to be here, school was still going on for another 15 minutes, plus she would have rung the doorbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in,\" you called. Mel entered the room, with Cassie following her, much to your surprise. \"Mommy's going to freak if she sees Cassie here,\" you told Mel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel rolled her eyes. \"Mom doesn't choose who my friends are and she's still out like a light. You going to tell on me?\" You looked from Cassie to Mel, then shook your head. \"Good girl.\" You frowned at Mel's condescending attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you two want?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie smiled, clearly appreciating your fire. \"Mel told me how you were ready to turn Christina's mind totally female before she got captured yesterday. And I heard about that stunt you pulled on that boy today in the arcade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed. \"How'd you hear about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm always looking for promising new recruits for my coven. One of my coven sisters saw the whole thing. Told me about immediately.\" Cassie gave you an approving pat. \"All this considered I think you're awakening to the truth about witches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What truth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That witches are superior to humans and girls are superior to boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. \"Some of my best friends are normal humans and girls aren't better than boys. Boys can just be super rude and annoying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie nodded. \"Name a boy who you haven't found rude and annoying since you became a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...uh...,\" you had to think for a second. Cassie was taking advantage of your young age to confuse you. \"Well, there's Pi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie giggled. \"Pi Cutie is well on his way to becoming a witch girl. He barely counts as a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure what to say next, so you eventually just conceded the point. \"I guess that's true...Boys are pretty annoying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel knelt down next to you. \"And didn't it, like, feel so satisfying to give that annoying boy at the arcade those pink ruffled socks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself nodding slowly. \"Yeah...I kind of wanted to do more too. But Christina was there.\" You hadn't admitted this to anyone yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie patted your head. \"See what I mean? You have the power to make sure boys don't annoy anyone ever again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...that's wrong to do that...without they're say so,\" you protested weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie shook her head. \"Why? Aren't the boys happier afterwards? Aren't you happier? Aren't Rachel and Stephanie happier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah...but, Tim...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim has always been a jerk to you, Lucy,\" Mel pointed out. \"Why should you care what he wants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's true.\" You felt cornered and confused. You felt like you were being pressured into something, but you didn't know what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Join my coven, Lucy,\" Cassie finally said. \"We can show you your true nature as a witch and how to deal with all these annoying boys around you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought for a second, but shook your head. \"No, Cassie. I don't want to be part of your coven. I'm way too young for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie frowned. Her mother, Darla, had promised her a new cell phone if she got Lucy to come to a coven meeting. She wasn't sure why, but she wasnt going to turn that offer down. Still, there were other ways to get Lucy to come. \"Fine, don't join. But maybe you could come with your sister to one of our meetings. You could learn a lot about witch culture and you wouldn't need to do anything in return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis idea appealed to you much more. No strings attached and a chance to learn more about witches and covens. \"Okay, that might be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie's frown turned into a smile. \"It will be.\" She looked at Mel. \"You were right, Mel. You're little sister is pretty cool.\" You blushed hearing this, finding yourself sort of liking Cassie, not realizing how easily she was manipulating you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was the sound of the doorbell. \"Oh, that's probably Liz.\" You left the two older girls in your room as you bounded down the stairs.

Purple flame appeared in her hand. \"Back off my friend's sister, Lady. Who are you anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilly Sweetie?\" Mom said in surprise, still suffering from waking up suddenly due to your scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Lilly Sweetie?\" Hayley and Mel chorused in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie frowned. \"Why do I feel like I'm missing something here? Who is Lilly Sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A member of the Morgana coven who went missing the day before Mom escaped,\" Mel explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom frowned, not eager for Cassie to be hearing all this. She also wasn't liking how you were hanging onto her for protection. \"Cassie, Mel, would you two take Lucy upstairs and stay with her? I need to talk to Lilly in private.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. \"Awww come on, Mommy. I want to hear too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This matter does concern these girls. The three of them, in fact,\" Lilly said, as she pointed to you, Cassie, and Mel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom thought for a moment, then directed everyone into the living room. Hayley paused. She wanted to get back to her friend's house now that the emergency was over, but she was curious. She soon decided to follow everyone in. You all took seats, before Mom asked the question on everyone's mind. \"Where have you been Lilly? It's been almost 20 years with no sign of you.\" She quickly scanned Lilly magically to make she was indeed Lilly Sweetie. She was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly nodded. \"I've...I've been trying to live a normal life. Far away from magic.\" She took a picture out of her purse and showed it to you all. In the picture, Lilly sat with another woman, both smiling happily with two boys sitting next to them. \"That's my wife and our two sons. They don't know anything about witches, and I hope they never will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded, but knew that was unlikely. The two boys had magic heritage, which meant there was a high chance they'd be witches someday. \"You all look so happy, Lilly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are. It's almost worth me losing my magic all those years ago...\" Even so, Lilly looked sad as she said that. \"You see, the night before you escaped, Eva and Helena stole my magic from me. I fought them, but it was no use. They got everything and left me on the streets. I ran and built a new life for myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSympathy was never Cassie's strong point, so she cut to the chase. \"I don't get it. You said this involved us.\" She pointed to Mel next to her and you who was positioned in Cassie's lap. This familiarity didn't clearly displeased your mother, but Cassie was growing on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting to that,\" Lilly explained. \"Something went wrong during the magic transfer. They got my magic, but I got a part of them too. I'm connected to them, mentally. I...can hear they thoughts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're controlling you?\" you said in alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly shook her head quickly. \"No, no, nothing like that. I just can hear them. Not all the time, but bits and pieces. I doubt they even know or they would have killed me. Still, it's been a torture I've endured for 20 years when all I want to do is leave that life behind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom looked angry hearing this. \"I assume you heard enough that you could have help capture them over the last 20 years, or at least informed the witch council they were alive. Many people have gone missing this past week, Lilly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly hung her head in shame. \"I know. I just...didn't want to be a part of this all, but this afternoon I heard something I couldn't ignore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly paused, thinking how to phrase what she next said. \"You were always kind to me Natalie, so when I heard they were targeting your daughter, I had to do something. They are planning a trap for her, using the help of Darla Bane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie's eyes went narrow. She suddenly knew exactly what Lilly was saying. \"That's why my mom wanted me to bring Lucy to meet my coven. So the Morgana sisters could get at her where the witch council couldn't watch her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom's face turned fierce as she whipped her head toward Cassie. \"You were going to recruit my six-year-old daughter to a coven?!?!\"</span></div></div>",

She never tried to make me be part of her coven.\" Cassie looked at you in surprise. You hadn't really lied, Cassie didn't try to force you, but she had asked you and laid on some heavy pressure. She hadn't expected you to cover for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assure you, Mrs. Harrison. I wouldn't have even done that if I had known what my mother was thinking. I'd never offer up Lucy to the Morganas.\" Cassie sound genuine when she said that. She was hurt. She didn't have the best relationship with her mother, Darla, but she never expected this kind of betrayal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly nodded. \"One of the Morganas would have taken your place at the coven meeting. She and her sister would have then captured Lucy and, most likely, killed the rest of your coven members.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this made Cassie even more furious, but she was caught off guard when you squeezed her hand reassuringly. Cassie blushed, then thought of something. \"I have an idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom rolled her eyes. \"I'm sure it will be just as good an idea as your many schemes against Samantha Forrester. Those have gone so well for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel stood up for her friend. \"Mom, just hear her out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie continued before Mom had a chance to deny her further opportunity to speak. \"The coven meeting was planned for tomorrow, so we turn their trap into our trap. Make it a witch council sting and catch the sisters in the act.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom made a face. That was the obvious solution, but in her anger, she hadn't thought of it herself. Still, she had objections. \"I'm not about to put my six-year-old daughter in the middle of a sting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly shook her head. \"You don't have to. Take a page out of the Morgana book. They like disguises. Have witch council members disguised as your daughter and the coven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom clearly didn't like it, but she nodded. \"That could work, but to be honest, I don't trust either you or Cassie. Cassie has caused a lot of trouble for this family and you've been missing for 20 years and stood by while plenty of witches got kidnapped by these sisters.\" She thought for a second. \"I'll get in touch with the witch council and set everything up, but Lilly, you are spending the night under my mother's watch. And Cassie, you are spending the night here. I don't want either of you tipping the sisters off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel smiled and looked at Cassie. \"You know what this means? We can finally have a sleepover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie sighed. \"Yeah, but I've never been invited to a sleepover under such insulting circumstances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt pretty happy with this result. You'd get to know Cassie some more and Liz was sleeping over tonight as well. This sounded like a lot of fun. Only problem was how was Christina going to react to all this?</span></div></div>",

Pretty soon she decided the sleepover was more than she was ready for and she retreated to her room. You didn't chase her. You had a feeling she wasn't ready for it. What did surprise you however, was that Cassie and Mel kept on hanging out with the younger girls. Cassie seemed to genuinely enjoy spending time with you, Liz, and Hannah, which actually surprised her as much as it surprised you. Liz and Hannah were hesitant to spend time with Cassie, at first, given her reputation, but the two of them started to soften to her as the night went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy seven, the five of you were hanging out in your room, playing Monopoly. Mel had just landed on one of Hannah's hotel, which made the younger girl extremely happy. \"Christina's missing out,\" Hannah remarked as her celebration died down. \"What's she so afraid of? We're just playing board games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged. \"She's uncomfortable being around too many girls. She's still got a boy brain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine, then. I'm pretty sick of boys today,\" Hannah said. \"Tim was terrible in school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded in agreement. \"Yeah, he was mad about you getting him in trouble, Lucy.\" She was referring to when Mom caught Tim pulling your pigtail. \"He was bothering anyone you are friends with today. He even pushed Becky into some mud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnger flared up in you. How dare Tim pick on your sister and friends while you weren't there to defend them? \"He better watch out the next time I see him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis got Cassie and Mel giggling. \"See what I mean, Lucy?\" Cassie said. \"Boys are jerks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but nod at that, though Hannah looked confused. \"Wait, don't girls your age want boyfriends though?\" she asked Mel and Hannah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel and Cassie started cracking up even more. Mel pulled her sister into a hug. \"It's more complicated than that, Hannah. You'll see when your older.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah sighed. \"Why do teenagers and grown-ups always say that? Also hand over the money.\" She smiled and held out a demanding hand, still waiting for Mel to pay up for landing on her hotel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie turned to you. \"Lucy, did you tell Hannah and Liz how you dealt with boys today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed and recounted your tale of the boy in the arcade. Hannah found it hilarious, but Liz was unsure. \"You sure that was a good idea, Lucy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"It felt really good to do it. And come on, don't you wish you could of done something like that to Tim today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It only would have made him madder,\" Liz said, but after thinking for a second she added. \"It probably would have been pretty funny though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie shook her head. \"We're witches, girls. We shouldn't have to put up with it when boys get so high and mighty. They need to be taking down a few pegs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But isn't that mean?\" Liz asked hesitantly. \"They don't want to be turned into girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but I'm happier now that I'm a girl. Rachel and Stephanie seem pretty happy too,\" you said, basically repeating what Cassie had argued to you earlier that day. Cassie smiled and gave you an approving pat on the head, which caused you to smile back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz considered this. \"I guess that's true. I mean, I'm really glad you're not still a boy, Lucy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"Being a witch girl is cooler than being a dumb boy.\" You looked at Cassie. \"I guess I have you to thank for that, since you sold Harry those glasses.\" You hugged the older girl next to you. \"Thanks, Cassie. You really are cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis action took Cassie by surprise. \"Y...You're so welcome, Luce.\" Her face looked sad all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Cassie?\" you asked quietly.</span></div></div>",

My father never had any interest in being one and left us before I was born. My mom is a pretty power-hungry witch though she's never had much success at it, other than some allies on the witch council. She's always looking for ways to increase that power and basically sees my brother and I as tools to help her with that. She has been cold to me, as long as I can remember. She doesn't actually want children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused at this admission, collecting herself before continuing. \"My brother is a few years older, and, since I was born, he took his frustration with our mother out on me. He's magic is still dormant, which makes him even angrier, especially since I development my magic at a pretty young age, like you Lucy. He's pretty jealous of me. Granted, I probably don't help matters by turning him into a little girl all the time, but at least he's not angry then. And he gets really angry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, Liz, and Hannah were listening silently, hanging on every word. \"I don't really have a family. I just live with a group of people who hate me. So I guess I play the bad, rebellious girl as a front, but really, all I've ever wanted is what you girls have. That's why I started my coven. For sisterhood. And that's why I feel a little envious and sad when I'm here with you all. Cause I don't have awesome little sisters like you do, Mel.\" You and Hannah smiled at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel hugged her friend. \"You've got me. We're friends now and I will always be there for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Mel broke the hug, you moved in, giving a hug of your own to Cassie. \"Like I said, you sold Harry the glasses that made me, Lucy. So I guess that makes me like your family too. Would you like me to be your little sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie chuckled at this while wiping away a lone tear that was streaming down her face. \"Really, Lucy? I'd...I'd like that a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never had a big sister,\" Liz, the only child, said. \"Will you be mine too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm not getting left out,\" Hannah declared with a smile. \"Be my big sister too. I'm the best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a brat,\" Mel contradicted, as she messed Hannah's hair. Hannah stuck out her tongue at Mel in response. \"But she's a great sister too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, all three of you can be my sisters,\" Cassie responded, genuinely touched. \"Mel, your family is the greatest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only sometimes,\" Mel chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get any ideas, though, Cassie. Just cause we're sisters now doesn't mean I'm joining your coven. I'm going to start my own coven someday.

How come you didn't invite me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the other girls in the room and smiled. \"You said we were all too girly for you and you went to hide in your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina blushed. \"Well, yeah. You are. But...now I'm bored.\" This revelation was met by a chorus of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you could join us, I suppose...\" Mel teased. \"But we've just been talking about what jerks boys can be and how we need a break from them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled, running to your closet. \"Yeah, so you can only join us if you're going to be one of us for the night.\" You pulled out a power blue nightgown with tons of lace trim. \"No boys allowed, so no complaining about us being girls or doing girl things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina made a pouty face and groaned, but then quickly took the nightgown from you. \"Fine, but this is one night only deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned. \"I can live with that.\"</span></div></div>",

Mel as well. Anything else and their guard will be up.\" She cast a quick spell, a mist forming around her. A moment later, the image of Cassie Bane stood in Elvira's place. \"We'll just have to make use of some illusions to disguise ourselves.\" Her next spell hit Mom, and in a second, Mom looked just like Mel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great and all. But you're still missing Vader,\" one woman commented, though she instantly realized it was a mistake to refer to Elvira's granddaughter as Vader in front of her.

She'll still be able to speak, but unable to reveal our true identities.\" Then, Elvira cast the spell of illusion again. Suddenly, where Lilly had been standing, the image of you appeared instead. \"And she'll take the place of my granddaughter. Anything that might happen to us, will also happen to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly started to freak now. \"No, you can't do this. I can't see the Morganas again. They'll know I'm Lucy.

Mommy called them to watch after us, she thinks of everything.\" She giggled. \"She will be back after that... whatever she was running of to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... what was she doing?\" Lost, Christina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure.\" Shrugging, Christina said. She then smiled. \"Probably nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira, as a precaution, had placed an unaware spell onto you and the other kids to prevent any of you from worrying and trying to help the sting operation. Sara approached the door before a mist surrounded her and she opened the door looking like Christina. There, at the door, was Samantha Forester. \"You can drop the disguise, sis.\" Half smiling, she said. \"I came to offer some extra security for the little ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You only come when there is something in it for you, Samantha.\" Returning the grin, Sara countered. \"Besides, I have all the help I need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor shook as a towering, insanely muscular man in military fatigues approached from behind Sara. It was her husband, Jack Strange. He lightly pushed a lock of his longish black hair aside, revealing his gentle blue eyes. \"Hey, sis in law.\" In a deep voice, he said. \"What brings you prowling to this door at night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just came to offer my help but it seems you have it under control.\" Forcing a smile, Samantha said. \"I'll be leaving now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always a pleasure, sis.\" Flatly, Sara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she closed the door. \"She's up to something.\" Frowning, Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That goes without saying, I'm afraid.\" Sighing, Sara said. \"Natalie told me that she's been very interested in Christina's progress as Harry was like a son to her.\" She shook her head. \"Either she has an interest in her or in something she still has in her possession.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think Christina still has some magical artifacts tucked away?\" Worried, Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That or Natalie has something hidden away she took from her.\" Serious, Sara said. \"Either way, Samantha wants it bad enough to come here behind Natalie's back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack nodded. \"I'll stay on guard until morning.\" Serious, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara gave Jack a kiss on the cheek. \"I'll keep watch over the girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Jack stood watch by the front windows of the house while the sleepover continued.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You stood next to her your eyes curiously focused on Samantha as well. \"What did she want?\" Cassie wondered out loud. She was trying to figure out if Samantha was there for you, her, or someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two still feuding?\" You sat on the window seat next to your new friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie nodded. \"Yeah, she's still holding a grudge cause of my stunt with the glasses. After the glitter bomb incident, I'm not to fond of her either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a moment to consider this. \"It's weird. You're both kind of similar. I'd think you'd get along great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie shrugged. \"I don't get along well with people who are too much like me. It's part of why I like you and your sisters so much.

Christina looked a little mortified that her nails were getting such attention, but as promised she acted like a good sport. Cassie smiled at Mel. \"Nice job, Mel. But isn't it a little on the nose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel giggled. \"All I could think off. I just, like, thought it should be something to welcome Christina here as one of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina blushed and pulled her hands back. She resisted the urge to declare that she wasn't actually one of you, but did say, \"A simple 'glad you're here' would have been plenty. I didn't need my nails down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't have landed on Park Place without enough money to pay for my hotel then,\" Mel teased, sticking out her tongue. \"You had to pay you're debt to me some way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina sighed in defeat. She handed you the dice. \"Maybe they'll make you shave your head or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie ran a hand through your hair. \"These beautiful locks? I would never. Much as I might want them for myself.\" This caused you to blush and giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled the dice, but you clearly weren't having Christina's bad luck. You got exactly what you needed to complete a monopoly on the orange properties, causing you to cheer and Christina to groan. \"You're not enchanting the dice or something, are you?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not aloud to do that anymore,\" Hannah said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel nodded. \"Our last monopoly game got pretty intense and primal. Limits had to be agreed upon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When was this?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A couple days ago when we were hiding from teenage Christina,\" you told her with a grin. \"We have a lot of time at night cause of the curfew.\" Mentioning the curfew briefly broke the unawareness spell you were under, and you wondered how your Mom was doing with finding and catching the Morgana sisters. As quickly as the thought came, it went away again, as Elvira's unawareness spell took hold again. You went back to paying for your new property, unconcerned with what Mom was up to.</span></div></div>",

She looked depressed at her depleted funds. \"What do I have to do this time?\" Services or challenges in place of money had become a way to allow those with less money to stay in the game. Plus, it was fun. You had taken possession of a dress of Hannah's you admired that was now too small for her, Liz, for some reason, liked making people sing for them, and Christina now had bright pink nails with witch designs, courtesy of Mel, and her hair was braided, courtesy of Hannah. All the girls looked at Cassie, excited to see what she had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie smiled, \"Don't worry, Christina. It's an easy one. You just have to say nine simple words: 'Boys are stupid and I'm one of the girls.'\" This got some giggles from the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina's face turned beat red. \"No, please. I don't want to say that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. It won't be so bad. You'd said you'd be one of the girls tonight,\" coaxed Cassie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I didn't think...\" She resigned herself to her fate. \"Fine...Boys are stupid and....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie suddenly shushed her and looked around, suddenly seeming very on edge. \"Lucy, Mel, you two feel that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel looked confused, but your eyes quickly widened and you nodded. \"Yeah, Uncle Jack's magical signature just disappeared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel finally felt it too. \"Yeah, you're right.\" She looked nervous, but then she felt something that sent her close to panic. \"Now I can't feel Aunt Sara either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, something clicked in your mind. \"Eva and Helena. I forgot about them. How did I forget about them?\" Liz, Hannah, and Christina looked at each other in confusion and worry. Their magic either hadn't awakened or wasn't trained, so they couldn't sense what was going on, nor could they break through Elvira's unawareness spell. They just knew something was wrong, and that confusion made them all the more nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie frowned as she got up and faced the door, a fireball of magic in her hands. \"Elvira or your mom must have done something to keep us from thinking about it. Lucy does have a way of finding herself in the middle of these things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel shook her head as she also readied herself. \"Totally didn't work though. We're all, like, still in the middle of it.\" She looked back at the younger girls. \"Hannah, Lucy hide yourselfs and the other girls in the closet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah quickly complied, helping Liz and Christina to the closet, but to what should have been no one's surprise, you joined Mel and Cassie at the ready, a fireball in your hand. \"Forget that, I'm fighting too.\" Cassie and Mel frowned but didn't have time to argue with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to your bedroom was kicked open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom returned home minutes later. She could hear the sounds of magic firing upstairs, so she didn't have time to check on Jack and Sara, who were both lying, hopefully unconscious by the front door. She sped up the stairs, and headed toward your room where the noise was coming from. Before she could get there though, the door to Christina's room burst open and Eva Morgana walked out. She had one of the Phararoh's rings in her hand, one with an sapphire jewel. She smiled when she noticed Mom and held up the ring in triumph. \"Remember these, Natalie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemories of the night Eva and Helena tried to steal Mom's magic flashed through her mind. They had a ring then too, but it had topaz jewel. Natalie tried to keep her cool. \"That's must be the one Christina bought. What's that number six?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEva looked surprised by that comment. \"No, this is number four for us. We had ours to start with, and we took two more of the transformed boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom tried not to smirk. Eva did have a nasty habit of talking too much. She liked her theatrics, but it was a useful way for Mom to get info and Mom didn't want to let Eva realize this. \"You only took two? But there were five transformed boys you kidnapped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEva chuckled. \"Even if they weren't from ring-guarding families, they were still useful sources of magic for us. That's the reason Helena's taking The Princess's magic now, and that's the reason I'm going to take yours...\" She grinned wickedly at Mom. \"...and finish what we started all those years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the sound of a crash coming from your room, followed by your voice screaming, \"Hey, I just got that dress! You're going to pay for that.\" That was followed by a flash of light and a grunting noise that sounded like Helena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Mom's turns to chuckled. \"Sounds like the Princess is given you sister some trouble.\" She was relieved to know you were still alright and fighting, but she was still worried about everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEva huffed. She couldn't believe it, but it sounded like Mom was write. It didn't matter though. She had to deal with the threat in front of her. Her dear sister would have to handle the kids. She had better handle the kids.</span></div></div>",

She held up three rings that used to be on Helena's fingers. Seeing the rogue's surprised look, she added, \"I swiped them from you when Lucy hit her with her spell. I learned to be quick while dealing with my brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little terror!\" Enraged, Helena snapped. \"I'll have two new kittens before this night is over! I'll make you both the runt of the litter, I'll...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped mid sentence and gasped hearing deep, incoherent babbling coming from behind her. Slowly, she turned to see that the book bags belonging to you and your friends had somehow come to life! The shoulder straps had torn in half and were serving as legs and arms. The open zipper of the main compartment was their mouth. Helena screamed as they spit shredded paper at her before charging, leaping onto her body, hitting her with the school books that were inside them. The terrified rogue ran out of the room and down the hall with the book bags giving chase, babbling like angry natives from some forgotten tribe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make her pay for ripping my dress!\" Giving chase, you screamed. \"Smack her silly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena was chased into a corner where she fell to her knees, screaming in fear and anguish. You wanted to make your new puppets hurt her for all she had done but Cassie took hold of your shoulder. \"Lucy, you got her.\" Calmly, she said. \"It's over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, you released your control of the puppets and they returned to normal as mom stepped up, looking roughed up but okay, dragging an unconscious Eva behind her by the collar of her blouse. \"Give it up, Helena.\" Serious, she demanded. \"You are defeated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena screamed and made one last jump at you only Cassie screamed in return, her purple flame becoming a bright blue before a powerful blast wave threw Helena off her feet and hard against the wall, cracking the reinforced blaster badly. Helena then slid to the floor, unconscious herself. \"No one attacks my friends!\" Angry, Cassie yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Smiling, you agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Cassie exchanged a high five while mom gave a bemused smile. \"Well done, Lucy.\" Kindly, she said. She turned to Cassie. \"It seems I misjudged you, Cassie. I apologize. Well done, young lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave Cassie a hug, causing her to blush. Shortly after Elvira arrived with women in police uniforms, you found aunt Sara and uncle Jack just waking up after a hit from a knock out gas grenade that was thrown through the front window. They were unharmed but embarrassed that they were taken out so easily. \"All of the rings have been secured and the children who had been transformed will be back to normal within a week.\" Serious, Elvira said. \"We do, however, have a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Sighing, mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilly had more power than she let on.\" Frowning, Elvira replied. \"She was working both sides of the fight to distract us both.\" She sighed. \"For what, who knows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be ready for her.\" Summoning a flame, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie patted your head. \"You said it.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With your room in need of repair and Christina's room looking like it had been ransack, you and the other girls had settled in Hannah's room, where everyone relaxed and caught their breathes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked, depressed, at the torn rags of the dress you had won off Hannah during the monopoly game. The dress was beautiful purple gown Hannah had worn to a costume party when she was your age. You had been coveting it for the last week, but now, a half an hour after you won it and before you could ever wear it, it was destroyed. \"Helena Morgana is the biggest evil bully who ever was,\" you groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least the witch council has them,\" Liz said. She had spent the last few minutes on the phone with her mom convincing her that she was perfectly fine and didn't need to come home. After what she saw you do through the crack in the closet door, she actually felt safer with you. \"Sorry about your dress though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a dress. No big deal,\" Christina said dismissively. This comment resulted in quick angry stares from you, Hannah, and Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch what you say,\" you warned. \"Or I'll make you understand exactly what a big deal it is.\" Your hands crackled with purple magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina blushed, getting the hint and quickly back tracked. \"I mean, I wish I could have seen how pretty you would have looked in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Liz giggled at this, but Hannah was too busy watching Mel and Cassie who were talking quietly in a corner. \"What do you think they are talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged. \"I don't know. Teenager stuff. I'm more interested in what the grown-ups are talking about.\" You look curiously toward the door. \"I wish we could listen in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina shook her head. \"Yeah, right. The witch council is all over this place. They'd spot you in a second. It's not like you can turn invisible or anything.\" Your face suddenly brightened and you flashed a grin a Liz who returned it quickly. Christina quickly caught on. \"You know an invisibility spell, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the room, Cassie and Mel were deep in conversation, not paying attention to what the younger girls were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel, talk to me...you're clearly upset about something,\" Cassie implored her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel sighed. \"Fine.\" She took a deep breath. \"I just, like, feel weak. I only got one shot off on Helena before she knocked me out, and it didn't even phase her. Now I'm learning that not only did you hold her own against her, but Lucy, <i>my little sister</i>, did too.\" She put her face in her hands. \"I feel totally pathetic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie wrapped an arm around her friend. \"You're not pathetic. Helena Morgana is one of the most powerful witches ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how did you and Lucy hold you're own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a question Cassie had been wondering herself for the last hour. \"Well, Lucy's powers are special. She has the potential to stronger than even your grandmother someday, and I...\" She looked at her hands. \"...I honestly don't know. I've never been able to wield that much magic before. You went down, and suddenly all I could think about was protecting you.\" Suddenly, Cassie blushed deep red. \"And Lucy, of course, gotta protect that crazy Lucy. Plus, there was everyone in the closet.\" She chuckled nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel looked at her friend with a little confusion, but then noticed something else amiss. \"Speaking of that crazy Lucy...where did all the other girls go?\" Cassie and Mel looked around the empty room with puzzled expression.</span></div></div>",

They were tired, tired enough that none of them noticed the four invisible girls, you, Hannah, Liz, and Christina listening in. Elvira was currently the one speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So no sooner did we return to the witch council with the Pharaoh's rings, but Lilly vanished and the rings disappeared from our vault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack shook his head in disbelief. \"How though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I could tell you, we would have been able to stop her. It was like she was a ghost,\" Elvira responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara sighed. \"So there are ten rings each one decorated with a different jewel and Lilly has four of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five,\" Mom corrected. \"The Morganas took her magic, she would have needed a ring of her own to get her magic back. Plus, the four we recovered from the Morganas and that's five.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The problem is that knowledge of the Pharaoh's rings is rare, as most of the texts that mention it were destroyed hundreds of years ago. Even which families were charged with protecting them has been partially lost to time,\" Elvira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great for secrecy, not great for keeping them away from an enemy,\" Jack added dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have the Belacourts start researching this in the morning. If anyone can find some information about the rings they can,\" Elvira announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara turned to Mom. \"Did Christina really have a ring?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"She had a collection of magically artifacts from when she was Harry. The sapphire ring was in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jack slapped his head and groaned. \"I'm such an idiot. That's what Samantha was after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samantha was here?\" Elvira and Mom said in surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack nodded. \"Sorry, we didn't get a change to tell you in the confusion. She came by, acted weird, and then left quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my sister for you,\" sighed Sara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis news exhausted Mom. \"So Samantha is looking for the rings too...Where can we find the other five?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one really knew the answer to that, though Elvira tried. \"We need to check with some of the five most renowned witch families. Strange is one, but I don't know of any ring. Maybe I should reach out to your father, Natalie.\" Mom looked nervous at that news. \"The Kruses are a possibility, maybe the Banes as well...oh and the Merlins and the Greys. Let's start with these families and hope for the best. We also need to investigate more about where Lilly has been for the last twenty years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom leaned back and groaned. \"There's so much to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more thing,\" Elvira added. \"Lucy needs to start training in combat magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shot up. \"Are you kidding mother? She's six.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same age as I was when I got my powers,\" Elvira argued. \"Besides she keeps finding herself in fights no matter what we do. She can't get through them all by sheer force of will. She needs to learn to protect herself, especially being the Princess.\" Her last sentence caught you completely off guard.

You sighed, knowing you were caught and became visible only not before signaling the others to go back to Hannah's room. Upon becoming visible to all, mom opened her mouth to scold you only Elvira interrupted her by saying, \"Thank you, Lucy for showing us how Lilly stole the rings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom turned to Elvira, surprised. \"What...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A non-corporeal spell.\" Bemused, Elvira explained. \"It's very simple but requires a lot of power to use properly. Lilly had a lot of power but could only use it in short bursts, likely because her ring was not fully charged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only Lucy has such power.\" Sighing, Sara said. \"If Lilly gets a hold of her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira smiled. \"Lucy has too much power for the ring to handle.\" Bemused, she said. \"You see, they were designed to hold the power of a dying witch whose power had already been fading.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack snapped his fingers, catching on. \"So if they were to attempt to take the power of a witch in her prime, it would cause the ring to explode from overload.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira nodded. \"Exactly. That is why the Morgana sisters targeted young witches who had not yet peaked then transformed them to keep them as familiars.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara sighed. \"As young witches, they would gain their power back in a few weeks.\" Sad for the young girls, she said. \"By making them cats, they get to siphon off more and more magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like vampires.\" Shaken, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira nodded. \"A bit of a crude analogy but... yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are still in trouble, young lady.\" Sternly, mom said. \"This meeting was private for a reason and I expect you to respect my rules, am I clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy's actions were of innocent curiosity, not disrespect.\" Serious, Elvira said. \"Besides, she answered the question that was on all of our minds and we now have a way to detecting her should she try that again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said I was a princess...\" Taking a chance, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the room smiled, making you nervous. \"Well, what did you expect?\" Amused, Elvira asked. \"I am, after all, the queen of all witches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes me a prince and your mother a princess.\" Bemused, Jack added. \"It makes you and your sisters princesses as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Cassie and Liz?\" Wincing, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"We researched that after the fight.\" Patiently, mom explained. \"The Banes are a magically powerful family but Darla was a normal girl they had adopted and was granted magical power by her new mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is why her magic is not particularly strong.\" Serious, Sara added. \"Cassie, however, is a natural at magic, which infuriated her mother and brother to no end.\" She sighed. \"Her brother has potential but a hatred of magic due to his mother. As for Cassie, it was only her lack of confidence, again due to Darla that held her back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, when she made friends, real friends, it all came out.\" Smiling slightly, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"That's right.\" Softly, she said. \"As for Liz, she is still very young. Very few witches gain powerful magic at that young of age.\" She giggled. \"Still, like Hannah, she has a lot of potential they just needs to be patient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will Mel get powerful magic?\" Hopeful, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"Melanie's magic is different.\" Calmly, she said. \"Mel is like my sister, Catherine. She is a healer witch, a powerful one at that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know?\" Curious, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the room chuckled. \"Look at yourself, child.\" Bemused, Elvira said. \"Do you see a single scratch on you? A single bruise?\" She shook her head. \"Helena was no doubt knocking the two of you around like rag dolls before you finally snapped and sent your puppets after her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even while unconscious, Melanie managed to protect all of you from harm.\" Smiling, mom said. \"That is a seriously powerful magic, young lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the landing, having come out looking for you, both Cassie and Mel were in tears. Only they froze, blushing as Elvira then called out, \"You got the answers you were looking for, girls.  Now go back to your sleepover and let us adults finish our talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbeit reluctantly, the girls walked back to Hannah's room with you following. \"Sorry...\" Wincing, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No harm done, young lady.\" Bemused, Elvira said. \"Just remember that trick rarely works more than once so don't make a habit of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled then giggled as you hurried up to your room. Hayley, who had been silent during the meeting merely shook her head in bemusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That the rest of her family may be princesses, but she is The Princess, your heir apparent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira shook her head. \"Undue pressure to put on a child that young. Besides, even though anyone can see that Lucy is the most likely candidate, she isn't my only possible heir. Hannah's magic might end up being even more powerful than Lucy's, and Tim could easily end up being an extremely powerful witch girl. Besides, Lucy hasn't even had her confirmation ceremony yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"I need to start preparing her for that. I wasn't expecting her to be ready for it so soon. She's taken to magic like no one I've ever seen before.\" She was trying to make a mental list of everything she needed to do, but it was a long one. She had to talk to Cassie in the morning too, thank her for standing up for her daughters and maybe find out if the Banes had one of the Pharaoh's rings. \"Maybe if I give Lucy something else to focus on, she won't get involve in this ring business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I highly doubt that'll work. She probably heard us talking about the rings anyway,\" Jack said. Mom sighed, knowing Jack was probably right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence in the room as everyone considered everything that they had talked about. Finally, Elvira spoke. \"The rings' locations, Lilly's whereabouts these last twenty years, and Samantha Forrester's interest in the rings. We need to start figuring these things out in the morning, but for now, we all need rest. Get some sleep everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLate that night, Mom went to check on you as you slept. The witch council had repaired the room, so you and Liz were sleeping there, but Mom was surprised to find you weren't asleep at all. You were sitting up in your bed, staring transfixed at a magic flame in your hands. Liz, on the other hand, was sleeping soundly in the bed next to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy,\" Mom whispered, getting your attention. You extinguished the flame and walked out of the room to talk with her. \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just thinking. Playing with the flame helps me think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are thinking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything,\" you sighed. \"Fighting those witches, me being a Princess, these ring thingies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was not what Mom was hoping to hear. \"You did hear about the rings...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"Why are they called the Pharaoh's Rings, Mommy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom didn't want to tell you, but she had a feeling you weren't going to be able to sleep unless you were got the answers you wanted. \"Long ago, people were very aware of witches. But us witches had such power people were scared of us. One of the ancient Pharaoh's of Egypt thought he could find a way to control us, and he created these 10 rings as a way of doing so with some of his loyal witch followers. They could steal powers from witches who didn't do what the Pharaoh said and keep the powers of loyal witches in their hands when those witches passed on. It was a dark time for witches everywhere, but eventually one witch was able to steal the rings and hide them. That's one of the reasons we try to keep our existence hidden from regular humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe Cassie is right about boys and humans, you found yourself thinking, but you hated to think negatively about your human friends. \"So why now? Did Lilly really steal those rings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"I'm afraid so. What the Morganas did to her all those years ago must have really hurt her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about the family she showed us. Do you think they are real?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom hadn't thought of that. It would be worth looking into. They might have some information on Lilly Sweetie. \"Could be honey, but you should really go to sleep. There may be no school, but you have ballet tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy said then done. I've been trying to sleep for hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"Well, there are ways to help with that.\" She waved her hand and suddenly you were put into a deep sleep, falling into Mom's arms. She kissed your forehead and put you into bed, pulling the covers over you. Tomorrow was going to be a new day. Who knew what was going to happen then.</span></div></div>",

To Micheal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie Thompson has agreed to raise you as her own.\" To Cassie's surprise, mom said. \"Your brother, Micheal will be taken in by Jack Strange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack nodded, a small grin touching the corners of his mouth. \"I have three sons who are powerhouses like myself.\" Calmly, he explained. \"They will straighten him out; make a real witch boy out of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Katie Thompson is my family's primary physician and is immune to all magic.\" Serious, mom said. \"She does, however know how magic works and can fight against it if needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who will be teaching me magic, then?\" Worried, Cassie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.\" Smiling, mom said. \"You and your small coven will all receive your training during each and every coven meeting which will all be held here in my house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie's eyes watered then overflowed. She did not know how to react. On one hand, she was being taken away from her abusive mother and brought closer to her first true friends. On the other hand, she was losing her brother, as annoying as he was. \"Will- Will I see my brother again?\" Tearfully, she asked. \"Will I see my mother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I live on the other side of the country but we visit every three months so you will see your brother again.\" Smiling, Jack said. \"He will be a better man by then, count on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mother is still just that, your mother.\" Serious, Elvira added. \"Nothing will change that. She has the right to visit you and your brother but not alone. Her mad quest for magical power has cost her everything.\" She placed a light hand onto Cassie's shoulder. \"Hannah told us all about your plight and we investigated. It turns out that your brother, as obnoxious as he is, kept detailed records of your mother's actions including secret video recordings. It was all the evidence we needed to prosecute her. She goes on trail next week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie was now crying freely. \"So... Micheal was looking out for me.\" Saddened, she said. \"To think I thought he was just plain mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boys are a nuisance.\" Smiling, mom said. \"Still, they do care in their own obnoxious way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Witch boys are the defenders of witch families.\" Smiling, Jack said. \"Their senses are far more acute and their heightened strength, speed, and agility easily allow them to take on any normal threat to the household.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only its a double edged sword.\" With a grin, Elvira said. \"It also makes them overly energetic and obnoxious, more so than normal boys, which is why they annoy young witches so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack childishly stuck his tongue out at mom and Elvira, causing Cassie to giggle.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Centuries ago the rings were split up and each was given to a witch family to guard, the ten most powerful families at the time, but records from that era are scarce, witch trials and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to know if the Banes were one of those families,\" Cassie said, understanding. Elvira nodded again. \"It's very possible. Mom kept a lot of magical artifacts for safekeeping, but she never told me where. Probably wise of her. I would have pawned it all off to Samantha for some quick bucks. If we have one you'll need to ask my Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not what Elvira and Mom had wanted to here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, Darla was sitting in the witch council with a big smile on her face, much to the annoyance of Mom and Elvira who were acting as her interrogators. She knew she had something they wanted, and she was going to use that leverage for all it was worth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you two want my Pharaoh's Ring. This is just delicious. But what makes you think I still have it? You yourselves are accusing me of working with Eva and Helena who we both know were collecting them.\" Darla's words with powerful and angry, but a hint of amusement was peppered in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know you too well, Darla. You never willingly part with power, even for the Morganas,\" Elvira retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla grinned. \"Very true, so let's cut the bull. I do have a Pharaoh's ring. It has a beautiful diamond jewel, but you'll never find it without my help. And you'll never get my help without me getting what I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" Mom had to force the words out. It hurt to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My freedom. Drop all charges against me and I'll give you the ring. You can keep my children. I certainly don't need those failures back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You horrible...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla cut Mom off. \"Don't bother arguing with me. I have nothing to lose. You want to take my magic from me, and this ring will be my only method of ever getting it back. So if these charges stand, I have no incentive to give it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Elvira looked at each other feeling frustrated. They didn't see another option, but they hated the idea of letting her go. \"It's a deal,\" Elvira muttered reluctantly.</span></div></div>",

You were much more willing and eager this time around, and the pink color and ballet skirt didn't bother you anymore. Annoyingly though, Hannah sat nearby, already in her own leotard and ballet skirt watching triumphantly, an 'I-told-you-so' look on her face. You tried to ignore it and tried to keep the conversation on literally anything else. \"So you found two Pharaoh's Rings at Darla's house?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah rolled her eyes, wise to your ploy, but Mom answered nonetheless, hoping that keeping you informed would keep you from trying to get involved on your own. \"Not exactly. One of the rings, one with a diamond jewel, was a Pharaoh's Ring, but the other, the sapphire, was a different kind of magical ring. I should have known immediately since the Pharaoh's Ring Christina had bought was a sapphire. Each ring has a different type of jewel. Still, at least we have one ring, even if Lilly has four.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, come on.

You groaned. \"I'm turning into a mini-you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say that likes it's a bad thing. It just means you have good taste,\" Hannah said as she ruffled your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I really have to go to this thing?\" Christina asked as she stomped into the room. The open-mindedness of the night before was a thing of the past, she was dressed in her most tomboy-ish clothes and she was extremely resistant to idea of spending an hour in a ballet studio. Liz followed her, dressed in her own leotard and ready for ballet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to participate,\" Mom told Christina for the fifth time in the last half-hour. \"But I can't leave a six-year old alone in this house. Hayley is off running an errand for me and I assume you don't want to be left alone with Mel and Cassie.\" Christina's eyes went wide. She definitely didn't want to be left alone with Mel and Cassie. They were part of a coven that believed all guys were better off being girls. She didn't trust to them to not mess with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do even have time to take us? Shouldn't you be off looking for those ring things?\" With these questions, Christina tried one last escape strategy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head. \"I can take time off to take my daughters to ballet. Spending time with family is what is truly important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina knew she had no chance. \"Fine, I'll go.

You're a girly girl now.\" This prompted laughter from Hannah and Liz, even Christina cracked a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha,\" Christina said, moving your arm off her. \"Get off me, Miss Priss.\" She stuck her tongue out at you, prompting you to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom checked her watch. \"We'd better get going. Christina, grab a book to read so you aren't bored. Let's go girls.\" She ushered the four of you out to the car.</span></div></div>",

It was a graphic novel from a series you and Hannah loved about a girl and her unicorn. It was funny, but not what Christina wanted to read for the next hour. The receptionist asked Mom a couple times if Christina was sure she didn't want to join, as there was space in the class. Christina refused repeatedly, using only a single word: \"No.\" Hannah went to mingle with her ballet friend and you and Liz began to wander and practice as you waited for class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one is fifth position, right?\" you asked as you showed Liz a pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but careful, you're losing your...\" Liz tried to warn as you started to wobble and fall backward. You gave a little shout, but someone caught you from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your form is terrible,\" the voice said. It sounded oddly familiar to you, but you couldn't place it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's only my second class,\" you explained as you picked yourself up. \"And whatever. Ballet is about having fun any...\" You went speechless when you turned around and saw who had caught you, the boy from the arcade whose socks you had used your magic on. He was surprised to recognize you as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sparkle boots?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinbrat,\" you said calmly trying not to be intimidated. You had called him blondie last time, but pinbrat sounded cleverer you thought. You had figured you'd never see him again. \"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My ballet class just finished up.\" Sure enough, he was wearing a white boys leotard and black shorts. \"I'm glad you're here. I'll give me a chance to thank you for the socks thing, yesterday.\" He didn't sound like he was actually thankful. You winced. He knew you had something to do with it? Did he know about magic?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wouldn't have done it if I knew you liked girl things,\" you retorted, referring to his enrollment in a ballet class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scoffed at that. \"Shows what you know. Ballet isn't for little girls like you who just want to twirl around and giggle. It's for serious athletes who want to be strong and fast.\" Okay, it was official. You couldn't stand this kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Are you like a ballet expert now?\" you tried to retort. Not your best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Compared to you, I'm Baryshnikov.\" You had no idea who that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz stepped in now. \"Wait, but the class before ours is for beginner level students too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy blushed. \"I said compared to Sparkle Boots there,\" he said quickly. He looked back at you. \"You know, thanks to you, I had to spend last night turned into a girl. My teacher wanted to make sure I wasn't slipping when he saw those ruffled socks. I'll get you back somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a witch boy?\" you and Liz said in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, pretty strong one too,\" he bragged. \"My magic awakened last year. My teacher says I'm one of the best he's ever seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...my grandma tells me the same thing. And she's head witch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy's eyes widened. \"You're a Strange?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda. That was my Mom's name before she got married.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy groaned. \"Just my luck. Teacher told me to stay away from you guys.\" He turned around. \"Enjoy your twirling, Sparkle Boots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the last straw. You felt your anger grow and you shot a quick spell at Pinbrat, intending to turn his boy's ballet outfit into a pink and sparkly leotard and tutu. Unfortunately, this time, Pinbrat was ready for you. He waved a quick counter spell, even without looking back at you. The magic reflected back at you. In a moment, your basic pink tutu and ballet skirt were gone, replaced by a formal pink tutu dress, with sparkles all over the place. You looked like you were supposed to be playing a sugar plum fairy at a ballet recital. Your eyes went wide with surprise and embarrassment, as Liz's eyes darted back and forth to make sure no one had been watching. Looks like you got lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinbrat turned back at you and grinned. \"Told you I'd get you back. You look good.\" You turned red with embarrassment and fury. \"My name is Sean, by the way. Sean Knightley. Just in case you want to know the name of the boy who put you in your place. See you Sparkle Boots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I prefer calling you Pinbrat,\" you called after him, but it was too late. He was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou growled. \"I'm seriously thinking about helping Cassie turn every boy into a girl for all time, but other than that I'm good.\" Liz hugged you sympathetically. It was appreciated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back, Lucy,\" said a new voice. It was your ballet teacher. She was looking over your new outfit. \"Well, I'm glad to see you are so enthusiastic about ballet outfits, but that's really more the kind of costume and tutu we only wear for performances. You're welcome to wear it today, but try to stick with just a leotard and skirt next time, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you could do was nod and apologize, and quietly plan your revenge on Pinbrat.</span></div></div>",

She didn't even notice the boy from the arcade pass by her and go out the door. Mom sat next to her, but her attention was focused on the ballet lesson and watching her daughters, though he was confused about what you were wearing. Did you ask your teacher to borrow one of the costumes or did magic play a role? She'd have to ask you after the class<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout fifteen minutes into the class, Mom got up. \"Christina, I'll be right back. I just need to make a few phone calls.\" Christina barely nodded and Mom stepped out of the studio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be a good book.\" Christina looked up to see Samantha Forrester sitting next to her. She wasn't sure how to react. She had always liked Samantha. The woman had helped her collect all kinds of magical artifacts over the years. But between coercing Christina to help with the glitter bomb incident, which she couldn't really remember that well, and finding out Samantha's favorite past time was turning boys into girls, Christina wasn't sure if she was safe around the woman. Samantha sensed the unease. \"Calm down. If I wanted to turn you into a girl, I could have done it for years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was true. You had been coming into her store for three years before the thing with the glasses happened. And that was because of Cassie, not Samantha. \"Sooooo...you don't want me to be a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I wouldn't say that. You're much better off as a girl than a boy, but I had never met a kid with such curiosity about magical artifacts, Reminded me of me when I was your age. I didn't want to drive you away by turning you into a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina nodded. That kind of made sense. \"Why are you here?\" Her tone was one of curiosity, not contempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To check on you, I suppose. You've been through a lot with the Morganas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard you were looking out for me. Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha frowned. \"I didn't do nearly enough. You still got attacked again.\" She reached into her bag and pulled out a bracelet. \"Here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina looked at it with suspicion. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A linking bracelet. It allows you to summon me when you need me. Just in case you get in trouble again. It's an incredibly rare item. Otherwise, all witch parents would want their children to have them,\" Samantha explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not your child,\" Christina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not. But you are someone I see great potential in, and I want to make sure you reach that potential.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have potential?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you do. But you're the only one who doesn't see it,\" Samantha explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina thought about that for a second and looked over the bracelet. \"You're sure this isn't some trick to turn me into a girly girl or something? I'm not going to put this on and then sign up for ballet and hate boys like you, am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha chuckled. \"If I wanted to turn you into a girly girl, I wouldn't need to ask.\" Christina nodded, not picking up on the fact that Samantha didn't actually answer her concern directly. Nonetheless, Christina put the bracelet on.</span></div></div>",

She turned to Samantha, feeling frightened and betrayed. \"What did you do to me?\" Whispering, she demanded. \"I feel strange!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's called the link bracelet.\" Calmly, Samantha explained. \"It is normally passed on from mother to child or master to apprentice. I will always know when or if you are in trouble and be able to zero in on you when or if it happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which requires parental permission to use, Forester.\" Angrily, mom whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have Christina's biological mother's blessings, Natalie.\" Confident, Samantha countered. \"You are merely the child's temporary guardian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You of course know I will confirm this.\" Her eyes narrowing, mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha nodded. \"I would not have it any other way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then quietly stood up and walked away, leaving Christina slightly shaken. \"Karma, I guess.\" Sighing, she said. \"It's what I get for going rogue...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head. \"I am still not pleased with what you tried to do while with the Morgana sisters but I understand that you were under tremendous stress.\" Serious, mom said. \"Nothing came of it so think nothing of it.\" She managed a smile. \"Even Lucy had her rebellious streak which is why the council has been calling her 'Vader'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the council calling me?\" Wincing, Christina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom grinned. \"Some of them are calling you 'Darth'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina gave a hick-up like chuckle. \"Darth and Vader... nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If your mother is agree to that bracelet, you can keep it.\" Turning serious, mom said. \"If not, it I will be reversing it so we will know where Samantha is at all times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do that?\" Surprised, Christina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am an expert in combat magic, young lady.\" Smiling, mom reminded. She sighed then changed the subject. \"What did I miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think Lucy has a new rival in that boy, Sean Knightley.\" Frowning, Christina reported. \"How was he able to fire a counter spell? I thought only girls can work magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled at that. \"It wasn't a counter spell, so to speak.\" Bemused, she said. \"You see, while witch girls are blessed magically witch boys are blessed physically.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that why 'John' and I were the strongest boys in school?\" Curious, Christina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The strongest boys in the surrounding five states.\" Surprising Christina, mom countered. \"The two of you were well on your way to becoming juggernauts and you were only fourteen.\" She sighed, adding, \"That is a nightmare for most witches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina gulped. \"That must be why the glasses were put into our hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"The glasses were only meant to test and measure a witch boy's curiosity of magic.\" Calmly, she said. \"Only Cassie was not aware that the glasses had been tampered with by Elena Kruse, the most vile rogue witch in our history.\" She sighed. \"Back to the subject at hand, Sean did not cast a spell, he simply caught the spell and threw it right back at Lucy who was not prepared for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean like a game of 'hot potato'?\" Surprised, Christina asked. She giggled as mom nodded. \"That had to be embarrassing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Live and learn.\" Smiling, mom said. \"Boys may be obnoxious at times but they are far from defenseless and, once trained, they can easily balance the odds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you think will happen between Lucy and Sean?\" Worried, Christina asked. \"Will their rivalry get worse or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom grinned. \"I seem to remember a certain cocky boy driving Melanie nuts before they got to know each other.\" Bemused, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina blushed horribly at that. \"I'm not falling for a boy!\" Almost too loudly, she protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled. \"Time will tell.\" She then turned serious. \"My father mentioned Sean Knightley several times in his letters to me. I'll contact him and inform him of his encounters with Lucy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will that get him in trouble?\" Wincing, Christina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"No... just teased for having a crush.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina giggled at that.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just no more extravagant costumes for class, okay?\" You grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you reached Christina, you and her looked each other over, appraising your new outfit and accessory respectively. \"What happened to you?\" you both asked each other at the same time. Christina felt confused suddenly. Wasn't she just talking about what happened to you with Mom? But she hadn't see anything. How could she have known. She couldn't remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina went first. \"Oh, Samantha gave me this bracelet. I put it on like an idiot. Where'd that outfit come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \"Some boy reflected my spell. The same one from the arcade, remember? Turns out he's a witch boy. I should have turned him into a girl while I had the chance. Said his name was Knightley or something. Sean, I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knightley?\" Mom said with confusion. \"There was an old witch family years ago by that name. They disappeared though. I wonder if there is any relation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina looked at Mom. \"Wait? I thought you said you knew of him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knew of who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sean Knightley!\" Christina said. \"We just had a conversation about him.\" Mom looked at Christina like she honestly had no idea what she was talking about. \"You said your father told you about him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom now looked worried and knelt down. \"Christina, I haven't heard from my father in years. And I've never heard of this Sean boy.\" She held up Christina's arm and looked at this bracelet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina was starting to get scared. \"But...we talked, didn't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"Yes, I found Samantha with you, then we talked about your time with the Morganas and how the witch council was calling you Darth. After that you went back into your graphic novel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina shook her head. \"That's not how I remember it, but...I also can't remember how I remember it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the link bracelet. It allows Samantha access to your mind, so she can communicate with you at all times,\" Mom explained. \"But it takes some time to adjust. Samantha must have given you information, but your mind, well, imagined it as a conversation with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That link bracelet can't be legal,\" Liz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"I'm afraid it is, as long as the person wearing took it willingly.\" Christina groaned. \"Let's get you home. We'll have to drop Liz off at her place on the way.\" You were disappointed. You were hoping to hang with Liz some more, but Christina's health came first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah took Christina's hand and helped led her to the car. As the group walked there, you had some questions for Mom. \"Why would Samantha do this to Liz, Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knowing Samantha, she's chosen Christina to be her apprentice. Most likely due to her skill with magical artifacts, one of her interests as well.\" You felt like Mom was holding back more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What aren't you telling me?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"Apprenticeships among witches is very serious. The teacher can have the power to project thoughts into the student's mind. If they want, they can shape what that student believes and thinks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's horrible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can be, which is why they are rare. But Samantha probably wants someone who thinks like she does and has Christina's talent. If we don't find a way out of this for Christina, Christina Rich will be no more, and we'll have Christina Forrester to deal with.\" Mom didn't enjoy telling you this, but she wanted to make sure you never accepted a link bracelet from a witch, ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to see Susan. I find it hard to believe she allowed this to happen.\" But deep down, Mom knew Samantha wouldn't have tried something like this without the permission of the guardian.</span></div></div>",

The bracelet was back on her wrist and you sat by her bed with a look of concern on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they're talking in their minds,\" you whispered to Mom. Mom sighed, knowing exactly what you meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan tried speaking to Christina. \"Christina, could you take the bracelet off for a moment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina shook her head. \"Don't worry, Mom. It's fine now. My brain couldn't handle the bracelet at first, but it's getting used to it now. Samantha's sorry. She didn't know it would be so rough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan looked at Mom for help. \"Christina, we need you to take off the bracelet so that we know we are talking to you, not Samantha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina sighed, but did nothing. She just lay there for a minute. You realized she was talking the idea over with Samantha in her mind. \"This is seriously creepy,\" you muttered to yourself. Mom wouldn't ever have to worry about you accepting one of these bracelets. You didn't want anyone else getting inside your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Christina took the bracelet off and looked at Susan and Mom. \"What is it? I told you. I'm okay with this now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christina, I'm not okay with you wearing that bracelet and allowing that witch full access to your mind,\" Susan exclaimed. She looked really worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina rolled her eyes. \"Mom, you just don't understand cause you're a regular human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom stepped in at this point. \"Christina, I'm a witch and I think linking bracelets are an archaic practice that should have been outlawed centuries ago. My mother would have outlawed them if it wasn't for certain members of the witch council who like to keep the old ways alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina shook her head. \"It doesn't matter. I'm allowed to make my own decisions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't sit well with Susan. \"You most certainly are NOT, young lady. You are only six-years old and you don't get to decide for yourself if you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, Susan,\" Mom said apologetically. \"Under witch law, any witch whose magic has awakened can accept an apprenticeship, even if she is six.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan looked aghast. Christina looked triumphant. \"I hate this,\" Susan said. \"I feel like my child lives in a completely different world than I do. I just want her to be okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mom, Samantha is helping me with that. I've always had so much anxiety and anger. Lucy's helped me with that a lot, but Samantha can help me even more. I feel calmer than I have in a long time. Learning from her I can become my best self and I can learn more about the things I love.\" Christina seemed pretty sure of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about being a boy again?\" you asked, remembering the promise you made to Christina that you'd help her become a boy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis question caught Christina off-guard. \"I'm sure Samantha...will let me be a boy again once I can be.\" No one bought that. Christina was deluding herself on that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan was beside herself at this point. This world was so foreign to her and she felt like she was losing her child. \"Well, maybe I should just take you away from here. Make sure you can never see Samantha again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head sadly. She really should have better prepped Susan for this. \"Susan, you know that won't work. Witch society doesn't usually recognize human law. If you took Christina, she'd be taken from you by the witch council, and adopted by a witch to raise her in the proper culture. Most likely, Samantha would have first claim to her. They'd probably wipe your memory too, so you wouldn't be able to contact her either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan felt her heart break inside. \"Well, maybe I hate witch society then. It's brought me nothing but trouble.\" Mom flinched. She saw a real anger in Susan. She had been thrust into a world she didn't entirely understand. She couldn't imagine how it must feel to be so powerless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina felt bad for her mom, but she couldn't not accept this at this point. She hadn't been this excited for anything since her magic had awakened. Suddenly, she had an idea. \"Mom, if it really upsets you that much I won't wear the bracelet.\" Everyone looked at Christina in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean it, sweetie?\" Susan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Mom. You mean more to me than some bracelet.\" It felt like a weight had lifted off Susan's shoulders and she hugged her child sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole event had been extremely emotional for Susan, and Mom asked Mel to help Mrs. Rich down to the kitchen and make her some tea to calm her nerves. As soon as Susan and Mel were out of earshot, Mom turned to Christina. \"You have no intention of getting rid of that bracelet, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina shook her head. \"Not at all, but you can cast a spell, can't you? A spell that will make the bracelet invisible to Mom and Dad?\" She smiled like she had thought up this great idea, but you were rather horrified at this suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom clearly didn't like it either, but she knew she didn't have much choice. Witch court rarely favored human parents and if she wanted any hope of preserving the relationship between Christina and her mother, she had to do this. \"I...I can, but your parents can NEVER find out about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina nodded and put the bracelet back on. Mom said a quick chant and waved her hand over the bracelet. \"It's done. Only witches can see the bracelet now.\" Christina was about to thank her, but Mom cut her off. \"Now, I want you to use that thing and summon Samantha. She and I need to have a serious chat.\"</span></div></div>",

Then she turned a stony expression to Mom. \"You wanted to talk, Natalie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom quickly cast a noise bubble around the room. No one outside could hear what was happening inside, so Susan wouldn't interrupt. No matter how loud it got. There was fire in Mom's eyes. She was ready to yell. \"I don't appreciate you manipulating myself and Christina into this position.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha chuckled. \"I didn't manipulate Christina. I just didn't ask you for permission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't tell her that the bracelet would give you direct access into her mind,\" Mom pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha had to admit that was true. \"Okay, yes, but I was just looking out for the girl. She's like the child I never had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes me glad you never had a child,\" Mom retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha shook her head. \"You may not be a fan of the old ways, Natalie, but they are still perfectly legal. Christina needs a proper witch to guide her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're Mom was a fan of the old ways. I want to make sure you're not trying to do the same thing to Christina that Elena tried to do to her and Lucy. And Christina already has me to guide her,\" Natalie responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You? You already have four daughters to take care of who demand fairly constant attention. One with power beyond her comprehension,\" she said, looking at you. \"One who's fallen in with that awful Bane child, one who doesn't get near enough attention, and one who's going to crack under all the pressure you put her under.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonetheless, the witch council put me in charge of Christina.\" Mom was holding fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but that still doesn't prevent Christina from serving in an apprenticeship if she wants.\" Samantha's smirk was annoying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I do want to,\" Christina interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could still fight you. We'd be tied up in witch court for a good long while,\" Mom pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is why I'm willing to agree to whatever protections and assurances you want,\" Samantha responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"First, you must swear that if you lie to me, ever, about Christina, even if it is about what she had for lunch, you will never talk to her again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina objected. \"What? No. You can't do that.\" Her objection was ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha frowned. The kind of swear Mom was looking for was magically binding. If she broke it, her powers would be forfeit. \"Fine...but only for as long as the witch council has you assigned as her magical guardian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the best Mom could hope for on that point. \"Agreed then. Secondly, Susan must never know about any of this, nor can you get in the way of her and Christina's relationship.\" That was all fine with Samantha and she nodded. \"Third, her apprenticeship will be monitored at first. Myself or Hayley will be present when Christina is at your shop.\" She kept going before Samantha had a chance to object. \"Fourth, when I want to talk to Christina alone, she will take off the link bracelet with no arguments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha looked back at Christina, then nodded again. \"Those are all fair terms, Natalie. I can agree...\" She was interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I have two more. You must drop your feud with Cassie Bane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis took Samantha aback. \"Natalie, that girl seriously damaged my reputation with the witch council.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't care. What's more important to you? Getting revenge on Cassie or taking on your new apprentice?\" Mom crossed her arms to emphasize her point. You were kind of in awe of her and the way she was taking on Samantha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha sighed. \"Very well. I see Cassie has made some friends over her. What's your last term?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tell me everything you know about any Pharaoh's Rings your family might have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis surprised Samantha. \"That's fine, but I really don't know much about the Pharaoh's Rings. I didn't even realize what that ring I sold to Christina was until about a week ago when the Morganas resurfaced. I do know the Forrester family was one of the ten witch families given a ring to protect, but I had never seen on before. My mother never let me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom groaned in frustration. \"So I need to talk to Elena...\" She had been hoping Darla was the only witch prisoner she'd have to deal with while searching for the rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha nodded. \"Yes, you will. And I agree to your terms.\" She reached out her hand which Natalie took. There was a crackle of magic and the deal was now binding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get to keep my bracelet?\" Christina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do we know this will be safe for Christina, Mom?\" you also asked with great concern in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded to Christina and gave you a look that told you to trust her. She turned back to Samantha. \"Lucy and I will bring Christina by for her first lesson tomorrow. We'll start with just an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha smiled. \"Good, I'm looking forward to it.\"</span></div></div>",

Mom proceeded to explain the spell she put on the bracelet. Samantha grinned thinking it was a great idea, which worried you. \"That's very clever, Natalie,\" she said. \"A wonderful way to get around that human's immunity to magic.\" She sounded too pleased about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom frowned. \"Alright. I'm going to go lie to Susan and tell her everything is okay. Meet me at the witch council, Samantha. I might need you when I talk to Elena.\" She suddenly had a realization. \"She must have a Pharaoh's Ring. How else would she have gotten her powers back when she escape from prison last time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha didn't like the idea of talking to her mother, but anything she could do to get Natalie's good will worked to her advantage. \"Okay, I'll head there now.\" She turned to Christina. \"Christina, keep the bracelet off for the next couple of hours. I don't want you near my mind when I talk to my mother. You should never have to think about her again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina nodded. \"Sure thing, Wi...ummm...Samantha.\" You raise an eyebrow at that. What had see been about to say? Christina took off her link bracelet. \"I'll talk to you later, and see you tomorrow.\" Samantha disappeared and Mom got ready to leave the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit with her a bit,\" she instructed, kissing your forehead. You nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Mom left the room, you turned to Christina. \"Alright, are you insane?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina looked hurt by that. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Letting Samantha mentor you after she tricked you is crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's doesn't know how else to get along with people. You saw how messed up her Mom was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? She was Aunt Sara's mom too, and she doesn't trick people into letting her into their minds.\" You couldn't understand what Christina was thinking. \"What were you about to call her anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina wasn't sure she wanted to tell you, but she gave in. \"Witchmother...cause she's like my fairy godmother, but a witch. I came up with it, but she really likes it when I call her that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Christina...\" you began, but Christina cut you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, Lucy? I'm really sick of you questioning me. You don't realize how good you have it. You figured out so quickly how to adjust to being a girl and who you were meant to be. You're a princess and a gifted witch. Hooray! Not all of us are that lucky. I have struggled to figure out who I am now. My mom couldn't help me. Your mom couldn't help me. Your sisters definitely couldn't help me. But Samantha is the first person who has given me hope that I might be okay and that I might be able to do something I'm good at and like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were taken aback by Christina yelling at you. Your mind had adjusted to be six. Her mind hadn't, which meant she could argue circles around you. But it did surprise you, and hurt you. \"I...I thought I was helping you with all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina sighed realizing she had gotten too angry. \"I'm sorry. You were helping, but when I talk with Samantha about magic artifacts, I feel like...that's my destiny. Like you do with doing spells, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"I guess that makes sense, but Samantha won't let you be a boy again. She doesn't like boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She liked me fine when I was a boy, so I'm not sure that's true, but it is a risk I'm okay with. And I need your support, okay? And I still need you to help me figure out starting first grade next week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you said quietly. \"I'll support you if this is what you really want. But if she turns you into a mindless glitter zombie, I'm coming after her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina giggled. \"That's why I'm not scared to try this. I know if I get in trouble, you and Mrs. H will save me.\" She pulled you into a hug, which you returned. This talk helped you feel much better about the whole thing. Still, you were glad you were going with her tomorrow. You'd better be able to see that she was okay.</span></div></div>",

You were in a strange house, standing beside Samantha as she watched her mother, Elena Kruse flipping through a huge magic book. \"I cannot have you and Natalie getting too close, dear.\" Serious, Elena said. \"Your combined power is too much greater than my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you so afraid of our friendship?\" Defiant, Samantha demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My other daughter, Sarah is already swooning over Natalie's brother, Jack!\" Angry, Elena snapped. \"I can't get her to listen anymore!

You were upstairs with Christina, Mel was taking Susan Rich back home, and Hayley was off with her friends. She was lonely. It felt like everyone had someone to play with but her. She had been hoping Stephanie and Rachel would solve that problem, but she always felt like a third wheel with them. She had thought she could hang out with Mike Cutie, but he had told her yesterday at school, he didn't want to hang with her anymore. The other boys in the grade were making fun of him for spending time with a girl, especially one as princess-obsessed as Hannah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and Cassie walked in. Hannah looked up confused. \"I thought you went over to Megan's house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie nodded. \"I did, but...I don't know. They're nice and all, but a little too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy?\" Hannah asked, making room for Cassie on the couch. Cassie sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Super eager to have me there.\" Her eyes moved to the floor. \"I'm...not used to that. I needed a little breathing room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come to see Mel?\" Hannah questioned, in a teasing sing-song voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie blushed. \"What? I mean, I guess. She's my friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you asked her on a date yet?\" Hannah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie looked completely taken a back. \"I...I...What kind of question is that for someone your age to ask someone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah shrugged. \"When you are my age, you can ask anyone anything and get away with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie shook her head. \"Well, it's not...she's not...\" She had not been expected to be interrogated by an 8-year-old. \"She's probably into boys anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Hannah shrugged. \"She doesn't take about them much anymore. Not since you two started hanging out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie sighed, looking for anything to change the subject. \"How come you are by yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah huffed and crossed her arms. \"Cause boys are stupid. Mike Cutie doesn't want to be my friend anymore. Just cause I'm a girl and boys are making fun of him.\" Cassie smiled. Changing the subject had been remarkably easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie nodded. \"It's what I've been saying. Witches are better than humans, and girls are better than boys. Mike's a potential witch, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like Christina. I wished he'd turn into a girl too. Then maybe he wouldn't be so worried about what stupid boys think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I could help with that.\" Cassie pulled out a vial of silvery glittery powder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah's eyes went wide at the sight of the powder. She recognized it. \"That's glitter bomb glitter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Pretty cool, right? You may not have magic yet. But with this you can make him a girl easy. Might even awaken his powers. Either way, he's better off as one of us than one of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah nodded staring at the vial. \"Yeah, cool. But...it won't turn him into a glitter zombie, will it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie shook her head. \"That was a little something Samantha added when she tried to frame me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah. Doesn't that mean we could get in trouble for doing this?\" Hannah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if you get caught, which won't happen. Everyone's been expecting Mike Cutie to turn into a witch girl anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah took the vial from Cassie. \"Okay, I'll think about it.\" She suddenly glared at Mel. \"But you better treat my sister right when you start dating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie chuckled as she leaned back on the couch. \"I don't know what you're talking about kid.\" But her mind did drift to Melanie Harrison.</span></div></div>",

You were in a strange house, standing beside Samantha as she watched her mother, Elena Kruse flipping through a huge magic book. \"I cannot have you and Natalie getting too close, dear.\" Serious, Elena said. \"Your combined power is too much greater than my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you so afraid of our friendship?\" Defiant, Samantha demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My other daughter, Sarah is already swooning over Natalie's brother, Jack!\" Angry, Elena snapped. \"I can't get her to listen anymore! I will not lose you to the same accursed family!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then chanted something that caused a flash to fill the room. When the light faded, you found yourself in a prison somewhere with Samantha looking right at you with a cross look on her face. \"Take that off this instant, child!\" Screaming, she demanded. \"You have no right to eavesdrop on my affairs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a scream of fright and tore off the bracelet to find Christina looking at you in surprise and annoyance. \"Why did you put on my bracelet?\" Irritated, she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I was curious.\" Shaken, you asked. \"I saw Samantha, she...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to hear it.\" Firmly, Christina said. She sighed. \"Look, I know you want to help me but right now Samantha can help me better than you can so just let her do it, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides that, the bracelet was not meant for you.\" Startling you, Hayley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to see her standing at the door. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley sighed. \"The link bracelet causes hallucinations for a short time before the wearer is used to seeing through another person's mind.\" Firmly but kindly, she explained. \"Those hallucinations can be worse if the bracelet is not meant for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Pouting, you muttered. \"I was just trying to help...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you were being nosy.\" Half grinning, Hayley countered. \"You're just as bad as Hannah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina giggled. \"Just don't do that again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shuffled out of Christina's room, not sure if you should tell anyone what you had seen while wearing the bracelet.</span></div></div>",

Hannah was asleep on the couch down below. Mel was probably still taking Susan Rich home. Cassie was probably gone. It looked like the sun had set without you realizing it. You heard a noise behind you as Hayley stepped out of Christina's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom just called. She'll be back in a few minutes. I'm going to back to my friends, Lucy. Try not to have another emergency for a while. I tired of getting warped back home to help you. It's wrecking havoc on my social life.\" Hayley seemed both annoyed and amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, Mom knows about me trying on the bracelet...\" you sighed, preparing yourself for another earful later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" Hayley got prepared to teleport herself, but looked you over first. \"Nice outfit, by the way. DIdn't know you'd take to ballet so much?\" You blushed as you realized you were still wearing the performance tutu from ballet that you got thanks to that Knightley kid reflecting your magic. With all the Christina stuff going on, you hadn't had time to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to explain yourself to Hayley, but she was already gone. Teleported away. You sighed again and began to walk back to your room to change. But suddenly as you opened the door, an extreme terror gripped you. You stumbled into the room and fell to the floor wanting to break out into tears. Suddenly, you noticed a large man standing in the middle of the room. You quickly realized her was the cause of this fear. Something about him, an aura, was making him terrifying to you. He step closer. You wanted to scream, but you couldn't. You were two scared. As he reached you, he bent down, reached out and put a necklace around your neck. Suddenly, you felt much better. The extreme terror was gone and you could move again, but there was still a man you had never seen before in your bedroom. You stepped back still worried, but he seemed friendlier now, and there was a warm smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" he said kindly. \"Sorry about that. I was cursed years ago. Makes those with witch blood very afraid of me. That amulet should protect you though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" you asked warily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why me?\" He laughed a hearty laugh, like how you'd imagine Santa Claus would laugh. \"I'm your grandfather, Moriarty. Moriarty Strange. Your mom left a message for me at our drop to come right away. So here I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was really a shock to you. You had heard stories of your grandfather, but no one had ever told you why you had never met him your entire life. You hadn't known if he was alive or dead. \"Here you are...in my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scratched his head. \"Yeah, sorry about that. I'm not very accurate with teleportation. That's more of a skill you witches have. Though you probably don't have your powers yet.\" He sure did like to talk a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have powers. Really strong ones.\" You did your flame to show off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked amazed. \"Wow, that's real impressive. Wonderful that one so young as you is already learning magic. I'm very proud of you, Hannah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not Hannah, I'm Lucy,\" you corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. I don't remember your mother mentioning a Lucy. I just thought she said the young girly one was Hannah.\" He pointed to your outfit as evidence. \"But maybe I'm confusing grandkids. Easy to do when you haven't met any of them.\" He laughed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannah's my big sister,\" you tried to explain. This was getting too weird. \"Look, Grandpa, what are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled. \"Grandpa...I've never been called that before. I like it. Definitely could get used to it. I like you, kid.\" He tussled your hair, which made you blush. Why did everyone love doing that to you so much? \"Well, as I said your Mom left a message for me. She only does that in emergencies, but if the rumors I heard are true, I'm guessing she wants to know about the Pharaoh's ring I'm guarding.\" He showed off a ring with a opal stone at the center. \"Pretty neat, huh? I bet you love jewelry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I got my ears pierced last week.\" You showed off the sparkly ear studs you were wearing in your ears. You weren't sure why you were so open with this man. He just made you feel comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very pretty, sweetheart,\" he complemented. \"I also thought I'd meet your older brother while I'm here. John. I hear he's got the potential to quite a powerful witch boy. I was thinking of offering to train him.\" Your eyes widened. You tried to interrupt him, but he kept talking. \"You know, there's a prophecy that a grandson of mine is going to be one of the most power male witch there ever was. I'm thinking its probably him. Of course, there's also a prophecy one of my granddaughters will become an insanely powerful witch. Maybe that's you, eh?\" He chuckled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they can't both me, Grandpa. I'm...well...I used to be...\" You gulped. \"John's gone. I'm Lucy now and I don't want to be a boy ever again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour grandfather's jaw dropped.</span></div></div>",

Just as you had finished, a knock came to the door and mom peered in before entering with Moriarty. She seemed frustrated but carried a patient smile as she turned to you. \"Curiosity is not a sin, dear.\" Firmly, she said. \"Still, you should not play with anything you do not understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, mommy.\" Pouting, you said. \"I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Live and learn.\" Shrugging, Moriarty said.

She paused. \"Do you remember the story of Cinderella?\" You nodded to which mom said, \"Same thing only Elena is the step mother from hell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing you need to worry yourself about, my dear.\" Smiling, Moriarty said. He held out a lollipop for you to see. \"Why don't you run along and forget all about that crazy vision the bracelet gave you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, you took the lollipop and gave it a small lick. To your surprise, it tasted like strawberry icecream, your favorite treat. \"Delicious!\" Beaming, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you were running off, forgetting all about even touching the bracelet. Mom sighed then turned to Moriarty. \"Really, dad?\" Frowning, she demanded. \"Lucy is hyper enough to be eating sweets before dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A distraction was needed.\" Serious, Moriarty replied. \"I couldn't think of anything else.\" he smiled. \"Besides, this is the first time I get to spoil my grandchildren.\" He then turned to Christina who was watching in fear from her room.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You didn't know how many of those amulets your Grandfather had, and you didn't want her to experience the terror from the curse on him that you had. Besides, you really didn't want to have to share this lollipop. It was super calming and you imagined magic was at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the doorbell rang. Thinking nothing of it, you popped off the couch and headed to answer the door. Your state of relaxation was immediately ruined by the sight you saw at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are <i>you</i> doing her, Pinbrat?\" you said with great distain and surprise. You had figured out what revenge you were going to take yet. This was too soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean Knightley groaned at the sight of you, but he didn't seem quite as surprise to see you as you were to see him. \"Looking for my teacher, Sparkle Boots. So you can get out of my way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your teacher?\" you said with confusion. Sean had mentioned him last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhh, Young Knightley. You found the place! Good, good,\" your Grandfather's voice boomed from behind. Color drained from your face as you realized who Sean's teacher was. \"Glad to see my teleportation spell didn't send to too far afield.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean stared daggers at Grandpa Moriarty. \"It sent me into the pool, Sir.\" It was only now that you noticed Sean's clothing was completely soaked. Which made you giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, come on in. Come on in. I'm sure Natalie has plenty of clothes your size here,\" Grandpa said as he ushered the dripping boy into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine, Sir. I don't want to borrow any clothes.\" He glared at you. \"I see your not wearing that silly outfit anymore.\" He was referring to the elaborate tutu you had taken off only minutes before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed deeply and lied quickly. \"Yeah, right. I took that off hours ago. First chance I got.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, this was the point when your Grandfather noticed you were no longer wearing that very same outfit. \"Hey, you're not wearing that ballet outfit anymore, Princess. You didn't have to take that off on my account.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to die. You actually wanted to die. Especially as Sean's face twisted into a smug expression with the realization of what Grandpa was taking about. \"Oh, I would have loved to have seen you in such a pretty outfit, Sparkle Boots. I'm sure you looked lovely.\" His voice was dripping with mocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands started to crackle with magic. \"I'll give you a matching one, Pinbrat!\" you shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try it. It'll go about as well as last time,\" Sean responded, readying himself for whatever you threw at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ENOUGH!!!!\" Grandpa bellowed. Both of you snapped to attention, facing him. It was fortunate that Hannah was able to sleep through anything. Grandpa sighed as he looked back and forth between you. \"I take it you two know each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, this is the girl who made my socks all pink and ruffly,\" Sean explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled. \"That was pretty awesome.\" You remembered something. \"Wait, you had to spend the rest of the day as a girl, didn't you? My grandpa turned you into a girl.\" You were at this point laughing hysterically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean gestured toward you. \"This girl is unbearable, Sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This girl</i> is my granddaughter, Lucy,\" Grandpa emphasized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but still, she's annoying.\" Sean looked at you again. \"Super annoying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at him. \"It makes me soooooo happy that I annoy you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you introduce me to someone else?\" Sean asked. \"Anyone else? What about your grandson John. He sounded pretty cool.\" Sean's eyes lit up with admiration as he mention your former self. You started giggling again, knowing he was about to be severely disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandpa grimaced and rubbed his shoulder awkwardly. \"Actually, young Knightley, I've just learned that Lucy here...well, she was John.\" Then, he smiled sheepishly. \"But Lucy's pretty great, isn't she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean's jaw dropped and he looked at you in complete and utter shock and horror. </span></div></div>",

It's different for every witch boy.

I didn't realize about Lucy or your houseguest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come you don't need one?\" you asked Sean, almost pleasantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smirked. \"Witch boys are immune, cause we're not wimps like girls are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could respond, Mom finally took notice of Sean. \"Who is this boy dripping on my carpet?\" she asked.

Isn't that wonderful?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"It really is, Dad. Better than you just sitting miserable around that castle.\" Grandpa lived in a castle? Mom turned to Sean. \"Maybe I have some clothing you can change into.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay, Ma'am,\" Sean said very politely. \"I don't want to wear any girl clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't catch cooties,\" you said, rolling your eyes. Sean shot you a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom chuckled. \"That wasn't exactly what I had in mind, Sean.\" She waved her hand and Sean's clothes disappeared, replaced by a sweater and slacks, dry socks and shoes. He seemed pleased with this result. You weren't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Ma'am. You're very kind.\" You suddenly became concerned that Mom might not realize that Sean was the most annoying person on Earth. You needed her to know that. \"Oh, I have something for you.\" Sean reached on to his hand and pulled off a ruby ring. You realized it must be a Pharaoh ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled and took it. \"So the Knightley family had one too. This means we have 4 and Lilly Sweetie has 4. That's progress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You found Elena's ring, Mommy?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom held up an Onyx ring. \"Yes, the witch was vain and oblivious enough that she was just wearing it on her finger. I can't believe no one found it until today.\" She looked at the four rings in her hand, one ruby, one diamond, one opal, and one onyx. \"I should take these back to the witch council.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think you can find a way to destroy them?\" Grandpa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom looked optimistic. \"Not yet, but we got some good people working on it. These rings have caused enough trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that you have the rings. I'm afraid Knightley and I should be off,\" Grandpa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt extreme disappointment all of a sudden. \"Wait, Grandpa. You just got here. I was hoping to get to know you a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandpa bent down in front of you. \"I'm sorry, sweetheart, but the longer I'm away from my castle. The more powerful the curse grows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face fell. \"What's the deal with this curse anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandpa smiled. \"Maybe I have time to tell my granddaugther one story.\" Sean looked like someone had just told him he had to have teeth pulled.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The phone rang the next morning as Mom was just about to start making breakfast. Hayley had slept over at a friend's house, but that still left four hungry girls who needed to eat. Though the only up was Hannah, who was sitting at the table deep in thought as she flipped through some chapter book about fairies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mom answered the phone, she discovered Clara Belacourt on the other line. \"Hello, Clara. How are you? I'm sorry we didn't get a chance to talk when I dropped off Liz yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine, Natalie. Sounded like a real emergency. I hope it worked out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"Jury's still out on that. How's Liz after everything that happened on Friday.\" She still felt guilty about the Morganas raiding the house while Liz was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's surprisingly okay. I think she sees Lucy as some sort of Superhero figure. Someone who will keep her safe no matter what. It makes me feel much better knowing Lucy looks after her. My magic isn't that strong, so I'm not much good in a fight, so I'm glad to hear your family has her back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hard to believe they've only been friends for a little over a week,\" Mom remarked. She was relieved to hear Clara wasn't too upset about the whole incident. \"They act like they've been best friends for years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara chuckled. \"Anyway, the reason I called is that I got some information on your rings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's amazing. I know information on them is pretty scarce.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is my job,\" Clara said, downplaying the complement, but still quite flattered. \"Much of this you already know. There are ten rings, each with a different kind of jewel or gemstone decorating it. There's amethyst, sapphire, ruby, emerald, diamond, opal, onyx, topaz, moonstone, and garnet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom quickly ran all the Pharaoh's rings she had seen through her mind. \"Lilly has four and we have four. I guess that leaves only the moonstone and the emerald unaccounted for. Did you have any luck matching the rings to the families protecting them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was difficult, but I am good at what I do. You know the Morganas had one to begin with and they stole one from transformed boys from both the Havendale family and the Beaumont family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was also the one Christina bought at Samantha's shop,\" Mom mentioned. \"Some family must have lost theirs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was most likely the ring belonging to the Ravenwood family. The sapphire, right?\" Clara said, checking her notes. \"They fell on some hard financial times about 20 years back and sold off most of there prized artifacts. Then they were disgraced by the witch council due to that scandal and things just went downhill from there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"I remember the trial. Well, those are the four rings, Lilly has possession of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I hate to break it to you Natalie, but she probably has five.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe color drained from Mom's face. \"The Sweeties were one of the ten families?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, they had the emerald, most likely. That's probably how Lilly got her magic back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom cursed herself for not thinking of that. \"Well, the four I recovered are the ones that were protected by the Banes, the Kruses, the Stranges, and the Knightleys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara was quite surprised to hear that. \"The Knightleys? I was sure that would be the hardest to find. That family was wiped out in that incident three years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I thought too, but just yesterday I met their last living heir,\" Mom said, thinking of Sean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's amazing. You'll have to explain later.\" Clara flipped through her notes searching for the info she needed. \"So the last ring is the Moonstone. I'm afraid that one might be tricky as well. It was given to the Frey families.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom groaned. The Freys were strong believers in the old ways and witch and female superiority. They lived out of town in the mountains and were very cautious about who they let near them. \"On the bright side, there is no way Lilly will get near them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara was in agreement on that. \"I know it goes against your maternal instincts to get them involved, but you might want to bring Lucy or Hannah with you when you approach them. I met the matriarch, Gwendolyn Frey at a conference a few years ago. She has a soft spot for fiery, independent-minded little girls. They might help you get your foot in the door. I'm guessing Lucy's reputation has even reached them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom groaned again. She really didn't want to get her daughters more involved then they already were, but Clara had a point. \"I'll think about it. What about destroying the rings? Did you find anyway to do so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's possible, but you would need to have all ten rings together. They have to be destroyed all at once,\" Clara explained. \"You sure the witch council is going to go for that. I know a few want to keep the rings around in their hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They've caused too much trouble for us recently,\" Mom said, remembering Elena, the Morganas, and Lilly all made use of the rings in some way. \"They had to be destroyed. Thanks for the information, Clara. You truly are impressive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anytime.\" And with that, the two hung up.</span></div></div>",

You changed into a blouse, tulle shirt, and tights, but beyond that you tried to avoid your room. You still felt a little bit of temptation to try the link bracelet, and figured the further you were away from it, the better. So pretty soon, you found yourself playing your Nintendo DS on the couch downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom had breakfast ready. She made pancakes every Sunday morning, which was your and Hannah's favorite. You ate quietly, though to make sure Mom didn't notice you and Christina were slightly at odds, you avoided talking to anyone. It wasn't too hard. Mel was absorbed in a magazine and Hannah seemed to be deep in thought about something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were finishing breakfast, the phone rang. Mom went to pick it up, but after talking for a few moments, handed the phone to you with a smile. \"Lucy, it's for you. It's a girl named Keira. She says she's your friend from school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded excitedly and picked up the phone. Keira had never called you at home before, so this was potentially exciting. \"Hey, Keira. What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Lucy. How are you feeling? I was worried when you didn't come to school on Friday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to think back and remember Mom kept you at home to help Christina adjust. Seemed like forever ago. \"Oh, yeah...I was sick, but I'm feeling a lot better now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to make sense to Keira. \"Yeah, Tammy was out too. Something must be going around, but I'm glad you're all better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" you responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeira then got to the point of her call. \"So my Mom says your dress is ready. She was wondering if you could come by today to try it on.\" This got you really excited. You and your six new friends were doing a group costume for Halloween, which was in about a week. You were all going as Disney Princesses, you as Cinderella. Keira's mom was a seamstress and had been making a beautiful Cinderella costume for you. Finally, it was ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so cool. Let me ask my Mom.\" You quickly and eagerly told Mom what was up. Christina rolled her eyes in the background, annoyed that you were so excited about trying on such a girly outfit, but you ignored her. Mom reminded you that you and her were taking Christina to the mall for her first lesson with Samantha, but suggested maybe you all could swing by Keira's place first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got back on the phone and told Keira the news. \"But there is one thing. A friend of mine has been staying over this weekend. Is it okay if she comes too just to watch.\" You knew Christina wouldn't be excited about it, but she'd just have to deal with it. You weren't going out of your way for her at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should be fine. Someone else might be swinging by as well.\" Keira giggled, getting you curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah? Who?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see later. See you soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hung up, a bit nervous about having Christina meet Keira. She was going to meet all your human friends eventually, but you were still worried she'd do something to mess things up for you.</span></div></div>",

No, that sounds so lame?\" groaned Christina as you informed her where you all were going before visiting Samantha. \"At least your interested in magical artifacts. I'm not interested at all in Disney Princesses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes. \"You will be pretty soon, once Samantha done with you.\" You were packing up a few things in your bag for the day in your room. The main thing you wanted was your spellbook. You thought it might be useful when you were in Samantha's shop. You might be able to find ingredients for some cool spells to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not going to do that with me, Lucy,\" Christina assured you. \"Witchmother respects that I want to be a boy.\" But you knew she was wrong. Samantha had manipulated Christina before and she'd do it again. You just had to make sure you didn't get caught in Samantha's web too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just try to be nice to my friend, okay?\" you implored your friend. \"She's not like Liz. She doesn't know about witches. She's just a cool girl from school who helped me when I was feeling really lonely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina frowned. \"How about I make you a deal? I'll go to this dress thing if you put on the link bracelet. I'll even put on a dress if you want.\" Christina was clearly desperate to get you to try on the bracelet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There isn't going to be a dress for you, Christina, so you don't have to worry about that,\" you said. \"Keira's mom makes custom dresses. So they base it off measuring you. You haven't been measured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina looked confused. \"When did you get measured? I thought you said you'd never met Keira's mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't. Keira knows how to measure too. She did it for me at school.\" You finally got the spell book to fit in your backpack. You smiled. \"Alright, I'm ready to go.\" The clock on your wall said you still had a half hour before you needed to leave though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina groaned again and went into your nightstand, pulling out the link bracelet. \"Fine, but I'm bringing this too. Just in case Witchmother can convince you to change your mind. You're really missing out, Lucy.\" She slipped the bracelet into one of her pant pockets and walked out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were happy to be able to sit in your room without feeling like that thing was in your drawer waiting for you, but you were a bit nervous about what Christina or Samantha might try to pull during Christina's lesson. Mom was going to be there, but you didn't feel like you could tell her what was going on. You needed other backup. There was one person you knew who would never miss the chance to see you all dressed up like a Princess and you decided to invite her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A half hour later, with you, Christina, and Hannah in the backseat, Mom pulled her car up in front of Keira's house. You felt a wave of excitement as you got ready to get out of the car. However, any excitement you may have had paled in comparison to the excitement that was radiating from your older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, what are you getting so crazy for?\" Christina asked Hannah. Hannah was making little squealing sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so exciting. It's Lucy's first PRINCESS DRESS!!!!! Well, it's her first that she's wanted to put on,\" Hannah explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom chuckled up front as she got out of the car. While not intentional, bringing Hannah to watch your back was a stroke of genius. The second she found out about you trying on a custom made dress, she demanded that Mom bring her too, or else face her 8-year-old wrath. Mom didn't suspect the real reason Hannah was coming along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the other girls filed out of the car. It was then that Christina noticed a camera gripped tightly in Hannah's hands. \"Wait, you're going to take pictures?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Hannah responded like it was the most obvious thing in the world. \"This event must be remembered...for science.\" You started giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina shot you a look. \"I can't believe you're okay with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged. \"Of course, I'm okay with it. Hannah's my sister and I like making her happy.\" Hannah smiled at you. \"Plus, I want to have pictures too to show how awesome I'm going to look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina shook her head in despair. Her best friend had lost her mind. You had gone full girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached the door and rang the doorbell yourself. Your friend, your job as far as you were concerned. The house was nice, bigger and fancier than yours, as Keira's family had more money. While her mom worked as a seamstress (mostly because she enjoyed the work), her father had some big corporate job in the city and Keira and her two sisters lived a very comfortable live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door flew open to reveal Keira's smiling face. \"Good. You're here.\" The two of you squealed and pulled each other into hug. This was actually the first time you two had hung out outside of school, so it was an exciting affair. Christina rolled her eyes, while Hannah felt a pang of sadness and envy. \"You excited?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So excited. I can't wait to see the dress.\" You remembered introductions were in order. \"Oh, Keira. This is my mom, this is my friend, Christina, and you probably already know my sister, Hannah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've seen Hannah around at school.\" Keira waved at all of them. \"Why don't you all come in? Mom's in her studio with a client.\" She giggled a bit at the word client. \"Just wait until you see who it is.\" She whispered the last part to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a very lovely home, Keira,\" Mom commented as the four of you followed Keira through the different rooms of the house. Sure enough, it seemed pretty fancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Mrs. Harrison,\" Keira responded. \"It's nice to hear that.\" She waved a younger girl playing with dolls in what looked like a playroom. You guess it was Keira's younger sister, which Keira confirmed a second later. \"That's my little sister, Molly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you reached a door in the back, which Keira pulled open to reveal a studio full of fabrics and figures for hanging clothes on. Keira's mom (or so you assumed based on their shared fiery red hair) sat in the center working on an Alice in Wonderland dress that was being worn by a girl. The girl's mom stood nearby beaming. What shocked you was that you recognized the mom. It was your Aunt Catherine, which meant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a close looked at the girl in the dress and your jaw dropped. Next to you, Hannah was having the exact same reaction. Christina, on the other hand, was a little more puzzled. Finally, she stated, \"Hey, doesn't that girl look kind of like your cousin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim Towers fumed at your sudden appearance, but also seemed extremely embarrassed to be caught in this situation. His voice portrayed a mix of anger and panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what are you two cootie-brains doing here?!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only was response was the flash of Hannah's camera.</span></div></div>",

Thank you for having me and making me a dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no trouble, dear,\" Mrs. McCarthy responded. \"Keira said you girls have been getting very close. And as far as I'm concerned that makes you part of the family.\" You blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure we can't pay?\" Mom asked Mrs. McCarthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for this. I do this every year for my daughters and their friends. It's a fun challenge for me. But if you like my work, feel free to purchase something else down the road.\" She finished one last tuck on Tim's dress. \"There we go. Walk around see how it feels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels like I have cooties,\" Tim grumbled, but after his Mom coughed threateningly, he followed that with: \"Thanks, Mrs. McCarthy.\" He looked back at Aunt Catherine. \"I don't have to curtsey or anything lame like that, do I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeira introduced her Mom to everyone, including Christina, who still looked like she'd rather be anywhere else.

And why is he wearing that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Catherine smiled. \"Well, I hear from both your mother and the school about the way Tim has been treated the girls at school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He pulled my pigtails,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He threw mud at my dress,\" Keira added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He pulled my seat out from behind me,\" Hannah also shared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis led to an embarrassed nod from Aunt Catherine. \"And those are just a few examples. So I decided if he was going be so hostile to girls, he could spend some time as one.\" You wanted to ask why not change him with magic, but you couldn't with Keira there. \"Faye is an old friend of mine and she offered to make Tim a dress for Halloween.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to be Darth Vader,\" Tim called deviantly from the corner, which made you smile. If only he knew what the witch council was calling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be nice to the girls this week and maybe you still can be,\" Aunt Catherine responded. \"Otherwise you're going to be Alice.\" Tim groaned loudly at that news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled, but stopped when you felt a hand on your shoulder. Mrs. McCarthy was smiling down at you. \"Well, Lucy. You ready to become Cinderella?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded eagerly. \"Super ready. I can't wait.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. McCarthy handed you a garment bag and pointed you to the back. \"There's a changing room back there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeira grabbed your hand. \"Come on, Lucy.

What are we doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah looked to make sure Mom was out of earshot. \"I'm going to turn Mike Cutie into a girl. Don't tell Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up in surprise. After what Tim had said, the idea of turning another boy into a girl filled you with uncertainty. You had more questions for Hannah, but the two of you had caught up to Mom and Christina at Samantha's doorstep. You'd have to talk to her later. Now, it was Christina's turn to ring the doorbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened a minute later, revealing Samantha wearing an old-fashioned gothic gown. \"Wonderful. You're all here.\" She looked down at Christina and smiled. \"Hello, Christina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina smiled back. \"Hello, Witchmother.\" She didn't hesitate to call Samantha by that title in front of your family today. She was growing more comfortable. Though, Mom frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on in, all of you,\" Samantha said as she waved you all in. You stepped into her home and your eyes widened with wonder. If you thought her store was a witch's playground, that made this house a witch's amusement park. There were cool looking magic items everywhere and a library filled to the brim with magic books. The whole house seemed to have a dark and gothic theme to it, but that somehow made the place more appealing to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is really cool-looking, Aunt Samantha,\" Hannah said in wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I bet it's really fun to explore,\" you agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't touch anything,\" Mom warned. \"You don't know what effects some of these items might have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha waved off Mom's concern. \"Oh, don't worry. I don't keep the dangerous stuff lying around. The worst anything out could do is turn a curious boy into an eager girl, but I don't think that will be a problem will it.\" She winked at you and chuckled. This did cause you and Hannah to laugh, though Mom and Christina weren't so amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we start the lesson now?\" Christina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, sweetie,\" Samantha said, patting Christina's head. She looked at you and Hannah. \"Feel free to join us or make yourselves at home.\" You thought for a second. You were curious to see what Christina was going to be learning, but you also kind of wanted to explore the house. You could also use this chance to talk to Mom about your concerns about what Tim said or you could look through some of these magic books.</span></div></div>",

Samantha smiled back and, to Christina, it was clear there was a rivalry between the two. <i>\"This must be why all the rules.\"</i> Looking between the two women, she thought. <i>\"They had to have been bitter rivals for years.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina turned to you and saw that you seemed to be clueless to it all. She guessed that was why you were so hesitant, you likely only knew mom's side of the story. She made the decision to talk to you again later when you could be alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steve and Rick, although they act like jerks around school, have saved a number of girls both normal and witch born from serious harm.\" Serious, Samantha began. \"After several incidents, it became clear to witch investigators that the two boys were diamonds in the rough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diamonds in the what...?\" Confused, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boys who put on 'bad boy' personas to blend in with the crowd.\" Translating, mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rick and Steve had thwarted more than a few true bullies who had targeted the weak or, in this case, young witches who are not aloud to use magic.\" Serious, Samantha said. \"They had also stopped a fair share of burglars who had broken into their neighbors homes.\" She paused, smiling, \"To many witches, having to owe a boy a debt of honor can be more embarrassing than losing a fight to one. Something had to be done to reward the two for always running in like knights in shining armor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same could be said for you two.\" Pointing at you and Christina, mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Christina blushed at that and turned to each other. It made sense, in a way and it caused you both to give a rueful smile. \"So, we would have both been girls and witches one way or another anyway.\" Smiling, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha nodded. \"Exactly.\" Smiling, she said. \"You two had saved so many young witches that they considered it a blessing in disguise when Harry, now Christina was sold the corrupted magic glasses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which was why they did nothing to end the corrupted test.\" Sighing, mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it worked out for the best.\" Smiling, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Reluctantly, Christina said. \"Same here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then winced. \"Does that make Tim a criminal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim is hurt and confused.\" Patiently, Samantha said. \"He is a jerk around young witches but  his actions are no worse than say you changing a boy's socks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat caused you to blush. \"Does Tim have a nickname too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"Trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Christina giggled at that before you said, \"Why don't you both give the lecture? It seems to me that you work better as a team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Samantha blushed slightly, though they both tried to hide it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No had talked to her directly about the glitter bombs, even though everyone knew she was one of the forces behind them. \"You don't hold back, Lucy.\" She thought how to phrase her answer, not wanting to freely admit to the glitter bombs in front of Mom. \"The witch council likes to make sure that when boys are turned to girls, it won't cause chaos or expose us witches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remember our neighbor's son?\" Mom added. \"It could have been really bad if I hadn't been able to turn him back and erase all their memories. We don't want the witch trials starting up again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you don't agree?\" you asked Samantha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha nodded. \"Not exactly. I do agree that we have to be smart about using our magic. I don't agree that the witch council always knows best. I've changed many boys into girls over the years and I've never risked exposing us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except with the glitter bombs,\" Mom pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha chose her next words carefully. \"Well, whoever was responsible for that was trying to cause chaos. She was trying to frame Cassie, after all, if I read your summary of the events right.\" She smiled at Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you two stop?\" Christina begged. \"It doesn't help me to learn if you two are fighting all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to make sure this woman doesn't radicalize you girls,\" Mom explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yet you let them be friends with Cassie Bane.

Fearing she would lose all hope of learning anything from Samantha, Christina jumped up and joined you. Only she was surprised by what you said next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs Belacourt told me that there is a magical fail safe in every witch household.\" Firmly, you said. \"It turns to fighting witches into three year olds until another witch can change them back.\" You frowned. \"I am not old enough to babysit so stop it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" Nodding, Christina said. \"Besides, Ms Harrison, you promised not to interfere so long as Samantha followed your rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you two fight all the time anyway?\" Pouting, you demanded. \"You get mad at us when we fight what makes you two different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Samantha looked at each other surprised. Mom wanted to say it was because they were adults and you and Christina were children but she knew that was not going to satisfy either of you. \"Sometimes two witches simply cannot settle their differences or work well with each other but must still work with each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made Samantha drop her feud with Cassie.\" Defiant, Christina pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassie has changed.\" Frowning, mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How has aunt Samantha not changed, mom?\" Curious, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow both mom and Samantha looked uncomfortable. Only, after a moment, Samantha grinned. \"We are being lectured by Darth and Vader, Natalie.\" With a chuckle, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom chuckled at that. \"They are too much like ourselves.\" Grinning back, mom replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The two of you are just as Natalie and I were as kids.\" Turning to you, Samantha said. \"We were almost inseparable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Wincing, Christina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it have something to do with that vision I had?\" Also Wincing, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha sighed. \"My step mother did not like what Natalie and I had.\" Sadly, she said. \"She did all she could to tear us apart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A curse.\" Wide eyed, you gasped. You then frowned. \"Mom, aunt Samantha, by acting like you are, the evil step mother wins!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that simple, Lucy.\" Sighing, mom said. \"You don't understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. \"Then explain it until we do.\" Holding your ground, you demanded. You took Christina's hand, surprising her. \"The evil step mother tore you apart but I am not letting her do the same to us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a chance, Christina whispered, \"The link bracelet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a thought, you said...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You still didn't trust the link bracelet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom began to speak. \"Lucy, Elena did curse us and what she did to us was wrong, but we are the people we are today because of it. I've told you about my history with covens when I was younger. I was much like Cassie and Samantha. In fact, while rebelling from my mother, I let Samantha inform my own way of thinking. I had no love for males, especially after my father vanished, and I believed witches were superior to regular humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which they are,\" Samantha interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom ignored the comment. \"Elena's curse and my inability to get along with Samantha for better or worse allowed me to be the person I am today. It allowed me to pursue friendships with regular humans, much like your doing. And when I found out what had happened to my father, it allowed me to repair my relationship with him. And I had a son, who I loved and adored for 13 years before he became my daughter. I don't think I would have given you the freedom or choices I did if Samantha and I were as close as we once were. I would have turned you into a girl the second you were born.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou considered that for a second. \"But...friendship is a good thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"Yes, it is, but it's complicated. Sometimes a friendship isn't always healthy for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must be. You felt super confused, which prompted Samantha to respond. \"Your mother's right, Lucy. She's become a fine witch. More independent and powerful than she ever would have been if she just stayed with me.\" She sounded sad as she said this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about Keira. If I hadn't been curse, I might not have let you be friends with girls like her. Because I would have thought you were too good for her. Samantha believes deeply in the old ways, and I just don't anymore,\" Mom explained further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha nodded. \"We both like the people we are now, and we don't spend time thinking about what might have been instead. I might be more like your mother, or your mother might be more like me.\" Neither thought seemed to appeal to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, you could break the curse. Be friends again,\" Christina suggested. You felt very sad for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Samantha looked at each other and sighed. Mom spoke first. \"Girls, we broke the curse years ago, though Elena hasn't caught on. We're just different people now. That happens sometimes. Your childhood best friend isn't always your best friend for life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a twinge of guilt, as you understood exactly what she meant. Christina, as Harry, had been your best friend for years, but if someone asked you now who your best friend was, you'd answer Liz without a second thought. You cared deeply for Christina, but you weren't as close as you had been and you had a strange feeling that divide was only going to grow over time, especially if she continued to learn from Samantha. You were curious about what Samantha had to teach too, but you knew at the end of the day, you were your mother's daughter and you would always take her side. You looked over at Christina and wondered what she was thinking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom frowned, then said something that surprised you. \"The girls are right, though. Us fighting is going to do them no good. I don't approve of the old ways, Samantha, but you aren't breaking any witch laws by practicing them, and Christina seems to want to learn from you. If she understands the risks, I need to be comfortable letting her do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha nodded. \"That's fair, but you're also right to worry. I did take advantage of Christina during the glitter bomb incident.\" She realized she had just acknowledged her involvement in that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. As long as the feud with Cassie is done and there are not more public incidents like that, I won't turn you in,\" Mom assured Samantha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha smiled. \"Thanks, Natalie. I respect your protectiveness of these girls. I will also do my best to respect that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie's face turned stern all of sudden. \"So no more late night visits to my daughter.\" Color drained from your face and Samantha's. \"Yes, I know all about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do?\" you said in surprise. \"Do you know everything? Why didn't you say anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie chuckled. \"I don't know everything. But I know when a witch transports herself into my house. I didn't say anything because I wanted to see if you would. You didn't and I'm disappointed about that, but you also didn't take the link bracelet, so I'm proud of you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I thought I was protecting Christina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Protect yourself first, young lady,\" Mom scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize too, Natalie,\" Samantha said. \"In my desire to instruct Christina, I overstepped my bounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"You did, and it will take me some time to forgive for that, but unfortunately late night recruiting attempts are also still legal according to the witch council and you are far from the first who has tried it. But understand my daughters are off-limits. Their grandfather would be very cross if someone took advantage of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis surprised Hannah, who rarely heard her grandfather mentioned. You remembered she didn't know about his visit either. Still, referencing him turned Samantha even whiter. \"I understand,\" she said nervously. Mom smiled, satisfied that Samantha wouldn't try something like that again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Christina,\" Mom said. \"I think it is high time we all listened to what exactly you want.\"</span></div></div>",

Not after the stunts she's pulled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Mommy...\" you pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts. I'm still your mother,\" Mom was firm. You knew not to argue. \"I understand you want to learn about artifacts, but I'm not sure there's any aspect of magic you don't want to learn about. You have to have some patience, especially because there are other parts of your magical education that are more pressing. It's my job to raise you. Christina is in a different boat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so, Mommy,\" you responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha nodded, adding, \"You have a wonderful mother to guide your education, Lucy.

She needs someone else to guide her, and frankly, you and your sisters keep your mom's hands plenty full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of these children alone would keep my hands full,\" Mom admitted. \"But I love them with all my heart.\" She swooped you and Hannah into a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is best for Christina is not what is best for you,\" Samantha added. \"You both have your own journeys to go on. You must come to terms with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I get it, I guess,\" you said, giving in. \"I guess I'm just worried about what will happen to Christina if she lets you teach her. She wants to be a boy again.\" Christina nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha chuckled. \"Christina and I have discussed that quite a bit. I won't magic away her wish to be a boy, but she also knows that my influence will likely have her embracing her new identity.\" That of Samantha's daughter, but she didn't say this part out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we'll just see what happens,\" Christina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha noticed the clock. \"I feel like we've made some major breakthroughs today, but our hour is up. I have to go see to the shop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina looked very sad to hear this. \"Can't I stay with you, Witchmother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha shook her head. \"We need the witch council to sign off first, and ideally your human mother would give you permission too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what if Mom went with Aunt Samantha and Christina to the shop? That way you could continue the lesson a little longer,\" Hannah suggested. \"Lucy and I can walk home. We aren't far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom turned down that suggestion quick. \"You have to cross that big street. Not an option.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teleport us, then,\" Hannah countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom raised a suspicious eyebrow. \"What are you up to, young lady?\" You knew exactly what Hannah was up to, but fortunately she lied better than you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike and I are supposed to hang out.

You had made this meeting all about you and Mom and Samantha, not Christina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"Very well.\" Mel was at home too, so she wouldn't be leaving you two unattended. She waved her hand and suddenly you and Hannah were back in the Harrison living room.

Your proximity was one of the things that made Hannah and Mike playmates in the first place about five years ago. Hannah marched forward with confidence and purpose. You weren't so eager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Hannah. We might get in real trouble for doing this,\" you said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard Samantha. Changing a boy to a witch girl is a blessing to a lot of people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also heard her say the witch council doesn't like it when other people do changes like that,\" you pointed out. \"Why do you want to do this anyway? I thought you wanted Mike to stay a boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah sighed and stopped. \"That was before he said we couldn't be friends anymore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friday at school, he told me that he couldn't be friends with me because some of the boys at school were making fun of him for being best friends with a girl. He told me not to talk to him anymore.\" Hannah's eyes were tearing up as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a jerk,\" you said. You couldn't believe he would do that to your sister, especially when she was always such a good friend to him. For such a stupid reason too. Who cared if his best friend was a girl? You felt your nervousness vanish as your anger rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I figure if I make him a girl, then we can be friends again,\" Hannah explained as she revealed the vial of glitter in her hand. \"And no one will care if he likes girly stuff either.\" You nodded. It seemed to make sense. \"Besides, he's been super exposed to magic all his life. Everybody thinks he's going to turn into a witch girl anyway.\" She looked up at you. \"I was hoping you'd come with me, but if you're afraid of getting in trouble I won't make you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. You were all in. \"I don't care about getting in trouble. This boy hurt my awesome sister cause he was being a dumb boy. Let's make him a girl so he knows better.\" You grabbed Hannah's hand and joined her in her determined march to the Cutie house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there, Hannah rang the doorbell and Mike's mom opened the door. \"Oh, hello, Hannah. Mike's upstairs in his room playing. I'm guessing you and Lucy want to join him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah smiled politely. \"Thanks, Mrs. Cutie.\" She led you up the stairs to a door that had Mike's name on it in colored letters.</span></div></div>",

Hannah gasped upon seeing him and shoved the glitter back into her pocket. \"Mike!\" Shocked, she cried. \"What happened to you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two kids from school, Karl Dusty and Greg Waters.\" Sobbing, Mike replied. \"They started picking on me last week.\" He winced as he tried to sit up. \"I tried to keep you away so they wouldn't go after you next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Mike...\" Wincing, Hannah said. \"Does your mom know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike shook his head. \"I sneaked upstairs.\" Miserably, he replied. \"I don't know how to tell her.\" He then began to cry openly. \"I'm sorry...

I thought if I stopped hanging with you I could protect myself, but...but they didn't care.

Of course, it wasn't really that simple. \"But you'll want to learn how to use magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds okay. This might be pretty cool,\" Mike said with a smile.

I don't want to get you girls in trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the door opened and Mrs. Cutie stood there in surprise. She was holding a tray of lemonade and cookies, but dropped it all in surprise. You guessed she came to give you all refreshments. \"It's...it's happened. Oh my goodness, my child.\" She swooped Mike into a warm hug. \"Is this a good thing?\" she asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike nodded. \"Yeah, Mom. I'm really glad I'm not a stupid boy anymore. Plus, I can do magic.\" She showed her mom the flame she could make. You chuckled. Mike's mind was really adjusting quickly if she was already decrying stupid boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact even Mom noticed that. \"Wow, I heard Lucy took over a week to enjoy being a girl.\" She turned to you and Hannah. \"Is...is this normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, totally,\" Hannah answered quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was the weird one,\" you added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think...we'll call you Mikayla.

I'm so happy for you sweetie.\" She ran out of the room to get the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's calling Mom?\" you and Hannah said in unison as you looked at each other nervously. You hadn't been expecting this. Hopefully, she wouldn't come over. And if she did, hopefully, she wouldn't catch on to what you two did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Hannah,\" Mikayla said again as she pulled her friend into a hug. \"You really are my best friend.\" Hannah smiled as she felt her friend hug her and affirm her importance.

Once they were gone, mom turned to you and Hannah with a stern look on her face. \"There is a reason we have laws behind the use of magic, girls.\" Annoyed, she scolded. \"Mike Cutie was slowly changing inside and would have become a girl and a witch within a month.

The two were known as vicious bullies around school but yet no one has come forward with enough proof for the school to take action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like another victory for us, Greg.\" Gloating, Karl said. \"I haven't seen that Cutie creep all day long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg chuckled. \"He must be sick.\" Grinning, he said. \"The poor soul.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two laughed at their sick joke but fell silent as they saw Tim Towers enter the cafeteria with his fists clenched. Everyone in the room could tell he was furious as he marched right up to the two bullies. \"How many times do I have to tell you upperclassmen jerks!\" In a rage, he shouted. \"No one picks on my class but me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he landed a heavy punch into Karl's gut that forced him to keel over before Tim grabbed him by the belt and literally threw him over a table! Greg took a swing at Tim only to hurt his hand against his jaw. He took a step back, shaking his hand in pain. \"Is that all you got, jerk?\" Unimpressed, Tim demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You- You're just a kid!\" Startled, Greg shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim took a step forward and Greg jumped back, causing him to grin. \"I pick on girls, sure.\" Darkly, he said. \"Only its nothing serious. When I see bullies like you picking on the weak, that's when I get serious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll pay for this, Towers!\" Limping away, Karl shouted. \"We'll make you sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim lifted his foot slightly but stopped as a strong female voice commanded, \"That's enough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone turned to see principal Jessica Wells step up to Tim. \"My office, now.\" Sternly, she said. She then turned to Karl and Greg. \"You two go see the nurse then come to my office. Do not make me come looking for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarl and Greg reluctantly walked out of the cafeteria, giving Tim death glares but ran as he held up his fists. Jessica took a hold of Tim's hand and he immediately felt magic. \"It is one thing to stand up for your classmates.\" Whispering, she said. \"It is quite another to use boyish magic in a fight.\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Elvira had offered to take you and Hannah to school today, so she could talk to you too about the incident. It was a weird experience, as she had a driver and rode in a small limo. You and Hannah had never ridden in something like that before, and, under normal circumstances you both would have been super excited, but today you were too nervous about what your grandmother was going to do to you and Hannah was upset that Mikayla was going to Witchbloom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long ride of silence, Elvira finally spoke as the limo pulled up in front of the curb. \"You two look worried, but not ashamed of what you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crossed your arms and spoke deviantly. \"He hurt Hannah's feelings. He was being a stupid boy. Now, she isn't one anymore. I'd do it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\" Hannah wanted to make it clear she stood with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira nodded. \"Peer pressure can be a powerful motivator. I'm very sorry he rejected your friendship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom thinks he was trying to protect me from bullies,\" Hannah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira shook her head. \"That I don't believe. He was scared, and he was protecting himself, and he hurt you in the process. It's not uncommon for kids to do. What he did was hurtful and wrong. People don't protect people by driving them away. Remember that.\" You both nodded. This wasn't the way you had been expecting things to go, so you were caught off-guard. \"Your mom is nervous because something similar happened to her as a child. She DID get in trouble with the witch council. You two will not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won't?\" You thought this sounded too good to be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mom was there to figure out what really happened. The witch council was not. They think this was Mikayla's magic waking up,\" Elvira explained. You sighed with relief. The last thing you needed was the witch council on you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Mikayla? Does she really need to go to Witchbloom,\" Hannah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira shook her head. \"Witchbloom is no place for an 8-year-old girl. Your mom's plate is full, but I got Aunt Catherine to agree to tutor Mikayla for now. However, Hannah, you must be responsible for this situation. You turned Mike into Mikayla so you must protect her. Keep her from using magic in school and be the friend she needs. It couldn't be more important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Hannah said confused. \"But why is it so important?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A newly transformed witch girl usually forms a tight lifetime bond with whoever they feel is there for them during their adjustment period. Lucy connected with Liz. Christina connected with Samantha. You must make sure you are that person for Mikayla. You don't want her to fall under the sway of someone who will use her for her power, understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah accepted the task. \"I'll do whatever I can for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, but there is one other thing I need you to do to make up for you recklessness,\" Elvira said sternly. Hannah got worried. \"Tim is spiraling. Keep an eye on him for me.\" Hannah groaned, but accepted this job as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me? Am I going to get punished?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't about punishment. This is about being responsible for your actions,\" Elvira explained. \"There are two new students in your class today. I need you to help them get adjusted to being first-graders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked confused. \"Well, I know Christina's one, but who is the other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid you're not going to like this part,\" Elvira said with a sigh. \"The student is a boy. His teacher, who had been homeschooling him, felt after seeing him without other kids his age, he needed to spend more time in a social environment. He'll need a friend to guide him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes went wide as you realize who she was talking about. \"No. NO! You can't mean...not him...anyone, but him...\" As if on cue, there was a knock on the limo door. Elvira opened it and standing there, dressed way too preppy for your school, was your mortal enemy, Sean Knightley.</span></div></div>",

Elvira, why did you say it was all peer pressure that turned Mike against Hannah?\" Wincing, you asked. \"I heard him, or rather her, say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really want Hannah to live with that kind of guilt, Lucy?\" Interrupting you, Elvira asked. \"Mikayla was going to change with or without anyone's help.

Hannah smiled at the girl, as she did recognize her, despite the fact that this girl was wearing boy's clothes the last time they saw each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mikayla. You look great. I love your dress,\" Hannah complimented. Mikayla was wearing a yellow floral print dress with a jean jacket and a glittery headband in her head. You wouldn't know she had been a boy yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Mikayla looked herself over. \"Your mom turned some of my old clothes into girl clothes. I picked this out for my first day as Mikayla.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim scrunched up as his face as he studied this new girl. Suddenly, he had it. \"Mike? What did they do to you?

Tim went white as a sheet and shut up immediately. Hannah turned back to Mikayla. \"Let's talk over there.\" She pointed to a couple seats on the opposite side of the room for where Tim was. The two moved over there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I don't want to deal with the Toad this morning. You know he's the only person so far who remembers I was a boy. Everyone else thinks I've always been a girl.\" Mikayla seemed amazed.

I wanted to saw I was sorry. I shouldn't have told you we couldn't be friends anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah nodded. \"Why did you say that? It really hurt my feelings.\" She had heard different things from different people. She wanted Mikayla's story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was scared. Scared that the boys weren't going to leave me alone if I kept being your friend.\" Mikayla sighed. \"I get scared a lot you know. That's why I like being your friend because you don't seem like you get scared at all. Plus, you play awesome games with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do get scared. A lot. I just remember my Mom and my sisters and then I feel braver,\" Hannah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikayla nodded. \"I should have talked to you. But those boys said that if a boy gets protected by a girl, he''s weak. I didn't want to be weak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those boys are stupid,\" Hannah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that now,\" Mikayla said. \"And I understand why you turned me into a girl.\" She finally smiled. \"Besides, I feel a lot braver when I'm with you and now I don't have to worry about not being your friend. I'm just sorry it took being turned into a girl to realize that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" Hannah agreed. \"But now we can play princesses together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannah, we played princesses when I was a boy,\" said Mikayla with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Hannah nodded. \"Well, now we can...talk about how boys are the worst.\" She was realizing that not much was going to change between them, even with Mikayla being a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good,\" Mikayla agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim groaned. \"Just so you know, I can hear you both over here, and I hate it. You both are so whiny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah rolled his eyes and turned back to Mikayla. \"By the way, my grandma wants me to spend time with him, so...get out while you still can.\" It was going to be a fun day in third grade.</span></div></div>",

Elvira may have asked you to help Christina get adjusted, but it didn't seem like she wanted your help. You had to deal with the problem at hand. Who was still following you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have to follow me like this?\" you asked Sean annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean looked confused. \"Your grandparents told me to stay with you today. I don't like it, but I'm just doing what they said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned. \"You don't have to listen to them, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean rolled his eyes. \"That's why I'm a better witch than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour furious response was interrupted when Liz approached. \"Hey, Lucy. You okay?\" she asked noticing your anger. She then took notice of Sean. \"Hey, weren't you the boy from ballet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Sean Knightley.\" Sean put out his hand politely to Liz. Liz shook it. \"You're Liz Belacourt, right? I've heard about your family. I love reading about witch history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz blushed. \"Thanks. I'm not really good at reading myself yet, but my Mom loves talking about witch history. You should meet her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure what you expecting when Sean met your friends. Politeness was not even something you considered. For whatever reason, it annoyed you more. \"Don't be nice to my friends, please. I want them to hate you as much as I do.\" Sean smirked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz looked confused. \"Why is he here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's my grandfather's student. Grandpa wanted to send him to school, so I have to guide him around,\" you said with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed some stuff after I went home, didn't I? I knew I should have stayed another night at your house,\" Liz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really wish you had. I have a lot to tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could start your story, Ellen, Keira, and most of your other friends approached, which meant the witch talk had to stop. They, of course, were wondering who the boy with you was and you began reluctantly introducing Sean to them all as a new student you had been asked to show around. To your horror, Sean continued to be super polite to them all. This was going to be a long day.</span></div></div>",

We need to convince them to give to us for protection,\" Mom explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a gated community?\" Hannah asked. You felt like you once knew the answer to that, but lots of things you knew when you were thirteen had began to slip away from your mind. You couldn't even remember how to do multiplication, but that kind of math wasn't done in the first grade. You knew what you needed to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A gated community is like a neighborhood that only people who live there are aloud to enter. This witch family is called the Frey family and they protect the moonstone Pharaoh's ring. They are very private, but very big. And they don't like men very much at all. Any boy born is almost immediately turned into a girl,\" Mom explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only people who live there are allowed in, how can we see them?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I called the head of the family, Gwendolyn Frey, this afternoon. She agreed to meet us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you said as you considered all this information. \"But why bring me and Hannah? I thought you wanted to keep us out of this ring thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"I do, but Gwendolyn Frey has a soft spot for strong-minded young witch girls like you two. I was advised that bringing you two might make the meeting go smoother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool,\" you and Hannah said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But all your going to do is be polite and friendly. Don't worry about the ring. I'll take care of that. Just listen to what I tell you. If either of you step out of line, I will not hesitate to teleport you to Hayley. She's expecting you,\" Mom instructed. Hayley had taken Christina to her lesson with Samantha, but this trip sounded way more interested, so both you and Hannah agreed to be good. Mom nodded at this. \"I must admit, I was reluctant to bring you two after the incident with Mikayla Cutie, so don't test my patience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Hannah looked at each other. So you were still in the doghouse with Mom, even if Elvira had been kinder about the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you arrived at the gate to the Frey community. Mom rang the buzzer out front, and the gate began to open, allowing Mom's car to enter. You and Hannah looked out the window as you drove though this community. It looked like a paradise for girls your age. All sorts of girls running around playing freely, some even practicing magic. Grown-up women were doing yard work or washing their cars. The houses were pretty big too. Everyone seemed so happy and there wasn't a single man or boy in sight. After the day you and Hannah had, these place was a welcome change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom parked the car in front of the largest house you had seen yet.

Was this that transformed you from a boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were taken back that this woman knew you were once a boy but you smiled back politely. \"I love magic and being a girl is so much better.\" Politely, you said. \"My friend, Christina loves magical artifacts more though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen chuckled. \"I think you like them too only they have to sparkle to get your attention.\" Kindly, she said. \"I have spent my life understanding how other witches think which was what made me the greatest witch counsellor of my generation.\" She ruffled your hair, making you blush then said, \"Why don't you and your sister explore a bit while I talk to your mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to mom, uncertain. \"May we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom gave a reluctant nod. \"If Mrs Frey says it is okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have nothing to fear, child.\" Smiling, Gwen said. \"Everything in this house is set to only work with my magical signature and anything they try to put into their pockets will become too big to fit and everything fragile is protected by a magic shield so they will not be touched.\" Mom opened her mouth to speak but smiled as Gwen added, \"All little children will try to put something they like in their pockets, it is in their nature. Also, children their age have not yet learned the art of being delicate so I have learned to prepare for such visits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, mom and Gwen began to talk about the Pharaoh's ring.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was dressed in a fancy dress that might have been wore by noble girls a hundred years ago. \"This room is just for entertaining guests,\" she explained. \"Grandma has a lot of dinner parties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah nodded. \"I'm Hannah Harrison and this is my sister Lucy. What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Athena Frey,\" the girl answered. \"I live here with my grandmother and mothers. It's nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is awesome,\" you say. \"It must be so much fun to live here. It's like the island Wonder Woman is from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl giggled. \"I guess so. Would you like me to show you two around the neighborhood?\" You and Hannah nodded eagerly. \"Cool, let me just let my Grandma know.\" She disappeared for a few minutes, then returned with a smile. \"Grandma said it was fine. Your mom looked worried though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"We have a habit of getting into trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena winked. \"Cool. So do I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three of you walked toward the door, Hannah admired Athena's outfit. \"I love your dress. You wear stuff like that all the time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot of the time. People here like to dress up in beautiful dresses most of the time, but we wear pants sometimes too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish I had a dress like that,\" you commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena smiled, mumbled something under her breath and waved her hand. In an instant, your pants and t-shirt were gone, replaced by an old fashioned dress and petticoat like the one Athena wore. A sun hat sat on your head now too, in place of your headband. You looked over to see Hannah was now wearing a similar outfit. \"Now you do,\" Athena said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your magic has awakened?\" you asked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena nodded. \"Yeah, about a year ago. It's been really cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Hannah thanked her happily for the dresses before the three of you stepped out into the sun. All around you kids were playing and in yards and grown ups were going about there day happily. Not a single boy or man in sight. \"So are all these people part of your family?\" Hannah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of,\" Athena responded. \"Many are my blood relatives, but a lot of witches who just decided they didn't want to deal with guys anymore. So they moved here and joined our family like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you guys never see boys?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena shrugged. \"Not if we can help it, but we leave the community for shopping and stuff or vacations. So it's not like we never see guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You probably see them in school too,\" Hannah added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena shook her head. \"Actually, we have a school here. That way we can learn about witch history without humans or boys getting in the way. We don't go to Witchbloom either. Everything we need is here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah nodded. \"That's really cool, Athena.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena smiled. \"Thanks. Ready to look around?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The initial conversation between Mom and Gwen focused mostly on small talk. Gwen was curious to know about what was happening at the witch council, as her family didn't really have much contact with the council at large. Of course, this was all an important part of the conversation. What Gwen was trying to find out was whether she could trust the witch council as she had some serious reservations. Mom, of course, caught on to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand your worries, Gwen. I know there have been members of the witch council in the past who have advocated for breaking up your community.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it really that surprising?\" Gwen asked. \"Male witches see this place as a threat and us as radicals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you do advocate for total gender conversion and total separation from humans,\" Mom pointed out. \"You know how protective men can be about their masculinity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen rolled her eyes. \"Only too well. The Pharaoh's ring guarantees our safety. We can keep any...hostile forces at bay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not a hostile force,\" Mom assured. \"Nor is my mother. She's always been very protective of your community.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's allowed us to exist, but we both know she does not share our philosophy. Nor do you. Lucy seems like a lovely girl, but she never should have had to live as a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted that to be her choice,\" Mom said. She was getting worried Gwen's answer was going to be a 'no'. \"You'll be happy to know she has rejected her old self completely. She's one of us now, but even more committed to her new identity because she got to discover it for herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen paused to think. \"What will you do with the rings once you have them all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once we get all ten, they can be destroyed. They are too powerful to let continue to exist,\" Mom responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen nodded. \"I suppose it's like nuclear disarmament.\" She thought for another long second. \"If I agree to give you my ring, I will need something in return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"I expected as much. My mother gave me authority to negotiate. What do you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Amygdala Orb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"The object used to curse my Grandfather.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has no effect on female witches, but it is a powerful too for keeping male witches at bay,\" Gwen said. \"I know the witch council has had it ever since your grandfather was cursed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's our best chance at reversing the curse on my father,\" Mom pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been almost 30 years since he was cursed. You've made almost no progress in that time. I can put it to better use here.\" Gwen wasn't going to budge on this. It was clear in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" Mom conceded as she conjured up the orb. Elvira had predicted that this was what Gwen would want in trade for the Pharaoh's ring, so Mom had brought it just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira pulled the moonstone ring of her finger and the exchange took place. Each person took a moment to authenticate the item now in there possession. Once they both were satisfied, they smiled at each other and the tension that had been there before eased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you stay for dinner?\" Gwen suggested. \"We're having on last neighborhood bar-b-que before the weather turns too cold. I'd love to get to know you and your girls a bit more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom looked out the window and saw you and Hannah happily playing with Athena and some other neighborhood girls. You all seemed to be having a fun time. \"Let me check with my older daughter, Hayley, to see if things are okay at home. If there is no pressing emergency, we'd be happy to join.\"</span></div></div>",

A local group of women had gotten out instruments and were playing folk music and there was lots of dancing. The kids played a lot of fun games on the lawns and you and Hannah found yourself making a lot of friends. The food was fantastic as well. The woman working the grill knew how to grill up the best burgers you had ever had. Even Mom was having a good time and she felt her anger with you two girls start to subside a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish we could live here,\" Hannah said as she bit into another burger. She was sitting at a picnic table with you, Athena, Robin, and Gwen. Mom was engaged in conversation with an old friend of hers who had joined the Frey community in another part of the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'd be awesome,\" Athena agreed. \"You have no more boys in your family, right? So you'd fit right in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's our cousin like we said before,\" you mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there is an easy solution to all your cousin's problems,\" Athena said with a smile. \"Turn him into a girl like us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But won't that just make him think witches really our bullies if we change him against his will,\" you pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena shook her head. \"That's not being a bully, that's freeing him from an unhappy life as a boy. It's a good thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think he's unhappy?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because all boys are. That's why they are mean to us,\" Athena assured you. \"Do you know any witch girls who were happier when they were boys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mind flashed to Christina, but even she seemed to be slowly accepting her new self. \"I guess not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Changing boys into girls is saving them, making them better,\" Robin agreed. \"My dad and I started as boys, but we're much better off now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about this and looked at Gwen. \"Do you believe all this too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen nodded. \"The girls put it a little more simply than I do, but yes. The world of men is filled with evil and aggression. War, environmental disasters, hate. Here we've found a better way to live. One free of male and human influence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah nodded. You could see she liked the sound of all that. You weren't so sure. \"But shouldn't people have a choice if they are boys or girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Choice only leads to disaster. Robin and her father weren't given a choice and they are much happier now. If I understand correctly, you weren't given a choice either. You just stumbled upon a magic artifact, didn't you?\" Gwen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, but Mommy let me made my own choice after that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But once you opened your mind to your new self. There was only one choice,\" Gwen added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. That was true. Hannah spoke up. \"Lucy and I have turned a few boys into girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard. And do those boys seem happier now?\" Gwen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah grinned. \"They sure do. It was fun for us too. Maybe I should try turning Tim and you could turn that boy who's annoying you, Lucy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. \"Sean would probably be annoying as a boy or a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen chuckled at this as Mom returned to the table. \"You having been radicalizing my daughters now, have you?\" Mom asked with a sly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These girls aren't the type to be easily influenced by others,\" Gwen said with a smile. \"Hasn't stopped me from trying though, but I'm guessing that's why you're so at ease having them here. Many witch families I know would keep their daughters far away from us. Worried we'd corrupt them or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"As I said, I believe in my daughters making their own choices in life. I want them to see as much of our world as they can.\" She patted you on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your girls are welcome back anytime,\" Gwen said. \"They've made a very good impression here.\" You and Hannah grinned at this. You may not have agreed with what Gwen was saying about boys, but you did like the people here and were happy to hear they liked you too.</span></div></div>",

She could live there too,\" Hannah argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her dad couldn't,\" Mom responded. \"Even if he was turned into a woman, which would be difficult with his immunity, he'd still be human. Her mom's a human too. Do you really think Mikayla would want to say goodbye to her parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess not,\" Hannah admitted. \"Her parents are really nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know the Frey village seems like paradise, but there is lot you'd have to give up to join it. I'm not sure you'd enjoy that in the end, Hannah.\" Mom chuckled at her next thought. \"Besides you both may want boyfriends someday.\" This comment was made with a disgusted sound from both you and Hannah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't like to live there,\" you stated. \"I think people should have the choice to be a boy or a girl. Although I did like visiting.\" A thought occurred to you. \"How come Aunt Samantha doesn't live there? She seems like she'd agree with them about a lot of stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She would,\" Mom agreed. \"But Frey Village doesn't have much contact with the witch council. Samantha is very interested in influencing the council, so she wouldn't want to join.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made sense. You were about to answer a follow-up question when Mom spotted a figure in the road. Instinctively, she stopped the car, breaking hard, but when she looked up again, the figure was gone. Before Mom had a chance to respond, the figure reappeared in the passenger seat. It was Lilly Sweetie. \"Hello, ladies. Out for a night drive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilly!\" Mom said in surprise. Before she could react he was hit full on by a blast of magic. The driver door of the car blasted off onto the road and Mom went flying with it, totally dazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOM!\" you screamed. You tried to hit Lilly with your own blast of magic, but before you could, Lilly had cast a spell on your car seat, which keep you from moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continued to scream and struggle, Lilly stepped out of the car and walked toward Mom's dazed body. Hannah was frozen, too scared to move, but her magic hadn't awakened yet anyway. There was nothing she could do. Lilly bent down and slipped the pharaoh's ring Mom had gotten from Gwen off her finger. \"Six down,\" Lilly said with a smile. Then she took another look at Mom, considering what to do next.</span></div></div>",

His voice was deep and threatening. \"I am always watching.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly was wise not to respond. She instead vanished from view.

Mel and Hannah, while glad that their mother was alright were both a little frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you tell us Grandpa was alive? And how come Hayley and Lucy knew?\" Mel demanded, trying not to get to angry. Her voice was still loud though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't shout, dear. My head is still pounding. But you're right. I should have told you two,\" Mom groaned. \"Lucy only found out by accident and Hayley...well, I thought when she went to Witchbloom she would find out somehow if I didn't tell her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you keep it a secret at all?\" you asked. You had never been clear on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The curse on my father prevented us female witches from being near him without soul-crushing fear. I thought it would hurt too much to know you're grandfather was out there, but you could never see him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he's got those amulet things that protect us from the curse,\" you pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are recent. I only learned he had them during his last visit. And with everything that is going on, I couldn't figure out a way to tell you all about that. I am sorry. I should have been more on top of that.\" Mom winced in pain again and gratefully accepted the tea Hayley had just brought into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're grandfather was that scary man?\" Christina said in amazement, remembering when she had glimpsed him over the weekend. \"And he's head witch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those boys called him head wizard,\" Hannah corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom chuckled, but laughing hurt and she immediately regretted it. \"Wizards are just what some male witches call themselves, because they find the term witch too threatening and feminine, which is silly. The male witches with the strongest potential, like your grandfather and Sean, mostly realized those distinctions are ridiculous and embrace the term witch. I would guess those boys we met aren't as secure in their masculinity. They certainly didn't act like they were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, remembering that both your Grandfather and Sean had called themselves witches in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is your grandfather the head of male witches then?\" Christina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he just has some students,\" Mom explained. \"Male witches answer to the witch council same as the rest of us, well, except for rogue witches and witches like Gwendolyn Frey. They tend to be scattered about. Many of them keep to themselves. They aren't organized.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Sean's one of Grandpa's students?\" Hannah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an attempt to steer the conversation away from Sean, you quickly brought up something else. \"What about Lilly? She's got six rings now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She does, but the last four rings are safely locked away with the witch council. You don't have to worry about that,\" Mom said. \"We'll catch Lilly soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, but felt unsure. You had a feeling Lilly had much more planned.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course, after visiting a community of female-only witches and having your mom be attacked by a rogue witch, solving math problems and reading early chapter books seemed pretty mundane. Tammy was back, which was exciting, but she didn't look fantastic, so you and the other girls try to help her throughout the day. Sean was starting to talk to more of the boys in class, so he gave you a bit more space, which was great for you, but at recess time, he approached you and Liz while you were both on the swings. You had finally gotten a chance to tell Liz about everything that had happened the day before and had just reached the part where Lilly got away, when you noticed Sean approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up, Pinbrat?\" you asked. Despite the nickname, you tone was kinder than usual. He had given you space, the least you could was be a little kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hear about tonight, Sparkle Boots?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked confused. \"What's tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Strange invited your family over for dinner,\" Sean explained. You felt mixed emotions about that news. On the one hand, you got to spend time with your Grandpa. On the other hand, it meant more time with Sean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you call him Master and Teacher all the time?\" Liz asked, before you had a chance to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean blushed. \"It's the proper way for a student of witchcraft to address his teacher. Calling him anything regular like his name would be disrespectful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou doubted your grandfather cared much, but you didn't comment on it. \"I guess he wants to get to know our family. Is anyone else coming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean shook his head. \"I don't think so. Master Strange only has five amulets, so that's you, your mom, and your sisters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, but that wasn't what you meant. \"What about his other students, like those two...\" You chose your words carefully. \"...big mouths I met yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean chuckled, but you couldn't tell if he was laughing with you or at you. Probably at you. \"No, they all have there own families to be with. And I think he wants to be alone with you guys anyway. Except for me, of course. I'm the only one who lives with Master Strange.\" He sounded a bit sad when he said that. He must have been thinking of his parents, who as far as you understood, had died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz, however, didn't know this and kept asking questions. \"Where do you guys live anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean snapped out of his thoughts and look around to make sure no one was listening. \"You know that abandoned construction site on Briar Street?\" You and Liz nodded. That construction site had been there as long as you could remember, but you had never seen anyone working there. You always found it weird, but most people seemed to barely notice it. \"That's an illusion. Master Strange and I live in a castle that's hidden there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Liz looked at each other. For a second, Sean thought you didn't believe him, but the two of you shouted in unison, \"That's so COOL!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you hear about all this anyway?\" you asked. \"You do know cell phones aren't allowed in school, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean blushed. \"Master Strange sent me a raven...with a letter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure what to make of that. \"My grandpa is weird.\" Sean didn't entirely disagree. One of the recess monitors freaked out when the raven had flown down at Sean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I'll see you tonight, Sparkle Boots,\" Sean said as he walked off. \"Try not to be too annoying and bubbly, will ya?\" That made you red. He had almost gone an entire conversation without angering you. Now though, it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be as annoying as I want!\" you called after him, but you knew it wasn't a great comeback.</span></div></div>",

Her twin brother was near the same height with soft features and blue eyes only his blond hair was cut short. Hannah met up with them after school while they were waiting for their parents to pick them up. \"I'm glad to see you in better spirits, Tim.\" Smiling, Hannah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well Tina kind of keeps me calm.\" Blushing, Tim replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina giggled at that while Paul only smiled. \"There's good and bad in everyone, regardless of who or what they are.\" Kindly, Paul said. \"Dad told me that if you only look for evil, that's all you'll find so look for the good instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point.\" Smiling, Hannah said.

The first one was about thirteen with crew cut brown hair and green eyes in a football jersey and blue jeans. The other was about a year older with short brown hair and blue eyes wearing similar attire. Hannah recognized them as the powerful boys, Jessie and Hank who had escorted your, her, and mom home after the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are these two nobodies bugging you, sis?\" Firmly, Jessie demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were trying to.\" Softly, Tina replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank turned to Greg who was hopelessly struggling against his iron grip. \"If I catch you bugging my sister or her friends, if I hear even a whisper of it, I will make you suffer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same goes for you, snowflake.\" Snarling, Jessie added to Karl. \"We're the big boys on campus now so make yourselves scare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough, boys.\" Calmly, a booming voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone turned to face a massive man in his early thirties with brown hair and green eyes wearing casual clothing. \"There is no need to frighten anyone.\" He then turned to Karl and Greg. \"Run along now, kids and do try not to get into any more trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah did not know why but Karl and Greg seemed terrified of Mr Moon and ran off without daring to say a word.

Your grandpa is going to love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I bet Sean makes fun of it,\" you groaned, remembering Sean's behavior the last time you were dressed up all girly in front of him.

Once you all crossed the moat, you found Sean on the other side, dressed in former shorts, a collared shirt, and a tie. Of course, Sean usually dressed more formal. He was holding five amulets and handed each on to a member of your family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Sean,\" Mel said as she took it. \"I hear you've been torturing my sister. Keep up the good work.\" Sean smiled at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley examined her amulet before she put it on. \"Are we sure we should be doing this? I mean, someone should be home with Christina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christina is having dinner with her parents. She's fine,\" Mom assured Hayley. Mom was a little surprised to notice Hayley was very nervous about all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everyone had an amulet on, Sean called out. \"It's safe, Sir. You can come on out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a huge puff of smoke in front of you, and...no one came out of it. You all watched quietly as the smoke vanished into the air. \"HELLO FAMILY!!!\" It was coming from behind you. You jumped in surprise to see Grandpa standing there behind you all, but you were happy to see him. You leaped into his arms and hugged him tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GRANDPA!!\" you shouted as you squeezed him. Mom smiled warmly at her father, but your three sisters paused unsure. None of them had really ever met the man. What were they supposed to do?</span></div></div>",

The magically stronger a witch girl becomes, the harder it is for a boy's magic to effect her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your grandfather become so powerful he can now block any and all magic regardless of how powerful it may be.\" Serious, mom said. \"He is rarely caught off guard. That one witch managed which is how he became cursed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So immunity to magic is like a shield of will power.\" Guessing, Mel said. \"It's only as good as your ability to see it coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoriarty gave a bemused smile. \"It's a bit more complex than just that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not going to bite you.\" Wincing, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley blushed slightly then stepped forward and gave Moriarty a hug with Mel and Hannah soon joining. Mom had to wipe away a tear seeing her father embracing all of her children for the first time. Moriarty was shedding joyful tears. \"You have no idea how long I had waited for this one moment.\" Tearfully, he said. \"I am so proud of you all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean stood by mom's side, smiling as well. He wanted to ask her why you were so annoying but he did not want to spoil the moment. Only mom seemed to sense his question and held back a chuckle. \"From what I have heard, Lucy's annoyance towards you started with you stepping on her pride back at the arcade.\"Whispering, she said. \"Something about you saying 'what do a couple of dumb girls know about pinball... and that its's a boys game'...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean sighed, rolling his eyes. \"You mean she's still sore about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy is just as guilty.\" Bemused, mom whispered. \"Instead of trying to resolve the issue at hand, she is trying to win the 'battle'.\" She giggled. \"Some things never change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Curious, Sean asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It took weeks for Lucy to finally accept things as they were and to admit she loves ballet.\" Smiling, mom explained. \"I have no doubt it will take the same amount of time for her to accept you as a friend. Have patience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, you were all escorted to the dinning hall where Elvira was waiting for everyone to arrive for dinner. You greeted her with a hug with mom and your sisters following before you were shown to your seats...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was weirder for her than the rest of you it seemed. Perhaps because she was the oldest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Elvira wasn't wearing an amulet. \"Because I'm not really here. I'm astral projecting. A very advanced witch technique, but since my body isn't physically here, I'm not affected by the curse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't understand what she was saying, but Mel whispered to you. \"She's like ghost, only alive, but she's not here.\" That made more sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we hugged you?\" Hayley said with confusion. \"I felt you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you? Or did your mind trick you because it is what you thought was happening?\" Elvira said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah reached out her hand and sure enough it passed through Elvira like a ghost. \"Cool!\" Hannah proclaimed. She did it a few more times until here mother called her to sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned when you saw your place setting, right next to Sean's. You found yourself even more annoyed when he pulled out your chair for you. \"What are you doing?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being polite,\" he answered, bothered by you questioning his action. \"You don't like me being nice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like you treating me like some weakling who can't pull out her own chair,\" you responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sean, Lucy, let's not fight,\" Grandpa scolded. You blushed and let Sean push in your chair once you sat down. You hated it, but Mel had a huge grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon food appeared on the table, though no one was carrying it. It just materialized. Eagerly, you all began to dig in. It was unsurprisingly delicious. \"Did you cook this Grandpa?\" Hannah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandpa shook his head. \"I'm a terrible cook, I'm afraid. I use a witch catering service for dinners like this. They make the meals and teleport them here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they are cooking for someone they've never met?\" you said in surprise. Grandpa nodded. The witch world was cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner continued. Grandpa started asking about all your lives and your interests. Hannah was happy to share and Grandpa learned all about what was happening with Tim, though he kept his thoughts on the matter to himself. You and Hannah told him all about Ballet, which Sean was also happy to talk about. You two also talked about what you were learning at school and Sean talked about how the first couple days had been. He didn't hate it, but he wasn't sure he didn't prefer being homeschooled. Mel and Hayley were still pretty quiet though and both seemed uncomfortable with Grandpa. Soon dinner was finished, and you sat there satisfied with the delicious meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean, however, was giving you a look. \"You eat like a pig,\" he said under his breath. You were pretty sure only you heard him say it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You act like a pig,\" you retorted quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandpa then spoke up. \"Sean, why don't you show Lucy and Hannah around the castle. I'm sure they'd love a tour.\" You annoyance at Sean didn't trump your desire to see the castle, so you eagerly agreed. Hannah too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" Sean said, leading you two from the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three of you departed, Grandpa turned to Hayley and Mel and smiled. He wanted to talk to them about what was bothering them.</span></div></div>",

There were a couple interesting things along the way, a two-way mirror looking into a study of some sort and a room marked \"Single Sock Storage,\" which contained a lot of socks that didn't have a pair. At the end of the passage, you found yourself brought into another hallway, which seemed disappointing, but you noticed a light on in a room nearby. Curiously, you walked over to the room and opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an ordinary room for a young boy, full of toys and books and clothing, all very neatly kept and organized. You noticed a dinosaur themed bedspread and several dinosaur models and you realized were you were. You had stumbled upon Sean's room. You grinned, knowing this was your chance to get back at him, and tried to decide what magical prank you wanted to leave for him, when you noticed a picture on the bedside table. You walked closer to it and picked it up. It was a picture of a toddler, who looked a lot like Sean, being held in the arms of a couple you had never seen before. You guessed they were Sean's parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing in here, Sparkle Boots?\" Sean's voice came coldly from behind you. You turned to see him staring daggers at you from the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately realized you had gone a bit too far. \"I'm sorry. I...I got curious. I didn't realize it was your room until...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean marched over and grabbed the picture of his parents from your arms. \"You had no business being in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right,\" you admitted. You suddenly realized he was alone. \"Where's Hannah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean's eyes widened in surprised and he quickly looked behind him. He groaned in aggravation when he realized Hannah wasn't there. \"Can't you girls go five minutes without sneaking off or doing something you shouldn't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our mother has the same problem with us.\" You looked at the floor feeling a little guilty. \"Are those your parents? In the picture?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean paused, unsure whether to share that with you, but something compelled him to do so. \"Yeah...\" He looked wounded, sad, lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean shrugged. \"They were...they died. That's all.\" He didn't sound eager to share the whole story and you didn't press him further. \"I really miss them,\" he admitted after a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom says the Knightleys were powerful witches. She was surprised to hear about you.\" You weren't sure what that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most people think I died when my parents did. Your grandpa kept me secret for a while. I had to tell everyone my last name was Woodhouse. He only let me tell people my real name a few days ago when I gave up my family's pharaoh ring,\" Sean explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. Grandpa must have been worried someone would target Sean if they knew he was a Knightley. Suddenly something occurred to you. \"Wait, you told me your name the day before you gave up your pharaoh ring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean blushed. \"I was...annoyed at you. I wasn't thinking smart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled. \"Yeah, I wasn't either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you smiled at each other silently, enjoying each other's company for the first time ever. But the peace was short lived. \"Just so we're clear. Don't tell anyone about my parents, and you still really annoy me,\" Sean said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I won't tell. And I still find you super annoying too,\" you said. \"Plus, you think you're better at magic than me, which is so not true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't the one who wound up in a super girly tutu the last time we squared off,\" Sean retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I like that tutu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'd be worse. It was so frilly.\" Sean smiled again, which you returned. There was something comforting in knowing you annoyed each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, maybe we can be rivals,\" you suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rivals?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you read any comics or watch cartoons?\" you asked. Sean shook his head. Of course, he didn't. \"A rival is someone you compete against and don't really like, but you both make each other stronger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean chuckled. \"Like I need you to make me stronger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's perfect,\" you said with grin. \"That sounds just like what my rival should say.\" You smiled and skipped out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not your rival,\" Sean objected as he followed you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late. I've already decided,\" you stated happily as the two of you headed back out into the castle.</span></div></div>",

We've never met you before, but now, like, suddenly you're our grandpa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, how are we supposed to act? Just pretend like you aren't a complete stranger to us. Lucy and Hannah are younger. It's easier for them to accept this, but for us...I feel like this is all moving very fast,\" Hayley added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandpa nodded. His face looked very sad. \"I understand. I've always wanted to be part of you life, but with this curse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel cut him off. \"We, like, understand the whole curse thing. But it doesn't make this not weird. You know what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do and I understand your perspective. This must all be strange for you.\" He smiled, hoping his pun broke the ice a bit, but no such luck. \"Sorry, bad pun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a pun?\" Mel said quietly in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His last name is Strange,\" Hayley explained to her sister. Mel made a noise of realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have to rush things,\" Grandpa said. \"I want to have a relationship with you two, but we can do it on your terms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Hayley responded. \"That's what we want too. But just one step at a time so we can get used to having you around.\" Mel nodded in agreement and Grandpa smiled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't ask for more. And I'm happy to see my granddaughters are two such wise, young ladies.\" There was hope and that was all Moriarty Strange could ask for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel, in particular, blushed at the complement. She wasn't often called wise. Mom and Elvira were happy to hear this airing of feelings. It was a good first step in bringing Moriarty back into the family. It would take time, but any forward progress was encouraging.</span></div></div>",

She left Hayley to go pick it up in her bedroom, but was surprised to find it was her mother, who she had just seen an hour before, though in astral projection form. \"Mother, is everything okay?\" Mom asked Elvira immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira was quick to ease her mind. \"Oh, don't worry. It's nothing too exciting. We just got some information that might be useful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This about Lilly?\" Mom asked slightly annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, daughter?\" Elvira was extremely practiced at sensing her daughter's moods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom moaned. \"I've done a lot for this investigation already, Mother. You have actual investigators. I've got a family to raise. Hannah and Lucy had nightmares last night after we were attacked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know and I'm sorry, but you knew Lilly Sweetie better than anyone else involved with the council. You're best qualified to lead this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe so, but I don't want Lucy or Hannah near this again.\" There was silence on the other line, which told Mom Elvira was about to suggest the exact opposite. \"Mother, you must be joking? They're children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira sighed, feeling a bit of guilt. \"Yes, but we've located Lilly's family, her wife and two sons. The boys are 7 and 5, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...you think they might let some information slip to children their own age, while I interrogate Lilly's wife,\" Mom said, finishing Elvira's thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom thought for a second. She turned her head to notice you, now dressed in your Disney Princess nightgown, peering into the room with a picture book in your hands. You wanted her to put you to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, we can go after school tomorrow, but I want Dad there too. Not in the open, but, out of sight there, in case anything goes wrong. Just him, not any of those obnoxious students of his. They'd just get in the way,\" Mom decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, he'll need to bring Sean. There's not one else to watch him,\" Elvira responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"Sean's fine. He actually listens to instructions and might manage to keep Lucy out of trouble.\" Emphasis on the might, she thought to herself, but she didn't say that with you listening. You had already perked up the mention of Sean and your name. You were now moving to sit on the bed next to Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I'll call your father and let him know,\" Elvira responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but don't ask for anything like this again. My girls have been through enough.\" With that, Mom hung up the phone and turned her attention to your curious face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We going on another adventure?\" you asked excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom wasn't crazy about you calling these adventures. \"We are after school tomorrow, but we'll talk about it then.\" She looked at the book you had brought her. \"Cinderella?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"Hannah had it in her room. I was hoping you could read it to me, since I'm going to be Cinderella in a few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"You might not remember this, but I read this all the time to you when you were five. It was one of your favorites. Before you started insisting that boys didn't like princesses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked confused. \"Really? I remember you reading it to me and me loving it, but I don't remember saying boys didn't like princesses. That's silly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you starting to forget things about being a boy,\" Mom asked, her face a little concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you nodded. \"Yeah, it's getting hard to remember some stuff. Is that bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head. \"Not at all. It's quite normal for witch boys who become girls. You'll never forget that you were a boy, but those memories will fade as they become less important to you. We're going to have to start planning your confirmation soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaned your head against Mom as she began to stroke your hear. \"What's a confirmation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every transformed witch girl has one. It's a celebration where you accept your new identity as a girl and sever any remaining ties to your former self,\" Mom explained. \"It's a lot of fun. Like a birthday party, but celebrating your rebirth. Of course, we only have one when you are absolutely sure you don't want to be a boy again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled imagining it. \"That does sound like fun, and don't worry, I'm a girl now. I never want to be a stupid boy again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom hugged you and kissed your forehead. \"You make a wonderful daughter. Now let's read that book and put you to bed.\" She stood up and took your hand, leading her youngest daughter to her bedroom.</span></div></div>",

You immediately blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned as you began to wake up, trying to remember what happened and where you were. It didn't feel like your room. As you looked around, you could immediately tell it wasn't. It was still a girl's room made for a girl your age, but instead of pinks, the room was decorated in purples, reds, and blacks. It had a very gothic victorian vibe. You discovered you were dressed in a dark blue nightgown as well. \"Where am I?\" you wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In our house, sweetie,\" a soothing, but dark voice replied. You eyes whipped to a large comfy chair near your bed side. There sat Elena Kruse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU!\" you shouted. \"WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? WHERE'S CHRISTINA?\" You stood up ready to hit her with all the magic you had, but nothing happened. You looked distraught at your hands, which produced no magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena smiled and helped up a device you recognize. \"Magic blocker, remember? Of course it doesn't work on me.\" She waved her hand, producing sparkles. \"Now sit calmly and don't raise your voice at me. Be polite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened in surprise as your body started moving against your will. You sat peacefully on the bed and when your spoke again you found you couldn't bring yourself to yell or throw insults at the woman. \"Where's Christina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's in her new bedroom, sleeping. I thought it best to keep you two separate until you both calm down a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. \"I don't see much of a reason to be calm. You kidnapped us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena's voice was sweet, filled with love which somehow made her scarier. \"Oh, no. I didn't do that. I just took my daughters home. That's the right of any mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not my Mom. My real mom will save me.\" You had to have faith in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natalie Harrison will never find this place.

You felt terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" you asked, trying to keep sounding brave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena patted your head, presumably trying to be reassuring. \"Just a dark magic spell to help you adjust.

You fall back on the bed as this feeling begins to spread to your entire body. You can feel something changing, not obvious things, but subtle aspects. It felt weird, but not painful, but it still scared you. Everything feels similar, but also a little bit different. It was hard to tell exactly what though as your mind had trouble focusing. The spell seemed to be at work there too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's...happening...to me?\" you manage to ask through this overwhelming feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena spoke softly in a comforting tone. \"It's forbidden magic made to alter your DNA. I used strands of hair from myself and Samantha's late father to introduce our genetic code into your body. Right now, it's finding all your Harrison DNA and rewriting it as ours. It's going to feel strange for a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou retained enough of you knowledge from biology class to understand what she was saying and it terrified you. Well, disturbingly there was a part of you that wasn't bothered by the idea and that part felt like it was growing. Your head started to feel like it was swimming getting harder and harder to think. You face showed the fear and confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena reached out and took your hand, rubbing her thumb against it as she soothed you. You could remember Mo...Natalie Harrison doing something similar when you used to get sick or scared. \"Shhhhh, this is the tough part, but your doing great. it'll all be over in a minute. You're so brave. My brave little girl.\" Strangely, you found her comforting to be...nice. Everything would be okay, you could get through this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, it passed. The overpowering feeling in your body and mind were gone and you started to sit up, rubbing your head and trying to orient yourself again. \"I'm...I'm okay now, Mommy,\" you said to reassure the woman sitting by your side. You quickly realized with surprise what you just called her. \"Mommy...\" You repeated, as if you weren't used to the idea. Indeed you weren't. You had thirteen years of memories of your mom being Natalie Harrison, but ever fiber of your being was telling you that your true mom was right next to you. She was the one who came in your mind when you though of your mom, and she was the one you felt love for. But it still felt strange. \"Why am I calling you, Mommy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena smiled. \"Because I am now. That's my blood coursing through your veins. There's not a hint of Harrison left in you.\" She nodded toward a full length mirror. \"Go take a look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity overtaking you, you sprang up and scrambled to the mirror. As you saw your new reflection, you mouth flew open. You were still a six-year-old little girl, but that was the only thing that looked the same about you. Gone was any trace of Harrison in your face. Instead, the face looking back at your reminded your of Elena Kruse and Samantha Forrester. Your hair was raven black and you had piercing green eyes. Freckles that use to be on your body were either moved or gone. A small birthmark had appeared on your ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you gazed into the mirror, studying your face carefully, you saw Elena come up behind you. She stood over you proudly. \"I know it must be a weird feeling. And part of you is thinking that this isn't real. That I made you feel this way.\" You nodded hesitantly. The thought was crossing your mind. Elena continued. \"I assure you that is not the case. I just altered your DNA. But one of your most notable character traits has also been your loyalty and protectiveness of family, and now, your family is me now, not the Harrisons.\" You nodded. Elena had taken one of your personality traits and found a way to use to her advantage. You knew that should anger you, but it didn't. You just felt unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena knelt before you and smiled. \"Do you still want Natalie to find you? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about it for a second, but then shook your head. \"No, I don't feel any connection to her. Natalie doesn't feel like my Mom anymore. You do. And she'd try to separate us and I don't want that.\" You eyes teared up a bit at the thought. \"I want to stay with you, Mommy.\" You jumped into her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena patted you on the back, reassuring you. \"Don't worry, sweetie. I won't let that happen. I know it will take some getting used to, but I promise you will come to love it here. And I promise I won't lie to you like Natalie did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and wiped away your tears. \"She did lie to me all the time. And she would always tell me who I should be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena smiled. She knew Natalie's secrets had weakened the wall of trust you two had share. It wouldn't take much work to bring that wall crumbling down. You'd be so easy to mold. \"Well, you don't have to be Lucy Harrison anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at her. \"Then, who am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena turned you around so you faced the mirror again. \"You are my youngest daughter, Tabitha Kruse.\" You couldn't help but smiled. The name sounded nice to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mommy. I am Tabitha.\" You repeated as you feel yourself begin to embrace your new identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena smiled. Lucy Harrison was gone. Tabitha Kruse was born.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her ears had small studs in them, and the most notable change for you, was that her previously rough, almost boyish hands, now had carefully oval nails that were painted light pink. There was no warning; one second there was a tomboy, and the next second, she had been replaced by one with a clear girlish streak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, John?\" Christina asked, apparently not noticing anything different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just have to give mom a call\" you said quickly, trying not to panic. Was it a strike, and if so, how? Neither you and Christina did anything. You quickly left the room, almost expecting to hear a scream, but strangely, Christina didn't notice.

The diamond earrings would have said, 'I want to be queen' which would have cost one or both or you all of your strikes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes bugged out like saucers. \"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This test is particularly tricky because of the subtle codes we use.\" Turning stern, mom said. \"You two are up against incredible odds which makes my test that much more difficult.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your test?\" Confused, Christina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"This is not your test, it's mine.\" Serious, she explained. \"To pass, I need to guide you two through the perils of the test you fell into.\" She sighed. \"If I pass, you both will come out of this as boys. If I fail, it means I have to live with a tomboy daughter and help teach another tomboy magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed your arm, uncertain and uncomfortable. \"So... what do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled before waving her hand, causing the earrings to vanish before replying...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A part of you wanted to plead for her to take you with her, but you knew it would only lead you to worse trouble. Reluctantly, you sat down on the bed that Dr Thompson had given you and waited. You didn't have to wait long, especially since Christina had decided to make herself scarce, leaving you to face your twin and closest female friend alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy. Like, are you in here\" Mel yelled out as soon as Megan let them into the house. You decided to remain quiet, but it was of no use. Mel pushed your door open as soon as she walked upstairs. Instantly, both girls spotted you, and to your horror, gave each other knowing smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what are you two smiling at?' you stammered, hoping that Megan didn't know, which would resulting in you being stuck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan smiled as she said, \"Mel told me that you secretly liked wearing such clothes, Lucy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou was relieved, but not by much. Megan obviously thought you was the tomboy forced to camp out at her house, but Mel knew everything. Her words and facial expression told you that. She had a bemused smile on her face, telling you she was plotting something. Plus after the Robyn experience, you was feeling cautious. Foolishly, you decided to test Mel out while protesting that pink dresses weren't your idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy made me wear it, you stupid airhead\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't call me an airhead, you little brat!\" Mel snapped. She ignored Megan's slight smile, which told you that someone, probably even yourself still called her that to annoy her, and rushed over to you. She quickly whispered I your ear, \"Pink dresses and mommy now, little sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to respond, but knew you couldn't. Not with Megan's presence. Mel took advantage of it and whispered, \"You're so going to get in touch with your feminine side for that, <i>Lucy</i>.\" In a louder voice, Mel continued, \"You're lucky that Megan and I are going swimming and we have to take you with us. I've got your swimsuit. Get undressed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your horror, Mel produced a pink one piece swimsuit in your new size, and it was girly. \"W-where did you get that?\" you stammered. \"No way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its just us girls here, sis. No reason to be shy\" Mel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel whispered in your ear in an annoyed voice, \"Either put it on, or I'll put it on you myself. Either way, you're tottally going to wear that. Are you, like, going to be a good girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be good\" you said, paling. You knew Mel would do it. Five minutes later, you had the swimsuit on, and it was the weirdest feeling you ever felt. It was tight, felt funny against your body, and highlighted your change of gender. Mel smirked slightly (though only to you), and grabbed your hand as she lead you out of Megan's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One was a pink one piece swimsuit like your own and the other was mom's car keys. \"I discussed this with your parents and we both agree you have a choice.\" Softly, she said. \"You can either wing it with Lucy, playing the role of a reluctant tomboy and take your chances or I can take you to the mall where I will try my best to prepare you to avoid those precious strikes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Lucy?\" Worried, Christina asked. \"Doesn't she get a choice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel is helping me with Lucy.\" Serious, mom replied. \"She is not as much of an airhead as some people think.\" She sighed. \"I know you are worried about her; I am too. Still, you need to make a choice before I decide for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina sighed, a worried look on her face before she replied...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She truly wanted to help you but your protests were seriously getting on her nerves. \"How do you and mom do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine smiled. \"Lots and lots of patience.\" Bemused, she said. \"Feel fortunate that your transformed brother is not like my son, Timothy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel giggled at that, knowing that her cousin, Tim taunted girls in a mixed up quest to make them stronger against real bullies. \"He really needs to get a girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine nodded, smiling then they both turned as they heard you let out a startled yelp.

Your mouth fell half open seeing Christina blushing while managing a small smile. \"H-Hey, Lucy.\" Shyly, she said. \"How was the pool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Stunned, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms H said that she needed to focus on me more so she gave me a choice.\" Near tears, Christina replied. \"Go swimming with you, Megan and Mel or go to the mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you choose the mall?\" Wincing, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina sniffed, blushing more. \"I- I didn't want to be stuck being babysat by Mel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel was taken back by the comment. \"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan laughed before turning to Mel. \"You are a bit bossy, Melanie.\" Amused, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel rolled her eyes then turned to Christina. \"Nice earrings.\" Bemused, she said. \"They make you look cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do they symbolize, peace between the genders?\" Curious, Megan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's exactly what it means.\" Appearing behind you, mom said. \"Christina chose quite wisely, I must say; I was impressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foul ball, mom.\" Turning to face her, you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just trying to keep Christina off second base.\" Winking, mom countered. She then turned serious. \"Being a tomboy does not mean you have to always act like a boy, Lucy. I finally got Christina to understand that so she has a better chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A better chance?\" Confused, Megan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom thinks I'll end up lonely if I stay a tomboy.\" Thinking quickly, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan giggled at that. \"Well you certainly caught the attention of a lot of boys at the pool.\" Bemused, she said. \"I saw some looking pretty impressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catherine told me about that.\" Frowning, mom said. \"Behavior like that will get you into more trouble than you want later on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would you know?\" Pouting, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"Because I was just like you, Lucy.\" Surprising you, she replied. \"I was a strict tomboy through and through and it cost me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on, Dr. Thompson called you into her study and had you sit down. \"I think its time you learned more about...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Don't worry too much, Lucy. The earrings served their purpose in pacifying Christina, and allowed Megan to comment about Christina's tomboyness all the while thinking that christina is about to move out of her tomboy phase. Christina is going to be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't reassuring\" you said, alarmed by the complete vagueness of the statement, especially about 'moving out of her tomboy phase'. Dr Thompson nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it must be frustratung for you, Lucy, but remember that if you want knowledge, it will cost you. Plus, I know you need a mall trip of your own.

Firstly, the room changed from it's original plain white guest room color to a pale pink, more suited for a little girl's bedrrom, a bedroom that started to gain the features of a very girlish girl living it in it. The most noticable thing was the sudden appearance of a solidly built (and pink) dollhouse, though there were no dolls or other toys. There were plenty of posters on the walls though, princesses being a common theme. Done with the room, the magic moved onto Christina. Within  a minute, Christina's pajamas had morphed into similar princess ones to your own, whiles her rosewood colored hair, once loose, because two braids. Finally, christina's earrings started to contract, before turning into solid silver heart shaped studs. Neother you or Christina were aware of any changes, as the magic finished its work.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You could tell she definately considered that you may have been responsible, since you was rather annoyed by being more girly than herself. \"Maybe you accidently did it. Your mommy said magic makes you sleepy\" Christina said. She walked over to the wardrobe and started checking its contents, and seeing it was full of dresses. The most tomboyish item seemed to be a pair of overall skirt, seemingly belonging to you. Whatever changed Christina, it certainly made her the more girly one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not!

I suppose you need to get something for your sleepover\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, she left you to dress in peace, though it wasn't all that peaceful.

Unfortunately, Christina was also unleashing onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That artifact probably saved your ass just then by making Megan think this is all normal. Besides, you're going to the mall with your mommy, and you know what she's like. Save yourself the trouble, and use the princess dress right now\" Christina said.

It's magic.\" She moved her fingers to indicate sarcasm making you smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, its on my desk, go and get it.\" Lightly, you said. \"I should tell harry though that her little cousin climbed the tree next to our house, she could have been hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom is already taking care of that.\" Calmly, Hayley said. \"Why don't you hit your homework, that will give you the rest of the weekend to yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me.\" Smiling, you said. \"Call me for dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will.\" Smiling back, Hayley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went back into your room while Hayley returned to mom's study where Christina was sitting in a chair, pouting tearfully. \"Any chance we can bring Harry back?\" Wincing, Hayley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can change her back easily but there is an issue.\" Serious, mom said. \"He's drawn to magical artifacts like a moth to a flame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has he been absorbing the magic?\" Worried, Hayley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"Yes but I fear he may have also been leaking some of that magic to John, making him drawn to magic as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hence he noticed the magic book where before it meant nothing to him.\" Sighing, Hayley said. \"What can we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now, we let John know that Harry is off with his parents on one of their business trips.\" Looking at Harry, she replied. \"Until he returns, Christina will be living with us for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't you change me back now?\" Worried, Christina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of that magic you have absorbed must deplete before we can safely change you back.\" Patiently, mom said. \"Otherwise, you will be wearing skirts and dresses longer than you might think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long?\" Wincing, Christina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It depends upon how much magic you had absorbed.\" Honestly, Hayley said. \"We will know more after we give you a medical exam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Thompson is on her way.\" Serious, mom said. \"From what I can sense, you have at least a month before you change back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute!\" Alarmed, Christina squeaked. \"How do you two know about all of this? Don't tell me you are some kind of witches!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are, Christina.\" Softly, mom said. \"You can not tell John this or who you really are. It will not end well for him if you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are not evil, Christina.\" Gently, Hayley said. \"Still, we are a secretive group.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina looked between mom and Hayley before she...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It wouldn't be to hard to convince her that she needs a new girlfriend. Look at the way she is staring.

She was dressed far girlier than before, and you could tell she more than a little uncomfortable in her pink and purple dress and white tights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Been shopping with mom, huh?\" you scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" Christina said, wincing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want me to have a word with her? I know you're somewhat of a tomboy\" you offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I'll be fine. I'm just not used to wearing stuff like this\" Christina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a slight chuckle. \"Trust me, she won't bite. I know it can be hard settling in, especially since you don't know anyone. Has anyone gotten you something to play with?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to go outside\" Christina said, not wanting to admit that, after mom had come home, she had spent most of the afternoon using your game consoles. Nor did she want to (or could) admit that her vastly smaller figure made playing the games harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but don't go climbing trees again\" you said. \"Oh, by the way, do you know where my mom is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina paused. \"I think she is in her study\" she said before she disappeared. You shook your head slightly; Christina was slightly strange. Still, you knew you won't want all that girlying up, even if you were a girl. Quickly, you walked over to the study, and knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes John?\" mom demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cam we talk? Its about Christina\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom, for a half second worried that you might had perceived the truth. She relaxed, and said, \"Is this about her clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I think you need to back off.

Before her increasingly worried eyes, Mel's hand shrank slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What's going on?\" Mel wondered aloud. She couldn't believe her eyes, as her hands were definitely smaller, but body parts shouldn't shrink. Naturally she wondered if she was going crazy, but as her clothes started to feel increasingly baggy, she saw that something unnatural was happening to her. Eyes wide, and becoming wider, Mel looked at her reflection, and saw that not only had she lost a foot in height, she had lost nearly all of her beloved curves.

You have magic powers, Melanie. Just like me and Hayley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic turned me to a little girl?\" Mel said disbelievingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a sense. Your magic didn't do this. Another witch did, but you can't go around talking about these things. You have to keep it secret. You can't tell Hannah as she is far too young,, you can't tell Christina, and you definitely can't tell John.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the story behind Christina?\" Mel asked, much to mom's surprise. She expected the first question to be about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides being too young or that she is a tomboy? In my opinion, tomboys and magic don't work well together\" mom said slightly evasively. As for your brother, if magic tomboys are bad news, imagine what magic former boys would do? In case you're wondering, Christina s not one of them\" Privately, mom wondered if such a scare would give Mel second thoughts about her 'true twin' desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait?

Once done, she handed Mel a small vile of a light blue liquid. \"Drink it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough taken back, Mel accepted the vile and drank its contents down. \"It tastes terrible!\" Making a face, she complained. \"What was that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A counter curse potion.\" Flatly, mom replied. \"It's not meant to taste good but it does its job very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed to a mirror on the closed door. Mel gazed at the mirror and was pleased to find that she had returned to her normal self. \"I'm back!\" Cheering, she yelled. She then paused then asked, \"You said I can't change John... why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are several reasons.\" Firmly, mom said. \"For the most part, using magic without training is very dangerous; anything could go wrong. Also, do you really want to face his wrath when he eventually turns back to his normal male self?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel gulped at that. \"I wonder what would have happened if John had found that package instead of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! That package was in front of John's door?\" Annoyed, mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel nodded and mom shook her head, annoyance clear in her expression. \"John said that Cassie Bane had been eyeing him all day.\" Almost whispering, she muttered. \"Only she is a strict amateur; she had to have had some help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe those new kids in school.\" After a thought, Mel said. \"They have been following Cassie around all day. Everyone thinks they were all girlfriends at one point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hayley said something about that earlier.\" Thoughtful, mom said. \"Cassie mentioned their names were Anna and Marry...\" She gasped slightly before giving an angry huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know them, mom?\" Worried, Mel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed before giving Mel a reassuring smile. \"Why don't you go check up on Christina.\" Kindly, she said. \"I need to make a private phone call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Mel nodded and quietly left mom's study. Once she was gone, mom picked up her phone and dialed a number. Who did she call?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After a minute to recompose herself, Hayley said, \"Why are you calling me first, mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Partly to warn you, but mostly because I have little choice. This is a tricky situation; most of the others have dim views on boys trying to read magic, and in their minds, the fact that Harry's attempts were accidental is largely irrelevant. I only got my way by two votes, and I was told that this is my mess to clean up. I fear a revote would go against me, and Christina's fate will be sealed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this Anna and Mary are defiling the original ruling\" Hayley spat out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but seeing them punished will not help Christina. Some of the council are far too short sighted\" mom complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now?\" Hayley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take out Mary's allies. It is obvious that Bane wants a new girlfriend, and not a babysitting job. The Banes have been know to be quite vicious when crossed and I suspect Cassandra will be no exception\" mom said. \"The other thing is that I've heard about her misdeeds with 'Michelle'. If she can't be reasoned, turn Cassandra into a boy, or offer to teach Michelle magic. I think that would be more than enough to get her to back off. Unless of course, I can persuade Melanie to be a kid again for an hour or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.

You stumbled after her but mom bared your path. \"Those rings are highly sought after by the criminal element, John.\" grabbing, your wrists, she explained. \"They are nothing you want to toy with!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom quickly examined your hands and sighed upon seeing a drop of blood seeping from a pin pick in your index finger. \"Oh dear...\" Sighing, she said. \"I had hoped to avoid this for a while longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Worried, you demanded. \"Why do I feel so weak?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That ring you picked up, all of the rings in fact, are protected by a curse, John.\" Firmly, mom said. \"Fortunately, its only temporary; used to detour the curious from trying the rings on.\" She paused, giggling slightly. \"I must admit, I never thought you'd make such a cute...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Christina was the polar opposite to you, total tomboy, we as you seemed to appear the epitome of pink girliness. Neither of you spoke.

She is staying with us for a while\" Hayley said, making the introductions. Both of you remained silent, though for her part, Christina was closely staring at you.

She wondered how long it would be before she too, was in ultra girly clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you two watch a movie. Mom can set it up. Unfortunately, I have homework to do\" Hayley said.

It stared a little boy who was curious about his older sister's mysterious disappearance. As you and Christina watched the movie, you began to see subtle similarities between the boy and yourself as you too had gone out in search of Hayley when she went missing two years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bit your tongue, glancing at Christina who seemed mesmerized by the story as the boy became frustrated to learn his sister was in a girl's boarding school. Unknown to you, Harry saw the similarities as well and glanced towards you, wondering if you were really John. The movie showed a villain who was trying to coax the boy to sneak into the school despite warnings not to. She told the boy his sister was in danger, being taught strange things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Christina soon forgot about your doubts about each other, completely pulled into the plot of the cartoon movie as the boy decided to sneak into the school to find his sister, going under the impression she was in trouble or worse, danger. \"This is a pretty good movie.\" Watching the action play out, you muttered. \"I wonder what I, err, my brother would do if that were him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope that boy will make it out with his sister without getting caught.\" Wide eyed, Christina whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a familiar voice called out. \"Hey, Lucy. I see you're watching 'Twin Magic'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around, startled only to have your jaw drop in surprise. 'John' was standing at the bottom of the stairs, smiling at you. He was wearing your jeans with a pink shirt you had got for Mel's birthday. \"That's not funny...\" Pouting, you complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'John' chuckled. \"Are you still mad at me for that little prank I pulled on you the last time you visited?\" Lightly, he asked. \"I thought you'd be over that by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina looked surprised as well but frowned as 'John' asked, \"Should I tell you how it ends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're trying to watch the movie, wise guy!\" Huffing, she blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Playing along, you yelled. \"Girls only! Go do homework with <i>Hayley</i> or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley, who had magically disguised herself as John smiled. She knew that you saw through her disguise but was glad you were not going to call her out on it. All she needed was for Christina to see 'John' to strengthen your cover until the curse wore off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay.\" Raising his hands, 'John' said. \"I got invited to go out camping with the football team. I should be back in a day or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever...\" Turning back to the movie, Christina said. She sighed. \"Have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we finish watching this?\" Glaring at your disguised sister, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'John' nodded then quietly walked back up the stairs. Upon entering her bedroom, she cancelled the disguise and became herself again. There, mom was waiting for her. \"How did it go?\" Whispering, she asked. \"Did Christina fall for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christina bought it but Lucy saw right through me.\" Smiling, Hayley said. \"At least she did not call me out on it. It will give us some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"We need to find out where Harry got those rings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting an idea, Hayley moved to your bedroom and searched through Harry;s overnight bag.

However, mom made you stay home for another day just in case the curse carried an unknown surprise. While you remained home with Dr Thompson watching over you, mom took Christina to Samantha Forester's house. It was a quaint little house with rustic brown siding and pine green shutters with a heavy oak front door. Mom knocked firmly while Christina squirmed at her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina was not happy to be wearing a princess themed dress with petticoats, elbow length gloves, white tights with red hearts, or black mary janes. \"Why do I have to wear this get up again?\" Sourly, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, it will help you here.\" Serious, mom replied. \"This woman loves to toy with boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresently, the door opened and Samantha Forester looked at mom with surprise. \"What brings you here, Natalie?\" Curious, she asked. Then she saw Christina and sighed. \"I warned you not to buy anything from Sweet Antiques, Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know...\" Pouting, Christina replied. \"Still, how was I supposed to know? No one warned me that they were magical or could do this to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are here about the rings Harry had.\" Quietly, mom said. \"Did you send Christina this letter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha nodded. \"Come inside and I'll tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom ushered Christina inside where Samantha offered them a seat in her sitting room. \"As I am sure you have already figured out, Harry has a magical addiction.\" Calmly, Samantha said. \"However, he comes from a long line of people who are immune to magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you have been selling Harry magical items, taking the risk they would not change him.\" Annoyed, mom said. \"You took a big risk, Samantha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a risk, I agree.\" Frowning, Samantha said. \"Through him, I had been able to keep a lot of what would be dangerous items out of the hands of irresponsible witches. Things began to fall out of control when he started to buy these items through other people besides me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry was compelled to find items with more magic.\" Sighing, mom said. \"That fits the pattern of his addiction but where did he get the rings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilly Sweetie, a school rival of mine.\" Ice in her voice, Samantha replied. \"She runs Sweet Antiques, an online store for witches.\" She huffed. \"The only reason Harry was able to get on was because she contacted him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What ever for?\" Worried, mom demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lily sold the rings to get rid of them.\" Serious, Samantha said. \"I found out about it as I track everything he purchases and questioned Lily about it.\" She frowned. \"She told me that Harry had out bid two witches trying to get them. She and I wrote a letter to warn him about his purchase when we found out the two witches were rogue hunter cadet drop outs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom's eyes widened, guessing Mary and Anna were the rogue hunter cadets Samantha spoke of. \"John touched one of the rings and was cursed to be a little girl for a day.\" Quietly, she admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina turned to mom, surprised hearing that as Samantha shook her head, looking bemused. \"The curse is harmless, a gentle warning, but the aftereffects can be troublesome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Worried, mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once touched by magic, it makes a boy curious.\" Bemused, Samantha replied. \"That is what started... (giggle) Christina's magical addiction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way back home, mom phoned Hayley. \"I have reason to believe that Mary and Anna are not rogue hunters but drop outs trying to acquire the Pharaoh's Rings.\" Serious, mom said. \"Those rings can give them a serious boost in magical power; we can't let them get their hands on them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want me to do?\" Worried, Hayley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep John in his room and keep watch.\" Speeding down the road, mom replied. \"I'll be home as soon as I can; we'll hand the rings over to the head witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Hayley could respond, mom heard a crash on her end followed by the sounds of a struggle. \"Hayley?!\" Worried, she called. \"Hayley!...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow frightened for her children, mom teleported the car into the driveway of her home and ran out to see that the front door had been magically turned into splinters!

Furthermore, you pigtails were still there, and unknown to you, some of your hair adjoining them had started to turn blond as well. Strangely, your clothes were resized for your smaller body.

All your main items of clothing, your shirt, jeans and underwear were relatively normal, but your socks were completely different. They were shorter and frillier, clearly for a girl. Additionally, your watch had disappeared, replaced by a silver bracelet. Unnerved, you took your shower, but didn't enjoy it much, even though nothing else had changed. You was too worried about anything else changing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten minutes of trying to gather your nerve, you dressed yourself, minus the socks and bracelet, and headed downstairs. The only ones there were mom, and Christina, who didn't look too happy in her princess inspired dress. She stared at you, then looked away surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up with you?\" you demanded. Thanks to the magic incident, you knew Christina knew about magic. Besides having your doubts about who she really was, you wondered if she could see what was happening to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mother is taking us to see that weird woman\" Christina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What weird woman?\" you demanded. \"Can you see what is happening to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samantha Forester specialises in the issue you're claiming to have, and in this matter alone, she is better than me\" mom said guardedly, and in a voice telling you she didn't like admitting that fact. \"Christina is coming with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" you demanded, giving Christina a sharp look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use you brain, John.

Reluctantly, you put on the socks, and slid the bracelet onto your wrist. Fortunately, your shoes were still normal, though you were still anxious about them being in contact with your changed socks. Your fears proved correct, as they started to change roughly a minute after mom had placed you in the car.

I'd better get the girls home\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt oddly relieved at that suggestion, because you were certain in mom's dazed state, she would take you shopping; better to deal with her amnesia at home. As you walked out, you took a closer glance at Christina., and almost screamed again. Christina also had pink fingernails, and while she was no stranger to getting them done, you knew she wasn't a fan. She didn't have it done before, and she certainly didn't have earrings in her ears. Alarmed, you reached for your own ears and felt something cold and metallic...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom....\" you said, voice trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it sweetie?\" mom asked, gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My ears.... and its spreading\" you wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going feel funny for a while, girls. I'm glad you're so brave after seeing Christina\" mom said, oblivious to your unease, and seemingly thinking the whole purpose of the mall trip was to get your and Christina's ears pierced. When you get home, you find...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She smiled and said, \"Good idea. Can I join you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned. From mom's perspective, it would be two little girls playing together, and with this adaptive magic changing things, you feared it would become a reality. \"I just want to be alone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to play video games, John\" Christina said. That caught your attention; you snapped twards her and said, \"You can perceive what is happening to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah. I don't know why, but it scares me\" Christina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned even more as you decided what to do. \"Okay, you can come and watch, but while you do it, I want to know what you know. You're too weird, and I don't know how you can see something even mom can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe because I'm a tomboy\" Christina pouted. \"Have you got anything good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so. You're too young\" you said as she reached for the console. as she grabbed it, the console morphed into a doll house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do!?\" you shrieked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? I didn't do anything!\" Christina said as she leapt away, with genuine fear. \"I don't have magic...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must have\" you countered as your bedspread changed into a princess themed one. This time, there was no contact with Christina. She turned to you and said, \"I didn't do that! You must have!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I want that?\" you snapped, as your drawers turned white and pink. Additionally, all your walls turned pale pink. You knew what was happening; your room was changing to match the form that you was slowly becoming, and it put you into a temper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't. Just calm down...\" Christina urged. \"I don't want this either. I'd much rather climb a tree than to play with dolls, or dress up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy for you to say\" you snapped as you saw your study desk change to a vanity, allowing you to see your altered form. You hair had changed even more, the blond parts merging at the back part of your head, leaving only the front unaltered. \"Get out of here! I've got to salvage what I can...\" you said, as you reached for your changed drawer. You gave an anguished cry, as you pulled out your swimsuit, which had become the object of your recent nightmares; a pink onepiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you didn't want to see that.....\" Christina soothed. \"Still, why not go for a swim?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy for you. If you're who you said you are, you've been wearing it for your entire life\" you countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No, you know who I am, and I don't have time for your games\" Christina said. From the disjoined way she spoke, you knew the conversation had been hijacked, mostly likely by your cousin, Tim. Tim was Hannah's age, and not the most pleasant kid around, as is hobby seemed to be teasing girls. In other words, not the ideal person for Christina to seek aid; he would be delighted by your plight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim?\" you mouthed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina nodded, so you mouthed, \"Give me the phone.\" She obeyed, but soon as you had it in your hands, you wondered what to say. Sighing, you decided on the direct approach. \"Tim, I really need to speak with aunt Catherine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with your voice? Have you finally caught cooties?\"  Tim said, much to your alarm. You really didn't want any more physical changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just get your mom. Now, Tim\" you replied in the deepest voice you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not until you tell me what is wrong\" Tim said. You could almost picture the smirk. \"Do I need shots?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you need shots. Go get them from Forester.

She never thought her speech patterns would give her away.

Why would I want to be stuck like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well its better to be pretty and....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you crossly demanded. The fact that Christina stopped mid sentence and seemed bigger weren't good signs. Quickly rushing to a mirror, you saw you were now the size of a seven year old, and that your face was far more girlish. Your face definitely resembled Hannah's and to a lesser extent, Christina's, and thanks to that, you knew even without this spell, people would question whether you were a boy. Ignoring Christina, you risked a look down your shorts and discovered you now had panties. Despondent, you walked downstairs, with Christina in close pursuit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going, Lucy?\" Christina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't call me that! Go away! I need to find help, and I don't need you telling me how great things are\" you wailed. Ignoring her, you opened the door, but you never waked through.

So, you've caught cooties, or is this who you really are?\" Tim mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can see what is happening to me?\" you demanded, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I can, you dumb <i>girl</i> I'm not mush brained to go to that woman\" Tim said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not being... you. You really can see? How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I can see. You're little, and wearing girls' shoes and have a stupid haircut. I bet you're even wearing girls' underwear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed, but tried to ignore his words. \"How can you see this, where even mom cannot? Only a powerful witch like Forester can, and to everyone else, I'm 'Lucy'\" you  demanded.</span></div></div>",

No wonder why Hannah couldn't stand him. \"I need help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you do. You're a girl, Lucy. Why are you dressed like a boy?\" Tim asked, still smirking. He quickly walked over to you, and ripped open one of your jean legs. You was shocked; not only could he actually rip them open, but also in the fact he had the nerve to do so. Apart from a few times when he'd slip his pet frog down someone's clothes, Tim had never physically done anything to a girl. From the look on Christina's face, she was as equally surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim? You're acting strange\" you said as Tim tore the other leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not, porridge brain\" Tim smirked. \"Doesn't that feel better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down in time to see your ruined jeans morph into a skirt. Tim could see it as well, and instead of being freaked out by a direct demonstration of magic, he had a mad, delighted look in his eyes. \"You're even wearing panties! Gross. They're pink and princess themed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat confirmed it for you. Something wasn't right and not even the changes to your clothes, the weird breeze flowing up your legs, or the fear that your could be missing something important tore your attention away from your cousin.

You're seen witches disguise themselves before, and apart from the smart mouth, Tim's wasn't acting like himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" you snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're becoming a real mush-brain, Lucy\" Tim grinned, but Christina looked horrified, figuring out what you suspected.

He didn't even see it coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a jump rope?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would I know?\" you snapped. The stress from the transformation, and that your panties felt 'normal' was becoming overwhelming. \"Maybe Hayley still has one in her closet. Get it, and we'll tie our guest in my room.

It would scare her for certain, but you was slightly annoyed at yourself for not doing it earlier, when you first suspected Christina was an act.

Angrily, you stormed over to Mary and ripped off her gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you done to me, you big meanie?\" you demanded, only cringing once you realized that came out like a little girl. \"Have you put a spell on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, <i>little girl</i>. Its just your little girl thoughts are taking root and sprouting. Don't you want to play dress up with your sister?\" Mary said in a mean voice. Annoyed, you slammed the gag back into the rouge witch's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christina? What do you think... Christina!\" you shrieked, as you saw Christina searching through your wardrobe. She eventually pulled out a princess costume. That did it for you; you needed help, and so did she. \"You're a tomboy and you're not my sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, sis? Did that witch curse you?\" Christina asked, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. We need help...\" you answered, but it was cut off. Mom yelled, \"Girls. Are you okay? Why are you yelling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced; the last thing you needed was for mom to check up on you, since knowing how things were going, she would probably think Mary was your babysitter of something like that, or at best, dress you real girlishly. \"Nothing is wrong mommy. Can Christina and I go use our bikes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where to, sweetie?\" mom demanded, causing you to wince again. If she was thinking you and Christina were really five year old sisters, she wouldn't let you ride alone. Especially if you had been fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aunt Catherine's house\" you said, thinking quickly. It was, after all, your original plan. You motioned for Christina to help shove Mary into your wardrobe, in case mom decided to come in. Not wanting to take any more risks, you also grabbed her hand and dragged her outside; it was a good decision as mom was about to come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a little far..\" mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No its not, mommy. I'll have Christina with me. Please mommy\" you said, trying to hide your alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please mommy\" Christina added, causing you to wince. You didn't know what was worse; Christina or mom thinking it was normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom paused. \"Sorry girls. Why don't you play here? If you really want to ride your bikes, just go down the street\" mom offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks mommy\" you found yourself gushing. You rushed down to where your bikes were, and stared shocked at the sight of the pink bike with a white basket; you knew it was yours. Reluctantly, you sat on it and started to ride. So did Christina, except she was much more eager and comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Partly because of your new size, but partly because you knew mom would be furious that you were defying her. From her point of view, you was her little girl, and who knows what she would do to do if she found out. Instinctively, you new telling her the truth would get you nowhere, and possibly might make things worse; she might think you're the one that is bewitched, not her... or Christina. You turned to face your 'sister' and saw she looked as worn out as you felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are we here, Lucy?\" Christina gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't want to tell her that her increasingly girlish behavor was creeping you out or that you feared she would drag you into girly girlhood with her. \"I wanna see Tim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? He's a big meanie\" Christina pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True but mommy told me he has something to do with magic\" you said, wincing, knowing the real Tim would be irritatingly annoying. Plus, you never meant to say 'mommy'. I just came out... Slightly worried, you headed around the back, and with some effort, climbed up to Tim's bedroom window. He seemed shocked when you knocked on his window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away, cootie brain. I'm doing something\" Tim protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up and let us in. We're in so much trouble\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim's eyes lit up bemused at the thought of you being in trouble, and let you in. Once in, you and Tim helped Christina up, which was much more difficult as she was dressed far more girlish than you, and during her climb, her clothing became even girllier. Something Tim noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get away! I don't want to become some princess like you\" Tim protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then help us! You know exactly who I am, what has happened to me, and to her\" you said, pointing to Christina. \"I know you are resistant to magic, which is one reason you don't already have a skirt of your own, and almost paradoxically, to top it off, you are a siren witch. I have a witch tied up in my room that is eager to turn Christina and I into twin sisters, and has already tried to impersonate you! She did a decent job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim increasingly looked uncomfortable and horrified, but Christina broke the silence. \"Wait, what are you saying, sis? How can he be resistant and be a witch? Can we go now? I'm bored\" Christina whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See what I mean?\" you hissed at Tim. \"Do something, because despite whatever ridiculous taunts you love to make, I do not want to be some giggling, pink clad kid.\"</span></div></div>",

A woman in her late twenties was doing the instructing, and like most of her students, she wore a pink leotard.

Her form permanently becomes that of Christina Harrison\" Trina whispered back. She turned and nudged you as the instructor walked over to you and said, \"Hope you two are having a nice conversation. Would you like to share it with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned slightly red, but Trina thought quick, sharpened by her taunting. \"I was just telling Lucy what to do.

Someone placed into Tim's head to see Samantha, and produced evil Trina, who I suspect briefly posed as Forester while Tim minus the girl part was talking with the real Forester. Trina then sold the glasses to Harry Rich, who then was turned into Christina. The council knew of the use, and voted on whether to keep Christina as Christina. That vote, as you know failed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're saying the suspect is from the losing faction?\" Laura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possibly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do we have to question them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not. Our only option is to search Harry's house. Thus wasn't done as the glasses were secured.\" Elvira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes later, Elvira had arrived at the end of the street, having walked as not to draw any potential attention, but an unexpected and unpleasant surprise waited for her; there was no house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Laura asked. \"Did some use an invisibility spell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. The change in reality is conveniently covering this witch's tracks\" Elvira said sourly. \"I have to implement the back up plan, and question Christina. You're her new seventeen year old babysitter. Hannah and Lucy's too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How? She has almost fully transformed, and is practically an extremely girly five year old\" Laura protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think of something. Just be careful of Lucy. I don't want her to start going girly too, and regardless, she would naturally be hostile towards you\" Elvira warned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Upon arriving, Catherine was waiting for them. \"I'll keep them out of mischief while you talk to Elvira.\" Serious, she said. \"Maybe she has found a way around this curse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so.\" Wincing, mom said. \"I fear this may drive poor Lucy mad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched sadly as mom pulled away as you wanted to see Elvira with her and maybe convince her of the truth behind everything that had been going on. As it stood, it seemed as if you and Elvira were the only ones who knew you as John.

John.\" Whispering, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to Catherine shocked but she carefully hushed you silent. \"I am a healer witch.\" Quietly, she explained. \"As such, I have a higher immunity to magical curses that warp reality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you help me, aunt Cathwine?\" Desperate, you begged. \"This whole ting is dwiving me insane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can tell you that your lisp is not a part of the curse.\" Softly, Catherine said. \"You had that same issue when you were five as a boy.

So far, it has not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, there is a chance; some hope that I'll...\" Hopeful you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a sliver of hope.\" Interrupting you, Catherine said. \"However, just a sliver.

Also, Christina seems more and more lost each day, though she acts like everything is normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I explained this to you earlier, Natalie.\" Serious, Elvira said. \"However, the curse is making you forget anything to the contrary that you have always had five daughters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the truth?\" Begging, Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira sighed. \"You originally had only three daughters and one son.\" Bluntly, she explained. \"The son, John, was a twin to Melanie. Christina was your next door neighbor's son, Harry who usually always ended up living alone for weeks at a time due to his parents always being away on business trips.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why is this Harry now my daughter, Christina?\" Frustrated, mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because of a unanimous vote from the witch council.\" Darkly, Elvira replied. \"Originally, they barely voted in favor of you trying to bring Harry and John back despite the fact they both used a banned enchanted magical artifact. You convinced them on the grounds they had no idea magic existed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What brought on the re-vote and changed decision?\" Annoyed, mom demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry had a magical addiction which would have eventually made him a girl and a witch.\" Serious, Elvira said. \"Two rogue hunter cadet drop outs took it upon themselves to free Harry of the artifacts but he had hid them all too well so they tried to get... her to lead them to the collection. When they failed, they vented their frustration out on John... the weakest link in any witch family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira then finished telling mom everything that you had relayed to her as to what had happened, finishing with, \"John was cursed three times. You know the rules of magic; too many hits and his dormant magic permanently gives the witch boy the means to fight back... to defend herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which caught the attention of the witch council.\" Sighing, mom finished. \"What a mess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It gets worse, Natalie.\" Grimly, Elvira said. \"As Christina is now likely a girl and a witch for life, the council voted to adopt her into your family, hence she and nearly everyone else believes she was always your daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there any way to fix this?\" Worried, mom asked. \"To at least give Christina and Lucy some closure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira was silent for a long moment as she turned to a window over looking a small garden.

Would you like to try on my old cheer uniform?\" Megan offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwapping a Cinderella dress for a cheerleader uniform was a poor exchange.

This time, Tim gave his sister a excessively sweet smile and transformed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you wouldn't feel better as a girl.... Hey!

She could sense the magic going through you, and knew she needed to give you some help, since there was only a short window of time between you gaining magic and you permanently gaining a female body. However, she knew she couldn't go as Tim, and as Trina, she had to dress the part; she still dressed as a boy, and had a very annoyed sister wanting to strangle her.

You smiled glad to be rid of it, but a part of you really wanted to pull it all back on. \"How are you going to hethp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Redress yourself. Just use your instincts\" Trina said as several outfits magically appeared. The first was a pink and purple dress, with <i>huge</i> puffed up sleeves and skirt, complete with purple gloves and tiara. It was most girliest dress you've seen, a monstrous parody of any princess gown, and something your growing girlish side really wanted. The second was the polar opposite; boy's clothes. The shorts and t-shirt looked like it was teleported straight out of Tim's wardrobe<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just put on some clothes, Lucy, then we'll talk\" Trina urged.

The two cadets turned ghost white and began to scream and struggle as they were dragged out of the courtroom for their punishment to be carried out immediately.

I'm hoping they will have enough energy after lunch to go shopping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFawn nodded then prepared the first batch of pancakes while you and Christina found a near by seat. Once they are out of ear shot, Fawn asked, \"Are you making any progress with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley smiled. \"They haven't changed a bit outside of their feminine side 'trespassing' on their male egos.\" Whispering, she said. \"I'm hoping to shake them both up a bit so they will work as one to get what they both think they want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFawn giggled. \"Good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And before you say anything, smaller body, smaller appetite\" Hayley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can\" you whined, like a pouting kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cppink\">'Yeah? If you think you're so good, why don't we have a bet? If we eat less than two, I stay quiet for this trip regardless of what you try on. If you can't, you try some pretty clothes. And shoes. And toys. And pink...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear that?\" you whispered to Christina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" Christina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can I hear your annoying, bratty voice?\" you whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo voices came back. The first was obvious. <i><span class=\"cppink\">'I'm not a brat'</span></i> The second was Christina. \"Its still there, but you can't hear her because I was transforming earlier than you. Why don't we just enjoy these instead. I see we only have the one stack\" Christina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not backing out because widdle mith sugar and spice ith saying I'm a chicken. I'm not wetting her thoil everythink.

Christina also started eating, but in an almost half-hearted fashion as if the real completion was against the voice, and not her. You was able to outeat her easily, as Christina could only eat one pancake, but much to your annoyance, you wasn't much better. You barely made two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<span class=\"cppink\">Are you do giving us a tummy ache?</span>' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">'Are you done being a girlish brat</span>' you countered, causing Christina to giggle. \"Hayley?

You thought they would be suitable with a few more modifications, like ditching the buttons, and the pink t-shirt.  She turned to Hayley and said, \"Shall I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I think I better do it\" your sister said, much to your confusion. Before you could question her, she snapped her fingers, and you found she was holding your pink dress, and you was wearing the new outfit. \"What do you think, Lucy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better than the dwess, but what about mommy?\" you asked, wincing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once I'm done with you, she'll be fine\" Hayley said, as you felt your hair untie itself.

She won't hear everything, and in case you're wondering, you won't become a trio of girly triplets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Christina, could you hear anythink?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a thing.

Turning to Karen, Hayley said, \"I think I better take these two home for some magic lessons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck with that\" Turning to you and Christina, Karen added, \"Hope you enjoy your new outfits\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"chotpink\">'I wanted a pretty dress!'</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tough. You're not getting a 'pwetty' dwess. Be gwateful I'm wearing pink\" you snapped. \"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">'You love pink. It's your favorite color, Lucy.'</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignoring the voice, you walked to the exit. You had taken only a few steps when you noticed that neither Christina or Hayley had moved. Both seemed shocked. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be alarmed....\" Hayley said gently as you saw something move. Instantly, you gave a shocked shriek, seeing your t-shirt's sleeves puff up, and have the feeling of material scrunch up around your waist.

Your clothes had also grow with you, making your transformation unnoticeable. unfortunately, it also meant Mel had returned to her form as well, and knowing her, she would want some kind of payback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<span class=\"chotpink\">I should get out of here before Melanie comes.

Felling slightly uncertain, wondering about what really happened to you in the past, and what you would do now, you headed back to your room. Christina would help; surely someone who is going through the same experience would know. When you opened the door, you received a massive shock. Christina was wearing a pink princess dress, gloves, slight makeup, tiara and was brushing the hair of the Harriet doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy?! I can explain. I thought you was talking with mommy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou entered the room and closed the door. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina shuddered slightly and looked at the floor. \"I was scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That the brat was right in saying that you wanted to do thith stuff?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I was turned into a girly girl once.

She couldn't have been more than seven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy. I don't....\" you started to whine, but you was quickly cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy. This isn't a playdate.

You did so reluctantly, if anything to get it done and over with. Mom was about to follow but Robyn blocked her path, shaking her head. \"I am sorry, Ms Harrison.\" Politely, she said. \"However, for me to perform my duties as her councilor efficiently, this session must be one on one.\" She smiled. \"I will call you when it is time to pick her up with an appointment for the next session.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she closed the door. Mom sighed and returned to her car. Inside the house, you were surprised to find it was decorated with a strange blend of feminine and masculine styles. The walls had flower themed wallpaper but the boarders were a solid dark blue. The curtains were white lace but the rods holding them looked almost like medieval spears.

You see, it was made to change an aggressive girl into a sweet girl with a more cheery disposition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only it awso changes boys into sweet, wovable wittle girls.\" Annoyed, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is ironic is that the potion was supposed to be unbeatable, especially to boys.\" Bemused, Robyn said. \"Yet, here you and I are, both victims of this infamous potion, still holding on to our male selves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean I have a chance to....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, no.\" Serious, Robyn said. \"However, it does mean that you will not forget who you once were... if you can find a balance that won't drive you crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you manage to work around it?\" Frowning, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn smiled slightly. \"I had a hard time of it, just like you are now.\" Honestly, she said. \"Only I finally stopped fighting with myself and began to find ways to satisfy my, shall we say, conflicting interests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She teaches at Spellblossom all girls boarding school on the other side of the country.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis shocked you. <span class=\"chotpink\">\"There is more than one witch school?\"</span> Surprised, the girl voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom laughed. \"Well, yeah. Otherwise, Witchbloom would need to be much larger than it is now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed slightly, annoyed by how the girl voice kept interrupting you. \"What did you choose as a distraction, mom... ballet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough mom had planned ballet after talking to Dr Thompson, her sister, and sister in law, she knew a good opening when she saw one and grinned at you. \"What a wonderful idea, Lucy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your mouth to protest but quickly decided to remain silent, knowing you had walked right into it with your eyes wide open. \"How would ballet help distwat me?\" Nervous, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled kindly at you, something you did not expect. \"I have arranged a demonstration so you can see for yourself why I chose this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough, I gueth.\" Sighing, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, you arrived at Hannah's ballet school where mom lead you into the building to meet Hannah's ballet instructor, Miss Diana Swanson. You had met her before as John but you did not expect to see your Tia Chi instructor, Mr Jo Tau. \"Lucy, I know how much you enjoy the art of Tia Chi and how you mimic it from what you see on the television.\" With a knowing smile, mom said. \"I want you to see that both ballet and Tai Chi are about balance and control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you looked at mom, dumbfounded but almost instinctively let out an unbelieving giggle. Mom's smile broadened, she had expected that and motioned to the instructors who smiled as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that you doubt your mother's words.\" Smiling, Jo Tau said. \"Please show me some of what you had learned from watching Tai Chi on television.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou demonstrated some of the basic moves that Jo Tau had taught you when you were John. Only, without thinking about it, you threw in some moves you had picked up from Hannah while watching her practice ballet. As everyone watched, their smiles grew more and more. When you had finished, all three applauded you. \"You seem to have a natural talent.\" Bemused, Jo Tau said. \"However, nearly half of the moves you uses were not Tai Chi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Blinking, you asked. \"I don't understand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Swanson giggled. \"Half of the moves you used in your little demonstration were basic ballet stances and warm up stretches.\" Bemused as well, she explained. \"It seems as if you picked up some moves from your older sister, Hannah while trying to imitate Tai Chi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed terribly and tried to back away only mom held you firm. \"No one is laughing at you, sweetie.\" Cooing you, she said. \"I arranged this to show you that, although you won't admit it yet, you do have an interest in ballet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo Tau and Miss Swanson then began a demonstration of their own, using basic warm up moves. You were surprised by how graceful both of them moved to the soft music that was playing. When they were done, Jo Tau knelled down to your level. \"I will gladly teach you Tai Chi when you come of age, Miss Harrison.\" Politely, he said. \"For now, give ballet a chance.\" He smiled. \"Strong people do not hold those weaker down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou teared up, finishing, \"They lift them up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on, albeit reluctantly, you signed up for your first ballet lessons. Miss Swanson smiled kindly at you before you left for home. \"I know you are a little young but I'm putting you in your sister's class to start to see how well you fare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, forcing a smile back. \"Wonderful...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you were not entirely thrilled or sold on the aspect of learning ballet, you were surprised that your 'girl voice' was silent the entire time. <i>\"I wonder why...\"</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once in your room, you looked around, and saw that Harry was still in his tank, in spider form.

I came to help you calm down, not to fire you up. Let me help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for a reply, she started to untangle your hair. \"Did you talk to your mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She doesn't like the idea of either of us practicing magic. She enrolled us both in ballet <span class=\"chotpink\">so we can be pretty ballerinas<br>\r\n</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina rolled her eyes. \"Wish mommy picked something less girly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree, but I know what she is trying to do. An activity like that will boost your stamina, which will help when you eventually do start using your powers. Ballet can be a double edged sword; it seriously boost that little brat inside of you if you go into it frustrated and filled with negative energy. It can be calming though, and help silence her if you go in open minded. More stressed, more anxious, the more the female traits you both possess with come out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess the little toad was right\" Christina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I was told by a certain weregirl you might be in trouble.

The potion was in powder form so most of it had hit Harry, now Christina only it did not explain everything. \"Why were you able to fight its effects to still remember who you once were? Robyn told me that potion was unbeatable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr and Mrs Rich, my other mom and dad are immune to magic, Lucy.\" Simply, Christina said. \"I'm guessing that immunity allowed me to fight it at some level.\" She then pointed at you. \"In your case, as mommy said, you come from one of the most magically powerful families in the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what do you suggest we, err, I do?\" Tearing up again, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina thought for a moment then smiled as if he were truly inspired. \"Let's start with a new game.\" Motioning to the closet, she suggested. \"I call it mix and match.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mix and match?\" Curious, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed that, again, your voice and the girl voice were one, making an entirely new voice. Only you also realized that it was closer to the voice you once had but decided now was not the time to ponder over it as Christina was almost literally dragging you to your shared closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The game is simple.\" Smiling, Christina said. \"I will show you a top and bottom that I piece together and you say yes or no to one or both.\" She giggled. \"The outfits you say yes to in one voice we keep together and we can make a wardrobe you can live with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"Why didn't you do that before, you poop head?!\"</span> came another voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasped as Christina blushed. \"I thought we had a deal...\" Whispering, she complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"Just voicing my opinion.\"</span> Sounding hurt the second voice said. <span class=\"cpblue\">\"There is no harm in that... boyish me\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was your girl voice...\" Wincing, you said. \"Why didn't you tell me...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did say I have my own demons to face.\" Honestly, Christina replied. \"I promised my voice I would listen to her if she did not allow herself to be heard by others as it made us look... indecisive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Why didn't you suggest that?\"</span> Annoyed, your girl voice demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're straying from the subject!\" Stomping both feet, you yelled. \"Are we going to play this game or not, let's make up our minds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're playing.\" Firmly, Christina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded then, in one voice said, \"Fine...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They're still clean and wearable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Christina fumed slightly at being called 'little sis' by Hannah. Only she took your compliment as a victory and continued. \"What is the point of playing dress up if you are too afraid to put anything new on?\" Tossing more clothing out of your closet, Hannah demanded. \"It's not like any blouse, skirt, or dress is going to bite you unless its been enchanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou conceded Hannah's point but you were increasingly annoyed by the way she was blatantly tossing yours and Christina's clothing around as if they didn't mean anything. \"You're making a mess, Hannah!\" Whining, you complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs.\" Winking at you, Hannah fired back. \"I'll help you clean up; just relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Hannah's methods of finding something to wear annoyed you, even as John, you had to admit that she had some idea of what she was doing. Within thirty minutes, she had completely rearranged your entire wardrobe into outfits that your boy self nor your girl self could argue with. \"I guess its a start...\" Begrudgingly, you admitted. \"Thanks for your help...\" You winced. \"Big sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah giggled as if she loved to hear those words. \"You are so welcome!\" Beaming, she said. \"Your big sister is always here for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, counting to ten as Hannah then turned to Christina. \"Now, my other little sister, would you like me to help you too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina shook her head fuming. \"You threw most of my clothing all over the room!\" Angry, she wailed. \"How is that anywhere near helping me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah looked around at the various articles of clothing that were strewn about everywhere on the two beds, the dressers, and the floor. She bit her lip, as is realizing her mistake then gave a short giggle. \"Didn't I say I would help you clean up?\" Smiling, she said. \"I'm using a different method with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...?\" Taken back, Christina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah nodded. \"This way, all of your clothing is out in the open and we can easily mix and match them and put them back into the closet.\" Smiling, she explained. \"See; I know what I'm doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina sighed then, through gritted teeth, said...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They asked you to lay face down, naked, onto a table with a soft cushion next to other tables where Christina, Mel and Hayley joined you. Your treatment at the spa then began with a full body massage by the team of young women. Unknown to you, the were doctors in the hire of the witch council. They had ordered for a check up on yours and Christina's progress of treatment after being under the effects of a curse for so long. The woman massaging you introduced herself as Mira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a bundle of knots, young lady.\" said Mira. \"Have you been feeling stressed lately?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say that.\" you replied, tears forming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything you want to talk about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing the massage therapist was a witch doctor, you sighed and shook your head. \"Other than being trapped between a princess and a tomboy, I'm alright.\" Trying to make light, you replied. \"It's nothing I can't handle, I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise.\" Giving a hiccup type laugh, Christina added. \"We're just two girls who can't make up their minds who we want to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira smiled. \"You are a tough kid.\" she told you. \"I can tell... you'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman massaging Christina, who introduced herself as Linda giggled. \"It seems you two need to pull yourselves together.\" Lightly, she said. \"I have seen many tomboy princesses in many movies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the other tables, a woman talked to Hayley and Mel...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is your new sister and her twin reacting to the treatments?\" asked the woman, massaging Hayley, introduced as Connie. \"Any progress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are having some issues accepting our help, especially with Hannah's messy methods.\" Quietly, Hayley replied. \"Mel was a little rough on Lucy due to a misunderstanding. Mom had to step in.\" she then moaned, feeling her muscles relaxing. \"However, Lucy did finally make a small wardrobe she can live with; Christina is still refining her look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you plan on pushing them to try more girlish things?\" Whispering, Connie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but a little at a time..\" Whispering back, Hayley said. \"We don't want to push them away with our efforts, despite their well intent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of the witch tests?\" Curious, Connie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley frowned. \"Mom has firmly stated to the council that the curse placed upon the entire family was enough of a test for everyone involved.\" In a harsh whisper, she said. \"We are still being tested with the aftermath of that curse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am required to remind you, Miss Harrison.\" Softly, Connie said. \"In case your mother decides to go ahead with the tests, they are carefully monitored to avoid cases of abuse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley nodded. \"I am aware of that, thank you.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA similar conversation took place between the Mel and her Massage therapist, none you or Christina heard a word of. when the massage was finished, they escorted you all into a private room with a hot tub large enough for all to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The minerals in the spa will relax away any stress or tension that may be left.\" said Connie. \"Please, enjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully slipped into the water, noticing its unusually warm temperature, then let out a low sigh as you felt the stress of your on going ordeal slowly ebbing away. \"This feels so good.\" you whispered to your sister's giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you would enjoy this, if you gave it a chance.\" said Hayley, softly. \"There is more to being a girl that what you had seen so far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"I've been twitng to tell you dat all dis time.\"</span> Softly, your girl voice whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to tell you again.\" Calmly, you said. \"This is my mind, not yours. Take a hike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"It's, well, our mind now.\"</span> Somewhat sadly, the girl voice replied. <span class=\"chotpink\">\"Why don't you wike me? I'm just twying to make us a pwetty girl.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that we don't like you, being a part of me.\" Whispering, you complained. \"You're just... so annoying, always trying to tell me what to say. That and blurting out, speaking for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing you, Hayley moved the conversation to what you and the voices in yours and Christina's heads had been saying and doing. Genuinely wanting help, you both eased into the conversation but since neither Mel or Hayley could hear the other voice, you feltt you were alone in the battle of wills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly an hour in the spa, you all and dried off before changing into your clothes and moved on to the beauty salon. There, you were given a hairstyle similar to Hayley's and a light makeover. You had feared they were going to pierce your ears but, to your surprise, they did not. That made you, correctly, guess that mom and or your sisters had something planned for you later on. When the makeovers were  done, you and Christina were surprised to see how pretty you looked and both reluctantly agreed that you liked what you saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon returning home, you had planned to lock yourself in your room to mediate on dealing with the little girl voice in your head. Unknown to you, Hayley told mom what she learned from you and Christina at the spa and salon. \"I have an idea that might fix their problem.\" After a thought, mom said. \"However, I think its best if you don't know about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Surprised, Hayley asked. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"Trust me, sweetie.\" Patiently, she said. \"I only want to help them.\" She sighed. \"Only because what I have in mind may make things worse, I rather have just myself to blame.\" She looked out the window and added, \"I will try this on Lucy first. If it works, Christina will be next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did mom have in mind?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Grimacing, you shared a worried look with Christina; Megan knew nothing about magic, hence she knew nothing about what happened to you, or Christina. As far as she knew, you had always been a little girl. She arrived a couple of minutes later, looking a little worse for wear, as if she had a cold. She also had a medium sized plastic black bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for coming over to look after the girls. I have to deal with Hannah's misbehavior\" mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did she do?\" Megan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She snuck in somewhere she shouldn't and played a very mean prank on someone.

Extremely tired, which you instinctively knew was magic related. As you took a step towards Hannah, you tripped, and blacked out, though not before noticing some sort of addition pink....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds flew past, and you opened your eyes to a pitch black room. \"Huh?\" you moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">You're not awake, Lucy</span>\" a familiar sounding voice said. It was the voice, but you couldn't see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You?! You brought me here? Let me guess, I'm inside my mind facing one of these 'unwinnable' fights you've been boosting about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Not quite. Someone knocked you out. Probably mommy. She specializes in such magic</span>\" the voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show yourself!\" you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Very well</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou was slightly disappointed to see an ordinary five year old girl appearing out of nowhere. Naturally, she looked exactly like you, though to your surprise, she wore pink overalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Surprised, princess? I'm the tomboy, silly. You're the girly one.

It's clear to me that the sugar and spice is working at last, and you're well on your way into becoming a cutie</span>\" the voice said. \"<span class=\"chotpink\">Take a look</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou initially thought you was formless in this reality, but apparently not. You stared down, and to your horror, you was in a pink princess dress. Screaming, you shouted, \"What have you done to me? I look like a <span class=\"cppink\">pretty princess</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Before you ask, I haven't done anything.

I want to be a <span class=\"cppink\">pretty girl</span>. Stop changing my words, you <span class=\"cppink\">thupid poop head!</span>. I'm going to teach you a lesson you won't forget. This is my life you're ruining!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"All you're do is become a little girl even faster, but hey, that's your choice.... lucky you. Looks like we're waking up. Wonder how much of a little girl we're become....</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt those words, you woke up. The first thing you saw was Robyn standing over you. She was still in her school uniform, looking concerned. \"I knew this would happen. All victims of the sugar and spice suffer though it. I hope it wasn't too scary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still should have warned cootie brain even though it would have freaked her out....\" It was Trina<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I brought Trina along too.

So far, it has transformed your magical state into a tomboy. That, by the way, is whom you assumed was the 'girl' trying to destroy your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The sugar and spice potion was designed to completely change the physical and mental state of a witch who had gone mad or unruly.\" Calmly, Trina explained. \"It's basically a more powerful version of the reset potion; dubbed the girl maker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now, you are fighting yourself, Lucy.\" Serious, Robyn said. \"That is why the sugar and spice is slowly taking over.\" She sighed. \"You got lucky this time but luck doesn't last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only way you will have a chance to keep what it left of your memories and core beliefs is to allow your mental state and magical state to join forces.\" Sternly, Trina said. \"Unless, of course you wish to have a split personality and a double life like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shuddered at the thought. \"How do I make this happen?\" Worried, you pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn turned to Trina who nodded. \"You need to start listening to the voice in your head.\" Serious, she explained. \"However, you need to separate her voice from the sugar and spice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Nervous, you said. \"Easier said than done...\" You stopped mid sentence as a thought came to you, one you did not notice before now. \"The voice in my head often changes in tone. One minute she is serious while the next she is sickly sweet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Smiling, Robyn said. \"That was why the potion was dubbed sugar and spice! The invading magic had a sickly sweet tone, almost like a...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a princess.\" Your eyes narrowing, you said. A steel like glint formed in your eye. \"Now I have some ammunition to fight back with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go get her, tigress.\" Smirking, Trina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two vanished from the room with a dull flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"You may have figured out who I am but it won't save you now.\" </span> Sweetly, a voice said. <span class=\"cpink\">\"You will be a girlie girl in body and mind.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"It won't save you either, brat princess.\"</span> came the voice you now recognized as your magic. <span class=\"chotpink\">\"A princess we will be but not the kind you think.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile came to your face; the first genuine one in a long time. <i>\"Okay... its the end of the half and the visiting team has most of the points.\"</i> Serious, you thought. <i>\"Let's show this intruder how we Harrisons fight as a team.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She informed them that all of her girls had fallen ill with a cold. It was soon after she was about to get some sleep herself when her private telephone rang. It was a line for family only, meaning it had to be important. She answered on the second ring. \"Hello; Natalie speaking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope I did not wake you, sis.\" Calmly, a male voice said. It was her brother, Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No; you didn't.\" Tiredly, she said. \"Still, its been a long night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah told me.\" Sighing, Jack said.

You must know that the huge collection he possessed would be a tempting prize for any witch, rogue or otherwise.\" He sighed. \"There were many attempts made to buy his collection and even to steal it. However, because of his family's immunity and where he lived...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All discrete attempts to acquire the collection failed.\" Feeling a headache coming, mom said. \"Did they seek revenge then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They hired the two rogue hunter drop outs to go after the collection by any means necessary.\" Startling mom, Jack replied. \"We found physical evidence to back it up, linking this family to the crime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They took the job because they had a beef with that family to start out with.\" Pale, mom said. \"Stealing such a collection from a non magical boy could be seen as an attempt to save him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That and, if successful, they could have made his parents look bad under witch law for allowing such a collection as it could have made him a witch against his will.\" Annoyed, Jack said. \"This family is bad news, Natalie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about about Lucy?\" Wincing, mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We believe Lucy, formally John, was a personal matter.\" Darkly, Jack replied. \"The eldest daughter of that family is into girls and has a record of transforming boys into girls so to add to her list of conquests in the form of girlfriends.\" He huffed. \"We have evidence that she had made many attempts to seduce John but you know he only had eyes for Megan Thompson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom gasped. \"Do you think this family may go after her next?\" Worried, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hard to say.\" Serious, Jack said. \"Just say the word, sis.

He was not immune to magic but his resistance to it was insane as was his three sons. His daughter, Lu was only seven but was as powerful as Mel magic wise.

However, she conceded her older brother's point, Samantha Forester was very knowledgeable when it came to gender spells and witch law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha was tall and slender with shoulder length strawberry blond hair and fire hazel eyes. She had come wearing casual jeans and a loose fitting blouse. This surprised mom as she usually always wore dresses or skirts. \"I had been looking into Lucy and Christina's case ever since I was named a <i>likely suspect</i> in the magical attacks against your family.\" Annoyed, Samantha said. She showed mom a medical bag she had been carrying. \"Now that we have strong evidence that the Bane family is involved, I believe I can determine how they are continuing to torment your daughters and put a stop to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are in their bedroom.\" Motioning to follow her, mom said. \"This way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha followed mom into yours and Christina's bedroom and looked around before pulling a short wand out of the bag and pointed it various objects in the room. Frowning, she placed the wand back in her bag before taking out various viles of different colored liquids. She had you sniff a number of them and ask if you remembered smelling them before. Mom watched as Samantha conducted a number of tests before finally standing up to face her. \"We need to talk in your study.\" Serious, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded and lead Samantha to her private study where she closed the door and cast a privacy spell to ensure no one would listen in. \"What did you find?\" Patiently, mom demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Banes are using a back door approach to attack your daughters.\" With distaste, Samantha replied. \"They are making themselves appear to be just like the sugar and spice potion by magically attacking their subconscious minds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That explains their unusual high potential for magic.\" Thoughtful, mom said. \"Magical attacks at the subconscious level causes their own magic to build defenses against it, increasing their power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why such practices are highly illegal.\" Fuming, Samantha said. \"Although it makes it all but impossible for the target boy to fight back with his will or wits, it transforms him into a powerful witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There has to be a way to combat this!\" Angry, mom said. \"If I know my mother, Elvira, charges have already been pressed against them but that has not stopped them... yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha sighed. \"The Bane family is currently on the run.\" Serious, she said. \"However, there is a way to fight this.

Still, it would be useful to have someone watching in class...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not letting you regress me, then treating me like your personal doll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? You're been doing it for years...:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n:I'll find someone else. Three of us should come\" Samantha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way. I'm not letting you invite your friends. The only reason you're helping is that you're pissed that Cassie Bane is trying to set you up, and triggered your berserk button. Trina can join in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that little brat!\" Samantha protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? Annoyed that you're met someone more than a match for you? That Timmy can throw insult after insult and there is nothing you can do about it?\" mom said in a faux sweet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch it, Natalie. I can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't walk away. Its personal. You can take this note to Tim, and I'll inform the girls that they'll be having some magic after their ballet lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hannah told her instructor, Miss Terra Swanson that you and your twin sister had daymares and thought ballet might help them. \"They have been dealing with it by talking back to their nightmares as if they were a person trying to get a rise out of them.\" Worrisome, Hannah explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's unique.\" Smiling slightly, Tera said. She turned to you and Christina. \"Ballet requires a lot of focus, you can't allow your mind to wander while you are dancing on your tip toes. Otherwise, you might trip up or twist an ankle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"You make a cute ballerina.\"</span> Giggling, the voice said. <span class=\"cpink\">\"Maybe you'll get a solo in the recital.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm more cute than you'll ever be.\" Taunting back, you whispered. \"I likely dance better too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra looked at you, confused then grinned seeing Christina frown slightly. Hannah saw this as well and giggled, though she felt nervous. \"The LC twins are seriously competitive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra giggled. \"I can see that.\" Bemused, she said. \"In my class, we work as a team; is that clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Christina nodded though you had a slight grin as you heard the voice respond, rather annoyed. <span class=\"cpink\">\"You are so not cuter than me! I will make you a cute girl though!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a wave of relief, not to mention a certain satisfaction. <i>\"So, you are not me, as you had claimed!\"</i> Angry, you thought. <i>\"You're another witch! Who are you?!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"That's for me to know and you to find out... after I'm done with you.\"</span> Smugly, the voice retorted. <span class=\"cpink\">\"I out class you by a mile; you can't hold a candle against me!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Forget the candle, I carry a flame thrower!\"</i> Grinning, you thought back. <i>\"You are like a haggish disease; once you give it a name, you can fight it no matter how bad it is.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"You smug little rugrat!\"</span> Angry, the voice thundered. <span class=\"cpink\">\"No one calls Cassie Bane a hag!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled from ear to ear and turned to Christina. Having heard the voice, she smiled as well. \"Hook, line, and sinker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled at that then thought, <i>\"Why are you hiding, Cassie Bane? Are you afraid of a little girl?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice screamed then fell silent.

She was Hayley's height with shoulder length auburn hair and piercing green eyes. She was still in her girl's school uniform, wanting some fun after school. Only she cringed as a hand viciously slapped her across the face. It was her mother, Darla Bane, a near duplicate of her but with dark blue eyes. \"You arrogant, prideful, sloppy bitch!\" Furious, she screamed. \"It's bad enough that you botched obtaining the largest artifact collection to date! Now you just blurt out your name to the two girls who 'got in your way'?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just came out!\" Defending herself, Cassie wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second slap sent her head reeling back. \"Lucy and Christina are daughters of one of the most magically powerful families in existence!\" Screaming, Darla Scolded. \"You heard what happened to those two amateurs we hired who got caught! What do you think will happen to us?\" Suddenly, she smiled, much like a python would to a rat. \"Then again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a plan, mom?\" Hopeful, Cassie demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla raised a dramatic hand to her forehead. \"Oh, Cassie, where did I go wrong?!\" Sarcastically, she declared. \"My eldest daughter gone insane... butting heads with the family of the head witch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie's jaw dropped as she realized her mother fully intended to make her the escape goat. \"You can't seriously be considering throwing your own daughter under the bus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you did orchestrate most of the operation.\" With an evil smile, Darla said. \"I was merely playing the role of a loving mother, blind to your true selfish intentions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie screamed in anger and ran from the room, grabbing the crystal ball as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** *******************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Hannah's ballet class, you and Christina had joined the class, trying a few moves they had been practicing when the voice, you now knew as Cassie, returned. <span class=\"cpink\">\"Lucy, you got to help me!\"</span> Almost pleading, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Why would I help you?\"</i> Annoyed, you thought. <i>\"After all you did to me...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Please, Lucy!\"</span> Desperate, Cassie begged. <span class=\"cpink\">\"Hear me out, I was forced to do this!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou excused yourself from practice, saying you needed to use the restroom and walked to the washroom where you sighed then replied....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Fighting off the urge to cry, you sat down alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Lucy? Are you sad?\" a voice asked. It was the second girliest girl, a five year old called Lily. Christina was behind her, looking a little sheepish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That meanie took my ball\" you grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you want to play with some dumb ball anyway?\" Lily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Here it comes.

You certainly didn't want to continue ballet, even though you was certain Christina did, and that you knew once you was doing it, you kind of liked it. You also didn't want to do any cheerleading; too painful. You was supposed to be close friends with a cheerleader, not be moulded into one yourself. Hence, you took the easy way out by not saying anything at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom laughed. \"What?\" you snapped, Ill tempered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're even cuter when you're pouting, Lucy\" mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am not!\" you whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, mom said, \"I've cast a spell to allow our conversation to remain private. All I can say Lucy, is you've quickly picked up that side of girlhood.\" holding up a hand to cut off your protests, mom continued, \"Still, I have to remind myself that you're also both smaller and will tire easier. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they're  both symbols of what has happened to us, mommy\" Christina countered, but the look on her face told both you and mom that she had no issues whatsoever about doing either activity. Then again, her mental changes was far more pronounced than yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to have to accept what happened to you, or you will go crazy. I know it isn't fair, but trust me, there are much worse things that Cassandra Bane could have done to you. I want to give you some input in your life, because I know deep down, you want to do an activity. If you cannot make a choice, I'll make it for you\" mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" Ballet meant twirling around clad in pink whilst Hannah watched on. No thanks. Cheerleading meant being under the eye of kid-hating Kristy Hart. Again, no thanks, though a part of you wondered how she got stuck with the job. You pondered for a minute, occasionally staring at Christina, though her internal debate was more centered on which one. After a minute, you felt mom's hands grabbing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" as you felt mom gently pulling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't stay here forever with this spell cast\" mom said, pulling you both to a changeroom. Five minutes later, she had dressed you both in princess dresses. You was dressed like Cinderella, much to your irritation, and Christina as Belle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princesses? Why, mommy?' you whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you can't make up your minds, I'm sending you on a playdate with your friend Lily. Maybe I'm wrong and you don't need sports and magic. All you need is time playing with other little girls. You know I've never been keen on the idea of teaching you magic so young. Maybe, with Darla Bane gone you should for a while be relatively normal girls\" mom said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You could not help giggle at your magical pet, now in the form of an adorable kitten. You found it ironic that he had the same coloration as the spider you once knew and eventually feared. It had taken on a new form which you could not help love. You were about to pull Harry in for a hug when you were startled by a chorus of all the girls cooing, \"Aw!

Still... I don't ever want to feel that scared again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then began to cry, petting Harry for whatever comfort you could get. Falling to your knees, Christina knelled down and pulled you into a hug. Lily, Becky, Emily, and Zoe quickly joined in as you cried out your frustrations. In a way, it felt good to talk about what had happened to you even though it was a half truth and you were glad to find that kindergarten kids had a better grasp of what you were going through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never need to stand alone, Lucy.\" Entering the living room, Dina said. \"I heard every word; what you and Christina went through was terrible. I would be on my guard after that too.\" She then smiled. \"Only try surrounding yourself with friends rather than pushing them out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She already is surrounded by friends.\" Grinning, Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others giggled, causing you to blush more.

You didn't have much to say on the way home, other than commenting on your relief to get home, or a plead for Hayley to do something about your clothes the first instance you and her were alone. She said you was overreacting, a drama princess and that you looked fine; you disagreed. All you needed was a pinafore, and then you'd be a close cope of Alice in Wonderland. Opening the door, you saw two figures waiting for you; Robyn and Tim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you two doing?\" you demanded, noticing that Tim in particular had a cheeky grin on his face that meant trouble. He got in first. Half smirking,  he said, \"Wonderland wants their girl back...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to face Hayley, back she wasn't there. Turning back, you saw Robyn giving Tim a slight punch to the side. \"Idiot. We're here to help Lucy, not tease her. If you won't be civil, Trina can help me, and I swear she will model that outfit so Lucy can see that she has no resemblance to that particular costume.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have the power, anime girl\" Tim taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, and if you're not careful, you'll have the exact same uniform. You know it is Witchbloom's\" Robyn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to smirk. For to people that were trying to help, they sure were effective at fighting each other. Robyn noticed, and said, \"I heard that you had a rough night. I wanted to see how you were doing,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is he doing here?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought having a weregirl that you knew would help. Obviously I was wrong. Lucy doesn't want to talk to you, you jerk. Maybe Tina would be more pleasant...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody talked to Tim in that manner. Instead of firing up, and throwing a few genuine insults, Tim relented, and shifted into Trina. It didn't stop her from staring daggers at the schoolgirl, though. \"Anything you want to talk about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't want to talk about your sense of being slowly changed. Instead, you said, \"Why is Christina so comfortable? At times, I think she is a real girly girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn nodded. \"The sugar and spice does that. It makes you want to act like the stereotypical girly girl. You have the urges, don't you? I bet the three of us could have real fun playing dolls right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't come here to be roped into playing with dumb dolls\" Trina muttered. Turning to you, she added, \"Plus there is the girl voice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl voice? I thought that was something that Cassie did to mess with my head\" you said, suddenly frightened. The thought of a voice telling you to progressively act and become more girly wasn't comforting, and undoubtedly was the reason why Christina was one of the girlier girls in class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no doubt she did mess with you. That's one reason you're a mental wreck. Your girl voice is still there, only she has. for some reason, remained quiet. I'm guessing she doesn't want you to mistakenly believe she is trying to override your personality\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you said, starting to freak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down cousin. You do not want to freak out...\" Trina warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She knew what she did was a risk as you had a very strong will and a high resistance to magic due to your ordeal. Still, she knew that holding back your memories was the best way to help you adapt and move on. \"At least they will be able to adapt and move on with the memories of what they went through put on the 'back burner'.\" Worried, she muttered. \"Still, I better have a plan ready in case they manage to break the magic holding those memories back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She agreed that what mom did was a big risk but she also agreed that it was a better option than you and Christina living with the trauma of your ordeals. She knocked on your door, starting you and your twin sister before entering with a slight grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" Pouting, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grumpy as ever, I see.\" Lightly teasing, Hayley said.

It's been a rough few days for you both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" Eyeing Hayley, Christina demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley sighed, knowing that mom had not erased the memories of your friends, not knowing how many people you had talked to about your ordeal. \"You two had been through a lot. So much so that you both seem to have developed a type of amnesia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am- what?\" Confused, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley smiled slightly, realizing that you and Christina were now closer to five year old levels. \"You both lost your memories.\" Simply, she said. \"You got mad at mom when she would not tell you what had happened to make your forget.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... of course we got mad!\" Stomping one foot, you protested. \"We have a right to know what had happened to us! So there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stuck your tongue out to make your point. Hayley did well to hide a grin. <i>\"College level one minute, childish the next.\"</i> Bemused, she thought. <i>\"It must be their resistance to the magic doing that.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why won't mommy tell us?\" Pouting, Christina demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have a bad dream last night?\" Softly, Hayley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question caught Christina off guard. \"Um... I don't think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley sighed. \"Before you lost your memories, you were both having nightmares bad enough to make you wake up screaming.\" Serious, she said. \"Do you really want those bad dreams to come back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Christina shook your heads, though you were both clearly frustrated. Hayley hated to keep you and your new twin sister in the dark but she hated to see you both jumping at every shadow even more. There was no better option to bring things back to somewhat normal. Her thoughts were interrupted by the gurgling sound of your complaining stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hayley, I'm hungry.\" Pouting, you said. \"When are we having breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pancakes!\" Suddenly excited, Christina shouted. \"I smell pancakes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley had to do a double take as you and Christina forgot your protests and ran passed her to the hall. She watched, bemused, as you both raced each other to the dinning room. Hayley followed them to find mom preparing small stacks of pancakes for the family to enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you two are hungry.\" Smiling, she said. \"I made a big batch this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starving, mommy!\" eyeing your plate, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm more hungry than you.\" Grabbing a fork, Christina teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are not!\" Smiling, you countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one who can't eat more than the other helps mommy with the dishes.\" Pointing to the sink, Christina challenged. \"Are you game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to lose..\" Teasing, you cautioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching you and Christina begin your eating contest, Hayley shook her head. \"A minute ago, they were pouting, tearful messes.\" Whispering, Hayley muttered. \"How do you do it, mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled. \"Despite their new age and gender, they still have their core beliefs.\" Whispering, carefully, she replied. \"The lure of good food always distracted them from anything troubling their minds.\" With a smile, she added, \"I know them better than they know themselves; they'll be just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Loss of their experience has also meant loss of their responsibility and control, leading to risk of them actually using their abilities, leading to you becoming even more worn out than you already are. Another issue I can see is Lucy. Blocking her memories will not stop her nightmares,  and losing her memories will magnify her nightmares. Better than even money that next time she is asleep, it'll be herself turning girly, or having some kind of girl's clothing burst from beneath her original clothes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are suggesting?\" mom demanded testily. \"That I suppress their magic?

If you do, Hannah becomes a boy for a week, and Lucy goes shopping with Mel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n:But mommy...\" both you and Hannah whined almost together. Five minutes later, you was dressed in the overalls, which you weren't too thrilled; too many bad memories of them bursting into a pink dress.

Without a doll in sight?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think? Go away, and why am I a boy with pigtails?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Because we're back to where we were when you was last asleep. Your core is slowly becoming Lucy, and she is extremely girly. Elvira must have seen this, as she is the only one that can force mommy into being a tomboy.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.

You saw a boy who looked like you locked in a fight with a girl who also looked like you. They both looked very angry or very desperate as they used fist, foot, tooth, and nail in their skirmish. They were shouting over each other as they locked hands in an attempt to throw the other off balance. You could not understand what they were saying but you could tell their words were not the friendliest. You tried to get closer but it was as if you were running against a very high wind; every step you took there was a force sending you a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it!\" Crying, you screamed. \"Stop fighting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour words echoed into the distance but the two did not seem to hear you.

She looked at you, very concerned as you were covered in sweat from your nightmare. Her nightmares still plagued her only it was a fear of being abandoned, not knowing she was in fact torn from her original family. She did not remember her birth parents later deciding to adopt a child, effectively abandoning her but her nightmares gave her hints of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy... are you okay?\" Whispering, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, softly crying. \"No, I'm not...\" Trembling, you whimpered. \"I can't stop the voices.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What voices?\" Fearful, Christina demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People keep talking in my head.\" Crying freely, you explained. \"They won't stop! They won't go away! They won't leave me alone!\" Crying harder, you said, \"Now I'm seeing a boy and a girl who look like me fighting and hurting each other! They won't stop fighting.... I'm sick of the fighting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou curled up into a fetal position, crying your eyes out. Christina winced as she hurried over to you, not knowing what to do to comfort you.

She followed mom into the sitting room where she and you realized mom had been entertaining some early guests.

You were talking to yourself as you wrote and Hayley stopped to listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Diary... I met the most interesting boy today. His name is Lynx; the Rich family who lives next door adopted him and his twin brother, Vinnie. They are both very nice, for boys, I mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley smiled at that.

At the same time, it feels good knowing that my sister and I are not the only ones having these bad dreams. Maybe its contagious, like a cold. I hope not; Mel's grumpy in the morning as it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley had to cover her mouth to stop a laugh and moved on before she was spotted. With a small grin on her face, she walked into her room. \"There is a lot of the John I knew in Lucy.\" Happy, she whispered. \"There is also a lot of Harry in Christina.\" She sighed. \"They may not have had the best lives as boys but they are off to a great start as girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, you and Christina met Lynx and Vinnie....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She pointed at you and Christina. \"Remember, no magic at school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not terrors!\" Pouting, Christina pointed out. \"We're angels!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes.\" Rolling her eyes, Hannah retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou responded by sticking your tongue out at Hannah, making her giggle. Mom ushered you all into the van and she drove you to school. \"Be good now, all of you.\" Waving, she said. \"I'll pick you up after school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye, mommy!\" Calling, back you said. \"I love you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too, sweetie.\" Smiling, mom said. She sighed, turning away to hide a tear. \"So another chapter of their lives begins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully now, the worst is over.\" Smiling, Hayley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"Hopefully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the school, you and Christina met up with Lynx and Vinnie who were both wearing blue jeans and a plain white shirt with tennis shoes. \"Ready for school, Lucy?\" Smiling, Lynx asked. \"Mommy told us that its our first great adventure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems boring so far.\" Wincing, you said. \"Mommy said we can't use magic here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because not everyone has it.\" Shrugging, Vinnie said. \"We're not even allowed to talk about it here, really so let's talk about something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Christina nodded in agreement and entered your class where a tall, slender woman was waiting for you and the other students. You immediately sensed magic and tried not to smile in fear of giving her or you away. \"Good morning, class.\" Kindly, she said. \"I am your teacher, Vicky Veronica or V.V. for short. It is my job to make certain you are all ready for first grade so let us get started.\" She smiled. \"Who here knows their alphabet and numbers...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day progressed, you were becoming bored. Everything the teacher was showing you and Christina you somehow already knew. You took a glance at Lynx and saw that he was a little bored as well. You wanted to speak out but you noticed that the other kids were all fascinated by what the teacher was saying. <i>\"I guess witches get taught earlier than normal people.\"</i> Wincing, you thought. <i>\"That's strange...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy.\" Startling you, Vicky called. \"Do you know the answer to this math problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the board. It was 2+4-1+3. \"Eight.\" Calmly, you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky smiled. \"Very good, Lucy.\" Kindly, she said. \"Still, please pay attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed slightly. \"Yes, ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter class, Vicky asked to speak to you and Christina. Fearing you were in trouble, you walked up to her desk. \"I really tried to pay attention, Miss Veronica.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not about that.\" Firmly but kindly, Vicky said. \"I know you sensed I have magic because i sense it in you two.\" Her face turned strict. \"I also sense you two are transformed boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think we're what?...\" Taken back, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an unnatural state!\" Frowning, Vicky snapped. \"Do not let me catch you using magic in school or anywhere else! Only true born witches deserve the right to magic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day mom picked you and Christina up to find you both...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She suspected her involvement in the test was also a test on her. She did not believe witch boys should become witches as they carried the gene to give birth to more witch girls. That, and they were blessed physically. They had a power all their own... <i>\"If the two of them were to become male again with that much magic, they would almost literally become juggernauts.\"</i> Startled, she thought. <i>\"Just like their grandfather...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Transformed boys should not have such power.\" Her voice quivering, she whispered. \"It's just not possible, even for pure witches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet, it happened.\" Calmly, Hayley said. \"I don't expect you to understand or even sympathize with the hell my sisters went through. Just do your job and let the rogue hunters watching them do theirs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Vicky was surprised. They only reason rogue hunters would be watching a young witch, pure born or transformed is if they were a candidate for the role of the Princess or next in line to be head witch. <i>\"There has not been a transformed boy as head witch in over a thousand years.\"</i> Darkly, she thought. <i>\"Also, there as never been a juggernaut witch boy before Dr. Moriarty Strange.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to realize why Elvira had placed her into the test. As the youngest and newest member of the council, she had to prove she could make the difficult choices that fall before them. The choice before her would define her as not only a witch but a member of the council.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If what you are telling me is true then I am pleased I said what I did.\" Serious, Vicky countered. \"They need to learn discipline, fast.\" Hayley opened her mouth to protest but Vicky interrupted her. \"You know as well as I do that with great power comes great responsibility. Your sisters have the potential to do a lot of good but also a lot of harm. That said, I strongly suggest your family considers...\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

You wasn't joking about your changes, and I can see Mel having nightmares herself if she saw you like this\" Hayley said as she stared at you. \"Interesting that apart from the hair, you perceive yourself as a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't funny\" you said stamping your foot rather girlishly. \"The voice did this to me and I would love to be back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">'Acting like a girl in front of our guest? Maybe you should look like one?'</span> the voice taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hayley! Help me! You can see what she is going to do. Blow her to pieces with your magic\" you pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you I'm here to gather information\" Hayley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'See? Even your sis wants a new sis. Now, change' the voice ordered. Instantly, you felt a pain in your gut, which quickly spread to the rest of your body. Fortunately it only lasted a few seconds, but by the end of it, you was fully female. Alarmed, you stared at you five year old girl body. You spun around, looking for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">'I agree, those boy's clothes don't suit you anymore. Maybe you should be a ballerina?</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna be some <span class=\"cppink\">pretty</span> ballerina\" you pouted.<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><br>\r\n\"Soon. Your little girl's mind is growing, Lucy, now that you're in your true form....'</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough\" Hayley ordered, as the black void somehow shimmered, and you suddenly found yourself back in the real world. Hayley seemed slightly stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with you?\" you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These types of spells always made me feel queasy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care. You should have helped me! I told you she is trying to get me, and see what she has done!\" you yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that your perception of yourself was corrupted, and you see the voice far worse than what she should be\" Hayley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! You're taking her side?\" you protested. \"I don't wanna become some girly girl. I'm a <span class=\"cppink\">pretty girl</span>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but it's going to happen, and soon, since I doubt even your sudden tomboyish clothes phase will help. Let me get you into something more comfortable, and call your friend, Lily\" Hayley offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was a giant; a massive, towering man with short night black hair and sharp green eyes. He looked completely out of place in his disguise but then disguises were not his strong suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTera gasped. \"Oh dear!\" Worried, she said. \"Everyone out of the building!

He frowned. \"You should know me better than this by now. I will not stand by while my family is being attacked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie sighed.

She was a tall, well dressed woman with long blond hair and wild hazel eyes. Behind her was her three sons, Hank, Ron, and Don with her only daughter, Lucy; Lu for short walking between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you again, dear sister.\" With a forced calm, Sarah said. \"It is going to be refreshing to fight you on the same side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha merely nodded. \"Sarah...\" Flatly, she responded. \"I agree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Hank, the eldest son, was Hayley's age with short blond hair and wild hazel eyes.

You bulked up when you were angry. All I have to do is paint you green\" Hayley said, bemused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we talk about something else?\" you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, John, but it's important. I'd admit, I was surprised, even though I knew it was possible. I'm just glad those two troublemakers weren't around when 'Lucy' was here. At best, Lu probably would have singed off every hair on their bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you say that?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a lot of potential.

Weren't they after the rings?\" you asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I believe they also saw you as a prize, albeit one that is highly dangerous.

She would think twice about learning or using magic if she knows it will end up in her having a twin sister that is way prettier than she is.

The little girl wasn't happy; while Anna and Mary had been captured, it was a hollow victory at best. You were even more aware of magic, despite mom's attempts to 'hide' it from Christina, and on a more personal level, things were worse for herself. The magic battle between the two witches and Hayley left a lot of magical fallout. Christina knew her hair was now more blond than rosewood, and it had started to curl slightly. Combined with the extremely girlish clothes that she was still wearing, Christina knew she was starting to look like Hannah. Or Lucy. Considering the events, she wondered if Lucy was really you, despite the fact she saw someone that looked like you come down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you coping, miss Rich?\" Elvira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think? I'm barely used to this body\" Christina moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. It is difficult to cope when you've been gender switched. Especially for those that are like yourself, though your reactions aren't abnormal. It usually takes this amount of time to get used to your new body\" Elvira said. \"Still, that isn't your main concern, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm absorbing magic, not depleting it. What is going to happen to me?\" Christina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The council will be more focused on John. While, as  you know, there were a lot of them that wanted you female for good as the price for 'trying' to use magic, even more will want to make a witch out of John. Which isn't good news for you\" Elvira said carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? What is going to happen?\" Christina said, alarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't give a definitive answer. Still, I'll see if I can find a way. At the very least, I'll make sure he doesn't know your secret. At worst, from John's point of view, you'll be Harry's cousin that tried to give him magical items and got trapped by them\" Elvira said. Without another word, she left Christina and headed for Mel's room. Mom was still there, talking to a pouting Mel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not fair, mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair or not, that is what seems to happen when boys are transformed. You transform your brother, and I promise your new sister will be curvier and bustier than you. Probably even more than Hayley. There's a reason why that Cassandra wants John as her eye candy\" mom said, somewhat tiredly. Elvira smiled; as predicted, Mel's vanity was getting the better of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natalie, I've finished my talk with Christina. She doesn't know anything about what happened\" Elvira lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good\" mom said, catching the lie. \"What about John?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The council will want to test him, unless, you're willing to allow me to test him with the princess test. It's probably the only one that will cause them to back off\" Elvira said, much to Mel's confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You turned to mom, hurt and confused, making her sigh. \"Right now, I doubt you know what you want just yet.\" Gently, she said. \"The next seven days will determine what path you take.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seven days?\" Worried, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"Within seven days, the transformation becomes permanent.\" Serious, she said. \"That is how long you have to decide what you truly desire; might or magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did the gloves fly onto to me on their own?!\" Tearfully, you demanded. \"If you didn't do that and I didn't want it to happen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can only guess it was royal attraction.\" Sadly, mom said. \"The gloves were enchanted to react to witches or witch boys with great magical potential.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do I do now?\" Sourly, you demanded. \"Try to find a castle to live in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed, catching your sarcasm. \"I suggest you start doing some serious soul searching, young lady.\" Firmly but kindly, she replied. \"Discover what path you truly wish to follow before the magic behind the princess test decides for you.

The solution is different for everyone; you are in control and you must find a way but to even begin...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \"I need to first learn how magic works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book then closed on its own and fell silent.

Your sister Mel had quickly gone to her and you could overhear her conversation although none of it you would like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Hayley, Lucy for some reason thinks she is this boy who was born in our family name John Harrison, think you can talk some sense to her?\" Mel asked.

It was something had Mel said to you earlier. You remember she had told you that no boys had been born in your family for years. Which meant that not even your cousin Tim wasn't a boy either! You couldn't believe that yet from what you had seen so far you knew it would be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \" Hayley, It's nice to see you but I am a guy named John Harrison, Not Lucy Harrison. I believe that. Yet I can't prove it. It like the male me Magically went away.\" You told her as she began to approach her. You expected her to tell you that it's not true, but oddly enough Hayley didn't exactly shy away from that possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Lucy, I don't know if it's true or not, but I would like you to tell me exactly what you remember.\" Hayley said.   You began to tell Hayley about how this situation began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" It began when I found this Magic book a warning appeared in the book and I didn't believe it to be true so I continued to read it, after that I remember a voice telling me this was punishment for not listening and then I woke up in the kitchen.\" You told Hayley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I see, so that is your story then, Well that is quite a possibility but something is off about that.\" Hayley said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"off? What exactly is off? about that? It's the truth!\" You exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I am not denying that it's just odd that no one here remembers John Harrison, meaning something else happened that you don't know of. Or couldn't possibly know of. I do have a few ideas what that might be however there is only one way to find out for sure.\" Hayley said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Finally you were getting somewhere and it seemed like Hayley had believed you, however her suggestion of something happening to you that you didn't know of was kind of odd even to you. But it did make some since after all you had no idea of how you got from your room to the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \" So what exactly are your theories?\" you asked Hayley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" A few, but none of them you would like. One is You really are Lucy, but your mind is John Harrison from another reality. Two someone has tampered with reality itself, yet somehow your former self is trying to resist it. Three you are John but something happened between the time you went from your room to the kitchen.  Aside from that there are a number of other possibilities but still you are probably wondering how any of these things are possible Correct?\" Hayley explained and then asked you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Yes, I am curious about that.\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" That is because you belong to a family of Witches and I just recently got back from training. \" Hayley said and then she produced a blue flame in her hand proving her claim.  You couldn't believe and were a bit curious about how she did it. However you were more interested in finding how to get your manhood back at this point.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Is there anyone who can help me?\" you asked Hayley.

All you know is that you were stuck as a girl because of your own curiosity. Not only that but no one of your family would remember you as a girl, or if they did they wouldn't tell you.  As far as everyone else is concerned you would have to act comfortable being a girl. Not an easy task for you, especially with three sisters. Hayley then left your room.

I knew it was a trap, yet I still grabbed it\" you growled. A mirror was inconveniently close by, and you could see your reflection.

Hence you actually screaming, and kicking her seat as she drove you to the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Behave yourself, young lady\" mom thundered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a proper explanation.

The assistant gave a nod, and left you and mom in peace, which you found extremely odd. Mom was doing all the talking, yet you were the one that supposedly wanted the dress. Horrified, mom picked out a dress and passed it to you.

Neither of us can drastically alter things, but you can slowly shift your path over time. Just be careful as you can shift things back to the previous course.

Yes, I think that suits you.\" mom snapped,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared downwards, not knowing what to say. In a more friendlier voice, mom said, \"I know you're stressed.

It quickly grew out to your shoulders. A part of you hoped that Hayley was doing a prank, a mean prank by somehow draping her own hair over you, but one painful push told you it was your own hair. Long and a different color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hayley! I know I let you get away with more than anyone else, but this has to stop. Either help me, or get out!\" you demanded, trying not to show your increasing panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its my room, John. I know this must be hard for you, but would you rather transform in front of someone that doesn't know what is happening to you? Can you imagine Mel? She would freak out, and then she would treat you like her own private doll\" Hayley reminded you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what you're going to do?\" you said humorlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or your friends. Or even worse, mom. Sis, you've got the best of the bad o ptions with me. I can tell you at least what is happening, and that cutting or dying your hair won't work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try me\" you said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" Hayley said. She picked some scissors, roughly pulled your hair into a ponytail, and crudely cut it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It cut. It's <i>hair</i>\" you said triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That magically grew out. Wait a few seconds\" Hayley said. To your horror, it suddenly grew out again, and if anything, it looked longer and girlier than before, as if whatever magic that was transforming you decided to punish you for your resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it\" you snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you. Dyes would have a similar effect. Still want to try?\" Hayley half teased, as she held a box of dye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Scowling, you said, \"It's bad enough that I'm slowly turning into a girl, I am not going to <i>dress</i> like one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom will disagree... oh\" Hayley said, surprised as she noticed her exposed clothes. Most of them were from before her disappearance, but one outfit you didn't recognise, and it was moving slightly. It was a blue skirt, and white top that reminded you of an anime girl's uniform. \"John, I'm not doing this. Get out of here. Now!\" Hayley ordered, as without warning, the skirt and a pair of knee socks flew out of the wardrobe and towards you. The instant they approached you, your boys clothes seemed to melt away, revealing your bra and panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?!\" you said, stunned with disbelief.

It doesn't care how the uniform gets onto you\" Hayley ordered as the socks and skirt wrapped themselves around your legs and waist. The only thing that prevented the top from doing the same was Hayley; she was holding it with both hands, but the top wanted to fly onto you. \"I can't hold onto it forever, John.

You backed into the hall, turning pale as you slowly shook your head. \"What is happening here?!\" Distraught, you screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned towards Hayley's room to see the blue skirt and white top fly out of Hayley's room followed by your sister yelling out, \"John, run!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou hesitated, only for a second; then turned angry. \"I don't run from bullies and i will not run from clothing, magic or otherwise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnotting your jaws in decision, you dodged the white top and leaped over the blue skirt as it flew for you and ducked into the bathroom where you grabbed a can of air freshener then ran out to your room and grabbed a lighter you used to start camp fires when you camped out with Harry on the weekends last year. Just as the clothing was circling back, you lit up the lighter and sprayed the air freshener. A stream of fire spewed out at the on coming clothing, causing them to stop dead and fly in the opposite direction. You immediately gave chase, despite Hayley warning you to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of my house, cursed clothing!\" Shooting another stream of fire, you screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caught mom's attention and she saw you, nearly completely female, chasing an enchanted uniform out of the house with a make-shift flame thrower. \"John, stop this at once!\" Firmly, she commanded. \"What are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly you were too angered by the clothing attempting to force themselves onto you to listen. \"Out! Out! Out!\" Firing another blast, you screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the clothing had fled the house and you slammed the door. \"Good riddance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed, shaking her head. \"John, I am not certain what is causing you to change or what caused that uniform to be attracted to you but I can tell you that your actions were not the best choice to make.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was self defense.\" Folding your arms, you countered. \"I was being attacked in my own home; I promised dad to protect this family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I respect that.\" Patiently, mom said. \"However, you must respect that your little flame thrower could have hit Mel or Hannah if they had turned the wrong corner at the wrong time.\" She sighed. \"I can't blame you for defending yourself but next time, call for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Stunned, you asked. \"You are a witch too?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"All of the girls in this family are witches.\" Calmly, she said. \"So will you be, once you fully become female.\" Seeing your face harden, she quickly added, \"I will get to the bottom of this, I promise. In the meantime, give me that lighter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, you surrendered the lighter, causing mom the smile. \"You did the right thing, John.\" Serious, she said. \"I will make a few calls.\" She then walked to the phone and dialed a number before sternly saying, \"You owe me and my son an explanation...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho did mom call?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Trust me, know her. I'll pay for the book and then I'll get my money book\" mom ordered. 'And Samantha's head. Who sold Harry the first book?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.. okay. Is John okay?

John-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy\" mom interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John\" Megan continued, ignoring mom, \"Asked that she could have all my old tomboyish stuff, which I kind of expected. That sparked Mel, who then said Lucy actually wanted the girly stuff. Especially pink, since she hadn't removed her dress, meaning she must have liked it. That, and her attempt at painting John's nails pink sent her John over the edge and she tried to make Mel wear one of her dresses. The last I heard was Mel saying, 'Little sis so wants to be a girl, and play with dolls. Could you bring some?' followed by 'Only because you're be using your old ones for yourself.' What are you going to do? Send them to that school you mentioned?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, though I suspect they're wasting the time they have as ten years olds. Their childish behavior means they're more than likely going to have a rude awakening tomorrow. Or at best within the week. I've got a better idea; both girls are going to share a room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure that's a good idea?\" Hayley wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure\" mom said, marching up to your room, where you and Mel was still squabbling. You had succeeded in roughly putting a pink princess style dress onto Mel, but she had tied you up, and was preparing to give you a full makeover. As soon as Mel realized mom was there, she became defensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'm just trying to teach Lucy how to...\" Mel stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head. \"Since the two of you can't get on, I'm going to make you. You're both going to share the same room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I have to share with... her?\" you and Mel said almost simultaneously, though you said it louder as you felt you had the rougher end of the deal. Undoubtedly mom would go for a pink, girlish theme (which she did), with a twin sister that cared nothing for your plight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy, I'm going to treat you like the ten year old girl that you are\" mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But..\" you stammered, feeling that you're getting punished for Mel's stupidity and incompetence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not buts, young lady. As for you...\" mom said, savagely turning onto Mel, \"Melanie, you're always making a big deal out of being the older sister. Time for you to act like it. I want this sister teasing to stop right now. You're lost far less than your sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" Mel said, as mom got to work, magically removing the dividing wall between your bedroom and Mel's. \"Hayley. You take Melanie. Megan, you take Lucy. Get them presentable\" mom ordered.</span></div></div>",

Because of her impatience to learn more magic, you were not not only the wrong gender but the wrong age as well. You were unaware that Harry had left the book in the house for Mel, not knowing the dangers involved. Mom wisely kept that quiet for the time being, knowing your fight with Mel was explosive enough. She did, however, had a word with you in private before sending you and her to bed that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curiosity is not a sin, Lucy.\" Firmly, she had said. \"Still, when a warning appears on a once blank page not to turn the next page, one usually drops the book as if it were possessed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always told me not to fear the unknown but to respect it.\" Annoyed, you countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled slightly. \"Then you should have respected the warning.\" Bemused, she said. \"Actually, you are lucky that you didn't stare at the page, wondering what would appear next. If you had, you would not be here but in a schoolgirl uniform at a special school learning magic along with your sister, Mel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid book.\" Tearing up, you muttered under your breath. \"If it were so important to keep it secret from boys, it should have had a lock on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the room, Mel laid in her own bed, unable to sleep. Unknown to you, mom also talked to her in private before bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you had a rivalry with another witch at school, you should have come to me.\" Scolding, mom had said. \"Training yourself, regardless of the reason, is not only irresponsible, it is dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean for John to find that book.\" Defending herself, Mel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps.\" Unimpressed, mom said. \"Still, you took a risk having Harry search for items and books to advance your training. What if he had changed by being in contact with those items?\" She shook her head. \"He still might change, depending upon how many of those items he kept for his personal collection of oddities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel frowned, remembering her talk with mom and looked at you, apparently asleep with your back turned to you in a separate bed on the other side of the room. \"Of all the rotten luck!\" Annoyed, she muttered under her breath. \"Harry just had to find the one magic book with a broken cover lock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both jumped as your cellphone rang. Irritated, you looked at the number; it was not one you recognized and rolled over intending to ignore it. Only the phone answered on its own and you heard a voice coming from the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, John dear.\" Sweetly, a voice said. \"I heard you had an encounter with the feminine kind.\" The voice giggled at her own joke. \"Tell me, what new name did they give you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this?\" Highly annoyed, you demanded. \"How did you get my number, how did you get my phone to answer your call?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel, hearing the feminine voice, jumped from her bed and hurried over to you. She recognized the voice as her rival, Cassie Bane from school. She intended to stop the call before Bane could answer but was not fast enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why I'm your new best friend.\" Amused, Cassie replied. \"I got your number off of your sister's notebook; the poor thing has so little brain, she simply has to write <i>everything</i> down.\" She giggled then added, \"I am Cassie Bane, a fellow witch. I used a simple spell to make your phone answer my call. I would like to talk to you about many things...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want, Bane?\" Coldly, Mel demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two are sharing a room?\" Genuinely surprised, Cassie asked. She laughed. \"Well, this is awkward. I was hoping for a private call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" Ice in your voice, you demanded. \"I'm not in a good mood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still grumpy in the morning, deary?\" Teasing, Cassie asked. \"All I want is to help you embrace your new found womanhood.\" She gave a cackle. \"Poor Melanie has not a clue though she was ironically born a girl. Such a plain, ordinary, dismal wall flower...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel turned red at Cassie's casual insults and was about to throw a few insults of her own only you surprised her by talking first. \"Listen up you smug, arrogant, pompous nobody!\" Angry, you said. \"Melanie and I might not always get along but she is <i>my</i> sister and I will not have you insult her in my presence!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you picked up a three inch heel shoe mom had earlier transformed from a pair of your tennis shoes and drove the thin heel hard onto the phone, breaking it and ending the call. Once Cassie's voice had been silenced, you turned to Mel. \"I want answers, sis!\" More concerned than annoyed, you said. \"Who is this Cassie Bane, what does she have against you, and why have you not told me about this when I was still your brother?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She totally thought it would be so funny to do it during school hours and send poor 'Michelle' back to kindergarten. I caught her as Michelle was transforming.

After a couple of minutes, she shrugged, and continued to get ready for school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                         ..............................<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meanwhile, Cassie walked in, smirking at her transformed brother, turned five year old sister. \"Did you sleep well?\" Cassie asked, smirking at Michelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Turn me back right now!\" Michelle demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? You're much cuter like this\" Cassie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have school\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already thought of that\" Cassie said, producing a girl's school uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't go to school like this!\" Michelle protested as Cassie magically transferred the uniform onto her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you will. Who was you calling?\" Cassie demanded, her voice turning icy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A friend\" Michelle said, relieved that Cassie couldn't find who she called. Hannah's number was completely wiped from the system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie's eyes narrowed. \"You're trying to make friends? Good girl. Maybe you'll ask me to keep you like this. Who is your friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle defiantly remained silent, much to Cassie's anger. After a minute, Cassie said, \"Have it your way, Shelly. I'll make you some friends. Starting with that airheaded bimbo and her cute little sister. They should be almost your age by now, and if not, I can always give them a hand. Then I'd have to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll get caught eventually. I... I'll tell\" Michelle said, not wanting to hear her sister's schemes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie gave Michelle a shark like grin. \"Do that, and you'll be Michelle forever.

You didn't want to be anywhere; mom wouldn't keep you home unless she had a reason, and going to school as a girl was one thing you wasn't looking forward to. After all, the threat of Mel regressing to ten wasn't enough to keep her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But some weird girl called me and wanted to meet with me\" Hannah said, remembering her short conversation with Michelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" mom demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All she said was she needed help.

I'd would totally assume it's from the same source\" Mel said nodding. So did Hayley, who overheard your whispered conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree with the twins.

Then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie stopped, as she felt Hayley's grip on her right arm. \"Get away from my sister\" Hayley hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going. Come on, Michelle\" Cassie ordered, making a reluctant Michelle walk away. As soon as she was gone, Hayley pulled you aside and said, \"What did that bitch say? Did she do any rhyming, or anything that sounded like a curse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. \"No. She insulted Mel, mocked what happened to me, and was trying to get inside my head. Hayley, can we go now? I don't feel safe with that lunatic around.\"</span></div></div>",

I know you like keeping 'Michelle' around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't trapped this place\" Cassie protested, though you caught a strange look on her face that told you she wished she had. \"I have my own issues, and I don't need to add any more complications with some brainless little girl.\" The second Cassie said 'little girl', Mel started to shrink...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel!\" you screamed, seeing your now younger sister. Already the implications had hit you. If she's younger, it means you'll change too. Turning to Cassie, you snapped, \"What did you do to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing\" Cassie replied, though you could see she was clearly enjoying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Mel just shrinks at the appropriate moment\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know of... the standard safety features needed around a impatient, brainless airhead like that little girl. She did it to herself\" Cassie smirked.</span></div></div>",

You did not notice the flame but you did smile seeing yourself grow back a few inches. Cassie noticed the flame and took a quick step back, looking startled. Mom, who had also noticed the flame rose her hands to keep you of your sister from advancing. \"I suggest you leave, quickly.\" Sternly, she said. \"Unless, of course, you want to trigger something that hasn't happened in over a thousand years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie was no longer smirking; she instead looked terrified. Her face had lost all color as she quickly backed away to the window and vanished from the room. Once she was gone, she pushed your hand closed before you could notice the flame. She then blocked your view of Mel with her own body and pointed. You heard Mel give out a screech of fright before mom whispered something to her and walked towards the door, muttering to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that all about?\" Confused, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to Mel who seemed shaken. She gave you a nervous giggle then fell silent. Now you were even more confused and turned to mom only to see her shake her head. \"Remember that potential I said you had as a girl?\" Annoyed, she asked. You nodded and she said, \"Cassie's arrogance just brought you closer to that and I have a feeling a lot of witches will be wanting to talk to her very soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, she walked out of your room, closing the door behind her. You thought about what mom said and it was unnerving. \"Do you have any idea what mom is talking about?\" Worried, you asked Mel. \"I need to know; she's starting to scare me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel winced. \"Mom just told me not to let you near any more magic.\" Nervous, she whispered. \"That's all I know... honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, frustrated. Inside her study, mom sat down, giving out a frustrated sigh of her own. \"Only girls of royal blood can be head witch.\" Quoting witch law, she muttered. \"However, a 'prince' turned girl against his will is automatically first in line to be head witch...\" She paused then finished, \"But only if 'she' wants the job.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The job offer still stands, and there is some time for you to consider\" mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go for it sis, you saw what happened. Cassie almost peed herself and you grew\" Mel urged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are some things about being the Princess that you don't know about, and that I'm certain Lucy will not like\" Hayley countered, scolding Mel. \"Besides, it's no guarantee that taking this role will age her, and hence you, a single minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're saying I'd still be a kid in a fancy dress. The downside is a dress, right?\" you said sourly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd already be in line for the dress treatment. I bet mom has dozens she would love to dress you in.

Forester took it, and although it's guarded, she has turned it into a trap for the foolish in that house of horrors or hers\" mom spat out. Without another word, she walked out and returned five minutes later holding a small wooden chest. She opened it, and to your surprise, pulled out a Cinderella costume. You paled at the sight of the blue gown, not wanting to look anything like Hannah's favorite princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so not the gown, mom\" Mel said, whilst you remained stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is\" Hayley said. \"Why do you think I said she wouldn't like it, and that we are short one sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen enough\" you said quietly. \"Put that thing away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only a girl of royal witch blood can be head witch but a <i>prince</i> of royal witch blood changed into a girl against his will is automatically first in line to the throne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then the dress is to see if I was changed against my will or if it was due to my curiosity when I found that magic book.\" Sourly, you said. \"Cute...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would rather you put the dress on willingly and get the test over with.\" Honestly, mom said. \"Once we determine where you stand, we will have a better idea as to how to move forward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, not liking the idea of putting on any dress at all.

I manipulated him into getting far away from here to ensure his safety, as well as to limit any unwanted transformations to either him, or to you. Natalie not informed of my actions, so don't blame her for getting you in a panic.<br>\r\nElvira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPS. I hope whoever broke in found my little trap that I left.

I bet mom would do it anyway regardless of what happened, and forcing Megan to do it is a way to pacify me\" you replied. \"Tim would be too scared of me; he would annoy you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever\" Mel said irritably, clearly showing she wasn't interested in talking anymore. \"Don't wake me up with your nightmares, or I am so going to give that makeover myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why would that matter? You are going to change him back?\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not entirely sure, but he will freak out at the sight of <i>her</i> new body. Tim needs to learn magic is not a toy\" Catherine said, waving her hands. That motion seemed to have an effect, as Tim stopped swinging her legs girlishly, and stared down at her dress cladded body. A second later, she gave an ear piercing scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm a girl?! Ew! Gross. Get this off me!\" Tim stammered in an extremely disjointed manner. She leapt off her chair, and stared to grab her dress, almost like she was hoping to rub away her change. It was the most uncomfortable thing you've ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is she doing?\" Hayley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim heard it and angrily said, \"What do you think? You turned me into one of you! Turn me back! I want... You! You did this to me!\" Tim wailed, her eyes locking with yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy did nothing, and you know it. You did this to yourself, young lady. You used magic potions to make your hair grow in an attempt to get Hannah into trouble, only to pick the wrong one. You're lucky that it isn't permanent' Catherine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight relieved look flickered on Tim's troubled face. \"Please mommy, get cootie brain to turn me back..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. You used magic as a toy, so I'm keeping you like this. Now be a good girl, and go play with Melanie and Hannah. They'll be coming to investigate the scream\" Catherine ordered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, mommy...\" Tim protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Immediate problem?\" you half spat out, not liking what was happening. Although Tim had been snapped out of her girlish mindset, she was still in a girl. Both you and Mel were little girls, and worse, Mel had the mindset of one. You wanted all of it to go away, to be as it was before you discovered that book, and before it really started messing with your mind and sanity. Your younger, feminine body really weirded you out, but from mom and Catherine's mannerisms, you guessed they weren't going to set things right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The problem is you have no control of your powers, and you're unused to your new life\" mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you could...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been over this dozens of times already, Lucy. You're completely female now, and there is no way to alter that\" mom snapped testily. \"All this shows is that you are unable to deal with your situation and that I must intervene.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do to me?\" you gulped fearfully, as mom produced a necklace. It was pretty, but very girly, with a colorless pendant hanging from the chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will block your magic, and help your girlish mindset to further take root and grow\" mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping even more, you looked around for an escape. This was quickly becoming a nightmare, not only because of what mom (and Catherine) were trying to do to you, but because this was outside their normal behavior. The reactions of the only other people in the room were mixed. Hayley looked surprised, but oddly steeled as if she heard of such things, but Tim looked terrified, as if she wondered she would be next...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mom got it around your neck with ease. The effects were almost immediate, calming you down and making you feel a lot more at ease with your new form. Catherine felt this and relaxes her grip on you, allowing you to stand. You think for a second, trying to understand the changes the necklace had on you. You don't feel any desire to play dress up or play with dolls, but the thought of doing that doesn't fill you with dread and distain either. You felt neutral to it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom looked at you with concern. \"You okay, sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, being called sweetie didn't bother you the way it used to. In fact, it felt kind of nice. You nod slowly. \"I think so, Mom.\" You smile. \"Thanks for the necklace. I feel much calmer now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim's eyes widened. \"You have cooties now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flash an angry look at him. \"No! I'm just not scared of little girls like you are!\" You pause for a second and then smile. \"Hey, Mom. I just got angry and nothing happened. I JUST GOT ANGRY AND NOTHING HAPPENED!!!!\" You jumped up and down excitedly and hugged Mom, happy that the chaos your magic brought on wasn't still going. Catherine smiled, but ushered Tim and Hayley out of the room. This was a time for you and Mom and Tim, especially would have been a distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled as you hugged her. \"That's great, Lucy. You see why this had to be done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"Yeah, I get it. I'm sorry I wasn't listening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head. \"Don't be sorry. I can't imagine how scary this all has been for you. But that's what this necklace will help with. You don't have to be scared, you can open your mind to everything that is happening without the prejudices of a 13 year old boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" you asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you think of that color?\" she pointed to the powder blue dress you were wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pretty,\" you answered with a shrug, not sure what her point was. \"I really like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom grinned. \"Of course you do. Did you like it before you wore the necklace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused as you thought about it. \"I think I did, but I would never have admitted it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. You spent 13 years as a boy being told that there were certain things you weren't supposed to like. You wouldn't let yourself like them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and nodded, getting it now. It was kind of cool when you thought about it that way. \"Oh yeah. I see. That's awesome.\" You felt so glad not to feel angry and frustrated about your new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now, you'll be open to explore this new chapter in your life and really see who you want to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if I start wanting to do ballet or playing with dolls?...\" you started to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom finished your thought. \"...Then, it will be because you really enjoy doing those things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded it was a lot to take in. \"What about my powers? I want to learn to control them.\" The thought of being a witch seemed a little exciting now. Honestly, given the option between your powers and going back to your old self, you weren't sure what you'd choose. Magic powers almost made being a little girl worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom paused. \"We'll have to see. I want you too, but we can't have any chaos like before. We'll have to wait until you are comfortable enough with your new body before we allow you access to your magic again.\" You nodded as it made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand. So you want me to explore being a girl, first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Mom said softly, not sure how you'd react to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged. \"Sure. Sounds like fun.\" It really did. How many boys got to see the other side after all? This was an adventure. The necklace really was taking away the terror of it all. \"So what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom thought for a minute. \"Well, I suppose you could go play with your sisters? Or we could have Catherine watch them for a few hours while you and I go off and have some time together. Not everyday I have a new daughter, after all.\" You grin. Both option sounded kind of fun and after so much time of being angry and frustrated in your new body, you were overdue for some fun.</span></div></div>",

You knew that Aunt Samantha had a bad reputation both in the family and in town but she was an expert in the strange and unusual. Harry was one of her best customers and you had not seen or heard anything bad happening to him. Finally, you decided to go see her at the mall.

She's six, but before she decided to fight this rouge witch, she was a sixteen year old boy\" Robyn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My God\" you gasped, horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. That said, she had taken to magic and one of the head witch's favorites. Anyway, it's best that we head to our room. The others would still be in their various classes and it would be best for you to settle in. Unless you would prefer a tour of the grounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't answer, but Paula took it as acceptance that you wanted to go somewhere private. She quickly walked off, resulting in you somewhat reluctantly following her. \"Okay, there's four of us currently here. I've told you about Robyn and my sister, Jacinta. The forth is a girl. Angel. Try not to freak out by the dorm as we have taken somewhat a gallow's humor to our situation at times. Least some of us. Jacinta is having a very hard time dealing with all this. Plus, don't freak out if you see a mirror. You've changed during our walk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you gasped, before covering your mouth.  Your voice had changed, to higher pitched. more melodious girls' voice. Worried, you looked down and saw... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To your horror, the lumps grew without warning, doubling in size to a b cup, and filling the bra that you were wearing. \"How big are these things going to get?\" All the women in your family were early bloomers and quite busty. Already your new breasts were bigger than Mel's, which you knew your twin wouldn't like all that much.

It was feminine, but that wasn't what made you grown. The fact you had also started to grow feminine curves made you groan, Just from taking a few steps, you knew your hips had become wider, and that you butt was starting to grow out, certainly taking on a bubble shape. Worse of all, there were significantly less pressure on the front of your panties, indicating that you were becoming a girl down there as well.

Opening your eyes, you were shocked to see that you were in a girl's dorm. <i>That was just a dream. Wasn't it?</i> You looked down to your hands and saw a pair of slender, girlish hands with pink fingernails. Just as bad, you saw in your peripheral vision two breasts, which was cupped with a pink bra, poking out in your chest. Immediately, you screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you're awake\" a voice said. It was a little girl wearing a white blouse and green skirt.

For some reason, Robyn found your outburst highly amusing, and started to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, you've got a meeting with her in forty five minutes. Get ready\" the little girl said. You glared at her. but you knew Robyn was right in saying you needed a shower. As you striped off your underwear, you saw that you definitely were a girl. \"Damn it\" you moaned despairingly trying not to look at your crotch. The shower wasn't too much better. Although the water was hot, the water felt strange on your softer skin. You were almost glad to put on a fresh pair of panties and a bra, which mercifully were plain and white. Your desire to confront this head witch and teach her a lesson overcame your distaste and generally unwillingness to wear a skirt, resulting in you being fully dressed within five minutes of your shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I thought you'd take longer\" Robyn said as you walked back into the main area of the dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just to make myself clear, I'm not happy that I'm dressed as some schoolgirl.

It was steady, and seemingly harmless, but seeing a flame shooting out of your hand scared you more than anything that had happened to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flame test. The sign of a witch. Close your hand, and it will go out\" Elvira said gently.

As for your twin, I don't know whether she left the book out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" you said as another surge of anger swept through you. Mercifully, you flame didn't reignite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Mel did it, it would had been out of carelessness, not a desire to have a so called true twin, but there are several other possibilities. You know how Hannah is good sneaking. She could have seen the book, and since she doesn't know what it does....\" Elvira warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I get it? Who else could have done this to me? Mom? Does she want an all girl family?\" you hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Natalie wanted that, she would have changed you openly like Jacinta. I think Tim must had gotten his hands on the book.

The idea that you girl taunting cousin could have done this to you angered you more than the idea of Mel possibly having done the deed, and learning that the creepy woman at the mall was a witch shook you badly. \"When will you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In about ten minutes. In the meantime, there are a few things I need to tell you. Like I said, you're biologically female now, and  you can get pregnant.....\" Elvira said, as she started to give you the talk, much to your extreme embarrassment and discomfort.<br>\r\nIt ended ten minutes later, and Elvira gave a thin smile as she saw the message that had flashed onto her study's computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yes, the more you use magic, the more you will be tempted to keep it and that requires you remaining a girl.\" She sighed. \"However, if your will is strong enough, you can learn enough magic to change yourself back into a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pouted. \" Only the temptation to use magic will still be there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira again nodded. \"Correct. Eventually, the temptation will get the best of you; each time it does, your chances of regaining your male state becomes less and less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly sat down onto a chair, covering your face with your hands. \"All of this because of a book...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira rose from her seat behind her desk and approached you with a bemused smile. \"You might not believe this now but you were lucky it happened this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shot your head up at Elvira but paused, realizing what she was referring to. \"You mean I could have been changed by mom or one of my sisters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira touched your shoulder with her slender hand. \"It would have been harder on you if it had happened that way as your trust in them would have been strained.\" She smiled again. \"This way, there is no one to blame other than your own curiosity.

Tim was your  seven year old cousin, and just as much a pain as Hannah. Where Hannah was excessively girly, Tim was excessively girl taunting. While most kids his age feared and thought the opposite gender were alien life forms, Tim took it to the next level. The other thing about Tim was that he was smart; his taunts, while childish, annoying, and tiresome, were actually well thought out and somewhat clever.

The best way I could deal with this is the classic 'were-girl' curse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The what?\" you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what a werewolf is? Same principle, except turns into a girl. Two other significant differences; the first is that the transformation happens every night, and that the curse isn't transmittal. Tim could bite anyone he wants, and it won't change anyone\" Elvira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted to strangle him, Lucy. If you managed that urge, you would've been tempted to put a curse on him yourself. You've more powerful than you realize, and I would not want to punish you for permanently changing your cousin into a girl just because he did it to you. Tim will be perfectly his, or rather her normal self in girl form, and would hopefully see girls aren't the horrors he perceived us to be. I will be warning him of this curse before the initial transformation, and necessary way to break the curse should he desire it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I going with you?' you asked in  a way that meant you demanded that she took you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Lucy.

There is no choice for you, young lady. Sometimes all we can do is try to fix the pieces\" Clara said in an annoyed voice. You pictured her focusing her attention not onto Paula or her troubled sister, but rather, you.

Once you graduate from here, you can either be an active witch or a 'normal' teenage girl marching into womanhood.\" She sighed, releasing her frustrations with you. \"Does it really matter what gender you are, child? I would think that all that really matters is what lies within.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused you to think for a moment before a tiny smile formed onto your face. Elvira smiled with you, glad that she had finally chipped away at least a piece of your wall of stubbornness. \"Think it over, Lucy.\" More softly, she said. \"Once you really begin to discover magic, you will find your situation less of a curse and more of a blessing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she walked you out and had a prefect escort you back to your dorm.

She sighed but remained silent for the time being as she listened to you rant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Hayley...\" Fuming, you muttered. \"I won't be a girl forever, she and grandma can forget it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Denial.\" Whispering, Jacinta muttered. She shook her head. \"Stage one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely hear her, you were too angry with your entire situation. Jacinta watched you grab your spare uniform, which Hayley fortunately did not touch, and stormed into the bathroom, slamming the door, shaking the walls of the room. Inside the bathroom, you stripped out of the cheer uniform and saw your lingerie clad body in the mirror. You noticed right away that you had a body that most teen models would kill for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kristy Hart, that queen bitch captain of the cheer squad at my <i>normal</i> school would be insanely jealous of me.\" Ruefully, you muttered. \"Not that I wanted any of this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you punched the mirror full force with your fist, breaking it. Fortunately, you were holding your cheer uniform so you did not cut your hand. Only, in your dorm, Jacinta again shook her head, hearing the crash of you punching the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anger.\" Tearing up, she whispered. \"That's stage two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou came out of the bathroom, grabbed the dorm phone, which everyone had to share, and stormed back into the bathroom, closing the door. Jacinta sobbed slightly, hearing you begging to mom to be brought back home, promising a number of things in return to just being 'John' again. Jacinta sighed, again shaking her head. \"Bargaining. That's stage three.\" She sighed then sarcastically muttered, \"Yeah, I got far with that one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then winced, hearing you crying and bawling in the bathroom. \"That's stage four.\" Tearfully, she said. \"Depression; that's where I am right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to a letter she had received that day, Jacinta freely began to cry. It was a formal letter from the witch courts, concerning her and Paula's mother. It read....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>To Jacinta and Paula,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother has been found guilty of permanently changing you into a girl and a witch for life. As such, she has been deemed a threat to both you and your new sister, Paula. As such, she will be stripped of her powers permanently and you will both be placed in the custody of the witch council until a new witch family can be found to take over your care. Paula will still have the choice to return to his male state at the end of the year if the twin factor does not trigger a permanent change before graduation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSincerely, Maria Collins.<br>\r\nHead Speaker of the Witch Council.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacinta placed the letter down then buried her face into her hands, crying herself. \"You lost your manhood, Lucy.\" Crying, she wailed. \"I lost everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to her, you had stepped out of the bathroom and heard her. The anger you had felt before fell to guilt as you watched Jacinta crying her eyes out into her pillow....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Cheerleaders, Jacinta\" you snapped. \"Do you know what is wrong that that girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacinta paused and stared at your face, wondering whether to open up. Finally she said, \"I can't believe how feminine she has become. She was transformed only a couple of days after that... monster got me.

Are you lying to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What to you think? Search your feelings.. Oh god, It like I'm quoting Star Wars or something\" you said, earning a half giggle from Jacinta.

Still, I know what you meant. Although these things on my chest isn't as big as yours, it still felt strange\" Jacinta said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n:Okay...\" you said, unsure what to make of it. Either she saw you as an attractive girl, or she was acting girlish herself.  As a distraction, you asked, \"So do you have a girlfriend?\" Instantly, you regretted it, hoping you didn't go too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" Jacinta said with a sour expression. \"What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that you had to provide some sort of an answer, you said, \"I haven't exactly asked her out, but I like this girl from class. Known her all my life. Guess she is the reason my evil witch of a sister tricked me into the cheer class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this girl is a cheerleader? Ouch\" Jacinta said, sympathetically as she eyed your lingerie clad body. \"You'd better get something on before the others come back. I don't want them getting the wrong idea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?

It's like my body is repulsed...\" Jacinta wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God.... Take off your shirt\" you ordered. You had no doubts that even though Jacinta identified herself as a guy, her body was totally feminine. You were worried that the same were happening to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No\" Jacinta protested. Jacinta was an average looking girl at best, and she was extremely shy about revealing any more of it than absolutely necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You owe me, this. I need to see if the same is happening to me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly and uncomfortably, Jacinta took the third option and leaned over and gave you a kiss. After a couple of seconds, you broke it off.

Only you can change yourself back as it takes both magic and will to make it work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I guess that makes sense.\" Wincing, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiled. \"It is not the fact you became a girl that is the real issue, John.\" Softly, she said. \"It's the fact you lost your powers and were offered a power you know nothing about.\" She paused then asked, \"Would you like to know why you are really here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded as the question had plagued your mind since you were sent to the school. \"Okay, aunt Sarah; I'll bite.\" Frowning, you said. \"Why am I really here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The boy of a witch family is sort of an early warning system and a guardian against normal threats such as burglars or bullies.\" Serious, Sarah said. \"An intruding witch will change that boy into a girl to disorient her and possibly use her as a shield as she would not know magic. She then would try to change any young witches into boys as they would not know how to use their physical powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused you to think. \"So boys and girls have to learn how to use the powers of both genders?\" Taken back, you asked. \"That's messed up, aunt Sarah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps but it helps to keep a witch family safe.\" Serious, Sarah said. \"No one wants to see you permanently changed because it is the boys who carry the witch gene.\" She then smiled as she ruffed up your hair and added, \"So, do try not to be so bull headed and just learn magic. You will have the chance to change yourself back, if you really want to, upon graduation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled slightly then asked. \"Why wasn't this explained to me like this earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't read the school literature.\" Lightly scolding, Sarah replied. \"It is all there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused you to blush brightly as Hayley was smiling in the background. <i>\"You got to love aunt Sarah.\"</i> Bemused, she thought. <i>\"She can talk an Eskimo into buying an ice machine.\"</i> She then asked out loud, \"Are you ready to go back to your dorm, sis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to Hayley, still blushing. \"Yeah, I'm ready.\" Timidly, you said. \"Sorry for the trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley giggled. \"You are nothing compared to a few transformed boys I met in my year here.\" Smiling, she said. \"One of them literally tried to escape by jumping from one rooftop to another and ended up falling through the roof into Elvira's office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced at that as it was your plan to do that as well. \"That had to have been awkward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley shook her head. \"Come on, sis.\" Calmly, she said. \"I'll teach you how to heighten your senses with magic so you don't go completely insane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hayley escorted you back to your dorm, talking about magic, Sarah took a cell phone out of her pocket and dialed a number. \"I got Lucy to calm down and go back to her dorm, Elvira.\" Smiling, she said. \"She may try to cram her studies to graduate early though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other line, Elvira sighed. \"She's almost as bad as 'Jackie' was.\" Weary, she said. \"Thank you for the help, Sarah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiled. \"Not a problem, Elvira.\" Calmly, she said. \"With some <i>girls</i> its just a matter of pushing the right buttons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on, your teacher, Lucy gave a bemused smile seeing you...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While it meant you'd get a mall trip, you knew it wouldn't leave you as open to getting something super girly compared to saying you had lost luggage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's rough\" Megan said, sympathetically. \"Have you got anything to wear?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really\" you said. \"Guess I'm going to have to go to the mall to get some new stuff. Hayley, when I'm going to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think mom is going to take you to the mall tomorrow, Joanie\" Hayley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not now?\" you asked, hoping to prevent your room from being torn apart. Even if you could manipulate one of them to take you, you knew it would be enough to wreck Hayley's plans. Plus you hated the idea of having mom buying your outfits for the next six months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't take you, Joanie, because I need to get your new room ready for you. I need to push all the furniture away from the walls so they can be repainted. It should dry fairly quick\" Hayley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay with being in this room, Hayley\" you said, uncomfortably staring at her. You knew that the only paint Hayley had was a light pink paint that was recently used for Hannah's room. Both Megan and Harry knew it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it's quite her style, Hayley\" Harry warned as he eyed you pouting. Neither he or Megan saw that Hayley had teleported in the paint cans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but could you imagine John's reaction? I've already got the paint. Think mom placed them in here\" Hayley said with a slight laugh. That seemed to settle things, and you helplessly watched as your bedroom walls were painted a light pink. The thing that made it worse, was the eagerness of both Megan and Harry. It was almost a relief when they left, though you knew that over the weekend, they'd be back to finish off the job.</span></div></div>",

Upon nearing the sitting room, you saw mom in the hall and hurried over to her to complain about Hayley's actions. Only she hushed you quiet and pointed into the sitting room. Curious, you peered in to see Mel looking into the same magic book you had found earlier. There was a hint of excitement in her smile as she read through the pages, making you feel nervous. Mom quietly ushered you into the next room and knelt down to your level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this to me?\" Pouting, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not doing this to hurt you.\" Firmly, mom said. \"I'm sure Hayley explained some of this to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said that magic was addictive and opening the book would have made me her sister for life.\" Sourly, you said. \"Still, she doesn't have to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Change John's room?\" Interrupting you, mom asked. She giggled slightly. \"Actually, yes. She does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Frustrated, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic is a powerful and useful tool in the hands of a <i>trained</i> witch.\" Patiently, mom explained. You noticed she emphasized the word 'trained'. \"However, in the hands of an untrained witch, it can be a dangerous force.\" She smiled flatly. \"Mel tends to be overly bossy when offered any authoritative power. She would be tempted to toy with John... <i>if</i> he were here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened slightly. \"You're hiding me from her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel needs to be trained but its not necessary to send her away with two trained witches to guide her.\" Softly, mom said. \"However, temptations will slow down that training. As Hannah and Joanie are too young to know magic, she is forbidden to reveal it to either one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I have to hide in plain sight until Mel is trained?\" Worried, you asked. \"Perfect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bit more complicated than that.\" Grinning, mom said. \"You also have to fool everyone into believing you are our visiting cousin, Joanie.\" Her smile vanished. \"If you think your current situation is bad, consider Mel trying to change you back to normal. Worse, toy with you with a lack of proper training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped, imagining the possibilities, none were pretty. \"Just six months?\" Wincing, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"I know it won't be easy, Joanie. However, it is better than the alternative.\" She rose to her feet and offered her hand. \"Come along now. It's time for dinner.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Many of them are still in style.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shyly smiled at your friend and eyed the box nervously. Megan was as much a princess as Hannah was when she was around seven. Mom smiled kindly and accepted the box. \"Thank you, dear.\" Sweetly, she said. \"That was very thoughtful of you.\" She turned to you, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rewarded Megan with a shy smile, though you felt like screaming. \"Thank you, Megan... You didn't have to go though all the trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no trouble at all.\" Genuinely happy, Megan replied. \"These clothes are not exactly tomboyish but there is no harm in looking pretty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree completely.\" Smiling, mom said. \"I was about to have that discussion with Joanie over dinner.\" She gave you a discrete wink. \"It won't hurt you to be more feminine every now and then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Megan had left, mom began to pull out the clothes. As you feared, they were mostly skirts and dresses with white tights, a few pairs of mary janes, and an assortment of frilly undergarments. Sighing, you commented, \"She has a good heart...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"Yes, she does.\" Softly, she replied. \"John is lucky to have her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at that but instantly panicked, blushing brightly as mom pulled out a schoolgirl uniform. \"You aren't going to send me to school, are you? I'm on 'vacation'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled. \"Nice try, young lady.\" Amused, she said.\"You are going to school tomorrow; its all a part of the experience and besides, I can't play favorites.\" She then called everyone to the dinning room and added, \"Remember to stay in character, Joanie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater the next day...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Worse, there had been significant changes since you'd went to sleep. Before, the only thing that had been done was the pink painting of your room. Now, it was decorated, with posters of princesses. Even your bed now had a pink, princess theme, though the actual bed frame itself was still normal. You were so stunned, you didn't, at first, notice Hayley watching you, looking pleased with herself, and a very tired looking Mel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to my room?\" you said to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We thought we'd pretty it up for you\" Hayley said, causing you to jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\" you stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We continued to do some renovations while you were asleep\" Hayley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I see\" you said, knowing exactly what would had happened. Hayley had given Mel a magic lesson whilst you were sleeping, but made sure it was something that was possible. That said, you had no idea how much of it was Mel's doing, as both seemed  to want to girlify you a bit. \"Can you leave me to get ready.

You then saw the teacher, a short, plump woman approaching you and mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I'm doing this!\" Hissing under your breath, you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its better than sulking at home all day.\" Whispering, mom replied. \"At least here, you'll be kept busy.\" She giggled, adding, \"And out of mischief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this little cutie?\" Smiling, the teacher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my niece, Joanie Harrison.\" Returning the smile, mom replied. \"She's a bit of a tomboy; I'm trying to get her to come out of her shell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher giggled, making you blush more. \"Well, I'm Deedee Vane.\" Kneeling to your level, she said. \"Everyone calls me De.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shyly smiled, though you felt like screaming. \"Hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see you are a little shy.\" Maintaining her smile, De said. \"Don't worry, once you get used to wearing a dress, you'll see its not such a big deal. It's looks very pretty on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced slightly. \"Um... thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can see Joanie is in good hands here.\" Grinning, mom said. \"I will pick you up after school, Joanie; be a good little girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled and walked out, leaving you with the kindergarten class. It was not as bad as you had originally feared. De acknowledged that you were surprisingly intelligent for your age. Fortunately, you stayed in character, leading her to believe you were not emotionally ready to skip any classes. The last thing you wanted was to end up a tiny girl in high school; you knew how mean students could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it came time for recess. The kindergarten class was kept removed from the higher classes but it did not stop some students to come over and visit during their lunch.

They were all girls, as at your supposed age, none of the boys wanted to play with you. They were the more physical ones, preferring to jump rope, and you saw it as the least bad option. You certainly didn't want to spend your break talking whatever little girls talked about, or playing with dolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, miss grumpy\" Hayley teased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, you walked towards your sister to somewhere quiet, and out of hearing range of the others. \"Why are you really here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, Joanie. I wanted to see if you're okay. I thought you might have blown your top by now\" Hayley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't even though this is so boring.

If I'm going to be stuck here, I'm going to be a tomboy and keep to myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley raised her hands defensively. \"Okay. I get it. You feel awkward. I'll leave you in peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on after kindergarten had ended for the day, you were picked up by mom. \"Aren't you going to drive the girls?\" you asked, surprised that you were the only passenger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hayley told me about kindergarten. I got you a present in the bag\" mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What bag....\" you said as a brown bag materialized next to your booster seat. \"I see.

You turned to Mel who gave you a kind smile. \"Maybe mom will help you make a new doll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou forced a smile. \"Maybe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Hannah returned with mom in tow. She looked at you with a bemused look on her face. \"Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry no one wished you happy birthday yesterday.\" Expertly hiding a grin, she said. \"I can imagine how hard it must be for you not to have your favorite dolly with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed, knowing mom was going to play this for all its worth. \"Yeah, well... its just a birthday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled, knowing your real birthday was only days away. \"Nonsense!\" Grinning, she said. \"Melanie will be celebrating her thirteenth birthday this coming Saturday so we will have a late celebration for you as well to make up for the oversight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really don't have to, aunt Natalie.\" Blushing, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, its the least I can do for my beautiful niece.\" Gushing, mom said. \"Maybe you'll get a few new dolls to play with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a nervous giggle. <i>\"Staying in character is not going to be easy.\"</i> Sighing, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While you weren't looking forward to the weekend as it meant that the Hayley would finish what she had started and remainder of your room would be girlified, you were looking forward to getting home, away from the other little girls who wanted to play with you, and out of the dress that mom had placed you into. Masquerading as your non existent, tomboy five year old cousin sucked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad that kindergarten is over, Joanie?\" mom asked as soon as you reached her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, aunt Natalie\" you said, pleased that only Hannah was around. While your little sister was still extremely annoying, trying to introduce you to more girlish things, and trying to get you to reconsider the fact you wanted to do gymnastics instead of ballet, her presence meant mom couldn't do any magic. For some reason, Hannah was pouting in her booster seat, like if something bad had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with her?\" you asked as mom strapped you into a booster seat or your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore mom could answer, Hannah blurted out. \"Timmy the toad is coming\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you said, but mom lightly chided Hannah, \"I know you don't like him, but you shouldn't call him that, Hannah. Joanie, but you're going to be introduced to the rest of the family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you like him? Is he the only other one? Will  Melanie and Hayley be around?\" you asked, trying to stay in character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Hannah cut in. \"Timmy calls me princess cootiehead. He's the gross one!\" Hannah whined, which caused you to smile slightly, which fortunately Hannah didn't see. \"He also has this disgusting frog that he carries around and likes to put it on my dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has a frog? Nice\" you said, trying to reinforce the idea of Joanie being a tomboy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled to herself, as she decided to step in. \"Tim isn't your only cousin, Joanie. There's Brooke. She's ten and I think you're going to like her. As for Mel and Hayley, they're currently at the mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat silently, knowing that Mel and Hayley were either playing with magic to get you the most girlish gift they could or actually doing it for real. After ten minutes, you were back home, but somehow, your aunt Catherine, and her two kids had somehow beat you home.</span></div></div>",

Only they did not have any children that you were aware of. Of course, you had not seem or heard from either of them in over five years so it was plausible. That was what you had based your cover story on.

He moved to touch your face but you saw that his hands were coated with mud and dodged him with an elegant turn, moving your arms to avoid his grasp. All the while, you were grinning at him. \"It is not polite to touch a lady without her permission, cousin Tim.\" Sternly, you stated. \"Besides, your hands are filthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah, who was standing behind you smiled excitedly. \"Joanie, you just performed all five foot and arm positions beautifully!\" Happily, she yelled. \"You <i>do</i> know ballet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed horribly as mom and Catherine giggled. Hannah ran up to you, ignoring Tim. She in fact almost bowled him over in her haste to get to you. \"Hey!\" Protesting, he yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why won't you try it?\" Pouting, she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy made me learn.\" Pouting back you countered. \"It's not me. I prefer gymnastics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't like ballet?\" Surprised, Tim asked. He chuckled. \"Maybe there is hope for you yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this... boy have a mute button?\" Irritated, you blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA familiar voice giggled and you saw Brooke approaching. \"We wish.\" Smiling, she said. \"I'm Brooke. Mommy told me that you'd be staying with aunt Natalie for a while. It's good to meet you, Joanie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here.\" Smiling, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what turned you into such a tomboy?\" Curious, Brooke asked. \"Our moms insist upon a no tomboy rule in their house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed further, if that was even possible. \"Daddy did not have a son so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He 'boyified' you!?\" Shocked, Hannah and Brooke asked in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, seeing mom and Catherine's increasingly amused grins. \"That was their biggest fight.\" Forcing a tear, you said. \"Dad wanted a boy and mom wanted a girl so I sort of had to be both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrook frowned before a rare look of determination formed on her face. \"Well, you don't have to be both here, Joanie. You can be as girly as you like!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard mom and Catherine stifle more giggles only Brooke and Hannah were too occupied with you to hear them. \"Yeah, we'll even help you!\" She turned to Brooke. \"She was just dumped here, Brooke! She did not have time to pack or anything! She couldn't even get to bring her favorite dolly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She can have some of your old clothes!\" Suddenly excited, Brooke declared. \"I know you have some very, very pretty dresses and bright shinny shoes she can wear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, Brooke and Hannah took hold of one of your arms and half dragged, half carried you into the house leaving Tim standing alone and very much confused. \"Am I missing something here?\" Bewildered, he asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head, amused. \"No, Tim.\" Smiling, she said. \"I think you just met your match.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine giggled then walked into the house with mom with Tim following, still feeling confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So immature\" Brooke said, rolling her eyes. \"Despite what he thinks, we're going to make you feel better, Joanie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeaaa\" you said in a weak voice that neither of the girls heard, as they dragged you to Hannah's room. Quickly, both of them moved into action, with Hannah searching her wardrobe for something 'pink and pretty' for you to wear, whereas Brooke was looking through Hannah's vanity for jewellery. They quickly got you out of your school clothes, apologizing for not doing it sooner, and into Hannah's old, and long since outgrown princess costumes,  painted your nails pink, and were in the process of adding some of Hannah's costume jewellery to your neck, wrists and ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe your mom hasn't pierced your ears yet\" Hannah said in a sympathetic voice as she clipped on to your glum figure some clip on earrings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want to do now?\" Brooke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

It would totally suck to be raised like if you're a boy\" Mel said. She paused and said, \"Can I ask you something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't I use magic around her or Hannah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannah is far too young, and Joanie doesn't have it at all\" mom said, lying. You had it, but to fit with your cover, mom pretended your were completely powerless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor girl. That would be like, be so horrible\" Mel said. \"I hope she likes the party tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, you were woken by Mel. \"Happy birthday... Well for a few days ago\" Mel said somewhat ditzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same to you\" you said, cautiously wondering why Mel was in your room. You didn't like the fact she was going through your wardrobe, or the fact she was timing her time doing so. Five minutes later, she had picked out your outfit for the day, and you felt like screaming as you couldn't think of a girlier outfit; Pink dress, white tights, pink mary janes, pink ribbons. You gave a sigh. It was going to be a long day....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You let out a short scream, seeing it but quickly closed your hand. The flame thankfully went out and you put your hand behind your back hoping Mel did not see. Unfortunately, Mel looked at you in shock then slowly began to smile; she saw the flame in your hand. \"You- You didn't see that!\" Lamely, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I saw that.\" Smiling, Mel said. \"That was a flame test. You have magic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did not see that!\" Stomping one foot, you insisted. \"There is no such thing as magic! Mommy and daddy told me so!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did not know what mom would do if she found out a flame had ignited in your hand while stuck as a little girl so you decided to try to get Mel to keep what she saw a secret. Only you were not sure how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mom told me there was no such thing as magic when I was your age too.\"  Kindly, Mel said. \"When my flame first appeared, I screamed just as you did. Mom then told me the truth...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a freak or some monster!\" Imitating one of Hannah's tantrums, you yelled. \"I- I...\" You began to shed real tears and honestly added, \"I'm scared, okay!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel sighed and knelled down closer to your level. \"I was scared too, kiddo.\" Gently, she said. \"I know your dad wants you to act more like a boy and you are trying to please him.\" She paused, trying to remember her own lessons. \"You need to keep in mind that emotions make magic stronger so being a tomboy will not do when you have magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pouted, hearing that. <i>\"I'm such an idiot!\"</i> Ruefully, you thought. <i>\"Mom wasn't kidding when she said frustrations will bring my magic closer to the surface.\"</i> Finally, you let out a sigh. \"What can I do? I want to be myself not what others want me to be, no matter their reasons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel giggled. \"Your dad wanted a boy but he had to settle for a tomboy.\" Smiling, she said. \"Why don't you try to be a 'pretty tomboy'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused, curious. Without thinking, you asked, \"A tomboy can be pretty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel laughed. \"Of course, she can, you silly!\" Amused, she said. \"Here, let me show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced as Mel took the two pink ribbons and tied your hair in a certain way. When she was done, she turned you to face a mirror. You gaped at the single pony tail shooting out from the back of your head then gave a slight smile. \"That looks better than pigtails.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel giggled at your reaction. \"Did you know that football players took ballet as part of their training?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whipped around to face Mel, annoyed. \"They do not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, they do.\" Grinning, Mel said. \"How do you think they learned to gracefully hop along the line of scrimmage so they don't clumsily fall over the line?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your mouth to answer then sighed before moaning. \"I guess if a football player can stomach a few ballet lessons, it won't hurt me to try...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel grinned, seeing Hannah appear at the doorway with mom behind her. \"So, are you saying you will sign up for ballet?\" Softly, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moaned. <i>\"I should get my head examined!\"</i> Ruefully, you thought. Then, you said, \"Yeah, I'll sign up on Monday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that, Joanie?\" Teasing, Mel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, irritated. Before you could stop yourself, you yelled, \"Yes, I'll sign up for ballet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah screamed in delight, startling you. She up, nearly knocking you over in a hug. \"I knew you would come around, Joanie!\" Happily, she chirped. \"This will be so much fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom chuckled before turning to Mel. \"I'm glad someone finally got through to her.\" Pleased, she said. \"Maybe now, she will relax and let herself be a <i>little girl</i> for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a nervous giggle then discretely threw Mel a dirty look. <i>\"Melanie is not as ditsy as she looks.\"</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You will remain quiet about this, even to Hayley\" mom ordered, much to Mel's surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got several good reasons. One, Hannah does not possess her powers yet. Another is Joanie, who is even less equipped to deal with such powers. Remember your science class where you magnetized some metal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally, but what does this have to do with Joanie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That metal piece that you said you remembered became a magnet itself. Same principle here. Joanie has somehow absorbed some magic, and it she continues to do so, she would become a witch herself. If you think that is a good thing, think again. She is five and her parents do <i>not</i> possess any countermeasures. Now, you're got some guests to meet and I have a very frightened niece to deal with\" mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do?\" Mel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Block her memory. From her perspective, your cousin would believe that you offered to pierce her ears. I suggest giving her time before you make another attempt.</span></div></div>",

She touched your forehead with her index finger and muttered a number of strange words...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen mom was finished, she pulled her finger away and smiled. You were pouting, tears still falling from your eyes. \"Melanie is a meanie!\" Sobbing, you whined. \"I'd look like a baby in pigtails! And she wanted to pierce my ears!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel was only teasing you when she offered to pierce your ears, Joanie.\" Soothingly, she said. \"Also, you would not look like a baby, just irresistibly cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pouted. \"I don't mind getting my ears pierced, aunt Natalie.\" Honestly, you said. \"I just rather it be done by someone who knows what they are doing.\" You paused then added, \"No pigtails!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled. \"You have too much stress for someone so young.\" Smiling, she said. \"Don't worry about what your mommy or daddy might say. They are the ones fighting like infants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled at that, causing mom to smile. The new memories were working perfectly, for the moment. She smiled more as you asked, \"Is it really okay if I sign up for ballet? I go back home in a few months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can take all the lessons you want, Joanie.\" Cooing, mom replied. \"Let yourself be a little girl during your visit so you can discover who you truly want to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave mom a grateful smile. \"Thanks, aunt Natalie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom waved her hand, dropping the privacy spell. \"Why don't you tell Hannah the good news?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned before jumping off your bed and running out of the room, giggling.

You like ballet, you just don't necessarily love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbeit reluctantly, you nodded. \"Yeah, it's okay.\" Pouting, you admitted. \"I just didn't like being pushed into it, literally by aunt Natalie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley giggled. \"Just give it a chance.\" Calmly, she said. \"Mom and I needed to get creative when it came to keeping you and Hannah away from the magic lessons.\" She then turned serious, \"Unless you want to be a teenage girl, or worse, a little girl and need to grow up again, take what you can get to stay out of the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped. \"I guess when you put it that way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley smiled, ruffling your hair with her hand. \"That's my brave little cousin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled not to giggle as you protested. \"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giggle moved you to turn and see Megan walk into the room. \"I see Joanie is still a bit of a tomboy.\" Amused, she said. \"Is she still annoyed for being coaxed into taking ballet lessons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's slowly getting over it.\" Grinning, Hayley said. \"She admitted that she liked it, just didn't love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan smiled. \"Well, there will be no ballet at my house tonight.\" Looking at you, she said. \"I have something more interesting in mind for you and Hannah to pass the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would that be?\" Wincing, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan smiled. \"It's one of Hannah's favorite games when I babysit her.\" To your inner horror, she replied. \"We are going to be...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You winced slightly, which caused Hannah to giggle slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scared?\" your annoying sister asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not\" you snapped, as you shock off Megan's grip and climbed up into the attic. You knew the attic was used for storage, and was in a reasonable condition. A couple of crates were in the corner and Hannah, having done this before, immediately went for them. It weren't too surprising that she picked out a Cinderella costume. She was obsessed by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go pick something out, Joanie\" Megan urged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princesses?\" you asked. You figured Megan didn't have too many.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mostly, but you'll see\" Megan said. Not having much of a choice, you walked over to the crate and saw an odd selection. Most of the princess costumes were old school, such as Belle and Ariel,  from when Megan was a child, but some appeared recently brought. Looking closer, you saw that two were not of child size. Confused, you picked up the blue garment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you've got my Cinderella costume. It's for Halloween, when I'm going to that your cousin. Melanie didn't want to wear it, even though I think she would make a more convincing version\" Megan explained. \"As for the other, it's for the party for us cheerleaders. We have to get each other a costume, and I've gotten stuck with a not very nice girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\" you said, hoping you didn't sound too bemused. Megan doing Cinderella would be a sight to see, along with her swipe at Kristy. Getting Kristy to dress as Elsa would drive her insane. Quickly,  you looked through the other crate. Mostly more dresses, but a few things stood out; mainly Megan's old cheer uniform when she were little. You frowned; none of this stuff were something you wanted to wear. The only positive was that none of it included pink leotards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See anything you'd like?\" Megan asked cheerfully, not seeing your expression.</span></div></div>",

You hoped Hayley's magic lessons with Mel weren't going to take too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really are a tomboy. Let me pick\" Megan said. You stared as she pulled out of the chest a Belle dress.

Partly to keep your sanity, you were reading books aimed at kids a couple of years older than the five years you appeared to be. Mom's 'gift' in giving you the ability to act like Joanie helped, but to explain why you could read such 'advanced' books, you said you loved doing it from an early age.

She looked surprised to see you dressed up, but she quickly shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I though you girls were getting ready for bed.

Another welcome addition would be that you'd lose Tim, who would have been his usual jerky self and you were too tired to deal with it, thanks to your nightmares. Unfortunately, Tim wasn't so easily lost. Makayla's house was within walking distance of the school, and that allowed Tim to follow from a distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you wanna do?\" Makayla asked as you entered her room.

Although you were concerned about what you were going to find with the new Tiffany (it was the source of your restless night), you didn't want to talk. Mom did, and one glance at you told her everything she needed to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to learn to relax, sweetheart. Even if things all went to hell and everything that can go wrong, goes wrong, would being a five year old girl be so bad?\" mom said gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" you loudly protested, not caring if anyone else were around. You hated the idea of growing up again, this time as little Joanie Harrison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. Your sisters aren't around, and I'm certain you do not want to remain like this, Joanie. However, you weren't having nightmares from your fears of being stuck in panties. You were fearing what sort of 'Tiffany' you were going to encounter. Just remember she will be what she would be like had she been born and raised as a girl\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remained silent, as that was exactly what you feared. Doubtlessly she would be sugar and spice. \"I wouldn't worry, Joanie. Tiffany won't be joining us until tonight, when she and Hannah have to work on their homework.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaaaa\" you said in a very flat cheer. Postponing the meeting was torturous, and you very much preferred to get it over and done with. The day went slowly for you, and your new friends could tell you were anxious about something, but you refused to say exactly why you were 'sad'. Finally, the day finished and mom picked you up. Both Hannah and Tiffany were with her, and the instant you saw your cousin, you face fell. Somehow, Tiffany was dressed even girlier than Hannah, and like your sister (and yourself), Tiffany was pigtailed, wore a warm colored puffy dress, had maryjanes on her tight clad feet. That was where the similarities ended; seeing your quivering face, Tiffany said, \"What's wrong, mushbrain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mushbrain?\" you asked, knowing that was something Tim would say and not something you expected from Tiffany's delicate little mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Anxiously, you tried to de-stress by scrunching up your toes, but listening to both Hannah and Tiffany comment about dressup and dolls, and how boys were dumb and gross weren't helping. You couldn't help but wonder how long it would be before you too were joining in play with dolls (an activity that you've somehow miraculously managed to avoid) and started to wholeheartedly act like the little girl you appeared to be. Mercifully, the car trip only lasted a couple of minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna play?\" Tiffany asked Hannah, who eagerly nodded, despite the fact both of them were supposed to be working on an assignment. The two little girls rushed in, past a deeply bemused Mel, whom could perceive the changes surrounding Tiffany's new reality. You walked in much more slowly, feeling like you're walking to your hangman. Naturally Mel didn't notice you at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom. I can't believe what you've done with 'Tiffany'. Definitely an improvement...\" Mel said, but was quickly cut off with one of mom's coughs. Surprised, Mel looked and saw you walking in aimlessly. You felt flat, and it was clearly visible in your movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.... Are you okay, Joanie? You look upset\" Mel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine\" you lied. Knowing you had o play the game, you asked, \"How is Tiffany an improvement?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just comparing her to what she was like a year ago\" Mel said. \"School was rough? Least it's over. Why don't you go upstairs and join in? It'll make you feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I just want to be by myself\" you said in a flat voice. As you said it, your emotions finally broke through, trigging your magic. A small flame leapt from your right hand. You noticed it seconds before Mel or mom, causing you to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-my hand....\" you stammered at the second ignition of your magic, though from Mel's perspective, she thought it was your first as the memories were 'wiped'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. Calm down. There is nothing to be afraid of\" Mel soothed, seeing your genuine look of fear on your face.</span></div></div>",

You knew that was in the region where your womb would be, assuming mom had bothered to actually create one when she transformed you into Joanie, and the thought of something happening in that area was discomforting. If it wasn't for Mel's presence, you would have spoken out, but since Mel had a slightly stunned look on her face, you knew talking about things no kid your apparent age would know, wouldn't be the smart thing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel.

The urge to enter Hannah's room was so powerful; you knew you had to escape before you submitted to it. Even in your room, you wouldn't be safe; it would only a matter of time. Somewhat reluctantly, you tore yourself away from your sister's room and headed downstairs. It was quiet, and in your panicked state, you believed that they were searching for you. In reality, both mom and Hayley were keeping their distance, knowing you weren't going to be a rational mind. Going to the back door meant going past mom's study, something you were worried about, but saw as less of a risk than going through the more obvious front door. It was empty, much to your surprise. Normally, you would ignore it, fearing a trap, but the girlish urge had freaked you out. You wanted some leverage, and mom's potions seemed ideal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, all mom's potions were securely locked, except for one. It was in some syringes within a metal first aid kit, along with some envelopes. Relieved to see one with 'John' on it, you tore it open and started to read its contents, and in the process, unlocking a syringe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>John. By now, you realize we have magic powers. Sometimes, magic can get out of control. If you are reading this, it means magic has gotten out of control and you're about to use the failsafe...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Failsafe? What is that?' you wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The failsafe contains a potion that will reset a potentially corrupted mind. However, I strongly I urge you to use this as a last resort, as not only does it wipe all but the most disciplined minds, it also resets one's body. Care must be taken for you NOT to come into contact with the potion itself as this reset potion is also known as 'Girl maker'.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes instantly widened. 'Girl maker?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm got this here for its true, original purpose, John. While I must admit I would love to mother you as my daughter, I DO NOT wish for it to be permanent, or through an accident. Be extremely careful using the failsafe if it must be used. I doubt you want a lifetime of skirts and panties</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of you wanted to have a bitter chuckle at the irony of your situation, but the majority of you was horrified. It seemed mom didn't want this to happen to you, yet she is doing everything to make you into a pink clad, sweet little girlie girl. \"Something must have happened for her to act like this....\"</span></div></div>",

Did mommy do something\" Hannah said in her giggly voice as she scanned the room. \"Oh, you're got new bedsheets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remained silent, stunned. It was clear that Hannah truly thought that not only you were her twin sister, and that you had always been so, she thought her enlarged bedroom was yours too. Not only that, Tiffany was still brainwashed into being a girl. In some ways, she was worse than Hannah in terms of pure girliness. You knew you had to do something about that; while Tiffany was quieter and more pleasant than Tim, and seemed to be closer to his... her new witch friend that originally got her into this girlish mess, to you, it didn't seem right...</span></div></div>",

She called her Hannah into her study and asked her to sit down. \"I am going to need your help to get Joanie out of her shell.\" Calmly, she said. \"You know that she is a bit of a tomboy, far more interested in boyish activities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know.\" Frowning, Hannah said. \"I just don't get it; we're supposed to be twins. Why doesn't she like ballet like I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's scared of it, honey.\" To Hannah's shock, mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why?\" Taken back, Hannah asked. \"What's so scary about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"Joanie tried out for cheerleading last year even though she was really too young to do so; the cheerleaders were quite bemused by her determination.\" Softly, she explained. \"They used her in a practice where they threw her high into the air only...\" She winced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone dropped her?\" Gulping, Hannah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head. \"Someone deliberately missed her and she fell hard to the ground, causing her to break her arm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah's eyes went wide before they narrowed and her face turned red. \"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flame appeared in Hannah's hand, as mom had expected. \"Cancel your flame, young lady.\" Sternly, she commanded. \"The girl responsible had already been dealt with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah took a breath then canceled her flame. \"Joanie is scared of getting hurt again, right?\" Quietly, she asked. \"That's why she won't try ballet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. It was a story from your past as John when you were Hannah's age the first time. You decided to give cheerleading a try as a bet from Megan. Only one of the older cheerleaders deliberately allowed you to fall as she did not want to see a 'boy' cheerleader. Your arm got cracked and you wanted to crack the cheerleader's jaw. If it were not for Megan, you would have discovered your witch boy powers early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joanie is still holding on to her tomboy persona but I can assure you its just a mask to hide her greatest fears.\" She then gave Hannah a bemused look. \"Just as your princess personality hides your own fears.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha. Ha.\" Pouting, Hannah said. \"Seriously, how are we going to help Joanie get out of this rut?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"I need to start practicing your ballet at home.\" Calmly, she said. \"With a little luck, Joanie will find some interest and start dancing as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah giggled at that. \"It's worth a try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning, Hannah began with a number of stretches which immediately caught your attention. \"What are you doing?\" Confused, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah smiled. \"I'm doing some stretches.\" Simply, she replied. \"It helps limber me up before practice at ballet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced at that. \"You don't have ballet today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Swanson asked us all to start practicing a few routines at home.\" Calmly, Hannah said. She paused, turning to you. \"Stretching helps get the stiffness out before doing anything really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I knew that.\" Blushing slightly, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah grinned. \"Sure you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou huffed at that and began to do some stretches of your own; if nothing else to get Hannah off your back for a while. Hannah smiled seeing you doing the same stretches she was. The plan seemed to be working, at least for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hannah practiced her ballet to some soft music on her CD player, you...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Hannah started practicing, you fully intended to leave the room, but then...you didn't. You had never watched Hannah dance before, not really. Certainly, there had been recitals and this wasn't the first time she had practiced at home, but usually you couldn't have been bothered to actually watch her and really see the dance. Today, you finally did and came to realize two things: One, ballet was kind of beautiful, and two, Hannah was pretty good at it, at least for someone her age. Her steps were graceful and timed perfectly to the music and once you started watching, you found it hard to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, you took a seat on a nearby comfy chair and continued watching her. It was relaxing, both the dance and the music, and all the stress of being a teenage boy stuck as a young girl seemed to vanish for a moment. A small part of you thought about joining her. The two of you dancing on stage before an audience. The thought wasn't unenjoyable, but still, you weren't going to be giving in to any girly feelings. Just watching the dance was enough for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes into the routine, Hannah started giggling and had to stop dancing. \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah gestured toward you. \"You're watching me. I thought ballet stuff bored you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does...I just...I don't know...you dance real good, okay?\" Flustered, you don't even realize you made a grammar error you hadn't made since the first time you were seven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah smiled. \"Thanks. This is why I'm practicing at home, so I can get even better. I'm glad you are here too. It's like I'm up on stage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, then hesitantly asked a question you were a little scared of sharing. \"How...how does it feel when you dance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah thought for a second, then answered. \"Relaxing. Everything scary or making me sad kind of goes away and I just feel happy and strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy and strong. That sure sounded nice and before you knew it you said it exactly as much out loud. \"That sure sound nice.\" You blushed again as soon as the words left your mouth, but they made Hannah grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is.\" Suddenly an idea seemed to occur to her. \"Hey, Joanie, would you be my audience whenever I practice at home? Pleeeeeease.\" She looked at you hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought for a second then nodded slowly. \"I guess that would be okay.\" You definitely wanted to watch her dance more, and just watching didn't seem too dangerous. It's not like you were actually doing anything girly. Just supporting your sister. It wouldn't turn you into a total, princess-loving, girly girl like her. Still, there was a small part of you that felt...disappointed. This part of you kind of wanted to try this relaxing ballet thing that apparently made Hannah feel happy and not scared. You'd love to not feel scared. It was ironic since fear was probably the thing that was keeping you from asking to try dancing with Hannah as well. Fear of becoming girly like Hannah, and liking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah tilted her head curiously. She could tell you were deep in thought, but had no idea about what. Nervously, you shifted in your seat. \"What?\" You asked embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to practice with me...that's okay too...\" She said these words quietly, unsure that was what you thinking and not wanting to scare you off. She really did enjoy spending this time with you and didn't want to push you too hard. She didn't want to lose you as her audience at the very least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused unsure. Inside, your curiosity and your fear were dueling for supremacy. It was an uncomfortable feeling and made you want to both overcome your fear and join your sister and give in to your fear and stay in the audience, which were contradictory ideas and made no sense. It was confusing for you and it took you some time to figure your out what your answer would be. Hannah waited patiently, smiling kindly at you. Finally, you quietly responded.</span></div></div>",

She took one look at your pink, floral patterned bikini and closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hayley..\" you gasped, but she held her hand up, as if to tell you to shut up.

Go to sleep\" Hayley said. Surprisingly, Mel didn't argue. After a couple of minutes, in which you unsuccessfully tried to remove the bra part, Hayley turned to you and said, \"Nice bikini.

You would be permanently transformed into a girl and a witch to ensure their secrets remain safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like the sound of that.\" Wincing, you said. \"Dare I ask what else could happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley sighed. \"You would be teleported to the owner of the book who would have full right to punish you for taking her property; regardless of how you managed to obtain it.\" Serious, Hayley said. \"Hannah is too young but can you imagine finding her book one day?

She then thought, <i>\"Who is going to keep you safe from yourself?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt school, you avoided pretty much everyone, which raised a few eyebrows with your friends at school.

She gave you a hug before looking you in the eye. \"I know when something is troubling you.\" Softly, she said. \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \"I'm not entirely certain.\" Honestly, you said. \"Worse, I'm not getting any useful answers from mom or Hayley. All I'm getting is cryptic comments. Paul Connors, Hayley's boyfriend,  told me I'm a key piece in a chess game being played out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan paused for a moment then smiled. \"I think I know.\" Grinning, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, tell me!\" Anxious, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paul Connors has been wanting you on the football team for weeks.\" Smiling, Megan said. \"Only the cheer squad has been trying to get me to talk you into being the new school mascot for the games.\" She giggled. \"It's been a 'war of words' between the boys and girls since school started last month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a strange way, what Megan said made sense but there were too many pieces that did not fit; pieces you dared not mention to Megan. The the panties and feminine socks you were forced to wear did not fit the picture; neither did the longer hair, pierced ears, and manicured fingernails. You decided to force a smile. \"Is that it?\" Trying to sound relieved, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan pouted. \"I know you're annoyed no one told you.\" Softly, she said. \"I was not about to get you wrapped up in a boys vs girls pissing contest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave Megan a kiss on the lips. \"Thank you for telling me.\" Smiling, you said. \"I better get to my locker, the final bell should ring any minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan left under good terms and you walked to your locker to find a note waiting for you.

She smiled kindly then beckoned you with her finger. You were irritated as it was but you walked over to her then cracked the knuckles in your right hand as you made a fist. \"Fair warning, I'm in a foul mood.\" Through gritted teeth, you whispered. \"Please make this brief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Libraries are within the short list of neutral zones, dear nephew.\" Calmly, the girl said. \"Not even Cassie Bane is stupid enough to use magic here. Any violation would ban her from all libraries, everywhere; you are safe from magic here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to Harry to find that he was sitting at another table, studying as if he were there for hours and you had walked in alone. Sighing, you turned back to the girl, now knowing her true identity. \"Aunt Samantha, I assume.\" Sitting down, you said. \"Do all witches enjoy revisiting their teen years? Should I expect to see a younger version of mom soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha giggled. \"She already has, on many occasions.\" Bemused, she replied. \"Only she did so before you were aware of magic so you would never have sensed her near.\" She sighed. \"As for your question, we don't mind seeing our younger self in the mirror from time to time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want with me?\" Annoyed, you demanded. \"Also, I'm not going to your house if I do not know price I would pay in doing so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very wise.\" Nodding, Samantha said. \"I'm considered the black sheep of the family for many reasons, which I will not get into, but I see no sense in you being kept out of the loop.\" She tapped a specific book on the shelf behind her. \"Knowledge is power, my dear nephew; I suggest you power up and drive on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, she stood up and walked out of the library without another word. Curious, you pulled the book from the shelf and gasped at the title. The Witch Boy Code of Honor. You gulped and turned to the door but Samantha was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If the library is a neutral zone, would I get in trouble for reading a book of magic here?\" Worried, you thought. \"Or does a neutral zone mean that no magic can be used in these areas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou new nothing of the laws or traditions of magic, having had no training. You were highly annoyed at your family for not telling you much of anything thus far. Still, you had the mysterious book in your hands and had to make a choice. You had to either honor mom's wish and put the book back or open it and read what it had to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was Hayley's height and age with a fairly athletic build. She had long auburn hair and piercing green eyes. Unknown to you, Amara had come in second for top student at Witchbloom all girls boarding school. The two were rivals, not friends but not really enemies either until recently. She politely introduced herself to which you nodded in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hayley and I were in the same class for a year at that boarding school.\" Smiling, Amara said. \"We made top students.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A boarding school?\" curious, you asked. \"Is that where Hayley was all year?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara paled, realizing that you were not effected by the love potion Samantha gave her and that you were, at least for the most part, unaware. \"She didn't tell you?\" Surprised, she asked. \"She didn't tell you anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing you know about magic.\" Irritated, you said. \"All I know is that I'm a key chess piece in some political game being played.

Your strength and endurance was already close to being off the charts by normal means and you were still just a teenager.

Mel hadn't fully let go of her 'true twin' schemes, and you didn't want her to get any ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, don't be mean\" Mel said, a second before she grabbed one side of your hair into a hair pigtail similar to her own style, albeit one that was short due to the shortness of your hair.

You never thought that way about her, about anyone since that drunk driver killed your father years before. You shivered, fighting the tears, and stormed passed her without a word not daring to make eye contact. Mel shivered as she felt the ice in your breath and watched you uncertain as you walked into your room and slowly closed the door and locked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside your room, you walked to your bed, completely forgetting you were wearing a skirt and blouse with your panties and socks. You slumped onto your bed and began to sob quietly to yourself, shaking. \"I promised myself never to hurt anyone out of anger again.\" Weeping, you muttered. \"Not after that drunk idiot hit dad's car....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered that night. It was just you and dad, out on a boys only adventure. A drunk driver hit the car on the driver's side, sending metal fragments into dad's body. He died shortly after the paramedics arrived. You were so incredibly angry that you jumped out of your car and smashed the driver's side window of the drunk driver's car. You ripped him out through the window with one yank, nearly breaking his arm. It took two grown men to hold you back as you screamed every curse word you could imagine. All that was running though your mind was to get your hands on the man who murdered your father. It took mom only one minute to calm you down and make you realize that you could have easily killed him with your bare hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning your mind to the present, you continued to weep. \"What am I becoming...?\" Desperate, you cried. \"Some one... anyone... help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside your room, mom and Hayley sighed, shaking their heads. \"This is quickly getting out of control, Hayley.\" Sadly, mom said. \"As much as I don't want to, we are going to have to use potions to help him through this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What potion did you have in mind?\" Worried, Hayley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed and suggested...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If I do, all it'll do is increase his vulnerability. The only option is to calm him down with a calming potion\" mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how are we gonna do that?\" Hayley half scoffed. \"No way we can force him to drink it, mix it with his food, or just tell him, 'Hey you're stressed. Have this potion to calm down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom half snorted at Hayley's dry, almost sarcastic tone. \"I know. We can't covertly use it, even though I think I could successfully deliver it without initial detection, but we cannot tell him why either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should talk to him even if he doesn't want to. Maybe give you time to come up with a plan, mom\" Hayley suggested.

Nothing\" you said sourly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ouch. I'm on you're side...\" Hayley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Then tell me what is going on. Why is everyone trying to turn me into a girl!\" you snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Cassie wants a girlfriend and most likely, Samantha likely wants someone new to order her around <i>after</i> she has foiled Cassie. Can't speak for any others that want to see you in skirts, 'sis'\" Hayley said bluntly. \"Mom is trying to help you, albeit clumsily, from any embarrassing incidents. Also, we want to pre-empt any more annoying 'presents' like this.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" you demanded, as Hayley produced a small pink box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A gift from one of your 'admirers', most likely Cassie. Non magical, surprisingly. Bra and panty set, all in pink. Wanted to keep it from you, but you left me no choice.

Have you drugged me with some sort of potion?\" you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Are you actually wearing it?\" Hayley said, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me help\" Hayley said as she slipped off your shirt, revealing your completely unchanged chest. You backed off, but Hayley was quicker. With the same speed as Mel had when she did your hair, Hayley put the bra against your chest, and hooked your arms through the straps. The only part still loose was the back. \"Feel different?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Why?' you said unhappily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I can see if wearing it triggers a physical change. Take it off\" Hayley ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once, you wholeheartedly agreed, and more pleasing was that there was no changes. Hayley smiled. \"Now sis, put it back on! You might want to lean into it when you do the back\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not going to happen\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to get your way with this, sis.

Once alone, you turned to Mel. \"Not a single word\" you warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like sorry for doing your hair yesterday. I so didn't think it would be a magnet for that psychotic bitch.

I don't want to be her plaything, though I know your 'girlfriend' would be her primary target. Except for you. I know she totally wants to change you, 'Jodie' in an attempt to find the next leader, but that's stupid. Wouldn't that leave you as a very pissed off, uncontrolled witch?\" Mel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised an eyebrow, knowing that Mel is guilty of the same thing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Samantha must had taken the guise of having an afternoon job at her own store. \"You shouldn't hang around there\" you warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you said, Jo, but Samantha seemed worried about you for some reason. She changed the subject abruptly, and said you should check up on 'Jodie'. It was strange...\" Harry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"When did she say that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. Thirty minutes ago\" Harry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'When Mel threw me into the pool and I grew... these. Samantha must had sensed it. But how?' you thought. Another worrying thing was that somehow, Harry seemed attractive...... You blinked.</span></div></div>",

You decided to just run with it and nodded. \"Aunt Samantha seems to have a sixth sense about these things, don't ask me why; she just does.\" You shook your head. \"I like you, Harry. I'm glad you stopped by to check up one me but now is really not a good time for a lengthy visit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry blushed slightly then nodded. \"I understand.\" Softly, he said. \"If you need anything, let me know, okay; I'm right next door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed at that. \"Make certain you tell Mel the same thing.\" Smiling, you said. \"I think she has a bit of a crush on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry smiled. \"I'm not going there, not with the way you are feeling right now.\" Standing up, he said. \"I won't be the subject of a cat fight while you and she are in that same type of mood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, that brought a giggle. Harry chuckled in return and left on good terms. After he was gone, you searched your drawers and closet for something to wear. To your dismay, there was only girl's clothing to be had. Reluctantly, you slipped into a white pair of panties with a matching bra, a modest blue skirt and a white blouse. This was followed by a pair of pink ankle socks and a pair of mary-janes. Once dressed, you left your room to talk to mom. Only you found Hayley instead. \"Where is mom?\" Curious, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley sighed, looking as if she was not sure how to respond. \"Jodie, mom is in a meeting with the witch council.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of meeting?\" Becoming worried, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley winced then replied, \"They are discussing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We limit her leverage, and since I'm better than you at this, if you allow me to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom snickered. \"And allow you to have leverage of your own? I may as well say, 'Jodie, try on these gloves'. No, I'll do it myself. get out of here, and say 'hi' to my nephew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't..\" Samantha protested, before she disappeared.

In less than a minute, you had been regressed into a six year old girl. Mom smiled at your annoyed look as she cast a second spell. \"What ever is the matter, Jodie?\" Sweetly, she asked. \"There is nothing wrong with needing to learn how to dance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to scream at mom for turning you into a six year old only the thought quickly left you and was replaced with only mom's comment about you needing to learn how to dance. It was very strange and unnerving to you. A look of confusion formed onto your face and you blurted out the only thing that came to mind. \"Hannah will want to make us all girlie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom chuckled. \"She's just trying to show you two how pretty you can be.\" Patiently, she said. \"Just give ballet a try. If you don't like it after say a week, I'll pull you out.\" She smiled. \"That's fair, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused; something did not seem right but you could not figure out what. You knew you were upset about mom for some reason but you could not fathom what that reason was. Finally, you shrugged and gave a frustrated sigh. \"I guess that's fair.\" Softly, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled. \"Wonderful!\" Smiling, she said. \"Get your shoes on and I'll take you with me and we can swing by the mall for some icecream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about getting pants or skorts.\" Pouting, Holly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll talk.\" Patiently mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Holly walked off to get your shoes while mom turned to find Hayley watching her. \"Why did you do that to her?\" Softly, Hayley demanded. \"You know she will remember all of this when you eventually cancel the spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"Jodie will be easier to deal with while she is under the unaware spell.\" Serious, she explained. \"Also, as a six year old, it will be harder for her to gain access to the powerful magic within her.\" She frowned. \"In retrospect, I wish I would have done this from the beginning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a risky solution, mom.\" Frowning, Hayley said. \"If Jodie's magic breaks through while she is in that form, she will be forced to grow up from that age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same goes for Holly.\" Serious, mom countered. \"It is a risk, I know.\" Her face softened as she glanced at you, now smiling with Holly as you both spoke of your favorite flavors of icecream. \"Only, I no longer can bear to see Jodie getting slowly destroyed by this political tug of war.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your plan, then?\" Her face softening, Hayley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"Right now, I'm planning this as I go.\" Honestly, she said. \"Right now, keeping both Jodie and Holly happy and unaware is the least damaging solution. It will keep both Samantha and Cassie away from them, at least for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley nodded, a smile forming onto her face. \"I can imagine both of their faces when they realize what you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"So can I but I'm more concerned about what they may try to get around it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, mom drove everyone to pick up Hannah from ballet. There, she quickly signed you and Holly up for a few classes. Once done, mom drove to the mall where she escorted you all into the icecream shop. You were looking forward to some icecream, forgetting your earlier annoyance with mom. Only upon seeing who was working there, you felt a something between fear and anger. You took a hold of the skirt of mom's dress, catching her attention. She saw the look on your face and looked at the worker. Seeing who it was, she frowned. It was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a false hope; Cassie's face twisted with rage as she watched mom lead you away. She snapped quietly to herself, \"If I can't have you, you can have your pair of increasingly girlish <i>little</i> girls, Natalie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" a worker, who was standing next to Cassie, demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of your business\" Cassie growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, mom was leading you and Holly out of the mall, and Holly was not happy. \"Mommy, you promised us icecream\" Holly whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you will get it. Just not from that lady. Did you see Jodie's face? What made you look so fearful, sweetie?\" mom asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but that girl was scary\" you admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I know\" mom said, not wanting to say more, but internally relieved that you could sense danger, yet not be fully aware.

As soon as mom had put Holly in her booster seat, Samantha closed the car, and turned on mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unaware spells on both of them. Nice\" Samantha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...\" you started to say, but neither paid any attention. Samantha continued her rant. \"Do you actually want two little girls to makeover and raise, or are you just that stupid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have to explain things to <i>you</i>\" mom snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you do. One, you have the most petty, vengeful little bitch in the area, and two, Princess Jodie. She dresses up in Hannah's Cinderella costume, and we have our new Princess within the hour\" Samantha said, before turning to you. \"Time for you to remember, Princess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Less than a minute later, Elvira appeared on the front step of Maria Bane's front door with her four body guards and knocked. When Maria answered, she turned pale upon seeing Elvira. \"I have done nothing wrong...\" Softly, she protested. \"What brings you to my doorstep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, Ms Bane.\" Kindly, Elvira said. \"This is a social call, not an official visit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria released a breath and allowed Elvira to enter. Two guards followed her while two stood at the front door. Maria prepared some tea, which Elvira's guards inspected before allowing her to have and they sat down to talk. \"Your daughter, Cassie has become fond of my grandson, John who is as the moment, my granddaughter, Jodie.\" Calmly, Elvira began. \"However, Jodie is going through a very difficult transition at this time. In the end, this transition will give him, or her, great power and responsibility.\" She took a sip of her tea. \"Your daughter's advances are making the transition more frustrating for her which is making things frustrating for all those involved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want me to do?\" Courtly, Maria asked. \"Do you want me to tell Cassie not to pursue her love for your grandchild?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira shook her head. \"I am asking you to tell your daughter to be patient.\" Remaining calm, she replied. \"My grandchild will not be dealing with this transition, aware or unaware, as a teenager or a child forever. He or she will come out of it in a few months time.\" She sipped her tea then added, \"After that, your daughter will be free to pursue her love for John or Jodie to her heart's content until he or she gets bonded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Elvira rose from her seat and thanked Maria for her time before leaving. Maria sighed, slightly shaken by the visit then turned to Cassie who was watching from the stairwell landing. \"Did Elvira forbid me to go near Jodie?\" Tearfully, she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, sweet child.\" Kindly, Maria replied. \"She only asked me to tell you to be patient.\" She smiled, motioning Cassie to come to her before urging her to sit. \"You, Jodie, and her friend, Holly are all the victims in this case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are victims?\" Worried, Cassie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria nodded. \"You see, Jodie is Natalie's little treasure; she will bring her family greater power and wealth if she remains a girl.\" Patiently, she explained. \"If he stays a boy, he becomes frighteningly strong which will also bring the family power but in a less subtle way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie hung onto every word her mother was saying as she explained things to her as one would read a bedtime story to a small child. \"What am I to do?\" Wincing, she asked. \"Why is Holly a victim? Why am I a victim?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natalie has grown fond of the child, Holly.\" Calmly, Maria said. \"One cannot blame her for this as she practically raised her, as a boy, for so long while her mother and new husband were away doing who knows what.\" She sighed. \"She wishes to take the child from her clearly unfit mother but she will fight it. This fight will tear the poor child's heart apart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor Holly...\" Whispering, Cassie said. She knotted her jaw in decision. \"Then its a good thing I decided to make her the most girlie girl she can be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria smiled. \"That's my daughter.\" Showing pride, she said. \"As to why you are a victim, Jodie's mother does not want to share her family's power with just anyone. She sees us as... below her, unworthy of her family name.\" She sighed. \"Elvira, the head witch sees that and only asks of us to be patient. She wisely refuses to take a stand on this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I do?\" Wincing, Cassie repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be Jodie's lady night in shinning armor, Cassie.\" Serious, Maria said. \"Save her from her mother's selfishness; show her how beautiful and wonderful she can be.\" She giggled as she cast a spell. \"I will help by making it possible to be near her at all times, regardless of the form her mother forces upon her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, Cassie had become a six year old girl. \"Mommy!\" Startled, she shrieked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is just until Jodie comes out of her transition.\" Patiently, Maria said. \"You want to be near her, do you not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes.\" Frowning, Cassie replied. \"But do I have to have Michelle with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria giggled. \"We all must make sacrifices for love, dear child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie sighed before nodding. \"I'll get myself ready for school tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had walked back up the stairs, Maria cackled to herself. \"That's right, my dear puppet, you get yourself ready.\" Whispering, she said. \"One way or another, I or one of my daughters will be marrying into that family.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Michelle hated being Cassie's toy, and worse, their mom didn't seem to care. Of course the only thing that wasn't ultra girly in Michelle's daily changed room was a leather book with a crude note saying, 'When you've finally accepted that you're my girly little sister forever, read me.'

You really should talk like the little girl you are!\" thundered Cassie, but to her horror, she  couldn't cast a spell. \"Why isn't it working?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're too young\" Michelle said gleefully. \"Maybe its time for me to teach you how to be a good little girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're finally accepted that you're my little sister\" Cassie said, trying to hide her anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but you've given me plenty of experience.

She frowned. \"The sooner you learn magic and take your revenge, the sooner you will hear me call you my son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she walked out of the room to confront Cassie who was desperately trying to hear what her mom was telling Michelle. Upon seeing her now a seven year old, she screamed at the top of her lungs. \"Why did you make her older than me?!\" Hysterical, she demanded. \"You told me that you wouldn't interfere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom waved her hand, closing Michelle's door before laughing. \"Your tactics were not moving your sister to learn magic fast enough.\" In a light tone, she replied. \"So I was forced to step in on your behalf.\" She then leaned in close and whispered, \"If you ever talk to me like that again, I will make you a boy for life, my little hellish angel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... she's older than me now.\" Tearfully, Cassie whined. \"It's not fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your eyes on the prize, child.\" Serious, Maria said. \"Focus on getting your new girlfriend and let me deal with our reluctant princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie sighed then sulked to her room.

She sported long black hair and emerald green eyes. \"Are your two puppets tangling their strings again?\" Teasing, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria giggled. \"No, just fighting for the spotlight, as usual.\" Smiling, she replied. \"Michelle wants to be the big, bad man of the house and Cassie wants to be queen of the castle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha shook her head. \"To be young and stupid again.\" Bemused, she said. \"Micheal had his fate coming to him as little Michelle the second he saw Cassie using magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria Smiled wickedly. \"Michelle has a lot of potential.\" Grinning, she said. \"If Cassie fails, she may just win John's heart with the right motivation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha and Maria shared a laugh as Michelle pondered over her mother's words, staring at the leather bound book...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She smiled seeing you both looking slightly uncomfortable wearing the grade school girl's uniform. Even though you and she were unaware, you were still boys on the inside. \"The skirt is too short, mommy.\" Blushing, you whined. \"Boys will peek.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not allowed to pound them for it either.\" Frowning, Holly added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be fine, girls.\" Bemused, mom said. \"The skirts reach your knees, boys won't be able to peek as easily as you fear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Holly, as John and Harry, had volunteered to be tutors to the children in the first grade level so you knew most of the kids by name. Mom was happy for that as it made the transition from tutor to student easier on you and Holly. She drove you both to school with Hannah, Hayley, and Mel. \"Have a good day, girls.\" Dropping them off, mom said. \"I will pick you up when school lets out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waved to mom as you hurried behind your 'twin' sister, Holly into the school. There, you took a seat next to her as the other students piled in. Once settled, the teacher, Miss Tanner motioned to a young girl with long blond hair and green eyes. \"Class, we have a new transfer student to welcome today.\" Kindly, she said. \"Please say hello to Cassidy Bane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the new student and blushed slightly. There was something about her that felt familiar and somewhat frightening. She caught your eye and blushed as well; she seemed just as uncomfortable as you felt. \"I-It's a pleasure to meet you all.\" Timidly, she said. \"I hope to get to know all of you well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Tanner smiled, noticing you and she catching each other's eye. \"Why don't you sit in the seat between Holly and Jodie, Cassidy.\" Kindly, she suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed at that, feeling embarrassed. Cassidy took a seat next to you as Miss Tanner added, \"Perhaps this will keep you two from talking too much in class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggles rose around you as Miss Tanner began class. You sighed, catching Cassidy's eye again; she seemed to be staring. You blushed brightly when she smiled and whispered, \"You're cute; want to be friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou forced a polite smile but thought it wise not to reply; you instead focused on Miss Tanner's lesson for the day. <i>\"I'd better tell mom about this after school.\"</i> Worried, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Hannah was having troubles of her own when she entered her class. Her teacher, Mrs Thatch was standing with a nervous looking girl with long black hair and blue eyes in the front of the room. \"Class, we have a new transfer student joining us today.\" Firmly but kindly, she announced. \"Please welcome Michelle Bane to our class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am pleased to meet you all.\" Shyly, Michelle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Thatch smiled. \"Why don't you sit next to Hannah.\" Kindly, she suggested. \"She is one of our top students.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle shuffled over to an empty desk next to Hannah who watched her curiously. \"You look familiar to me.\" Whispering, she said. \"Have you come to this school before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle nodded. \"I did a while ago.\" Wincing, she replied. \"Only I was a different person then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah sighed at that; she sensed magic and that meant a transformation. <i>\"I'd better tell mom about this when I get home.\"</i> Worried, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, at lunch, you and Holly sat down to eat and were joined by...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Still, I will not see a girl get hurt... not my style.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassidy fumed, looking as if she wanted to scream.

That said, Holly could be in the transition as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is.\" Softly, mom confirmed. \"However, her transition is not as powerful or as difficult to manage due to the fact her mother is a first witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley gulped. \"Do you think there is a chance that Holly could become Jodie's twin for real?\" Wincing, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head. \"The bond between twins is very powerful so the chances of that happening are slim to none.\" Serious, she explained. \"If it does happen, Mel will become Sarah Rich's twin to form a balance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We lose one if we gain one.\" Sadly, Hayley said. \"I see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not make Holly and Jodie twins through reality; I just made everyone perceive them as twins, including themselves.\" Firmly but kindly, mom said. \"It made things easier for everyone, overall and Sarah Rich is being trained at Witchbloom. We are hoping this is over before she graduates in the spring of next year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do from here?\" Sighing, Hayley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We keep an eye on Jodie and Holly.\" Serious, mom replied. \"I want to keep this in the family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning was Saturday and mom allowed everyone to sleep in as she waited for the first wave of mail to come in. She sighed seeing the large pile of junk mail offering sales on everything from dresses and makeup to toy car and toy soldier. collections. \"I wonder if other witch families deal with a boy in the mix deal with this nonsense.\" Annoyed, she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, realizing she may be on to something legal, mom picked up the phone and dialed...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Taking a chance she may have some answers, mom called her from inside her car. Three rings later, she answered with a polite, \"Hello, who am I speaking to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if you remember me, Ms Switch.\" Wincing, mom said. \"It's Natalie Harrison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom jumped, nearly dropping her phone when Ms Switch nearly screamed, \"Darling!!

I'm calling because I fear I have found myself a little over my head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you were when you and Catherine were toying with your brother, Jack?\" Bemused, Ms Switch asked. \"I hear he married a former quasi rogue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like that... it's worse.\" Tearing up, mom said. \"I'm trying to help my son only I fear I am hurting 'her' more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom jumped as she suddenly found herself in a small but quaint office setting, sitting in front of a desk Ms Switch was sitting behind. She calmly poured a cup of tea and offered it to mom. \"Please tell me everything from the beginning.\" Softly, Ms Switch said. \"Try not to leave anything out; I will ask questions to fill in the blanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sadly nodded and explained the situation. Ms Switch listened patiently, silently nodding or raising an eyebrow her and there until mom had finished. \"It's not that you are doing anything wrong or causing things to get worse.\" Firmly but kindly, Ms Switch said. \"The fact of the matter is you are ignoring your child's long term goals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't follow.\" Confused, mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does your child want to be when he or she grows up?\" Bemused, Ms Switch asked. \"Which people does he or she look up to as a role model?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom opened her mouth to answer then paused, blushing. \"I'm not really sure.\" Softly, she said. \"He has so many interests...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is what you must discover and help your child, regardless of gender, accomplish.\" Serious, Ms Switch explained. \"By focusing only on her living as a girl, you instill a fear that you are trying to control her destiny.\" She took a sip of tea before throwing mom a stern look over her half moon glasses. \"Sound familiar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shivered. \"I'm not the girl I was when I was a teenager.\" Shaken, she protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Switch shook her head. \"No, you are not.\" Calmly, she confirmed. \"However, you are using the same tactic, just to protect rather than to play. The result is the same, you send all the wrong signals. Focus on long term goals so your child can see a light at the end of the tunnel, regardless of what gender he or she ultimately becomes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, mom found herself back in her car with much to think about. \"I need to have a heart to heart with Jodie.\" sighing, she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't want to make Hannah or Holly look bad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're joking, right?\" Bemused, Tim said. \"You and Holly practiced with Hannah many times. Though you might not remember...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't I remember?\" Wincing, you demanded. \"It's all a fuzzy mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the cooties.\" Grinning, Tim retorted. \"It'll do that to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha. Ha.\" Humorlessly, you said. \"Seriously, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim sighed. \"It'll come back to you when you least expect it to.\" Cryptically, he said. \"Don't think too much into it. Just deal with what's in front of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded at that before sensing mom entering the room. \"I'm sorry the girls frightened you.\" Kindly, she said. \"I had a word with them about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind playing dress up.\" Wincing, you said. \"I just was not in the mood for it then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, honey.\" Patiently, mom said. \"let's go home.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I won't let that psychopath turn you into some pink clad, princess obsessed cutie. Mel will look after Holly and Hannah. Mom will deal with Samantha, if she is there.

Just admit it, you're comfortable with girly stuff. You <i>like</i> girly stuff</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGritting your teeth, you didn't even bother to reply. The voice certainly could be a brat at times. Annoyed, you walked in, and was surprised to see Cassidy talking with both Hannah and Holly.

It worked only  she sparked the wrong kind of anger; she stepped on your pride. You grinned at her like a python would grin at a rat, making her suddenly nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why- Why are you smiling at me like that?\" Taken back, Cassidy demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you think you can out dance me, you clumsy wall flower?\" Still grinning, you asked. \"How about you put your moves where your mouth is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly backed away, a hint of her former self peeking through. \"Uh-oh...\" Whispering, she said. \"Cassidy pushed the wrong button.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah backed away as well, knowing that you were not one to let anyone trash talk you or your family without a fight. Inside your mind, your girl persona hesitated as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"What are you doing?!\"</span> Startled, she demanded. <span class=\"chotpink\">\"This is not how a proper little girl solves any of her problems!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Sit back, watch, and learn!\"</i> Sternly, you thought back. <i>\"This is how a 'proper' royal defends her crown!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then did a number of spins before stopping right in Cassidy's face, grinning. She jumped back, moving around on her tip toes. You followed suit, still grinning. \"I'll show you whose the better dancer, Harrison!\" Annoyed, she blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure about that?\" Still grinning, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will be in the front; being adored!\" Becoming angry, Cassidy whispered. \"Me and me alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... not.\" Grinning, you countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are nothing compared to me!\" Furious, Cassidy fumed. \"I am better than you and always will be better than you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then put your moves where your mouth is.\" Turning serious, you challenged. \"Here and now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, you and Cassidy jumped into a number of jumps and spins, each trying to out do the other with more and more complicated moves. Hannah and Holly both watched with their mouths half open in shock. Only one ballerina ran out of the room to where the adults were all still talking after dropping off their daughters. \"Dance battle!\" Excited, she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom, Samantha, and the other adults came running to see you and Cassidy toe to toe dancing fiercely but gracefully in an all or nothing dance battle for the spotlight. Through spins, kicks, and leaps, you and Cassidy danced all around the room. Cassidy began to stumble through her moves as she was running out of energy. She grabbed your hair in an attempt to pull you off balance only you did a flip to compensate and kept on dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"You dance like a pro!\"</span> Gushing, your girl voice said. <span class=\"chotpink\">\"You are a girly girl, Joide!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignored her as you needed to focus. Cassidy was beginning to breath heavily from effort only you were just warming up. Within minutes, the smug girl collapsed to the floor, unable to dance any longer while you continued strong for another good minute before stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never call me a nothing again.\" Annoyed, you said. \"Everyone has worth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls applauded and cheered, including the two transformed boys. Mom sighed before smiling slightly with Samantha smiling as well. \"It looks like Cassidy got what she wanted.\" Whispering, she said. \"Jodie is a real girl now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom grunted. \"No, Cassidy wanted a girlfriend.\" Whispering back, she countered. \"Instead, she got a new rival.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was an excellent performance, you two!\" Gushing, Miss Swan said. \"I'm so glad to see you two have such spirit!\" she then turned to the adults and winked before adding. \"I believe the solo should go to...\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

You turned around to see other expressions. Both Hannah and Holly looked pleased by also envious. Samantha appeared to be gleeful. Both mom and oddly Mel seemed to be deep in their own thoughts, but Hayley had the strangest look of them all. She looked almost as furious as Cassidy.

You knew she had a potion stash and a book. That and she had not said she had any traps at the ready. Still, you entered cautiously by softly knocking first to ensure she was not in the room and whispered out her name. This was so you could honestly say you knocked and called out, though softly, if you were caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She really keeps her room tidy.\" Wincing, you whispered. \"What a neat freak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"This is a bad idea, Jodie.\"</span> Serious, your girl voice said. <span class=\"chotpink\">\"You are going to get us in trouble or worse, hurt over not wanting to be a girly girl.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now, I'm only worried about getting rid of you!\" Through gritted teeth, you whispered. \"This is my body, my life, not yours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"I am a part of you, silly.\"</span> Unphased, the girl voice countered. <span class=\"chotpink\">\"I was always here and always will be here, like it or not.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never spoke to me before and you never twisted my words before either.\" Annoyed, you replied. \"You are an invader, a disease of which I intend to cure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"That hurt!\"</span> Tearfully, the girl voice yelled. <span class=\"chotpink\">\"Why are you so mean?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All boys, transformed or not, say things they don't mean when they are frightened or upset.\" Startling you, Hayley said. \"Thank you for knocking and calling before you came in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I didn't see you there!\" Stammering, you said. \"How did you do that?!

You will be facing the same stress as before only from a girl's perspective.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Fearful, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once the transformation is complete, you will see the world from a girl's perspective rather than that of a transformed boy.\" Patiently, Hayley explained. \"You will still have your memories and core beliefs so the old you will not 'die', just change.\" She then raised a single finger. \"This is where it gets tricky; your body and mind will need six months to a year to recover before we can start the process of changing you back into John.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that time, I will be used to being a little girl.\" Tearfully, you said. \"Why me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to sob as your girl voice jumped in. <span class=\"chotpink\">\"It's not so bad being a girl, Jodie. You showed everyone at ballet class, you are not a delicate flower.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you are a Harrison girl.\" Smiling slightly, Hayley said. She then turned serious, adding, \"There is no way to reverse the process at this point. You allowing your pride and ego to take control had pushed you across the threshold; you are more girl than boy now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I do?\" Desperate, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley sighed. \"All you can do now is allow the transformation to complete itself.\" Softly, she replied. \"The <i>annoying</i> girl voice will become your own within a few days and you will never hear her in your head again.\" She then smiled. \"If you decide to change back after six moths to a year, you will start to hear an <i>annoying</i> boy voice in your head instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Ha. Ha.\"</span> Humorlessly, the girl voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then spoke up, \"I came in here to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to age yourself, I know.\" Bemused, Hayley interrupted. \"It would not have worked, even if you found the right spell or potion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Wincing, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley giggled. \"The magic needed is beyond your age capabilities.\" Smiling, she said. \"That and the potion needed requires adult level magic to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Downhearted, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley smiled. \"You are not the first witch boy to go through this.\" Comforting you, she said. \"Also, in rare cases, witches faced this issue as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Curious, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Many reasons.\" Shrugging, Hayley said. \"Other witches being fearful or jealous of their magical power, toying with magic beyond their abilities to control it, playing with potions, breaking magical law...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" Pouting, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything equals out in the end, Jodie.\" Serious, Hayley said. \"You will have magic and it will be strong; just as you were physically strong as a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Hayley escorted you out of her bedroom and closed the door. You reluctantly walked away, wondering what to do. \"There has to be a way.\" Muttering, you whispered. \"Girls are magically blessed while boys are physically blessed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"You are a stubborn one.\"</span> Sighing, the girl voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look whose talking.\" Pouting, you fired back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter much consideration, you decided to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You knew there was no way to avoid them, or other girly stuff, and you was curious about how strong your urges would be. \"Lets see how strong these urges are\" you said, slightly confidently.

Curious, they walked into the room you and Holly were sharing. You did not notice them at first; you were more focused upon your troubles. You ran your fingers through your hair as you always did when you were frustrated. Everything around you had changed including you and it all felt wrong. Had you known that your mind not changing meant a chance to change back, you might not have been as depressed and frightened. Still, you began to run a brush through your hair, tears falling as you attempted to at least make your hair less feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly, thinking that someone was trying to make her twin sister a boy, walked up behind you and took the brush from your hand. You gasped but said nothing when you felt her brushing your hair. Sighing, you allowed her to style your hair because, in your mind, there was no sense fighting over it anymore. You were surprised, however, when Holly finished leaving you with a single braided ponytail making the illusion of short hair. A tiny smile formed upon your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing an opportunity, Hannah took one of your hands and began to file your finger nails into an oval shape with Holly doing the same. Again, you sighed as they began to pint your nails; not even bothering to see what color they had picked. Only, when they were done, you were in for another surprise as you found they had painted your nails a silk pink; just a tone lighter than your skin. You admired the work in the light then made a fist, your smile growing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah and Holly turned to each other smiling. They were not sure how or why but they were reaching you without saying a word. Hannah ran over to the closet and began to rummage through the clothes. Holly ran up to her and began to help. Minutes later, they walked up to you with mischievous smiles, making you nervous. Hannah held up a dark blue pleated skirt with one hand then a pair of shorts with the other. Holly held up a white blouse with a dark blue jacket. You smiled at their choices and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to you, Hannah, or Holly, the outfit was....<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Also, your pony tails were no longer braided but loosely curled. \"Much better!\" Nodding at the mirror, you said. You then turned to Hannah and Holly. \"You two can wear all the pink you want but keep me out of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah and Holly nodded and you walked out of the room. After you were gone, they turned to each other and smiled. \"She's coming back.\" Whispering, Hannah said. \"Not as fast as we want but she's coming back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly nodded, smiling. \"Good.\" Softly, she said. \"To think someone wanted to make her a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shivered at the thought, not remembering her own past due to the unaware spell that was still in place. Downstairs, mom met up with Hayley who seemed worried. \"I sensed magic.\" Wincing, she said. \"Is everything okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone had set a trap for Jodie.\" Frowning, mom explained. \"Not to worry though; I took care of much of its effects and set a trap of my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of trap?\" Curious, Hayley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"Anyone who tries to make Jodie more girlish before her mind is willing to accept it will send her into full tomboy mode.\" Bemused, she said. \"She is slowly becoming adjusted to being a girl and a witch. When that time comes, we will know for certain if Jodie is here to stay or if John will return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley nodded. \"If a strong flame ignites in her left hand, Jodie will be here to stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded back. \"A flame in the right hand will signal John coming back.\" She then sighed. \"That will be her most vulnerable time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Worried, Hayley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When Jodie's mental transformation is complete, reality will have been completely changed.\" Sadly, mom said. \"Only I and perhaps you will know different. Everyone else will assume some crazy witch is trying to turn their sister into a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be an up hill battle for her.\" Wincing, Hayley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom again nodded sadly. \"That is why all but the most stubborn of witch boys don't bother trying to fight their way back to boyhood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, the next day, more problems arise as...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You broke free from Megan's grasp and lunged at Cassie with an angered scream. Cassie, showing fear for the first time, took a step back as if to run but was not fast enough. You tackled her to the ground and began to viciously pound on her face as you would a bully who went too far as John. Cassie screamed and cried with each blow until a strong hand pulled you away; it was Ms Thorn, the principal of the school. \"That's enough!\" Sternly, she said. \"I want both of you in my office, now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to Megan to see her walk away as if nothing had happened then walked towards the principal's office with Ms Thorn urging you and Cassie to stay quiet. Once you entered, Ms thorn slammed the door and ordered you and Cassie to sit. \"I am well aware of magic, ladies.\" Angry, she said. \"Also, before you ask, yes; I am a witch as well as the head of the D.D.M.C. Department of Dark Magic Control.\" Cassie gulped, which Thorn noticed. \"Using magic on school grounds is forbidden, Miss Bane.\" Sternly, she said. \"Do it again and I will ban you from this school as you were from your last school. Do I make myself clear?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am.\" Through gritted teeth, Cassie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your attitude is unacceptable, young lady!\" Unimpressed, Ms Thorn snapped. \"Shape up or ship out, I do not tolerate witch bullies in my school!\" She then turned to you, equally unimpressed. \"I frowned upon you pounding on bullies when you were a boy, John, or rather, Jodie.\" Firmly, she said. \"I understand that you are under a lot of stress but the rules stand for a reason!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then enforce them.\" Angrily, you countered. \"This is not the first time I had been attacked by magic on school grounds. Also, when I was a boy, I had to step in when a boy got beat up by three kids and no teacher moved to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I took care of that incident just as I will take care of this one.\" Ice in her voice, Thorn said. \"It is obvious that Cassie has feelings for you, Jodie. Therefore, I am ordering you both to the same classes during school hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Stunned, you asked. \"How does that solve anything?! Also, I'm not Jodie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two will work as a team.\" Ignoring you, Thorn continued. \"Any spell used against you from anyone will effect Cassie as well.\" She gave Cassie a satisfied grin. \"The more feminine Jodie gets, the more masculine you will become so I suggest you keep her magically safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie forced a smile though she looked like she wanted to scream. Ms Thorn then turned to you. \"Any physical harm that comes to Cassie will effect you, Jodie.\" With the same grin, she said. \"The more punishment she gets, the more feminine you will become so I suggest you keep her close and out of harms way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the door to the principal's office opened and you were both dismissed.

However, I now see that it would be best if Hayley lead the tour so it would be seen as it truly is, a sister showing off her Alma Matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps one of us should accompany them then.\" Offering a compromise, Miss Verse said. \"At least this way we can guarantee our visitor has a pleasant tour of our fine school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\" Smiling, Elvira replied. \"However, I believe this falls under the jurisdiction of the school prefects; I will summon them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick phone call, four teenage girls in security uniforms entered the office with serious expressions on their faces. They spotted you immediately and turned to Elvira. \"Has this boy caused trouble on campus, madam head witch?\" The first girl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, this is Tia Winters, Lee Summers, Val Fall, and Mia Spring.\" Motioning to the girls, Elvira said. \"They are this school's top prefects and Rogue Hunter cadets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rogue Hunters?\" Confused, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Witch police.\" Firmly but kindly, Miss Verse replied. \"They help enforce the laws of magic and protect the masquerade that witches do not exist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira nodded then turned to the prefects. \"Ladies, I would like to introduce you to my grandson; John Harrison whom I am certain you have already been briefed regarding his potential.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prefects turned slightly pale as they looked at you then they saw Hayley and sighed slightly. \"I take it Mr John Harrison is here for a tour with his sister.\" More calmly, Tia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct.\" Firmly, Elvira said. \"I am entrusting you four to ensure nothing unfortunate happens to our guests during their stay. As John told me, he just wants the facts, not a sales pitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four girls nodded, a bright smile forming upon their faces. \"John and Hayley are in good hands, madam head witch.\" Saluting, Mia said. \"We will ensure a pleasant and informative tour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, the four teenagers lead you and Hayley out of the office to begin the tour.

She was quite muscular for her age, clearly a tomboy. She motioned to an empty classroom where a lone female teacher was preparing her desk for up coming lessons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon the intrusion, Miss Lucy.\" Politely, Lee said. \"We are giving a extra special guest a tour of the school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLee was an inch taller than Tia with short brown hair and hazel eyes. She was not muscular but you sensed that her magic was strong. Hayley noticed you blushed slightly at her comment but remained silent though you did see the hint of a bemused grin. Lucy was tall and slender with auburn hair and brown eyes.  She turned to the prefects with a single eyebrow raised, carrying a curious look on her face. \"Every student who comes here is special in their own way.\" Firmly but kindly, she said. \"How do you see this one individual as extra special?\" She smiled upon seeing Hayley then gave a bemused smile to you. \"Welcome back, Hayley.\" Kindly, she said. \"I see your little brother has discovered magic a little earlier than you had planned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John Harrison shows great potential.\" Politely, Val said. \"He is considering this school but fears a sales pitch rather than the facts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVal was the shortest of the group. She had mid-back black hair and green eyes. She was not strong in appearance but you sensed her magic was almost as strong as your sister's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I just learned about all of this today.\" Blushing, you said. \"I was told I needed to make a choice, might or magic, but I need more facts before I can make such a life changing decision.\" You scuffed his feet, nervous. \"I'm not more special than anyone else... honestly, I'd rather be an athlete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy smiled kindly though you suspected she was holding back a giggle. \"It is very rare to meet a humble roughneck.\" Bemused, she said. \"Many witch boys almost immediately go into a mental power trip when they discover the physical powers they have at their command.\" She giggled slightly. \"To be fair, I have also met young girls of witch blood who fell down the same path due to their magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you teach in your class?\" Curious, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I teach the uses and laws of magic.\" Firmly but kindly, Lucy explained. \"The uses and laws of boy magic is equally important. There is a balance and we must be careful to maintain it to avoid repeating past mistakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you give an example?\" Showing interest, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lucy could respond, a loud boom was heard that shook the room followed by alarms and buzzers sounding from everywhere. \"It's a magical back draft!\" Startled, Mia announced. \"Lock down the room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whipped your head around just as Hayley did to find the prefects quickly pull their wands from their blazers and pointed them at the door, causing it to close then glow for a moment. This made you visibly worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on?!\" Firmly, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A student has likely tried to use a spell beyond her ability to control.\" Serious, Mia explained. \"This causes a magical back draft as the magic used has no where to go but explode outward like a bomb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia was the tallest of the group with short auburn hair and brown eyes. She was visibly strong with strong magic as well. You had no idea what was going on but your mind was already exploring options to make a run for it, taking Hayley with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay close to me.\" Firmly, Lucy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother loud boom was heard and you saw a support beam falling from the ceiling.

Not that you could tell exactly what was said, but from mom's reaction, it probably involved a stern lecture. After fifteen minutes, Elvira herself walked up to you, flanked by Lucy. Mom was nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is mom?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Making herself scarce. You're not the first to be transformed by her own mother, and not the first for it to occur accidentally, but you're the first on school grounds\" Elvira said humorlessly. \"We'll try to make this transition as painless as possible, but there could be complications.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Complications? What complications?\" you demanded, suddenly concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're magically potent, and it may be that you remain a girl longer even if you're not in school. Still, we have one thing in common\" Lucy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you said with a half growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy Conners, met Lucy Harrison\" Elvira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy? You gave me a girl's name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd look foolish Lu, with a boy's name. Still, you're be with girls with a similar story to you. One that was transformed permanently because her mother wanted a daughter, one that got transformed trying to help that said daughter, another that thought drinking from an unmarked bottle was a 'good' idea, one that lost a bet against a witch and was turned into a little girl, and one that thought trying on his girlfriend's... well, ex-girlfriend's uniform would be a good laugh. Speaking of uniforms, I have yours right here\" Lucy said as she thrust into your hands a uniform. You scowled as you saw it consisted of white plain underwear, black maryjanes, knee length socks, a blue pleated skirt, white blouse that was secured by a ribbon; you didn't want to wear any part of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The clothing was comfortable but it left you feeling out of place as you still saw yourself as a teenage boy rather than a little girl. Elvira had left by the time you came out and Lucy was waiting for you alone. \"Elvira had to attend a meeting but you will see her here and there throughout the school year.\" Kindly, she said. \"Allow me to introduce you to your classmates, Lu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not fair.\" Tearfully, you said. \"Why can't I, or the others, be changed back and sent home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like the real world, magic is not always fair.\" Honestly, Lucy replied. \"However, it does carry a balance; a good and bad side to everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry but I don't see a good side here.\" Frowning, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy smiled. \"You will, in time.\" Patiently, she said. \"Everyone in your class feels that they had been cheated in some way. It is my job to teach them and you magic and show you all how magic is not to be feared or resented but respected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy reached a room and opened the door before ushering you in. You saw what looked like the common room in a frat house in a college scene. There were bunk beds lined up against one long wall with name plates on them, two doors on the second wall leading into two bathrooms, a number of desks facing the third wall with a chalkboard, and what looked like a small chemistry station on either side of the door you had just walked through. Five girls who were talking in the center of the room stopped and turned, curious to see you enter with Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Class, this is our new student, Lucy Harrison.\" Kindly, Lucy said. \"You may call her Lu. Her mother brought her here for a tour only her visitor bracelet proved to be defective and it marked her as a trespasser rather than a visitor.\" She paused then added, \"All I will say is that it was quite the embarrassment for her mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed slightly at the nickname Lucy gave you as the girls walked up to you. From the expressions on their faces, they already knew you were once a boy. Only their surprised looks quickly turned to kind smiles as they each introduced themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first girl was your height with long blond hair and ocean blue eyes. \"I'm Jack, now Jacinta.\" Softly, she said. \"Mom transformed me saying that she wanted a daughter to pass on her magic to and dumped me here to be trained.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second girl was a near mirror image of Jacinta only with light brown hair and ocean blue eyes. \"I'm Paul, now Paula.\" Shaking your hand, she said. \"I tried to save my bro, err, sister by breaking her our of here.\" She blushed brightly, a frown forming on her face. \"Stupid trespassing rule!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were not enrolled because you were trespassing, young lady.\" Firmly but kindly, Lucy said. \"You came onto school grounds as a visitor. You were enrolled because your mother knew you were coming here and told us you wanted to learn magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula turned to Lucy, stunned. A look of betrayal filled her expression. \"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy nodded, a sigh escaping her lips. \"That is why she is now serving a year without magic.\" Serious, she said. \"She forced this upon you both only we did not learn of her illegal actions until afterwords.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When it was too late.\" Pouting, Paula said. \"Am I stuck as a girl too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That remains to be seen.\" Honestly, Lucy said. \"I can not see the future, girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third girl walked up to you with a bemused smile on her face. She had brown eyes and shoulder length auburn hair tied into two pigtails with a blue ribbon on the left and a pink ribbon on the right. You found that rather odd but decided not to question it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Cire, still called Cire.\" Smiling, she said. \"Who knew having a gender neutral name could come in handy around magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your story?\" Curious, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mom called her potion collection her 'pop' stash.\" Rolling her eyes, Cire explained. \"I thought she had a stash of colas somewhere and decided to look for it.\" She laughed in spite of herself. \"Well, I found it and I can tell you her 'pop' has quite the kick to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We found evidence that Cire's mother had baited her into searching for the 'pop' collection.\" Serious, Lucy said. \"However, Cire found her situation, although unfair, to be ironic so charges were not pressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Ty, now Tia.\" Sourly, the fourth girl said. \"I'm here because a witch suckered me into a bet without saying she was a witch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to Tia, surprised. She was slightly shorter than the others with mid back length sun blond hair and sky blue eyes. You refrained from telling her that her pout only made her look more cute. Lucy smiled kindly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you are here because you took a bet from the daughter of a witch and tried to sneak into the house of a known quasi rogue.\" Patiently, she countered. \"That teenage girl who pushed you into the bet is no longer a witch; at least not until she reaches thirteen again. That still does not make you blameless, you willingly trespassed upon a witch's home. She could have done worse than enroll you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quasi rogue?\" Curious, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy smiled. \"A trouble making witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that leaves me.\" Sighing, the fifth girl said. \"I'm David, now Diana. I decided to wear my now former girlfriend's school uniform as a costume for a masquerade party we were invited to.\" She huffed. \"How was I supposed to know it would automatically enroll me here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana was a well built girl for her young age with shoulder length braided brown hair and green eyes. Lucy shook her head, smiling. \"Your former girlfriend was reprimanded for foolishly taking her uniform with her off campus.\" Calmly, she said. \"As I told Lu, magic is not always fair but it does carry a balance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

May I ask what is with the ribbons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCire giggled. \"The blue represents the boy I was and the pink is for the girl I am now.\" Simply, she explained.

I knew that!\" Gruffly, she spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing that quasi rogue sent you here because she sensed strong magic in you.\" Surprising Tia, you said. \"Otherwise, why would she have even bothered to go though the steps to put you, someone with no relation to her, here for a mere trespass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTia seemed stunned. \"I- I don't know.\" Wide eyed, she said. \"I don't think my mom is a witch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mom is immune to magic.\" Cutting in, Lucy said. \"Still, although magic does not effect her, it very quickly accumulates and needs an outlet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What outlet?\" Quivering, Tia demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasped. \"Passing the magic on to the next generation.\" Whispering, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy nodded. \"Quite correct.\" Calmly, she said. \"Tia is the first witch of her blood line. The quasi rogue only intended a temporary gender change to scare 'him'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only it 'kick started' my own magic.\" Pale, Tia finished. She sniffed then smiled slightly. \"I'm the first witch in my family...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That leaves Diana.\" Turning to the pouting girl, you said. \"Something tells me that trying on the uniform alone did not got you enrolled here.\" Thoughtful, you said. Diana winced, confirming your theory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think there is more to it?\" Hiding her smile, Lucy demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you, I can't see the future or the past, Miss Lucy.\" Politely, you said. \"However, I have three sisters; I know when someone is holding something back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the real story?\" Curious, Jacinta asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tell me.\" Defiant, Diana said. \"You are the princess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned. \"I'm thinking you missed your girlfriend so much that you decided to borrow the spare uniform she foolishly took off campus to visit her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana sighed. \"Not quite...\" Tearfully, she admitted. \"She vanished so I figured she had dumped me; I tracked her down to this school and sneaked in to try to win her back.\" She sobbed slightly. \"I know she is not into girls so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. \"You are an idiot!\" Sternly, you barked. \"Your transformation is not permanent so winning your girlfriend back is not a lost cause!\" You scoffed. \"You give up way too easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana looked up at you, hut but then paused as your words sank in and smiled slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Lu is truly a princess.\"</i> Smiling, Lucy thought. <i>\"A reluctant princess to be certain but a princess none the less; she already has the entire class thinking differently about their situation.\"</i> She sighed then thought, <i>\"Now if she could only get herself to see her own situation in a different light.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Elvira is my grandmother, but I never knew any of this until today. I got home from a tiring day at school, when I found a magic book lying on the floor. I picked it up, but before I could investigate, mom came in and showed me magic. First she grew my hair, then... damn it\" you wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Cire asked, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My hair!

All the girls in your family were all the same; blond, curvy and busty, and you were no exception. \"Don't get me wrong.

Within moments the pleated skirt and white blouse were gone, replaced by a blue and white girls' leotard. Jacinta looked slightly shocked, but not overly displeased; her words summed it up. \"It could have been worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like me?\" Paula growled. While you was focused on her sister, Paula's uniform had changed into that of a cheerleader. \"Damn it, Lucy. I told you I don't like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you have to pick a sport. you too, Lu, but I will discuss that later\" Lucy said as she turned her attention to the class. \"As you can see, it does save some time, but both the shown transformations are relatively simple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana interrupted. \"I know where this is going. I don't need.... Lucy!\" Diana screamed as her clothes shifted. Within moments her uniform was replaced by a pink tube top, and denim skirt. She didn't look to happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much more complex, as it changes everything. Still, since Tia is quiet, I will demonstrate that there are other transformations than skirts...\" Lucy said. Tia instantly looked relieved, as she found herself in jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Lucy?\" Paula asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I won't leave her out\"  Lucy said, much to your discomfort. You suddenly felt something wiggle on your own body, and to your horror, you saw that your neckline was receding as your blouse slipped off your shoulders, leaving them bare. It first, you feared you'd end up looking like Diana, since she wore something that screamed 'Mel', but seconds later, you saw you was wearing something far worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You put me into a ball gown!\" you hissed, as you folded your arms over the top of your breasts. All the others were staring, and not all of there looks were 'better you than me'. Some had a slight envious look, like 'you're pretty.'</span></div></div>",

Only you froze as Cire gasped. \"Her magic levels have really gone up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh!\" Stunned, Tia exclaimed. \"How can she have that much power?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't notice any changes to yourself other than the heat of your own annoyance but hearing your classmates, you turned to Lucy worried. She nodded, a serious look on her face. \"Strong emotions such as anger and fear augment magic.\" Firmly, she explained. \"Having a twin sister, who is also a witch, Lu's magical power is augmented again. Then there is the fact that she comes from one of the most magically powerful families in existence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that way Elvira said my magic is potent?\" Wincing, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy sighed. \"Partially, yes.\" Softly, she said. \"Strong emotion will augment any witch's power, hence Jacinta needed training.\" She then changed your ball gown back to the school uniform. \"It is also why you need training in case your transformation ends up being permanent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will strong emotions make her, or any of us girls and witches for life?\" Tearing up, Paula asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't see into the future, girls.\" Lucy repeated. \"Strong emotions alone will not seal your fates; but it will not help your chances of returning home a boy either.\" She smiled, returning everyone's clothing back to the school uniform. \"Not all lessons are obvious. Keep an open mind and keep your cool; these are the keys to doing well here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was the point of annoying us?\" Curious, Tia demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at each other, class.\" Serious, Lucy instructed. \"Once magic is used against you, your body and mind develop the ability to detect it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at your fellow classmates and gasped seeing a strange aura around all of them, including Miss Lucy whose aura was very strong with vibrant colors. \"What is with the different colors?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you looked at a radar map and noticed the various colors marking intensity in a storm?\" Smiling, Lucy asked. \"Magical aura's work the same way, it is how our eyes interpret it. The bolder the color, the more powerful the magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about my aura?\" Curious, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy sighed. \"Your aura is very strong, Lu.\" Serious, she replied. \"That is why you need to be trained.\" She then smiled again. \"Also, you are not required to wear the uniform on off days so having a little fashion sense will help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes. \"Wonderful...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy then motioned to the desks. \"Now, we move on to...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Basically magic can do a lot, but it does have limitations. As much as I would like to, I can't, for example, turn that Kristy Hart into a dog. Only humanoid transformations. I could give a two year old boy Kristy a tail though..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why haven't you?

It would be easy for you to suddenly adjust to both magic powers and a switch in gender.

Only mom could, and even then, she would have to answer for her actions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those girls did\" you said in a cold voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, they did. Troubled girls.

You know enough about girls, and much younger brothers, Lu. Look at our cousins. Sadly, some decide to toy with their new found powers. Like our 'friend' Cassie. She doesn't spend her time trying to hit on you; she also changes her brother for a couple of hours a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you're saying doesn't make sense. Shouldn't she be in trouble?\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a reason why her family has a poor reputation.

I'll deal with them later for a gross violation of rules and protocol once I've dealt with Mr Harrison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two witches that came in with your grandmother nodded, and took the two troublemakers away, both seemingly frozen with terror.

I can enrol you if you desire, and allow you to get some measure of revenge on those two. If you do so, you will become a witch. Option two is to send you home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't go home looking like this!\" you protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. We'll clean you up, give you a haircut, new clothes. Unfortunately, there is nothing I can do for your... problem, and it may be that your body will change before I can find a solution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a teen, John. Unfortunately due to those two's meddling, you're going to face girl's puberty. Sooner or later, it will become obvious that your hips are widening, or that your chest is becoming puffy and sore. It would be easier if you were a few years younger, but... I'm sorry. The other option is to cut your loses, dress you up, and send you home as the teenaged girl you unfortunately are.  I'm sorry to be blunt, but it will avoid the major fight that will occur if and when your boy disguise fails with our second option.\"</span></div></div>",

First is you won't tell anyone about this place, especially Megan. If you do, I complete the transformation.

I honestly want you to beat this, but to be honest, I don't think you have a chance. You're just setting yourself for trouble. Katie, opinions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're guessed right.

It took several minutes for the potion to take effect, but eventually, your hair lengthened past your shoulders. Of course, you was completely unaware, worn from the stresses of the day and transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, you was dozing, still anxious about what was going to happen to you. Sports was out, amongst other things, and you had to find a reason to explain your now blond hair. Plus mom had kept saying 'nine days' before your disguise would start to become compromised. You gave yourself a week before a bra was added to the panties you was forced to wear. As you missed, you felt an odd tickle against your neck. Opening your eyes  you saw your longer strands. Horrified, you screamed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, you thought mom had to be wrong, that you was transforming overnight, but after a few seconds, you realized it had to magic. The transformation you was fearing was due to your own body's teenage chemistry; and for hair to grow this long took months. Furious, you yelled, \"Melanie, you stupid airhead! Get in her right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Mel stuck her head into your room, looking both tired and annoyed. You didn't care; she had to have been the one that had done this to you. \"Don't call me an airhead, sis, or I'll... what have you done to your hair?\" Mel said, her angry voice twisting to giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must have done this to me\" you snapped, resisting the urge to tell her not to act stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't do this, sis\" Mel protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then who did? Either you did it, Hayley did it, or mom did it\" you said coldly, letting her know who you thought was responsible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't\" Mel protested before adding, \"I better cut your hair, even though it, like, looks totally you. You can't go to school like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                 ***********************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with the new hair color?\" Harry asked as you met him before school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meanie happened. She wanted to play hairdresser\" you growled humorlessly. Of course, you knew you couldn't mention the main part, that she cut your supernaturally longer hair, after she had taken time to test various girlish styles on your hair. \"Least you don't have to worry about things like that. Got anything after school? I need to get away from the girls right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Planning a mall trip\" Harry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forester?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's weird, but I can get some good stuff\" Harry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's a bit of a mess and it'll take time to sort it all out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry smiled. \"You're a good friend to warn me about this.\" With a brotherly hug, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day went surprisingly well with only a few strange comments from teachers and friends about you losing weight and looking shorter than before. Nothing to raise heavy concern, but the principal sent you home with a note to see a doctor before returning to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mood was not improved as you reached home and gave mom the note from the principal. She sighed seeing it. \"I told you you made a bad choice, John.\" Softly, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my life, mom.\" You squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"It is your life but even you must realize that there are some things that can not be fixed.\" Firmly but kindly, she countered. \"Magic is not always fair but i can promise you, it does form a balance; a gain for every loss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile mom called Dr. Thompson, Hayley walked up, looking concerned. \"John, did you tell Harry about aunt Forester?\" Frowning, she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told him not to go to her shop alone because she is involved in some family issues.\" Honestly, you replied. \"When mom told me about magic, I remembered her warnings about her and put two and two together.\" You winced, \"Why? What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley sighed. \"You should have told me first, sis.\" Wearily, she scolded. \"Harry said he was going...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You know what would happen if you do\" Hayley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt comforted by her concern and desire to stop and reverse your transformation, but you knew you had to go. It was useless to avoid Forester and satisfy mom's demands in that regard only to fail in keeping Harry unaware of magic. Even if it was due to Forester herself; if mom was feeling creative, she could say that you set things in motion, and decide its enough grounds to accelerate your metamorphosis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm screwed if I don't. That's why you're coming with me. We intercept Harry, and mom would have to believe you that I'm avoiding Forester\" you said, grabbing Hayley by the wrist. \"besides, we can talk on the way. I want some answers of my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley allowed you to drag her out of the house. \"Okay, first thing I want to know is what is the deal with mom and Samantha Forester?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't fully know. Something happened to them when they were teens, but mom isn't telling. All I know is that Sam is real good at the gender spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next question. Why is she so eager to change me? She certainly is keen to get me fitted for a bra, then a skirt\" you said, nearly hissing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She doesn't want to see you hurt. Next\" Hayley said, a little too short for your liking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still doesn't make it right\" you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but somethings things just happen\" Hayley said, agreeing with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what about Harry? Or Megan? I was told to keep quiet about magic\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing the real question is what about them in a weeks time. They're not ready to learn about magic. Neither was you, John\" Hayley said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last thing. This wasn't amongst my list of things she would girlify me over, but I suspect the principal is a witch\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree. Odd that mom didn't mention that\" Hayley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did mom insist on that list anyway?\" you demanded, unhappily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Measure of control to prevent you doing anything reckless\" Hayley said, as you arrived at the mall. You and Hayley raced in, and to your relief, found Harry by the arcade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you guys doing here?\" Harry asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanted to apologize. I should have told you why. Mom doesn't really like Forester, and hasn't done so since she was a kid\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kind of got that, but what is going on, John?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She kind of dabbles in the paranormal\" you said carefully. harry turned and stared at you, missing Hayley's warning nudge into your side. She obviously thought you was losing your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? So kind of witch?\" Harry scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be ridiculous. Its all a big con, and I guess mom doesn't want to see her ripping you off and getting rich off of you\" you said, thinking quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nothing else about her told you that she was a dangerous witch; instead she looked like a woman in casual clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley also looked disturbed; she hadn't detected Samantha's approach. You raised an eyebrow, as if you was question the next move. Hayley nodded in reply, as if saying to shut up and that she would handle it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not, but you're still trouble\" Hayley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax ladies, but I won't have you slandering my reputation. Why don't you come into my shop and see for yourself\" Samantha offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paled slightly. Having her bump into you was one thing, but willingly walking inside, in direct defiance was another, especially with mom's threats over your head. You turned to Hayley and shook your head. She gave a slight approving smile, much to your relief. Calmed by this you wondered if you could 'accidently' bump into the witch in the future. Assuming that she doesn't do anything insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with you two? John, you came with me last week\" Harry said in slight disbelief, as he walked towards the antique shop. \"See you both later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha gave a slight grin. \"I'll see both of you girls later\" she said, causing you to take a step back so you actually was at the entrance to a shop. She pretended not to notice and walked away, much to your relief. Hayley wasn't as calm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, I detected multiple spells ranging from twenty yards. All Samantha's\" Hayley said distastefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any on me?\" you asked, worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that I can tell, but look where you are\" Hayley said, her voice changing slightly to slight bemusement. Your face fell; it was a lingerie store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samantha would have known about your changes.... sis, and must had thought this place would be an appropriate way to teach you not to 'slander' her. Plus you have seven days before you actually need to come here. As I told you last night, I was going to be the poor sucker that was going to do that job, and that I'd do it somewhere a couple hours away so you don't get recognised, but I think Samantha has taken care of that problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around and saw that the entire shop was empty, and instead of an assistant, there was a bell that had a 'ring for assistance' sign. </span></div></div>",

That meant going to school, even though you were effectively banned for a week on 'medical grounds'. Quickly you got dressed, minus the bra (though you did stuff it into a bag), and walked out the door before anyone intercepted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes later you arrived at the front of the school, still relatively early. There wasn't many people around which suited you fine; you wanted to get rid of the evidence. Walking quickly, you headed down the main corridor to your locker.

Right?\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am, and that information does not leave this room.

What made you decide to wear that?\" Hayley said to you during lunch. It was just you and her; Mel had driven you to the point of almost wanting to throttle her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not by choice\" you said sourly. \"Do you know how embarrassing this is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do actually\" Hayley said. \"I take it that this is Thorn's doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering her threat, you remained silent. Hayley laughed. \"Sorry sis, but I've heard of her and her style. Can't blame her; dealing with this school is enough to drive anyone crazy. Look at Mel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you do anything about it? She has been giggling at me all day, and I'm sick of it!\" you complained, not caring that it made her look even more like a ditzy airhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but... damn it\" Hayley said softly. You turned to see what caused her to stop, and saw it was the other crazy person of the school, Cassie Bane. Unfortunately, she was a witch and could clearly see your girlish outfit. She immediately smiled, walked you to Hayley and yourself, and uninvited took a seat and sat down. You felt a tinge of annoyance as you realized she was checking you out, or least the more feminine parts of you; it was well known Cassie despised guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking good, John\" Cassie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back off Bane. These transformations don't work like that. Any relationship you're hoping with her is doomed from the start\" Hayley said quietly, menacing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to help\" Cassie said sweetly, smiling just as sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Like, so what are they?\" Mel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tears in our reality. Fairly uncommon, but its where magic of a different reality, a different universe seeps in. Naturally, it is only short range, but I'm talking about something irrelevant. John's case is she was attacked by the troubled girls, and their magic had a <i>lot </i>of malice\" Catherine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel, and especially Hannah looked confused, but Hayley was nodding.

Melanie, Hayley, could you join Hannah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Mel's turn to pout, but eventually, you was left alone with your aunt. \"Is there any point to this?\" you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is.

What do you know a weregirl?\" Catherine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you said, surprised. \"Weregirl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its exactly what you suspect it is.

What, a mermaid?\" you scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One reason why I didn't want to say it in front of Hannah. No, he doesn't go fins when wet. No, its more like her voice in rather enticing. For that reason, and others, he prefers to remain in a male form, though I suspect she likes the girl form to cause mischief...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you make someone invisible?\" you snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can\" Catherine said as a familiar voice started whining.

We all have to face our fears;  you're making a great Beauty, and now, I have to face mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" Tina spluttered, but you hadn't the energy to argue with her. You walked to the study, and entered it, where mom, Catherine and Hayley were talking, though they dropped whatever conversation they were having once they knew you was around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get to Witchbloom, and no, I do not intend to stay\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" mom demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to face the witches that did this to me. It is the only way to reverse whatever they did to me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, what you wish to do is incredibly risky. I do not have a bracelet for you. If I was to teleport you, I would have to send you to Elvira's office. If I miss, you will be enrolled, and you will remain a girl forever. This includes the option of me teleporting you outside of school grounds and for you to walk in. Are you prepared to take such a chance?\" mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if believe you can teleport me\" you said, slightly dismayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can Just hold still\" mom said, as she sent you on your way. Once you was gone, Hayley said, \"I can't believe you lied about her change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Partial truth. Your sister's fears are what is keeping her female. Her own body is what is reinforcing and accelerating the change. I see you didn't have the heart to say anything yourself\" Catherine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you reappeared...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The life I had as John was taken away from me and I might not ever get it back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you might not.\" Calmly, Elvira replied. \"However, that shouldn't stop you from becoming who you want to be or reaching the goals you make for yourself.\" She rose from her seat. \"Regardless if you are named John or Lucy Harrison, you will always be my fiery grandchild, the one who charges forward, fearing nothing or no one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I'm scared of magic.\" Disappointment in your voice, you said. \"It's what turned my life upside down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira smiled. \"Fear is like any other emotion, it can be controlled and conquered.\" Touching your shoulder, she said. \"Even I wrestle with that unpleasant emotion from time to time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Unconvinced, you asked. \"You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even the most powerful of people have their fears.\" Serious, Elvira explained. \"Only this is not about me; its about you.\" She smiled. \"I doubt its magic you are fearing. I think you're just mad because two <i>girls</i> got the better of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze, your eyes wide as if you had been slapped in the face. For a moment, you could have heard a pin drop in Elvira's office before you lightly punched her shoulder. \"Grandma...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira giggled with you soon joining. \"I know where your buttons are, kiddo.\" Grinning, she said. \"You have a lot of your father in you.\" She then turned serious. \"If you truly believe you must face the witches who attacked you here, I will arrange it. However, you must go as you are, a teenage girl. They will see a boy disguise as hiding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira summoned a visitor bracelet and pushed it onto your wrist before waving her hand, placing you in a modest skirt and blouse with knee length socks and black maryjanes. She then pressed a button on her desk just before a young woman entered. \"You called for me, madam head witch?\" Politely, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Tanner, this is my grandchild, Lucy Harrison.\" Motioning to you, Elvira said. \"She believes she must face the troubled witches who had attacked her here a few days ago.\" She then carefully whispered, <i>\"Take the scenic route.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Tanner smiled then nodded and turned to you. \"This way, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did not hear what Elvira whispered to Tanner but you were too focused on facing the troubled witches to think about it. Tanner took you down a long hall where many girls were attending their first class of the school year. Curious, you looked though the windows as you passed. In one room, you saw the teacher showing the class mathematics, something you were quite talented in. You had to be to join the many sports you loved. \"Why are they teaching math here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Potion making is an exact art.\" Simply, Tanner replied. \"Much like following a recipe; too much or too little changes how the potion works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know magic was like that.\" Honestly, you said. \"I thought it was like an instinct or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of it is.\" Nodding, Tanner said. \"Only its a lot more than just that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou passed another window and paused seeing a flame burning in a teacher's hand. Your first instinct was to change into the room and help put out the fire only you froze, your eyes dancing as you saw the flame turn into a horse and gallop around the room. \"Woah...\" Whispering, you said. \"Did you see that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanner inwardly giggled. \"That is rather simple spell, Miss Harrison.\" Lightly, she said. \"It's taught to the first years here to show them magic can be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanner lead you through a number of halls, passed several classes where you saw more and more magic being used. \"We are almost there, Miss Harrison.\" Kindly, she said. \"The troubled witches are usually kept isolated from the other students and I think you can guess why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded but your focus was no longer on the troubled witches, you were more interested in seeing what was being taught at this school. \"I should have stayed long enough for the tour.\" Dreamily, you muttered. \"This magic stuff is kind of cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanner pretended not to hear you as she passed one final room where you stopped dead in your tracks upon looking into the window. You saw a teacher firing spells at Mel who was deflecting them with some effort with a class of younger students watching with wide eyes. \"What's going on in there?\" Worried, you demanded. \"Is that some kind of combat demonstration?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is the defense against rogue witches class.\" Standing next to you, Tanner replied. \"Like everyone else, sometimes, witches go bad. Young witches need to know how to defend themselves and their male relatives from magic attacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, they don't need my help...\" Downcast, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They do need your help, Lucy.\" Serious, Tanner countered. \"So, when you are done moping and ready take on the world again, your family will be there for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking in Tanner's words, a small grin formed onto your face. \"Miss Tanner, forget about those stuck up troubled witches...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The witch tests were designed to find character flaws in each of her children and help correct them before they end up walking down the wrong path. \"I intend to use Lucy's transition into girlhood as a test for everyone.\" Simply, she said. \"If a family can help Lucy adapt and accept her new life without sparking a magic war, they are going to grow up just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley sighed at that. \"Who do you think will have the hardest time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom frowned. \"I think you already know the answer to that one.\" Serious, she replied.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As Harry began to show off his collection she was even more amazed as almost every piece of Harry's collection was an incredibly dangerous artifact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \" So what do you think of my collection Mrs. H?\" Harry asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" IT is amazing, but wha'ts even more Amazing is that you haven't turned into a girl by all the Magic in this collection.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Why would a collection turn me into a girl? If it hasn't so far then I guess it'd be safe for me to keep it.\" Harry said. Unfortunately that wasn't the case. If Harry was immune to magic then he wouldn't have been able to have his body swappe with Mel. No this had to be something different, then it came to your mother the answer she found it. Harry was affected by his collection just in a rather unique and yet dangerous way. Natalie Harrison had come to the conclusion that Harry was actually a weregirl and completely unaware of his transformations. Unfortunately to confirm this she would need the help of Megan's mother if this were the actual case.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \" Harry your collection of artifacts is too dangerous and I am afraid that I must collect them and keep you as far as way possible for the time being.\" Your mother said. She then called and notified the Head Witch of  every collectible Harry had and within moments his collection of dangerous artifacts were no more. As for the next part would be the most difficult part especially for Harry and John. Before she had to go to Megan's mother and confim her suspicions. As Dr. Megan began the test on Harry which she insisted Harry take, fortunately Harry had no problem it...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Pleased with herself, Mel said, \"Problem solved. We should like, have a swim since we're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan hesitated, but the decision was taken from her as Mel repeated the spell. Seconds later, Megan's clothes had twisted into a bikini or her own. She gave a half scream. \"Mel.

Your chest looked slightly swollen, and worse, your nipples were slightly enlarged, and had a darker color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melanie! What have you done?!\" you ranted, knowing that your chest looked like what it would if you were about to undergo female puberty. \"I know what this is. Change me back right.... Damn it, I mean NOW!\"  Already furious, you watched as your nipples deepened and grew out even more. After they tripled in size, you felt a slight pressure in your chest as two small lumps formed. They didn't stay small; the lumps rapidly expanded almost like a balloon. You were silent as the womanly flesh on your chest became larger than Megan's, but as your breasts grew larger than Mel's, you exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a girl! If you won't stop your magic, I'll try it myself\" you snapped. Even though Megan's and Mel's attention was directed at your altered body, Mel managed (barely) to keep the book away from you, which in itself was a very bad sign. Looking around your body, you saw that you had lost considerable muscle mass, as well as some height, explaining why you couldn't overpower her. Agility wise, you were outgunned, as your torso was changing. You couldn't move as easily, not used to your expanding hips, or the increasingly obvious hourglass shape of your body. Nor could you handle the strange feeling of extra padding in your rapidly inflating rear as it become heart shaped. Tripping, you landed on your inflated rear, and watched helplessly as your arms and legs changed. All the hair on them instantly fell out as they shifted into a thinner, more feminine looking form.  The changes progressed to your hands and feet; they slimmed down as easily as your limbs, and unsurprisingly, your fingernails and toenails grew out slightly before they were coated in a hot pink lacquer. Immediately after your limbs, you felt a tingling feeling in your groin. Sobbing slightly, you watched the slight bulge in your bikini bottoms shrink down into nothingness, followed by a weird twisting, and inflating feeling as your internal femineity completed itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Quickly scanning the page, you found what you were looking for, and gave an enraged squeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melanie. If you had taken the time to read the spell, you would have known it would have done this to me\" you snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Mel said as she took the book an started to read.

Calm down\" you ordered, but your airheaded twin was far too gone to even listen to your words. She took multiple steps back, almost like if she was about to run. While you were unhappy about things, at least you retained your perspective. Being a beach babe in a pink bikini that showed way too much skin  (though to be fair, anything short of a one piece with overlying clothes was too much skin) was very bad, but you knew you needed Mel to get home. Megan also was relatively calm, as the only thing that directly happened to her was a clothing change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right. John...\" Megan said, but all it did was drive Mel further into panic. Your attempt to grab her wrist was the thing that snapped Mel's hold on reality. She turned and ran up the dunes as fast as she could go. You took a few steps to follow, but Megan blocked your path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to talk to her\" you protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let her go, John\" Megan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just calm down.

Nothing seems right; you're far too calm\" Megan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe\" Megan responded in a dry voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe? Maybe this thing makes the target calmer, so they don't freak out\" you said, picking up the discarded magic book..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just be careful with that thing\" Megan pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to cast the first thing I see\" you muttered. To your relief, you could see some sort of text, but you frowned at the message. While it didn't mention your name, it acknowledged you, as the reader, as a young witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I can see text, but.... I says I'm a witch\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you can reverse this?\" Megan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but what if I does something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" Megan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think? It said 'witch'. I don't want to end up in bras and skirts\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan gave a bemused grin, which you found irritating. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you would jump at the chance of becoming a guy, Jenny. Or at least get out of that cute bikini of yours\" Megan giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instantly frowned. Still giggling, Megan said, \"I'm teasing. This has been a shock for me too. Don't like Jenny?

All these spells seem to be female orientated...\" you said in a half growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you'd find something, though if you're stuck, it's not the end of the world, Jo. We'd be bff's. I can get you some cute clothes, give ourselves makeovers, have you join me on the squad...\" Megan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to disappoint you, but I think I've found something\" you said in a dryer than normal voice. Quickly, you cast the spell, but as the last words came from your mouth, you realized you made a mistake. You swore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit. I shouldn't have done that!\" you said, worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Megan asked, suddenly worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't a gender reverse spell\" you said as you felt the material of the bikini change into a soft cotton. It also changed color, as the hot pink faded into a very pale pink. The straps of the bikini turned bra disappeared, as some lace of bows material, before the new bra pushed your breasts together as it finalized its form as a strapless, padded push up bra, similar to something Mel would wear. She bikini bottoms fared marginally better as they became a pair of matching panties, but they served as a bigger reminder of your new femineity even compared to the bra. You felt the lack of your dick even more keenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You changed your clothes?\" Megan asked, surprised, but annoyed. \"You scared me. You should have told me you were testing a clothing spell before you said you made a mistake\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. It was a reversal spell, but I only realized it reverses the clothing spell. I'm becoming what I'd look like if I really was airhead's sister\" you said, wincing. Much to your distaste, some clothes were materializing onto your body, which unfortunately, were in the more girlish range. Seconds flew past, you saw that you were now wearing a pale pink tube top, and white skirt. The skirt was, in your opinion, too short, even though it was mid thigh, but the top was your real concern. The showed far too much of your midriff, and thanks to your bra, your breasts. You gave a short, high pitched shriek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Megan was also outraged, but for different reasons; she hated the idea that her emotions were being magically manipulated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the Princess now, and cannot be going around being called 'John'\" Elvira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No arguments, Princess.....\"</span></div></div>",

Displeased was an understatement, and you didn't believe Elvira's reasoning for her to call you 'Ella'. As you struggled to pull the gloves off, Megan opened the door, and walked up to you. You were too busy struggling with your clothes to even notice her approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you going, Ellie?\" Megan asked, her voice gentle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised and annoyed, you jumped. \"How did you get in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't lock the door\" Megan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it.

I can't let anyone see me like this! Grandma would have sent Mel home around the same time she sent us home. Hannah would have gotten home by now, and considering how I look, she would think her birthdays have come at once. I don't need my princess obsessed sister following me 24/7.

While she was gone, you struggled with your gown, but you had the same success trying to remove it as you did with the gloves. Feeling frustrated by the fact you couldn't even find the zipper, you noticed a pale flame was erupting from your right hand . Like Mel, you flame seemed to be erratic, but it also seemed to be stronger. The flame also seemed to pass through the gloves, leaving it completely unharmed.

The first to arrive was Hannah, your youngest, princess obsessed sister, who, once she saw you, stood in the front of your room with her mouth open, like if she was happily surprised. Making matters worse, she too was in a blue, Cinderella inspired dress. Next was Mel, and your twin had a slightly shocked look on her face. While she knew your predicament, she expected a girl dressed for the beach and not one ready for a ball. You barely had enough time to scowl, as you blamed her for your plight. Finally, to make a bad situation worse, Hayley, the sister that you hadn't seen for a year, stuck her head though the door. She was the sister that pre disappearance was closest to you due to her (relative) tomboyish nature, but right now, you didn't want her to be anywhere near you. The fact that none of them looked surprised to see you as a girl was troubling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away\" you whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Ella\" Hayley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head shot up at the mention of that name. Not only because of Hannah, but also the time factor. It had only been a couple of minutes since Elvira cursed you with that name, and the only other person to hear it was Megan. No way she could have talked. \"What?\" you hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know your science, right?\" Hayley said, taking the lead. \"Time isn't absolute. What seemed a couple of minutes for you and Megan was in fact one hour. Enough time to pull me from Witchbloom and explain the situation to Hannah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Witchbloom?\" Hannah asked, though her eyes never left you. You felt your teeth slowly grind, knowing she was already hero worshipping you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley sighed. \"I told you. It's a magic school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Now, you've seen me. Can you now go?\" you said with mock politeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you scream?\" Mel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, you stupid airhead?!\" you snapped, as your temper got the better of you. \"I've been turned into a frigging girl, thanks to you, stuck in this damn dress which I can't get off, got Hannah looking at me, and got this flame coming out of my hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Mel and Hannah stared at you, as if you had slapped them. Hayley remained passive, though she gave a sight nod. \"I can understand your point of view, Ellie.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't call me that!\" you snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but you are the Princess, whether you like if or not. I'm certain it's not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, genius. How did you figure that out?\" you said dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I don't know.

You should be able to do this\" Megan said, crossly staring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to take that chance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan remained silent for a few seconds. \"Not really, but do you want to go downstairs, and be paraded in front of Mrs H?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, but want do you want me to do? Stay here with you and pout? You know what Mel would ask us if we stay up here\" you said with a slight shudder. Boy-Megan was slightly too attractive. Sighing, you kicked off the heels that had materialised with the dress, cautiously opened your bedroom door and looked for signs of your sisters. None of them were around, so you slipped out of your room and closed the door. Mom was easy to find; she was in her study, seemingly waiting for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this must be hard for you, sweetie, but for what's it worth, you are pretty\" mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but I had to say it. How did you get yourself that dress? Been playing with your book?\" mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Hayley happened. Her idea to get rid of these damn gloves is for me to date a boy-Megan. I need you to turn her back\" you said through gritted teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Before I do anything, I want to ask a few questions. Why have you come to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't trust myself to do it. I've seen what an incompetent witch can do\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't let your sister hear you say that\" mom lightly scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan said the same thing\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why haven't you gone on the date?\" mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you gone insane? Which reason do you want? The fact I don't think it'll work, or the fact neither of us want to be seen?\" you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think that you can not remove the gloves?\" mom asked, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma said something implying it\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.  Maybe you should go on this date anyway. A good night out would do you good, Princess\" mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me. I know a good restaurant on the other side of the planet so you won't be seen. Been to Australia before?\" mom said, slightly mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare!\" you gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Feeling frustrated, you sat down on your bed, which itself felt weird and closed your eyes, trying to think of an answer. After ten minutes of silence, your phone rang.

My voice!\" Even with a calming spell, Harry eyes showed her panic as she noticed that with every word, her voice became increasingly higher pitched. It wasn't just her voice; her face rapidly became more feminine. Her face quickly became more rounded as her other features softened. Her checkbones  became more prominent as they raised, and they were highlighted as a small spattering of freckles formed around her more petite nose. The other change was her lips; they were pinker and slightly more pronounced. Other than that, Harry hadn't changed too much. She didn't have the curves you and Mel had.

She also ignored all your calls for her to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to go after her\" you muttered, turning red. The gloves, still stuck to your arms was still in your mind, and you didn't relish the idea of someone, most likely Harry's parents, seeing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't advise it. Even the closest to us often react in this manner when exposed to magic. Give her time to cool off, and process what had happened\" mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to try\" you said, ignoring her advice. Five minutes later, you knocked on Harry's front door, and as feared, it was opened by Harry's mom. She gave you an odd look, mainly due to the gloves and the fact her 'daughter' had fled inside a few minutes earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is with the gloves, Elle, and why has my daughter come home crying? Is it over some boy?\" Harry's mom said, causing you to wince. All your fears were correct; she perceived you as Elle, must had thought you grew up as a girl, thinks Harry is Candice, and can see the gloves. The only good thing it that you're still best friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that. I just want to talk. About Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it! You both like the same boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.....\" you said, knowing you made things worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I talk to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can try, but if Candice doesn't want to talk...\" Harry's mom said, trailing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou headed up to Harry's room, which to your surprise, was completely girlified. On the middle of her bed, face down, was the new Candice. She was sobbing in her pillow.</span></div></div>",

I talked to mom and she thinks it was coincidence that you changed after what I said. The real person you should be pissed with is that Samantha woman, not me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right.

The girls played dress up?\" Harry asked, staring at your gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Apparently, I'm some kind of 'princess'. Short version, I got told I'm a powerful witch, got dressed up as freaking Cinderella and as a sick joke got named 'Ella'\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you did do this to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way.

On getting rid of your gown. Didn't do a good job\" Harry scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they're stuck to my arms\" you growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry rolled her eyes and grabbed your gloves. After a couple of minutes of tugging, she snapped. \"Did you glue them on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I want them off, Harr-i.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be a bitch, Elle\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I deserved that. This has been the worst day of my life\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's face softened slightly. \"I know. Do you know how heavy these things are?\" she said, motioning to her almost non existent, budding breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes. \"Trade stories with Megan. Hayley's idea of getting rid of these gloves was to turn Megan into my date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big deal. You've wanted that for months\" Harry scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As in a guy and girl. Me as a girl. My favour was to get Megan changed back to normal. Sorry bro, but you came thirty minutes too late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you do it. Change me into a boy\" Harry insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't. I don't want to remain a girl. Is this really going to kill you if you be Candice for the night?

Fight me? My speciality might be gender magic, but I can use elemental magic too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I have to, yes\" you said.

One of the little girls started hugging your waist. You looked down, and groaned. It was Hannah's best friend, Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry sweetie, but I've got to go\" you said, pleased that she didn't recognise you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you just got here\" Emma whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm only here for...\" you started to say, before cutting off mid sentence. One of the advertising boards suddenly changed to <i>Meet Cinderella today from 9am to 12 pm</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Samantha' you thought gloomily, knowing that witch gave you a farewell present. \"H.. Candice. You better go\" you said, knowing you were stuck for another hour at least. Harry didn't respond; she was already walking away, having noticed the initial change of the sign.

It didn't take  genius that she intended Harry to play the role of that particular fish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hours seemed to drag on, and you felt even worse.

At 11:30, you started to head for the exit, much to the disappointment of the crowd. It was more diverse, including some girls from school. Moving through the food court, you bumped into the two girls you didn't want to meet; Megan and Mel. They also had a glum looking Candice with them. From the number of bags she was holding, it looked like she had been dragged through a different kind of hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elle?

Your sister has been through a lot, so of course she'd forget\" Megan lightly scolded. A faint smile formed on your face from Megan's defence, but her next comment caused your smile to fade. \"We'll head for the bathrooms and change into our uniforms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uniforms?\" you sputtered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.

I don't have the athletic skill to do it, and then we'd have that bitch Kristy targeting us\" you said, hoping Megan would accept that line of thought. The head cheerleader, Kristy, hated the fact that younger students managed to make her squad, even though Megan was extremely talented. You failing would be enough justification in her mind to ban you both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Kristy. She'll target us no matter what we do, Elle. Come on\" she said, grabbing your hand . Reluctantly, she lead you to a bathroom and pushed you into a stall along with a bag with a cheerleader outfit. You shuddered; wearing it would generate a lot of attention, but not as much as your Cinderella costume. Reluctantly, you put it on, annoyed that there was no reaction from your body from either undressing, or actually being dressed like a cheerleader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I'm dressed\" you said, exiting the stall, shortly after Megan. She was identically dressed as you, except her hair was actually tidied into a high ponytail. Plus, she didn't have any gloves on, something she eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't tried to get them off\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, Meg. You know I want them off, but I can't...\" you snapped. Your anger must had generated a magical reaction, as the contrast of the gloves faded. They were still on your arms, but looked more transparent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better. Let me do your hair. It's a mess\" Megan offered, knowing that it'll annoy you. Besides, it really was a mess, and needed to be done. Her ploy worked as she restyled your hair, the gloves became transparent to the point they were only slightly visible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still not gone\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I can't see anything but your pink nails\" Megan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you said, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be a witch thing. Come on; we're late\" Megan said. Fifteen minutes later, you were walking into the changerooms, were Kristy was glaring. Her glare increased as she spotted you and Megan. \"About time. Maybe they should've taught you to read the time in kindergarten\" Kristy snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan didn't reply; you were both early, and everyone knew it. It didn't stop Kristy though; she continued on her rant. \"I can't believe I've even let you or that princess wannabe on this squad....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unlike the baby\" Kristy said, unable to resist throwing a parting snide comment. You barely noticed, as you remembered Elvira's words regarding your gloves; 'Only a witch will be able to see them'. From the way Kristy have you a confused look, it meant only one thing; Kristy has magic powers..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? You look pale\" Megan whispered to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kristy can see my gloves. It means she has magic\" you whispered back, causing Megan's face to drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap. Are you sure? If she has magic too...\" Megan said, fearing the worst. You knew she was thinking of the dozens of ways Kristy would be able to get rid of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't...\" you said, but Kristy interrupted. \"I don't know what you two are whispering, but it's time. Don't fuck this up, and Elle... I'm glad you're taking this seriously by removing those gloves. I don't know how the others missed them, but I will not tolerate you playing dress up....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Now she can't see them?\" you whispered back to Megan. \"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but I don't think she was acting. Her expression was too... Kristy. Just try to forget her, and focus on flying\" Megan said, revealing that you were like her; a flyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEasier said than done you thought as you took the field. Almost immediately, you felt a magical presence on you. At once, you feared it was Kristy, but as you started the routine, you realized you were going good; almost too good, like if the magic was aiding you. That meant it was someone in the crowd. Risking a look, you saw mom had joined Mel and Candice in the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                       ***************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" you asked as mom lead you, Mel, Megan and Candice towards the car once the match was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to see my daughter cheer her first game. You did well\" mom said as she opened the car's door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed slightly. \"There's more, isn't there?\" you said, remembering Kristy. If mom knew about that....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I know you and Candice disobeyed my orders not to go near Samantha Forester\" mom said, her face darkening. You couldn't see it from your position in the back, but could her sharp change of tone. \"What were you thinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That witch is insane! You think growing a pair of breasts is the worst she could do to you? Try being boy crazy. Or the stereotypical dumb blonde\" mom said in a cold voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I'm trying to help....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elle...</span></div></div>",

All you wanted to do was get out of your cheer uniform, and lie down on you bed, but the instant you opened your bedroom door, moping became the last thing you wanted to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to my room?!\" you screamed, seeing that your bedroom had completely changed. It was now a very girlish teen girl's room, complete with a cheer theme. It was almost like they took Mel's light pink walls, her large vanity/ study desk, and tossed in a bit of Megan's decorations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Elle?\" Megan called out from downstairs. You knew if she had a role in this, it would be as a distraction. Given the amount of time taken to paint, dry and remodel your furniture, this makeover had to be magical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter grinding your teeth for a few seconds, you said in an angry voice, \"Nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't sound like nothing. What happened, little sis?\" Mel called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think? Hey! Don't come up!\" you screamed, as you heard your twin's approach. Mel ignored you, and in your panic, you flame reignited. It also resulted in your cheer costume twisting into your hated Cinderella inspired dress.

The instant she saw you, she giggled, but it was quickly followed by a 'Sorry sis', which wasn't at all comforting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lost control, sis\" Hayley said as she eyed your outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lost control?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.

Try focusing. What do you want the most?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, it was to get out of the dress, but you glared at your twin. Instantly you knew what you wanted, and began to focus.

Only she steals what she wants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which would explain why she has magic.\" Worried, you said. You then gasped. \"Does that mean Candice is a witch too?!  Also, who did she steal the magical items from?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samantha Forester has been known to help boys interested in magical artifacts discover their magical talents; Candice carried strong promise despite not being of witch blood.\" Firmly, Elvira said. \"As for Kristy, she is being watched; you need not deal with her unless she confronts you directly but remember the law of magic use in public.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Samantha thought she was helping him by allowing the magical artifacts slowly change him into a girl and a witch as she hates men and boys.\" Mussing, you said. \"It makes sense but it's still wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is guilty of selling magical items to a non witch but that is a misdemeanor crime; a slap on the wrist I'm afraid. Using magic out of anger in public however has closed her store for a month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then she has been dealt with.\" Sighing, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That only leaves Candice and yourself.\" Flatly, Elvira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you?\" Softly, you challenged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My test was merely a matter of bad timing, no crime there.\" Firmly but kindly, Elvira said. \"However, since you clearly need to be pacified, I will tell you this. Your test is not about your will to be a boy again but your ability to deal with a magical situation. So far, you are doing well because you have the will and humility to ask an expert for help in a situation that is over your head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not the test I thought it was...\" Confused, you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira gave a short giggle. \"No one figures out their test before it ends, Elle.\" Bemused, she said. \"You did figure out it was a test, as I predicted but you will not move forward until you pass or fail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Elvira ended the call, leaving you with much to think about. \"This situation I am in is the test.\" Taken back, you said. \"Only how I settle this determines if I pass or fail.\" You slumped down onto your bed and sighed. \"No pressure...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Although you hated spending the last day you had before restarting school as a girl in your overgirlified room, you needed answers quickly. Plus, you had a feeling it was wise to avoid a potentially vengeful Mel; she <i>hated</i> mom's new photo in the main hall.. Some of the rules were already known to you, such as the no use in public, but even then, there were different grades of no use. To your disappointment, Samantha's magic was on the lesser scale thanks to her relative discretion. Of course if she had tried to roast you and Candice to a crisp with fireballs, it would be a different matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther rules seemed to be more etiquette based; except for unusual situations, males have no magic whatsoever. For their protection, they can only be permanently changed by their mother or legal guardian except for life saving circumstances. All actions must be explained in a satisfactory manner. Temporary changes can be made for demonstrationary purposes. You gave a slight snort at the final warning of the section; Remember magic does <i>not</i> make you all powerful. Although by it's nature, feminine, do not except any sympathy if you end up with a black eye from some enraged boy you've put into a skirt, or end up on a receiving end of a spell from a boy you had just girlified, unaware she can use magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-kay. No using magic in public. Don't torture people. What else?\" you muttered. The rules and what you're already learnt seemed conflicting; Elvira said Samantha had no case to answer, but changing Harry was not under a life saving pretence; it was pre-empting a possible worse witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turned the page, you discovered a note tucked within the pages.<br>\r\n<i>Congratulations on reading the rules of magic, Princess</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? That was it?\" you said, half disgusted.  You continued reading the note. <i>Unfortunately, most of the rules are not written, and are often based on instinct. Trust your feelings. They will tell if you are right. Now it is time to put your abilities into practice....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great\" you muttered.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nAll these cases are already monitored, so do not feel pressured into taking a certain case. The first case is of the Summer quads. Three boys, one girl. Unfortunately, the sister is developing her powers, and with it, it will start to spontaneously her brothers into girls. I suggest you read up on the 'twin factor' and pacify the three new witches any way you can.<br>\r\nThe second case is closer to home; I know you know of Cassie Bane. She is becoming a problem. Arrogant, distasteful of guys and believing she in the only witch, Cassie has an older brother, Mike that she has been turning on and off into her new younger sister, Michelle. Teach her the error of her ways and restore Michelle, assuming she wants to be changed back. Beware, she will be attracted to you, both in power and physical form. It may involve some stress, as by now, you have realized you no longer feel attraction towards women...<br>\r\nThe third case is more complex. Do not. Repeat, do not unleash your temper, Princess Elle, but it involves your cousin Tim....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. What has that little monster done?\" you muttered. Tim liked teasing girls, and considered that his name appeared on this list, it meant he picked the wrong girl.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n.... Tim had a altercation with our mutual friend, Samantha Forester....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! That bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...I told you to calm down!...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I'm not going to do anything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>.... The incident has already been investigated, and has concluded that both parties are responsible for Mr, or should I say, Miss Tower's altered crotch, and that Ms Forester has no case to answer. Tim has not been fully transformed into a female, even after repeated visits to Samantha. We suspect there may be an odd respect between the two. Timothy believes she has hidden her new condition, but both her mother and myself are aware. This can not continue indefinitely, and must be dealt with.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though I don't get why that would be an option\" you admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Protection, magic, extension of her lifespan by ten, fifteen years. You've seen some of the things Hannah can get away with. It could be tempting\" Hayley said. \"Now, about that makeover...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                     *********************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should be investigating you\" you said sourly as you walked towards the Bane house. Mel had given you one of her push up bras, a pale pink tube top, and skirt. She also did your make up, and had given you some heart shaped gold earrings and a sapphire choker pendant. Overall, it made you look hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? I've totally made you pretty\" Mel said with a slight hint of envy in her voice. You knew she didn't like that you were a hotter girl than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock it off, little sisters\" Hayley said. \"The Bane house is right ahead. That little girl must be 'Michelle'. Mel and I will fall back. Call us if you need backup\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Michele.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle's eyes widened in shock. \"Did Cassie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she didn't.\" Smiling, you replied. \"Another witch did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Cassie's eyes widened slightly. Only she recovered quickly as she gave you a shark like grin. \"Let me guess, you are hoping I will change you back?\" Smugly, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled. \"Hardly.\" Slightly amused, you said. You allowed your gloves to become visible. \"I'm here to warn you that there are far stronger and more experienced witches out there than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that include you... princess?\" Smirking, Cassie asked. \"You had to have been hiding those gloves for a reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just beginning to learn.\" Honestly, you said. \"However, I can and do have the right to do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou focused your concentration on Michelle and a familiar book appeared in her hands. \"Why did you give me a magic book?\" Worried, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie whipped around, suddenly fearful. \"You can't have that!\" Firing a spell, she yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle winced but the spell hit what looked like a spherical shield surrounding her. Seeing this, Cassie turned to you, angry. \"What did you do?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled. \"According to witch law, Michelle has been kept a girl long enough to bear the right to a magic book.\" Calmly, you said. \"So long as the book is in her possession, you can not use your magic against her, Cassie Bane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie growled under her breath but then smiled. \"It also means I can't change her back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True.\" Nodding, you agreed. \"However, Michelle can learn to change herself back with the proper spell ans use that knowledge to change back to normal each time you transform him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie threw you a death glare but you ignored it and turned to Michelle. \"You have a very big decision to make, Michelle.\" Firmly but kindly, you said. \"If you study the magic book, it will allow you the change yourself back to normal but doing so will send a signal to your mother that you are interested in magic and being a witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do I do?\" Worried, Michell asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can either keep the book safe in your room and wait for Cassie's spell to wear off or learn magic and change yourself back to normal.\" Simply, you said. \"You could also give the book to your mother and ask for her protection... Either way, the choice is yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't do this!\" Fuming, Cassie yelled. \"You can't interfere with other families!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not interfere in the least.\" Smiling, you countered. \"I simply gave Michelle what was rightfully hers under witch law and gave you and her valuable information that will save you trouble down the line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to you, Cassie was furious but also curious. You were a transformed boy who could work magic and, in her eyes, you made a very adorable girl. \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled slightly then replied...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Additionally, change or not, Cassie Bane was not the most attractive girl, physically or personality wise.<br>\r\nI need you to lay off your brother.

You woke up to a grinning Mel, who was unusually dressed and ready for school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, little sis. Looking forward to your first day?\" Mel said in a cheerful voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away, Melanie\" you said crossly. \"I don't want whatever 'help' you're scheming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Whatever. Why are you like, so suspicious? I totally don't want you ruining your reputation...\" Mel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes. \"Trust me. I'm so not going to go out and embarrass you. Just leave me in peace.\" It was a relief to see the back of Mel. Besides, there wasn't much opportunity for you to dress badly, as your  school had a uniform. Something you now suspected was installed for the situation you now found yourself in. It wouldn't be too hard for mom, Elvira, or even Samantha to manipulate the school. After a shower, you put on the uniform which consisted of a green pleated skirt and a white blouse and headed downstairs. Before you was able to get to the kitchen, you heard someone knocking on the door. Thinking it was Candice, you opened it, knowing she would be having a harder time adjusting than you. Instead, it was a seven year old girl. She was dressed ready for school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\" you asked; there was something strange about this kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I met your sister yesterday. My name is Robyn and I want to go to school with her\" the girl said as she eyed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. I can sense your power...\" you muttered, as you realized what the strange thing about this Robyn was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I admit it. I have powers just like you. I am the one that is looking after your cousin\" Robyn said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're looking after Tim? What is your story? You better not be using my sister...\" you threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Princess Elle. I was sent by Elvira. As for my story, I was turned into a kid about a year ago. While I'm aging normally, I had to grow up again as a girl. I do like some girly things now, so I'm not going to 'use' Hannah. You don't have to go big sister on me. For your information, she doesn't know about me, and I prefer it to stay that way\" Robyn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shuddered slightly at the thought of being turned into a little girl. \"Okay. I want to be kept in the loop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got your own file. That Bane bitch, I believe. Plus, you have the issue of adjusting to your new form\" Robyn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know that?\" you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got the same files that you did, Elle. I can help you if you need help with 'Michelle'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know what to say. This girl would have to had experience, but the downside was that you didn't know her. Caution won out. \"I hope it would be unnecessary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so. We better cut this short...\" Robyn said as you heard the tap tap of Hannah's shoes. She gave a delighted yell and greeted her new friend. You stepped back, and headed inside. You wanted mom's advice and information about this new girl, but again, you were interrupted. This time, by Michelle giving a distress call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help! I'm still like this, and mom has seen me. She said I look much better and wants to send me to school like this\" a childish whine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I'll see what I can do\" you promised her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please hurry. I don't know what mom would do to me. I've heard her say something about improving Cassie's spell. I don't want to be like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm coming right now\" you said. Reluctantly leaving the house and your issues with Robyn, you immediately headed back towards the Bane house. You felt responsible for Michelle and hated to think that you may have given her false hope. You didn't know if there was anything you could do against her mother. Quickly, you started observing the front of the house. However you were shocked and extremely alarmed to find that within a minute of your stakeout, Samantha Forester had joined you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Princess\" Samantha said in a admirable voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You! What do you want?\" you hissed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I have no doubt at all she has silently approved the actions of that daughter of hers, and by her silence allowed her to act like she has.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really think....\" you started to demand, but Samantha had worked herself up into a rage. \"I do my transformations because it's fun. Olivia does it because she thinks its right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fun? You made me parade around the mall\" you snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You called me a hag\" Samantha countered. \"Look, we have issues, but our interests align.  Doubtlessly, the only reason you're here is because you're to help little 'Michelle' in some kind of initiation. To stop Cassie, or more like it, Olivia from doing further transformations, or if Michelle wants to learn magic, you'll be some sort of guidance. Since the Banes want another sweet little daughter/sister in the house, that means I do not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't trust you\" you said automatically, without thinking. Samantha appeared unfazed, though. She continued to glare at the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I thought. Cassie is going to take 'Michelle' to school, as a new student. I can reduce your age so you could follow them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think I'm that stupid?\" you scoffed as the two girls left the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not like I have anything to do for the next couple of weeks\" Samantha said, making you realize that there was a very dangerous wildcard in play.</span></div></div>",

Then we will know for sure whether it is fake or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Are you really starting to believe that thing is the real deal! I highly doubt that!\" You told Mel. You were positive the book was just a prank or something. However Mel's curiosity got the best of her and she had decided to try the spell just as she was about to cast it however. You and Mel were shocked to see Hayley grab her arm and stop her. \"Mel don't cast anything out of that book!\" She yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Hayley? When did you get home?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Just recently and looks like I arrived just in time.\" She said. Both you and Mel were confused as Hayley had just arrived home, even though she was supposed to not arrive home until tomorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I am glad that you are home, but why did you stop me? It's not like it's real magic.\" Mel said to Hayley. Hayley was quick to respond with an answer. It was then that she looked at You and ponder some thoughts before she gave you both an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Magic is real, but as of right now you are too inexperienced to work certain spells.\" Hayley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Now you are telling me magic exist Hayley, Both me and Mel have doubts but do you have any proof of this? You asked. It was shortly after that in which Hayley showed a beautiful blue flame coming from her hand. \" here's your proof, this is what is called the flame test. It is proof that I am Witch, As well as Mom. I know you have a lot of questions however those will have to wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Why does it have to wait?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" How's Harry been doing lately?\" Hayley asked you while avoiding the question.

It was the next question she asked that rather surprised you. \" Would you mind if we take a look at Harry's antique collection while we are at it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I don't think Harry would mind, but I guess we could visit Harry before we find out anything more.\"  You replied.

It was the Harry did reply but at the moment. His voice sounded rather feminine instead of his usual voice which was strange to you. Yet you suspected Hayley already had a hint about what is going on with Harry.  \" Harry, It's me Hayley, don't worry just let us in. I am sure it's not as bad as you think.\" Hayley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Harry opens the door and both you and Mel are surprised to find out that not only has Harry's voice changed but his appearance as well. He had long rosewood hair and you could help but notice the orbs at his chest. Still it was hard for you to believe, but somehow deep inside yourself you knew that this girl was Harry!  \" Harry how did you get like this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I don't know, I just went antique shopping like usual. Then I somehow ended up like this.\" Harry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" I was afraid that would be the case. I believe some of the items you may have collected could be magical objects, can I have a look at them?\" Hayley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Magic doesn't exist.\" Harry bluntly said to Hayley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Harry, look at yourself, the form you have is proof of magic existing. Now let me see the objects you felt the most drawn too.\" Hayley insisted. Harry then went  and got five different objects. These were the ones he felt drawn too the most. The first objects was a complete collection of ten rings. The second object was a crown and the third was a scepter. With the fourth being a really creepy looking doll and the final object being a mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" These are all pretty Harry.\" Mel said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" All five of these objects give off some magical power. Far more than I suspected. You are in great danger for possessing all of these objects Harry.\" Hayley said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Why? There just stuff I bought at Forrester antiques and Sweetie Collectibles?\" Harry asked.  Hayley from the mention of those two shops appeared to be angry, yet not at Harry oddly enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Is Harry going to be okay?\" You asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" He will, however I am not sure if he will ever be Harry again.\" Hayley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" What do you mean by that?  Do you know what these items are?\" Harry asked. Hayley nodded and then told him what each of the items are. \"  I believe those are magical enhancing rings known as the Pharaoh rings, How you managed to get all ten of them I have no clue, but dangerous witches, usually go after them. I believe that crown is the Magical Princess crown. Who ever wears it will think they are a magical princess. As for the scepter it is called the scepter of fear, it brings out your enemies worst fears to life.  As for the fourth one it is a cursed doll, if you say a person name while talking to a doll that person will slowly become a doll themselves. The final object you brought me is the gender reversal mirror it is the least harmless, but like it's name  it reverse the gender of whomever looks into it. With all these in one place I am going to have to call the head witch here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Head witch? Who's she and what does she have to do with any of this?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"  You will find out soon enough.\" Hayley said. </span></div></div>",

That item in particular was the mirror. You thought that perhaps the mirror could help Harry out of his situation and reverse his gender to normal. Of course you weren't even sure it would work. You took a glance and a small peep at your reflection in the Gender reversal Mirror. What you didn't know at that time was that single glance was all it took for the Mirror's effect to take. Within minutes your hair began to change to that honey blond color of your sisters. Yet  there was quite a bit you didn't know about the mirror or the objects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Hayley quickly sensed that you were enchanted and easily pulled you away form the room filled with objects. \" John! I told you to stay away from those things!\" Hayley scolded you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" It was just a glance Hayley completely harmless.\" You said. At the moment you were unaware about your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" John look at your hair in a regular mirror it's changed color.\" Mel said. You looked and then realized that your hair had indeed changed color. So far you hadn't any signs of any other changes. It was just your hair color for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Just as Hayley was about to speak the doorbell rang. Fortunately Hayley got a look and saw it was the head witch had just arrived. Hayley then opened  Harry's door and let her in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Grandma what are you doing here? You asked. Of course she did notice that your hair was different as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Grandma Elvira is the head witch John, I called her here cause all of the items harry possesses are dangerous if together and it could make him a target. \" Hayley explained.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Indeed, I rushed here as fast as I could.\" Elvira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Can witches teleport?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I could have, but it would of been rude of me to teleport into someone else's house. I see you've been curious about magic yourself. How did your hair changed color?\" Grandma Elvira asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \" What about me? IS there anything you can do about my situation?\" Harry asks. Your grandmother then sighs and puts on a rather serious looking face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \" A Witch Doctor should be able to determine how much build up you have and if it's important. However form the moment I stepped on your property Harry Rich, I need you to understand that I will be confiscating every single magical object in the house. Which could potentially be your entire collection.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \" I understand.\" Harry replied although from the look on his face he was quite disappointed he was losing his collection.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \" What about the Mirror couldn't it help Harry?\" You asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" More Magic will only worsen, Harry's or should I say Harriet's condition. Once he sees Dr. Thompson I am sure can determine whether Harry has too much magic in him or if he can return to being male. As for you John that mirror aside from being a Gender Reversal Mirror  has another name. It is called the Mirror of Desire, if you have a secret desire that happens to be only fulfilled by being the opposite gender, than until that desire is fulfilled you wont be able to change back.\" Elvira said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      With that you all left Harry's house and escorted him to your neighbors house. Where your crush and Dr. Thompson lives. You then knocked on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" John? What happened to you?\" Dr. Thompson asked as she answered the door.  Little did you realize that you hair had now grew longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"  I am fine. It's Harry who needs your help.\" You told her. You Mel and Hayley waited as you all waited you soon realized like Harry you were becoming more and more feminine. You couldn't help but notice as your arms became thinner and you started to feel a weight around your chest. Of course you were still denial of the changes happening to you.  two hours later Dr. Thompson came out and told you that...</span></div></div>",

I don't want to be stuck like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't be celebrating just yet, young lady. You absorbed a massive amount of magical energy. It will be a long time before that magic depletes itself. Before you wonder, no, you cannot deplete magic by casting spells. It will just make things stronger\" Elvira added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite right. Unless there is a way to deplete it, I think it would be two years before your magic dissipates on it's own\" Dr Thompson added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two years?! I can't go around like this for two years! It may as well be permanent!\" Harry snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, young lady. I agree your situation is quite painful. If you desire, you can come with me, and I'll enrol you into our school. It is the same one that Hayley went to\" Elvira offered. Before Harry could speak, Elvira produced a medium sized bag. inside was a school uniform consisting of a blue pleated skirt, white blouse which was secured by a red ribbon. It immediately reminded you of something some anime magic girl would wear, though this one wasn't anywhere near over the top. You winced at the sight of it, and from Harry's reaction, you knew she saw it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad that you're more than I little uncomfortable about this, John. One you wear this uniform, that's it. You're enrolled. There has been a couple of boys that have worn similar uniform... it doesn't matter what their intent was, it all resulted in more Witchbloom schoolgirls. I'll gibe you some time, Harry to decide if you want to attend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just need some answers of my own. Firstly, what is the story?\" you demanded, looking at the doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a witch myself, and neither is Megan. I'm just trained in this sort of stuff\" Dr Thompson said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\" you said, slightly reassured as you didn't entirely like the idea of a witch crush/girlfriend. \"What about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone stared at you. At this point the mounds on your chest had grown quite sizable, your arms and hands definitely feminine, and shoulder length blond hair was starting to blow into your field of vision. At that point, your increasingly ill fitting boys clothes became...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was at that point however your Grandmother than put Mel into equally ridiculous clothes as well as changed her into a guy. You got a small chuckle out of it, but no else laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Grandma? Change me Back!\" Mel demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I can not do that Melvin. I have my reasons for keeping you and John separate genders, but I also can't ignore your laughing at your brothers misfortune.\" Elvira said. You tried and attempted too take the ridiculous outfit off, but quickly found out that each time you tried to take it off it just kept putting itself back on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \" I am not a guy!\" Mel grunted but she or rather he knew once grandma makes up her mind about something she sticks with it. Melvin was also a bit disappointed that you two weren't allowed to be the same gender.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \" Your mother will explain it later on, I am very bust and right now I have two antique shops to pay a visit too.

Fortunately Dr. Thompson did examine you after Harry and gave you her diagnosis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \" John, I don't know what the princess dress means, But from what I guess you can either try to resist the magic or let the magic play itself out in the way it's intended. Which means you have to fill your desires at least according to Madam Head Witch. Also I suspect that when you get home, I am pretty sure your room will have changed from what you last though of it.\"  Dr. Thompson said. She didn't intrude on your desires, yet still you were a bit stubborn and didn't want to admit it. Even after all the change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Fortunately you managed to avoid Megan who wasn't home a the moment. You really didn't exactly want to explain this too her either.

Of course, with your new form, you found it even more revolting than normal. Looking around, you saw your salvation; there was only one 'Mel', you. You could pretend to be your own sister, whilst introducing Harriet as one of your friends. Not too difficult, especially since your princess gown ensured the only skin you showed was maybe an inch below your neck and head, hence hiding any subtle differences such as your slightly larger bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Timothy.

Although despite that you couldn't help notice that while your feminine attributes were increased, when you saw Mel transformed you quickly realized that his masculine attributes were increased and that you couldn't help but feel a bit jealous over that. Yet at the same time you also knew that must be what Mel thought when she saw your increased feminine attributes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"What about me?

It was a room you knew your sister Hannah would be overjoyed to be in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Meanwhile your mother talked with both Hayley and Melvin in her study. \" Why don't you want John in here isn't he a part of this as well?\" Melvin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \" He is, but Melvin the reason for your transformation is because John is at a very risky moment in his life. His changes could end up being permanent.\" You mother said to them in a very serious tone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Permanent? But the mirror is the one that changed him right? So it should be reversible.\" Hayley said. \" Unless you think there is another factor that could be at work here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"  I am sure Madam Head witch transformed you because of the Twin factor. Twins can be powerful especially if born the same gender but when they are not, they usually fight one another and for most cases it ends up with one turning into a girl permanently. If that happens then we will have to help her adjust to that kind of life.\"  Your mother told Hayley and Melvin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I don't fight with John that much!\" Melvin exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" it's not you that does the fighting it is the dormant magic power within them awakening the power of magic, especially in family's that have incredibly strong magic like ours.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \" So what do we do?\" Hayley asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" For now we just wait and see what happens.\"    Your mother said. With that Hayley and Melvin went to their own rooms. Melvin was of course quite surprised to find that her room had also been changed, but unlike yours it was fit for a boy her age.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" John I think I may have an idea how to get that dress off.\" Harriet told you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" What really? You have to tell me Harry!\" You said in excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \" Well your room and your dress is princess dress it's everything Hannah would like, so I think one of your desire's that your grandmother mentioned could potentially be that you want to play princess with Hannah.\" Harriet said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You then responded by saying....</span></div></div>",

It was then that I overheard her whispering about getting something troublesome in her shop, and just right when one of her sisters was coming to visit as well. It wasn't long before I went to the counter and told her I overheard her conversation it was then that I offered to pay for the troublesome item.\"  You continued to listen to Harry's story as much as Mel and Hayley were quite in to it as well. The look on Hayley's face however it looked like she was worried about what Harry said about your aunt that you were told to stay away from was worried about a visit from her sister's. Both you and Mel were curious about as to why that particular statement had Forester worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I don't think a visit from her sisters should be that much worrisome.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" We still haven't gotten to the bottom of this John, Harry please continue.\" Hayley said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I thought the same thing at first too John, but Forester absolutely insisted that I take it the troublesome item, which happened to be the orb. She told me that it would be bad if her sister's knew she had it and she wanted to get rid of it quick so she offered me a great discount. The next thing she told me was that the object was a wishing orb. I didn't believe her at first but then she told me to try it buy making any wish I want. It was then I made my first wish was somewhat silly thing, but I saw your cousin Tim being his usual self towards some girls and thought about making my first wish about him. So I wished that every time he would try to be mean to a girl that wasn't being mean to him first he would tell the girl He is a cute pretty little princess.\"  Harry explained, while Mel burst into laughter after hearing Harry's first wish he made from the Orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \" Ha!

Wanting to hear more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \" After hearing  Tim, yell that a few times it looked like he was freaked out by it, The next wish I made however was quite a different one. I simply wished for the owner of Forester's Antiquity's to be my twin sister. I thought that by wishing that we would be able to get rid of our loneliness.\" Harry said.

I may as well wish you were a girl and save your sister the effort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hayley!\" you screamed, alarmed that she had made a wish. Already, the wish was affecting Harry. Rosewood colored hair had sprouted in a losse ponytail, and the rest of Harry's hair was rapidly changing color. It seemed he was getting his mom's hair, as well as her eyes. Harry's eyes lightened slightly, as the changes spread to his face. It became rounder, more feminine. You were so fixated on his head, you didn't notice that the rest of his body had been changing. Harry lost a couple of inches, as well as most of his muscle tone as his body squeezed tone into a feminine form. His hips and rear flared out slightly, and waist slightly caved in to give a slight hourglass. Finally, Harry's chest slightly swelled as he grew a pair of breasts. They were small, probably in the a range. Certainly smaller than your sisters, or even Megan, but they were early bloomers. On Harry, they suited him or rather, her. She looked cute, but you were still shocked she actually made that wish. You looked up at Harry's face and she seemed...</span></div></div>",

She then turned to you, Harriet, and your sisters. \"Consider yourselves lucky this did not turn out worse. You are dismissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When will my one wish expire?\" Desperate, Harriet asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled and replied...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He thankfully however never let it go too far and knew when to quit insulting them. In fact some times you think Tim's just trying to toughen up the girls. He was at least better than the Water brothers Karl and Greg who would often try to hold down a girl and beat her up so that they would have no defense against them. Still despite his intentions what ever they were, you did know the girls in his class didn't really appreciate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"My first wish was about Tim, Mrs. H. I wished that he would say I was a pretty cute little princess every single time he was mean to a girl who wasn't mean to him first.\" Harry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Then until Tim learns to be more considerate towards Girls, You will be stuck like that.\"  Your Mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Mom, I am just wondering what about his second wish will that be undone as well?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" The Second wish will wear off eventually, however if certain factors go in to play, that wish could become permanent.\" You mother said with a serious look on her face. It was then you realized that this certain factor only impacted twins to witches and that's when you finally realized that you also risked this factor. Still you weren't exactly sure of it though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Does this mean John could turn into a girl anytime?\" Mel asked beating you to the question you were going to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"  Yes, He very well could and if he started to show signs of magic he would make a very powerful witch, However I don't want you to get any ideas of turning your brother into a girl just cause you want too.

It certainly got your attention, and you immediately sat up, wondering what was about to happen, or wo was responsible; you had no doubt it was due to magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen seconds later, the light dissipated, and immediately, your clothes started to change. At first, it wasn't too alarming as only the clothes' texture changed; your shirt and jeans became lighter, and softer in feel, which was surprising as your jeans remained demin, but you definitely became alarmed as the size of your clothes shifted. The sleeves of your shirt shrunk down to nothingness, becoming a pair of straps, whilst it also shrank along the torso and neckline, exposing your torso. It also shank overall, making it very ill fitting and constricting. Your jeans also shrank, overall becoming smaller and a more feminine cut. Probably the most alarming was the sudden constricting feeling that suddenly overwhelmed your upper chest. Quickly, you glanced at your now bare shoulders, and saw that there was second pair of straps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it\" you yelled, wondering who was doing this to you. You had no doubt that someone had turned your clothes into their feminine equivalent. Worried, that it would be you next, you unzipped the jeans and saw that you were wearing panties. They looked extremely odd, as you hadn't physically changed at all. Slightly relieved, you felt your new tank top, and felt through it the outline of a bra, its' cups hanging empty across your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of you wanted to immediately storm out and confront mom, as you knew only she, Hayley or possibly Mel could have done this, but pride won out. You didn't want the to see you like this. As you reached your wardrobe to find something to wear, your door burst open. Shocked, you spun to face the intruder, and was slightly surprised to see mom storming through, a stick in her hand. Hayley was behind her, and they looked worried. With a determined expression, mom walked up to you, and started to check for any changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" you protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't answer for about twenty seconds. Finally she said, \"We detected a spell. Were you playing with magic?\" mom asked,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Do you think I wanted something to happen to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?

Why is John's door all messed up?\" Hannah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel didn't have the same restraint. She giggled at your new attire and said, \"Totally looking good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley stared daggers at your twin.

Besides, you wanted answers, and knew mom would not be too happy if you got them directly. Harri would be the perfect intermediator.

Not only your nails were longer and painted candy pink, you fingers also looked more girlish. That wasn't the worst part, as you could barely see them as your fingers were mostly  obscured  by your now oversized pajamas. Panicking, you threw the covers off your body and saw that the rest of your body had shrunk too. Slightly shaking, you looked down your pajamas, and saw that you were still a guy, but your manhood had shrunk out of proportion compared to the rest of you. Wanting to see what other damange had occurred to you, you picked up a mirror that Hayley had left behind for you, and stared at your reflection. inadvertently, you gave a high pitched, girlish scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou face had changed into that of a girl. If you somehow got rid of the hair, you knew you might be able to pass as a boy, but with the still intact pigtails, anyone that looked at you would assume they where looking at a cute girl. You figured you were now eight, maybe nine years old. Unsurprisingly, mom blew your bedroom door open a few seconds later. She took one look at you, and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought as much. Forester's meddling has made things much worse\" mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?

To your surprise, mom produced a pair of heavy rubber gloves from her dress and started to put them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" you demanded. You swore to yourself that you were going straight to Harri's house the second you could escape from your crazed mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While I believe the first part of Forester's advice is nonsense, I agree it is wise not to come into physical contact with you, sweetie.

You recognized it as the girls' school uniform, which had been introduced towards the end of last year. Nobody liked being forced to wear it, though at the time, you, Harry and most of the other boys thought it made the girls, or at least the girls around your age, look cute. Now, it filled you with dread; you wondered if mom had a role in getting it introduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not wearing that, mom!\" you strongly protested. \"In case you haven't noticed, I'm still a guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom's gleeful look broke for a few seconds, replaced with one of sadness and regret. \"Not for much longer. I need to get you used to wearing clothes like these. You <i>will</i> have a bath and you <i>will</i> put on your new uniform.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not likely\" you said defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you would be like this. Have you forgotten that mommy is a witch? Do you want her to punish you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally it would be a frightening prospect, but you didn't care. Seeing that you were still defiant, mom grabbed you with her other, gloved hand and began her work. It took her fifteen minutes where you fought constantly, but in the end, she got you bathed and dressed in the uniform. You didn't know which part was worse; the pigtails and pink ribbon constantly in your peripheral vision, the odd breeze flowing up your skirt and hitting your white cotton panties, which in itself was a discomfort, or the matching training bra she had forced onto you chest (mom stated she didn't know what age you'd be, but thought it would be a good precaution). The moment she finished dressing you, mom released you. You didn't need more than a few seconds to rush for the door, and for the front door. Within twenty seconds, you had burst through the front door, and was knocking on Harri's front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarri opened it, and she was wearing a uniform similar to your own. Her glum expression quickly changed to on of disbelief. \"What happened to you!?\" she said, clearly shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me in. Mom happened\" you said. Not waiting for a response, you pushed past your friend and closed the door. You knew this would be one of the first places mom would search for you. Once inside, you relaxed slightly, and said, \"Sam's potion didn't work. Remember? Mom they went crazy and dressed me like this. What about you?\" you said, eyeing Harri's uniform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"mom and dad already left for work. No, this is my new sister's handiwork\" Harri growled. Her growls attracted Samantha, who  walked downstairs. She was also dressed in the same uniform, and somehow kept a blank look on her face. It did not stop you from launching an attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You! I thought you would help me! Now, my mom has gone insane\" you yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that. Trust me, I think she has lost hope of stopping your transformation\" Samantha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust you? You've said that too often for my liking\" you fired back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why are you here? To cry on Harriet's shoulder\" Samantha said, earing her a dirty look from both you and Harri. \"I want still help you. One potion wouldn't have, and didn't help you, young lady. I promised my sister I would, but....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I should get involved anymore\" Samantha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" you spat out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How could being turned into a little girl be better?\" you shrieked in a suddenly higher pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're already on the way to becoming a little cutie, and if you anything like Harriet, you'd quickly learn how to manipulate. Besides, that temper of yours will be the end of you\" Samantha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Temper?\" you squeaked, your alarm building that your voice had changed into a higher pitched girlier one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, your temper.

Finally, she said, \"Fine have it your way. I'll continue treating you, but don't blame me if things backfire. Your magic is way too unpredictable. One more thing, little girl. If you call me a hag, I swear I'll turn you into the sweetest, cutest little girl you can imagine. Got it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She means it, even though it would break her promise to me\" Harri muttered. You gave a rapid nod, and received a colorless vial of liquid from her, which you quaffed down. Instantly, you felt yourself changing, becoming bigger. Within moments, you've turned back to normal, but in the process, spreading most of the uniform that you had been wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it. You could have least done something about my clothes\" you growled, as you stared at your torn mary janes. Your feet growing out of them was painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\" Samantha giggled, as the door opened. It was mom, and she had a stick in her hand. She gave one look at you, which quickly became one of shock. She didn't expect to see you back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"i want my real uniform\" you growled.</span></div></div>",

Stay here and be girlified further by Sam, or go to school?\" you countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarri's silence gave you your answer, but you started to wonder if she could even go to school. \"Can she even go, Sam? I know her parents think she is sweet little Harriet, by what about everyone else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha giggled at Harri's indignant death stare. \"Yeah, they will think Harri is Harriet. Unless they have a power of their own There would be a couple of students other than your sisters that can perceive,. Or have some sort of memory protection, or natural immunity on them. Besides, if I have to go, so will she\" the witch said with a sour look on her face. You guessed she hated wearing the uniform as much as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, you saw that Samantha was right. Everyone saw Harri as a girl, except for one. Megan's eyes nearly burst from her head when she saw your transformed friend, and to everyone else it was normal. However, lunch  was the first time you could talk about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on?\" Megan demanded as she sat down next to you and Harri. Samantha wasn't around, but Mel was. She sat opposite you, keeping clear of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harr-i got into trouble with her antiques. What is with you? How come you can perceive the changes?' you asked. You didn't like the idea of having your crush as a witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel told me, then nearly burned down the house with her flames\" Megan said. It took you by surprise; you hadn't seen Megan since this madness had began, but obviously, Mel had. \"what about yourself? Found any trouble? You're wearing a cap, and you never wear one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped, not wanting to tell her, but unsure what Mel had said. She didn't look shocked when you walked into class. \"Kind of. It's called Samantha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad she's not here\" Mel added. \"She totally has a temper..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! So does John and we keep him around\" Harri protested, not noticing that you suddenly gulped. You felt a sudden pressure in your cap, meaning your pigtails were back. Relief that you were wearing your cap to cover the change, or that it didn't happen during class where it wasn't an option, turned to horror at the thought of it being the precursor of further changes that you couldn't hide. Quickly, and without a word, you stood up, and headed for the door. You almost made it to the bathroom when a voice said, \"John Harrison?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the principal. You didn't need this delay, especially since your nails had grown out and turned pink. Hoping she hadn't seen anything, you stuffed your hands in your pockets and said, \"Sorry, but I need to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you do not. I need you to confirm something with me\" the principal said in a voice only gave you one option. Reluctantly, and worried, you followed her to her office and found, to your surprise, Samantha was sitting in one of the chairs. The witch did not look too happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr Harrison. Could you tell me why I have this.... witch in my school. I do not need the stress of dealing with an all girl's school, even if everyone is completely unaware.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You knew you had to answer quickly to break this standoff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't really her fault\" you protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Explain this?\" Elizabeth demanded to Samantha, as magically, your cap was ripped from your head.

Or did they need a h a g\" Elizabeth said, as Sam's face darkened. \"Same goes for Ms Harrison, though she is more suited to the role of the graceful princess....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a gasp, though not from the threat. While Elizabeth had been bullying Samantha into cooperation, you had felt a pressure build in your chest.  Alarmed, you looked down, and saw that your shirt was being pushed by a pair of lumps. Your new breasts were easily larger than Mel's, who was the bustiest girl in your year. Immediately, you had a problem as the dismayed look on your face attracted Elizabeth and her whole 'get dressed' thing. Plus, the alien orbs on your chest felt heavy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Elizabeth could speak, Samantha turned, stared at you and hit you with some kind of spell. Alarmed, you demanded to know what Samantha had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry John, but it is the only way. Right now, I can't use my potions, so I'm hoping to freeze the transformation\" Samantha said as your whole body started to tingle. Seconds, later your new breasts shrank back into your chest.

That said, Elizabeth was fuming as much as you. She hated that Samantha had brazenly disobeyed her orders. Samantha  wasn't too fazed; she turned to the angry principal and said, \"I've just saved your life. You of all people should know that magic and angry, busty, cute witches are a recipe for disaster.

As you moved to close the door, you muttered, \"All of this because Forester tried to sell Harry a wishing orb!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, Elizabeth grabbed the door, eyeing you with a pale but angry look. \"Forester did what?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \"She tried to sell Harry Rich a wishing orb.\" Softly, you explained. \"He did not believe her when she said it granted wishes.\" You then told Elizabeth the two wishes he had made and what mom told you would reverse the damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were finished, Elizabeth shook her head, annoyed. \"The wishing orb is designed to be mischievous when non witches make wishes on it.\" Sternly, she said. \"Were you a part of these wishes, Miss Harrison?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. \"No, I wasn't.\" You then blushed. \"Still, I think my magic might have made things worse for Harry, or rather Harriet. The wish did not make him a girl... I might have accidentally cast a spell on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth's face softened. \"I see... Did your mom call you princess by any chance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded to which Elizabeth smiled slightly. \"You will not be attending Hannah's class. I have a different class in mind for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What class is that?\" Nervous, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth did not answer, she instead pointed to the closet. With a weary sigh, you entered the closet and closed the door. Minutes later, you were escorted by the arm down the stairwells to the basement of the school. \"Why are we here?\" Worried, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your new class is, shall we say, a little different.\" Cryptically, Elizabeth replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped at a door and knocked three times before knocking twice then three times again. You recognized it as Morse code for S.O.S. and gulped. The door opened revealing a very short and slender professionally dressed woman. She had shoulder length black hair and thick glasses that made her blue eyes seem to pop out of her head. She looked up at Elizabeth and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good day, Liz!\" In a heavy British accent, she said. \"What bright mind have you brought to my classroom today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth smiled. \"Good morning, Helga.\" Kindly, she said. \"I bring you <i>princess</i> Lucy Harrison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe short woman, who was nearly exactly your height, turned to you with a look of curious bemusement on her face. \"A princess, you say?\" Smiling, she asked. \"Not very lady like, is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a transformed boy.\" Frowning, you said. \"Samantha Forester tried to help me change back...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forester?!\" Surprised, Helga asked. She threw her head back, laughing. \"That uninspired hack couldn't cure a case of the sniffles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom told me Forester was very powerful.\" Wincing you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga nodded. \"She is; I was her teacher at Witchbloom boarding school.\" Bemused, she said. \"Only she was so obsessed with learning how to get revenge upon boys who had wronged her in the past or had crossed her path, she never studied the counter spells, potions, or curses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forrester is a walking disaster.\" Firmly, Elizabeth said. \"She did study counter measures later in life only she has almost no experience in using them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why they call her 'setback'.\" Moaning, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga nodded, turning serious. \"I am now retired and volunteer here to teach transformed boys who have been called 'princess' to control their emotions so that magical mishaps can be avoided.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid I might have already had a mishap.\" Feeling guilty, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explained what had happened to Harry to which Helga nodded. \"Your friend's situation will right itself once the mischievous magic runs its course.\" Gently, she said. \"Had it been permanent, reality would have rest making everyone believe Forester was really a teenage witch rather than a transformed adult.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, she motioned you to enter her class where you found six other girls who turned to you before smiling kindly. Uncertain, you allowed Helga to lead you in front of the class.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One, holding her against her will and two, transforming him into a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you suggest?\" Worried, Eliza demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still waters run deep.\" Darkly, Elvira replied. \"Lu may seem outwardly calm but inside, there is a storm brewing...\" She frowned deeply as if to give a warning. \"Don't push her too much; just let her take the classes and graduate at the end of the school year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza sighed but nodded. She had made it a policy to push hard on the transformed boys to show them that magic, although it had caused their plight, was not a tool for revenge or even some pay back. There were other ways for boys to even the playing field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try not rub her the wrong way.\" Flatly, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira nodded. \"See to it that you don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Minutes later, Elvira got you talking about your magic lessons and seemed both pleased and worried that you had mastered the basics in such a short time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you are serious about learning magic.\" Softly, she said. \"Tell me, is it to get revenge on the three teacher aides or to keep yourself from going crazy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little of both, I guess.\" Frowning, you replied. \"I need something to keep my mind off of the rut I'm in because of them.\" You then gave a half smile. \"Success is the greatest revenge; I plan to surpass them then break every record in this school before demanding my male body back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira's worry turned into bemusement. <i>\"That is just the type of revenge I would expect from her.\"</i> Hiding her grin, she thought. <i>\"With the power she yields, she may just pull it off but she will find it a lot harder to give up her magic than she thinks.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing dinner, Elvira escorted you back to your dorm to find Sarah, Cleo, and Becky...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was of average height with long blond hair and blue eyes which seemed to be at the verge of tears. \"I am Jacinta Bowers.\" Tearfully, she said. \"I was known as Jack until a rogue permanently changed my gender. Mom sent me here to learn magic along with my sister, Paul, now Paula.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, Paula stood up next to her sister. She was the same height with long brown hair and brown eyes.

We're stuck like this and stuck here for the year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLu smiled kindly. \"Jacinta, Paula... you are both confusing pride for punishment.\" Firmly but kindly, she said. \"You both took on an adult witch as boys and managed to win; that alone I assure you is an incredible feat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All witches must learn to control their powers either here or at home.\" Reciting one of your lessons, you said. \"However, it is considered a great honor to a mother to send her son to witch school; not all transformed boys get this opportunity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mother is very proud of you both, I promise you that.\" Smiling, Lucy added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Jacinta and Paula smiled as the class applauded.

She knew from experience that telling a transformed boy 'being a girl is not so bad' on their first day was not a wise move. \"Make up is not about gaining attention as some might think.\" Kindly, she said. \"It is about building self esteem and confidence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why don't boy wear it?\" Cracking a grin, Bethany asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy smiled. \"Boys have their own way to build their self esteem and confidence but we are not trying to build Harry's confidence.

When it was done, he blushed at her own reflection. \"I feel turned on the mirror.\" Glumly, she muttered. \"It's too creepy... take it of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a normal reaction.\" Serious, Lucy said. \"From what I understand, Lu is still going through this as is Paula and Jacinta.

That said, magic also cannot fix everything.\" She turned to Bethany. \"You don't have to keep the makeup on, if you don't wish to. Beauty is from within more than it is within the products we used.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBethany gratefully nodded and walked towards the washroom. Once the door was closed, Raven turned to Lucy concerned. \"Will she be okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy did not answer at once, she opened a file that had appeared on her desk and motioned you to her. Looking at the file, you found that Bethany's parents were witch family councilors working for the Rogue Hunters.

He was nearly incoherent, which was a good thing, as your jeans shifted in cut and color. Within seconds, they had become tight, figure hugging girls' jeans. Hayley winced; she knew she was almost at the point where you'd notice, and that she needed to do something even more drastic. Quickly, she uncloaked, but made it seem like she was coming from the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hayley?!\" you said, slightly surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now, 'John'. Follow me, and try to stay quiet\" Hayley ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou was confused by her demeanour, but remained silent as Hayley slung Harry's right arm around her shoulders and lead him back to his house. By this time, he was almost asleep. Your clothes, had also changed even more; a bib had formed against your jeans, turning them into overalls, but were hanging loosely, as it wasn't fastened against your now girly shirt.. You didn't notice, as you were focused more in your sister.  \"What is going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but you have to understand I have nothing to do with what is happening to you\" Hayley said gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're turning into a girl\" Hayley said directly. \"First you, then your clothes.

Even if magic is real, why did I become a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic is a power that is inherently geared for girls.\" Calmly, Hayley replied. \"Boys born into witch families have power but of a different kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The stronger that power is, the higher the chances of him becoming a girl to give that power a better outlet.\" Serious, mom added. \"Because you are a twin to a witch, namely Melanie, the chances of you becoming a girl and a witch were very high.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only one person in our long history has ever beat those odds.\" Wincing, Hayley said. \"That's why we didn't tell you until we knew you were going to change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because the odds were already stacked against me.\" Tearfully, you said. \"I see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would have been a stressful transition had you known and you would have fought a futile battle to stay a boy.\" Pouring you more tea, mom said. \"Becoming a girl is not the end of the world and Hayley and I have plenty of experience to help you adjust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \"Just out of curiosity, what do witch boys have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Witch boys have magic in a physical sense.\" Calmly, mom explained. \"Heightened attributes, acute senses, teleportation, telekinesis...\" She sighed. \"It levels the playing field but boys are trained in a more subtle sense than girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what do we do from here?\" Worried, you asked. \"Make everyone believe I was always 'Lucy' and forget John ever existed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone will remember you for who you are, nothing will change that.\" Smiling, mom said. \"All that will change is how they perceive you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Taking another sip of tea, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before this, everyone knew you as the sweet and protective boy named John.\" Kindly, Hayley said. \"Now, they will know you as the sweet and protective tomboy 'princess' named Lucy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha. Ha.\" Humorlessly, you said. \"I know nothing about being a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we could do this one of three ways.\" Bemused, mom said. \"I could cast a spell, giving you all the experience you need to act properly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could make you younger so you can grow up again and learn just like every other regular girl.\" Smiling, Hayley added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you can just be yourself and let nature take its course.\" Smiling, mom finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, uncertain.

Waving your arms to get your balance back, you noticed a flash of white on you right palm. It was the same with your left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?...\" you gasped as the whiteness rapidly grew out, overcoming your hands. Within seconds, you were wearing white gloves that extended past your elbows. Worse, your arms looked different, much slimmer, almost girly.

Missy... and yes, you're turning into a girl. No... to be absolutely correct, you were already female when you walked into my store.

Samantha grinned. \"The only spell that is mine is that to keep you quiet. Yes, you heard correctly. Spell...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for Samantha to continue, you turned towards the area where Harry was browsing, intending to drag him away from Samantha and her magic, which you was certain was responsible for your situation.

Curious, you picked it up and read it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Lucy... John, there is nothing I or anyone else can do to change you back, we wish there were.

Frowning, you turned to your own clothes and quickly found that most of what you had did not fit because your hips were now too wide to fit in the jeans and your new bust was too big to fit into most of the shirts. Those few you did manage to squeeze into were uncomfortably tight, you were not certain if you could stand them long enough to buy larger clothes to suit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This sucks...\" Irritated, you moaned. \"At least Hayley gave me some fashion freedom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran your hand through your now much longer hair, wondering what to do.

Already you knew they would be tight, but you didn't realize how tight they would be with your boxers instead of the panties. After three attempts, you finally pulled them on, but they were very uncomfortable, squeezing your new hips far worse than before. Next came one of your shirts. It felt rougher than before, and was far baggier, but you easily threw it on. However it did nothing to hide your new breasts, or even any support; instead of a confined squeezing feeling, and annoyance about wearing such a feminine garment, you now had the feeling of being top heavy. Sighing, you headed to a mirror that  you assumed Hayley had placed in your room, and stared at your reflection. It looked like Mel had lost her mind and started playing dress up as a boy. No, it was worse. You was curvier and bustier than your airheaded twin, and nothing could hide your feminine figure. Sighing, you turned your bedroom door's handle, wondering what Hayley would say.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" you gasped, seeing your sister was waiting for you just outside your bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Making sure you was ok. I should ask the same thing! You look terrible\" Hayley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I look terrible!

I know, you're still you, and you're going to be still you even if we dress you up in the puffiest princess dress we could find...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to do that!\" you gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Too dangerous, though Mel might for making her 'look bad'.

Answers\" you snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom would have a fit if she saw you in that. She would say its not only unladylike, she would mutter something about looking after your body, sis\" Hayley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, stop...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm not listening. If you want answers, Lucy, put this on\" Hayley said, half giggling, as she tossed to you not only the pink panties set you rejected, but a similar pink strapless bra, a pink skirt and a tube top that would show a lot of your midriff and of your breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blackmail\" you growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want answers, Lu.

Don't pout sweetie; If Lucy had turned into a little girl, I would forbid her for the same reasons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But its not fair!\" Hannah whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom ignored her. Turning to Mel, she said, \"You are not ready either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I totally am\" Mel complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're reckless. Plus, your first reaction to your sister is jealousy, as if you thought magic gave her a more feminine body than you. It didn't. If you had changed Lucy instead of her naturally changing on her own, she would look exactly the same. The only reason either of you know is that it isn't easy to hide Lucy....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" you snapped, hating how they're talking about this change right in front of you, like if it wasn't a big deal.</span></div></div>",

Surely they could straighten it out, dye it, and generally make it look like you're not going to the prom.

One second, you was standing, annoyed, the next second, you fell backwards, staring at your newly formed mermaid tail!

The sight of a dress amongst your clothes stunned you, but you wanted to get dry; finding out what damage you had to your clothes could wait until you had legs. Quickly, you used the dress and dried off. Just as quickly, you regained your teen girl form, but you knew Mel's little stunt did some damage. You wanted to check it out, but was hesitant to do it in front of your still shocked twin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a mermaid?!\" Mel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Melanie\" you moaned. \"I don't need your commentary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this would, like, explain a few things....\" Mel said, mostly to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Explain\" you snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, Hayley's reaction. She found out too, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but keep it to yourself.

They're totally girly, and not necessary. You're like, either hiding something or using them for distraction. Which is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor an airheaded ditz, Mel could be perceptive. She grabbed your left sock and pulled it off before you could react. Not only were your toes still webbed, but your foot was covered with koi colored scales, like your mermaid tail. While still a foot in both appearnce and functionality, you could tell it was well on it's way in becoming a fin. Mel dropped your sock, stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy now?\" you angrily snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel looked at you, dazed, yet she still gave you a shallow nod.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The second Hayley arrived back home, she marched up to your room, andlifted the spell that had trapped you and Mel. Neither of you could escape though, as your surprised sister blocked the way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is she doing?\" Hayley demanded as pointed to Mel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I called her in.

You didn't pay too much attention, as you wanted answers. And payback. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hayley. A word\" you demanded, as you pushed your way out. As soon as you was in the hall, you vented. \"Why did you bring Kimberley Hart here, when you could have just told me, and more importantly, WHY DID YOU TRAP ME IN MY ROOM WITH MELANIE!?! Not only she gave me a shower in my OWN room, I know SHE IS UP TO SOMETHING!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Lucy.

You failed to do what you wanted, and wore yourself out. Be thankful that Lucy didn't feel vengeful due to your vulnerability. She doesn't need magic, which she certainly has, to get payback.

I have another, extremely reckless, daughter that is still technically a mermaid.

Normally, I would suggest that you go and learn magic at Witchbloom, even at the risk of being trapped in your feminine form, however from what Forester has told me, when you initially transformed, you nearly were dressed in a sailor fuku. It is too dangerous to send you to Witchbloom, unless I reverse the racial spell, which would be nearly pointless. If I go the opposite extreme and push your own spells, it would things could spiral out of control. I could try and break the twin bond between you and Mel by changing your age, but I think it is too late for that. you'd just drag her down with you.

Immediately you screamed, horrified. You legs were completely fused into your golden colored mermaid tail, and your chest was completely bare, the cheer uniform and bra having faded into non-existence. A quick glance at Megan told you that she was the same, though she seemed to be suffering more from the teleportation, and still unable to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is happening, Lucy?\" Megan said, her voice uncertain and clearly uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bit your lip, not sure how to respond.

You (and Mel) barely had time to even take it in, before mom flung both balls at you and Mel, impacting in the torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you do that?\" Mel demanded, clearly worried. She quickly looked around for anything to dry herself with, but there wasn't anything. Five seconds after impact, she tripped backwards, thanks to her newly formed mermaid tail. After a quick glance at her own body, which you also undertook, she angrily turned on mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, you knew this would happen to me!\" Mel whined. \"Turn me back to normal, right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could sympathise, but wondered why you remained unaffected. not that you wanted a golden colored tail and a pair of seashells. The voice answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">'Because you're Kasumi.'</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Give it a rest' you thought, as a strange feeling overtook you. You was puzzled, then remembered your own mermaidifaction before this whole 'Kasumi' thing really took root. Feeling more annoyed than anything, you fell onto your back. Mom pre-empted you own, angry complaints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to admit, I'm pleased this happened, girls\" mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleased?! Have you, like, lost your mind?\" Mel ranted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it as a marker. It proves there is still a conception between you two girls. Even with John's changes\" mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">'She means 'Kasumi', since that's who you are!'</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it a rest\" you growled, as Mel gave you an odd stare, Mom however, didn't even flinch. She nodded, and said, \"I know who that comment was directed towards. As I was saying, the changes are slower, but still present. I suggest you girls, Mel especially, read up on ways to prevent contact with water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've totally got a better idea. You lift this curse, or whatever it is\" Mel snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. There is another thing, Mel. Just how 'Kasumi' changed, albeit slower than yours, the girl that's doing this has formed a link. She is going to change too. Just like a magnet onto some pins\" mom said, somewhat pleased.</span></div></div>",

The elderly woman was very short with her grey hair tied into a small bun near the top of her head and deep blue eyes. She was professionally dressed and carried a willow wood cane with a small round crystal on the top. The teenage girl was Hayley's age with shoulder length blond hair and blue eyes. The boy was near your height with longish brown hair and green eyes. You noticed that he seemed very shy and jumpy.

Although you did not notice, Hayley spotted mom watching Carla and Gwen with cold, calculating eyes. She could tell mom was scrutinizing every detail of their words and hand movements. In a flash, you were back to your normal self but exhausted. You were dazed in the chair as Gwen smiled at mom. \"The curse is lifted.\" With a hint of relief, she said. \"Your son should be free from its effects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"Good work, young lady.\" Firmly, she said. \"Only...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why has mommy allowed her to stay with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To keep an eye on her, I guess\" you said, as you headed for the door. Despite Mel's eyes pleading for you not to go. A couple of minutes later, you knocked on Megan's front door, and to your surprise, Dr Thompson answered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I might be seeing you\" she said. \"Are you okay?\" You could tell Dr Thompson was staring at your extremely girly attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... Is Megan home? I heard she is badly shaken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, though I don't know what scares her more. The idea of you permanently being a girl, or in her words, 'an obviously evil witch living with you and you're not doing a thing'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to talk to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to share clothes... Seriously, why leave the house, Lucy. With what happened to you....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instantly paled as you realised Dr Thompson knew about your mermaidication. \"H-how did you know about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think, Lucy. You can come in, but don't talk about your seashells\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm not going to\" you said dryly.</span></div></div>",

John slowly regained consciousness a few minutes later, and immediately realized something was wrong.  For starters, his vision was suddenly blocked by some long blonde hair.  <i>What the hell?</i>  When he brought a hand up to move the hair out of the way, he was surprised to see it was suddenly much smaller and daintier than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to know what was going on, he got to his feet and ran over to the mirror on the back of his door.  If the blonde hair and dainty hands were a surprise, John was positively floored by what he saw in the mirror.  Instead of seeing a reflection of himself wearing his shorts and Call of Duty t-shirt, he saw a reflection of Hannah wearing her favorite violet-colored dress.  <i>No, this can\u2019t be happening!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn\u2019s fears were quickly realized when the reflection in the mirror copied every move he made; down to the horrified expression on his face.  Suddenly feeling overwhelmed, John screamed at the top of his lungs. After screaming for a moment, John stopped when he heard groaning coming from behind him.  Turning around, he saw his body turn over onto its back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn didn\u2019t need to be a genius to figure out that if he was Hannah\u2019s body, she was likely in his.  Running over to his body, suddenly aware of how much bigger everything was, he started shaking his body.  \u201cHannah, is that you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah slowly opened her eyes; only for them to bug out when she saw who was standing over her.  \u201cWho are you and why do you look like me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Hannah became aware of the fact that her voice was different, John looked at her and said, \u201cHannah it\u2019s me, John.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohn?\u201d Looking at him, Hannah said, \u201cWhy do you look like me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably for the same reason you look like me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up, Hannah said, \u201cWhat are you...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah stopped mid-sentence when she saw her reflection in the mirror.  Seeing the horrified look on her face, John said, \u201cWhat exactly did you read from that book, Hannah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know.\u201d Running her hands over her new body, Hannah said, \u201cIt said it was supposed to help two people understand each other better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re in each other\u2019s bodies; I think it\u2019s safe to say it did that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her way over to the mirror, Hannah started touching her face.  \u201cWhat are we supposed to do now?\u201d turning to John, scared, Hannah said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be an icky boy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you seriously think I want to be <i>you</i>?\u201d spotting the book on the floor, John said, \u201cThe spell you used came from that book; see if there\u2019s a way to undo it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah went over to grab the book.  John watched as she ruffled through the book for a moment.  Closing the book, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t get it, the pages are blank.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat jogged John\u2019s memory a little bit; remembering something he noticed when he first found the book.  \u201cI noticed some writing earlier that said the book isn\u2019t for male eyes.\u201d Sighing, John said, \u201cI\u2019m a girl now, so maybe it\u2019ll work for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanding the book to John, Hannah said, \u201cIt\u2019s worth a try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, downstairs, Melanie was walking into the house; having stayed at school to chat with some friends.

Is anyone home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to walk into the kitchen to get a drink when she heard movement upstairs.  Going upstairs, she heard voices coming from John\u2019s bedroom.  As she got closer, she realized they belonged to John and Hannah.  Walking up to the closed door, she listened as John said, \u201cCan you see anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Pausing, Hannah said, \u201cThere\u2019s definitely some writing here, but I\u2019m having a hard time making it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering what they were talking about, Melanie opened the door to find Hannah holding the family spellbook in her lap.  Running into the room, before John or Hannah could react to her presence; she grabbed the book and said, \u201cHannah, you shouldn\u2019t be reading this!  It\u2019s far too dangerous!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little late for that, Mel.\u201d Looking at her, Hannah said, \u201cI\u2019m not Hannah, I\u2019m John.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Placing the book down on John\u2019s desk, Melanie said, \u201cLet\u2019s say, for a moment, that I believe what you two are saying.\u201d  Kneeling down to John\u2019s level, Melanie said, \u201cIf you\u2019re really John then you\u2019ll be able to tell me what happened to Rachel Johnson at lunch today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel Johnson was on the cheer squad with Megan, and she viewed Megan as her chief rival on the squad.  John wasn\u2019t sure what lead to the altercation in the lunchroom, but Rachel had approached their table with a bone to pick with Megan.  It all happened so quickly that he barely had time to process what happened.  Looking at Melanie, he said, \u201cShe slipped on a puddle split soda, bumped into another student\u2019s lunch tray and fell to the floor with spaghetti all over her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn hoped that was enough to convince Melanie that they were telling the truth; although she might think that he\u2019d told Hannah that story.  To be honest, he probably would have if he hadn\u2019t ended up in her body.  With a flabbergasted look on her face, Melanie said, \u201cJohn?  That\u2019s really you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs strange as that sounds?\u201d placing his hands on his waist, John said, \u201cIt\u2019s really me in here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Melanie burst out laughing; causing both John and Hannah to glare at her, which only made her laugh even harder.  Once she finally stopped, Melanie said, \u201cThis is too funny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you think it\u2019s funny, Mel.\u201d Pouting, Hannah said, \u201cYou think I want to be an icky boy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I really don\u2019t want to be my own little sister.\u201d Looking at Melanie, John said, \u201cYou said there were body swap spells in that book; can\u2019t you find one to undo this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUndo what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, everyone turned to find Mom standing in the doorway with a confused look on her face.  With a weak smile, Melanie said, <br>\r\n\u201cHi, Mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, Melanie.\u201d Turning serious, Mom said, \u201cDoes someone care to explain what\u2019s going on here?\u201d</span></div></div>",

When they were finished, John could tell that Mom was upset.  With the book on the table in front of her, Mom just stared at the others sitting across from her \u2013 John never felt so small in his life; and it wasn\u2019t just because he was in Hannah\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was getting nervous as they wondered what Mom was going to do.  Taking a deep breath, Mom looked at Melanie and said, \u201cYou\u2019re grounded until further notice, young lady.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d shocked, Melanie said, \u201cBut I didn\u2019t do anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you?\u201d sighing, Mom said, \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t been so careless with the book, your brother and sister would still be in their rightful bodies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I spent hours looking for once I realized it was missing.\u201d Gesturing to John, Melanie said, \u201cHow was I supposed to know John would find it, or that Hannah would be stupid enough to read it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d glaring at Melanie, Hannah said, \u201cI\u2019m not stupid, you\u2019re stupid!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe that as it may, you\u2019re still grounded until I say otherwise.\u201d Pausing, Mom said, \u201cWhich, I\u2019m afraid, means you won\u2019t be going to that concert this weekend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis totally sucks!\u201d getting up, Melanie glared at John and Hannah, \u201cThanks a lot, you guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Melanie stormed off, Hannah and John turned to mom.  Looking at Mom, Hannah said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to us, Mommy?  Can you undo the spell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn winced when he heard his own body talking like a little girl.  Looking at Hannah, Mom said, \u201cI could undo it, quite easily, but I\u2019m not going to \u2013 at least not yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was John and Hannah\u2019s turn to be upset.  Both of them looked at Mom and said, \u201cWhat!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not going to undo the spell; Hannah needs to learn there are consequences for her actions.\u201d<br>\r\nWhile Hannah started tearing up, John looked at Mom and said, \u201cI\u2019m kind of the victim in all this, why am I being punished?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not being punished, John; but I think this will do you some good as well.\u201d Sighing, Mom said, \u201cThe purpose of that spell was to help two people understand each other; I think it will do you good to have a better understanding of what Hannah\u2019s life is like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOvercome with emotion, Hannah stormed out of the kitchen in tears; like she usually did whenever she didn't get her way.  After a moment, John turned to Mom and said, \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to be a 7-year-old girl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sweetie, but my decision stands.\u201d  Looking at John, rather cryptically, Mom said, \u201cIf you give it time, I think you\u2019ll find this is for the best.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot likely.\u201d Getting out of the chair, John said, \u201cWhat am I supposed to do now?  Can I go play some video games?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so, those are way too violent for a 7-year-old girl.\u201d Sighing, Mom said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have to find something to do in Hannah\u2019s room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling to himself as he walked out of the kitchen, to no one in particular, John said, \u201cI wish I never found that stupid book.\u201d<br>\r\nOnce everyone was out of the kitchen, Mom sat back in the chair and said, \u201cPerhaps this incident can fix what I couldn\u2019t do 7 years ago.\u201d</span></div></div>",

As she stood in the doorway, she noticed how small everything in her room seemed now.  Going over to her dolls, she sat down and grabbed one of them.  As she held it in her hands, Hannah started to tear up again, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I have to be an icky boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think I want to be a little girl, Hannah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, Hannah spotted John standing in the doorway; one hand behind his back and the other holding the hem of her favorite dress.  \u201cWhat do you want, John?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate to do this; but technically, thanks to you, this is my room now.\u201d wincing, John walked into the room and said, \u201cYour room is down the hall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that\u2019s a boy\u2019s room!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like this any more than you do, Hannah.\u201d Sitting down next to his little sister turned older brother, John said, \u201cBut we\u2019ll just have to live with this until Mom decides to change us back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to regain her composure, Hannah said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I got us swapped, John.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.\u201d Looking at Hannah, flashing the same smile she would give, John said, \u201cMaybe Mom\u2019s right; maybe this will help bring us closer together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Hannah and John made peace with each other, they spent almost 30 minutes having a tea party.  As time went by, although he would never admit it, John found himself enjoying the experience.  He was just starting to get into it, playfully asking if Hannah wanted more tea when Melanie came walking into the room with a dour look on her face.  \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you two are having so much fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForgive us for making the best of a bad situation, Melanie.\u201d Trying to sound intimidating in Hannah\u2019s body was difficult, but John did what he could.  \u201cWe\u2019re in this mess because you were irresponsible with the magic book.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not the one who read a spell out of the book.\u201d Gesturing to Hannah, Melanie said, \u201cYou could\u2019ve stopped Hannah from reading it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was I supposed to know something like <i>this</i> would happen?\" Looking at her, John said, \"I didn't even know magic existed until today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn heard the sound of the phone ringing downstairs; followed shortly after by the sounds of a muffled conversation.  After a moment the sound of footsteps coming up the stairs could be heard.  Mom appeared in the doorway to Hannah\u2019s room; looking at John, she said, \u201cThat was Kelly\u2019s mom inviting Hannah to a sleepover tonight.\u201d  Pausing, she said, \u201cI hope you don't mind if I said yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I care if Hannah's been invited to a sleepover?\" Suddenly the reality of the situation dawned on John.  His face turning pale, John said, \u201cThere's no way I'm going to a sleepover with a bunch of little girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the time being, John, you are in Hannah's body.\" Sighing, Mom said, \"I'm sorry but that means you have to be her, and that includes going to school and playing with her friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious, Mom; I have no idea how to act like a 7-year-old girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a solution to that problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Mom, with a confused look, John said, \u201cWhat kind of solution?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s called a mimic spell.\u201d Taking a breath, Mom says, \u201cIt\u2019s used to help someone blend in with a certain group; in this case, a group of 7-year-old girls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn suddenly had a bad feeling in his stomach.  Looking at Mom, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not permanent, is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry; I\u2019ll remove the spell when you come home tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill I remember that I\u2019m supposed to be a boy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis spell doesn\u2019t affect memories; only personalities.\u201d Sighing, Mom said, \u201cSo yes; you\u2019ll be a 7-year-old girl with the memories of a 13-year-old boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn paused to think it over for a few moments.  He wasn\u2019t too keen on the idea of attending a girl\u2019s sleepover; but if mom had a way to make it easier, he\u2019d be stupid not to go for it.  Taking a deep breath, John said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then.\u201d Looking at Melanie, Mom said, \u201cMelanie, honey, you might want to leave the room for a moment.  Hannah and I will be protected from the spell\u2019s effects, but I\u2019d rather not have to explain why my 13-year-old daughter suddenly has the mind of a little girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie didn\u2019t argue as she turned to leave; closing the door behind her.  She leaned against the opposite wall for a few minutes until the door opened again.  Seeing Mom in the doorway, she said, \u201cDid the spell work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome and see for yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie walked back into the room to find John and Hannah in the corner by Hannah\u2019s dollhouse.  There wasn\u2019t anything particularly strange about that; since John would occasionally play with Hannah like that.  What amused Melanie was the sight of her twin brother and little sister acting like they were 7-year-old girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Hannah, you\u2019re doing it wrong!\u201d Holding a dog figurine in his hands, John said, \u201cThe doggy goes \u2018woof\u2019 not \u2018bark.\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind her, Melanie heard Mom say, \u201cLet\u2019s go John; I promised Kelly\u2019s mom I\u2019d have you at the house by 5:00.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, mommy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she and Hannah watched John follow after Mom, skipping down the hall just like Hannah would do, Melanie hoped her carelessness wouldn\u2019t take her brother from her.</span></div></div>",

Melanie was about to start watching TV again when there was a knock at the door.  Thinking it was Mom; she got up and walked to the front door \u2013 only to find Megan and Harry standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening to the door, she said, \u201cHey guys, what\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were thinking of going to the movies tonight.\u201d Pausing, Megan said, \u201cWe were hoping John and you would like to come.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d love to come, but I\u2019m grounded until further notice.\u201d Sighing, Melanie said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure John is feeling all that well either; I <br>\r\nthink we may pass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, that sucks.\u201d Groaning, Harry said, \u201cWe were going to go see The Hermit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hermit was a newly released teen slasher movie; one that Melanie really wanted to see.  Before Melanie could say anything else, Hannah came out of the bathroom.  \u201cWow, peeing standing up is really...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohn!\u201d turning around, blushing, Melanie said, \u201cHarry and Megan are here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie didn\u2019t know it, but Hannah also had a little crush on Harry; ever since he fixed a flat tire on her bike a few months back.  Walking up to them, making sure to act as John would, she said, \u201cHey guys, what\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe came to see if Melanie and you wanted to go see The Hermit tonight, but she\u2019s grounded and you\u2019re not feeling well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d unaware of what Melanie had told them, Hannah said, \u201cI feel fine; I\u2019d love to go to the movies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohn, can I talk to you for a moment?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter indicting that she\u2019d be right back, Hannah followed Melanie down the hall to the kitchen.

To empathize that you were wearing Cinderella's dress, a couple of blue pads formed at the top of your skirt, near the bodice. To finish things off, you felt that your now hidden shoes were changing, and you knew that they'd become a pair of glass slippers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah!

It uses energy, leaving a witch exhausted if she does it too much. That's the reason why I've worked on my fitness. It's also a reason why someone young cannot normally work magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Hannah can work magic\" you said in a low voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.

Go get yourself cleaned up\" Dr Thompson urged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan is still in the bathroom. I can just head back home\" you protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll be finished by now, and I'm sure you'd both want to spend more time together\" Dr Thompson said. Not wanting to make a scene, you reluctantly headed up towards the bathroom. As the Doc said, Megan had finished up and was in her room. You closed the door, and locked it. After washing your face, and dried it, your eyes spotted Megan's discarded cheer uniform. Instantly, your desires to wear it returned. So did your physical changes; you saw that your pink nails and shoulder length blond hair returned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it\" you growled, softly to yourself, still wanting to dress up....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You wondered who you could turn to for help, and the only one that made sense to you was Dr Thompson. You were in her house, and she knew about magic. It would be plausible for you to say that someone had enchanted Megan's clothes in order to entrap you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a mistake, as you began to think about wearing them more than ever. Without realizing it, you stripped off your clothes. Only as your underwear hit the floor did you realize what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can't do that! What if I'm caught? Even if I don't change, it'll mean it's over for us. This is wrong! Put them back on, now </i>you mind screamed, but your body had other ideas. Despite all your mental protests, your hands grabbed Megan's panties from out of the basket and put them on, followed by her tube socks. Next was her bra. As you snapped it on, you felt your body starting to change, mainly about your hips and chest. Horrified, you noticed that your chest felt itchy once more, signifying that you were starting to grow breasts and worse, the panties seemed to fit better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicked, you tried to focus on trying to break whatever curse or trance that had your body on autopilot, but it was too strong. You grabbed Megan's uniform and started putting it on. Although you put on the skirt without much of a struggle, you felt that your body was becoming more responsive to your thoughts as you slid on the cheer top. Unfortunately, as you regained full control, you saw that there had been significant damage; your face was much more feminine, with a slight button nose, and raised checkbones. Your chest must had been in the b cup range, making it impossible to hide your new assets, but the worst thing was that your waist had caved in, while your hips and butt had flared out. You weren't quite a girl yet, but you didn't look at all masculine, even if you got out of these clothes. You feared what would happen if mom saw you like this.</span></div></div>",

You had to change. Quickly, you removed the borrowed cheerleader uniform, hoping that in doing so, your body would revert back to normal, but after a minute, you saw that your body was still girlish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, no!\" you screamed. Normally, your changed, higher pitched voice would be the cause for concern, but the other changes were more concerning. Your breasts looked even bigger than what they did whilst clothed, and they definitely had a feminine look to them, but your lower half was worse. The only masculine part of your lower body was your manhood, and even that was only two inches at most. All the rest were changed, such as your new bubble butt, or gone, such as your balls. You were so depressed by the sight, you nearly put the panties back on just to hide your changes from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I going to do?\" you moaned as you heard the sound of someone knocking on the bathroom door. it was Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John? What is happening? I heard screaming...\" Megan asked, concerned. Almost immediately, you felt faint, knowing you were trapped. Seconds later, you fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you came around, you found yourself bound to a chair, staring at the Thompson kitchen. Megan was also in the kitchen, also bound to a chair. She was knocked out cold. \"What is going on?\" you tried to say, but it came out muffled as someone had gagged you. Just like Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you're feeling confused, John\" a voice said. it was Dr Thompson, and mom was standing next to here. \"I heard Megan screaming, so I investigated. She was also knocked out, from shock. I got you some clean underwear, then Natalie and I tied you both up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, I know it's hard for you to accept, but you're going to change\" mom said gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm\" you moaned through your gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would listen to her. I can't even pretend I know about her abilities\" Dr Thompson advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm\" you moaned. mom walked over to you and removed you gag. \"Yes, sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone enchanted Megan's clothes\" you protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possible. I will investigate. However, it doesn't change the fact your condition has forced me to step in. I warned you what would happen, and the fact it has only been 24 hours does not bode well for you, Lucy\" mom said, as another set of moans emerged. Megan had regained consciousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I know all too well that seeing your reality shattering can be more than a little frightening\" mom said as she restored Megan's gag.

Obviously she didn't want you mentioning that you were in Samantha Forester's basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Lucy, but until you both calm down, you're both staying like this\" mom said. Worse, Dr Thompson nodded in agreement. You slumped into your chair as you watched both women walk out of the room, but Megan was still straining against her bonds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natalie\" Dr Thompson said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\" mom said, instantly causing you to worry for your friend.

A pale pink tube top hugged your chest, covering a strapless push up bra, which highlighted your new assets a little too much for your liking. Worse, it exposed your midriff as well, making you feel extremely awkward, and exposed. A matching pink skirt was around your waist, again exposing far more of your girlish legs than you wanted. Basically, you were wearing what Mel would wear when she was out of school, and you hated both it and the fact you wore it far better than what she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry girls, but you're too freaked out right now. We'll be back shortly\" Dr Thompson said as she walked out of the room, with mom closely following her. Once alone, you stared up at Megan. She was staring back at you, still wide eyed from seeing you get transformed into a girlier version of your already ditzy, twin sister. She thrashed against her chair, but the rope securing her was too tight. After five minutes, she slumped into her chair. Like yourself, she realized that neither of you would be going anywhere anytime soon. You closed your eyes, defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes later, you heard Megan's voice. \"Oh my god, John...\" Opening your eyes, you saw that somehow Megan was free from her prison, and still freaked out. She was about to flee, when you made a muffled plea through your gag. Pausing, Megan considered her position for a few minutes, before removing your gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Get me out of here, Meg\" you pleaded, alarmed that your voice had changed even more. It definitely belonged to a teenaged girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan stared at you, but thankfully after another couple of minutes of hesitation, began to remove yours bonds. Getting off you chair told you that you were now physically 100% girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to help me\" you pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how?

It was merely a coincidence that the wig was the same color.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the style?\" Fuming, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It likely stayed in that style because you feared it would.\" Patiently, Samantha said. \"I had absolutely no involvement, directly or indirectly, in your permanent transformation, young lady.\" She took a breath, likely to calm herself. \"I have made some mistakes in my youth, causing trust issues with your mother. Your unfounded accusations are not helping matters in the least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you at least change me back?\" Desperate, you pleaded. \"Please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha shook her head. \"You were born into one of the most magically powerful families in existence.\" Ruefully, she said. \"The instant your dormant magic awakened, it became too strong for your male form to contain.

From the stunned look on her face, and the slight startled scream she emitted, she was obviously unaware of what happened to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God? John? What happened?\" Mel stammered, shocked. Initially, her facial expressions changed from shock to pleasure, as you knew she  always had wanted a girl twin, but her pleased look didn't last long. She was checking out your body and had quickly realized that you were curvier, more developed, and generally prettier than her. It didn't help that you were dressed in clothes that she would normally wear, giving you another reason to hate tube tops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is wrong with you?!

We're going to have to work on that temper of yours before you curse some guy checking you out, or another girl jealous over your appearance. like it or not, you are pretty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. Can I have my towel and some decent clothes- that's from my point of view, not yours\" you hastily added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are planning to wear proper underwear, Lucy. That is the other thing I've added to your room, though everything else is still intact\" mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mom\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There, you met Harry and Tim, both looking trapped between excitement and worry. You were all placed onto a jet and flown to another small airport on the other side of the country. There, you were taken by jeep to the cabin deep in an isolated patch of wilderness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think is really going on here, John?\" Whispering, Harry asked. \"I mean, to suddenly be given the vacation of a lifetime without a catch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there's a catch alright.\" Frowning, you said. \"If we are hit with too much magic, we'll be girls just like my sisters for life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim reacted as expected. \"Ew!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There will be no magic where you boys are going.\" Calmly, the female driver said. \"This cabin was designed to to give boys a chance to get away from everything for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresently, the jeep stopped at a quaint little cabin with a small lake not too far away. You, Harry, and Tim were escorted inside while a number of women who were there waiting unloaded your luggage. \"There are three bedrooms upstairs.\" Kindly, the driver said. \"There is a bathroom on the first floor off the kitchen in the back.\" She smiled. \"There is a second bathroom on the second floor at the end of the aisle at the top of the staircase.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of the supplies you will need for fishing and boating are in the shed in the back yard.\" Chiming in, another woman said. \"Everything is fully stocked. If you need anything, the radio is in the dinning area.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the woman left you, Harry, and Tim to your own devices. Once the jeep had driven out of sight, you turned to Harry, smiling. \"Dibs on the refrigerator.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of your scrambled to the kitchen, laughing and joking with each other before you opened the fridge to find it was filled to the brim with anything you could possibly want. You and the others grabbed a root beer and began to enjoy your first taste of freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to you, your cousin, or friend, Harry Rich's eye for 'rare antiques' has placed him at risk of becoming a powerful witch, the first of his bloodline which many witches would love to adopt. Tim had shown signs of becoming a siren witch if transformed into a girl. A siren witch could temporarily control the minds of witch boys, non-magic people, and even witches to some degree, depending upon their magical strength. Then there was your still unknown endless magical reserves. Any one of you could be a great prize to any witch for different reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral yards away, the woman who drove you, Harry, and Tim to the cabin was in a high tower, hidden among the trees. She smiled, watching you through a small crystal ball then turned to a radio. \"John the familiar, Harry the first witch boy, and Tim the siren witch boy are in isolation.\" Calmly, she reported. \"The perimeter has been secured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ensure no one gets near the the boys until I give the all clear to release them.\" Firmly, Elvira's voice ordered. \"We will have our hands full if a rogue witch gets her hands on any one of them.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mine has snapped itself closed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Mine has too. I can't believe I'm wearing this. It looks like something dumb old Brooke would wear\" Tim whined, referring to his ten year old sister. You gave a sigh; so far yours were the only one not fully closed, where as both Tim and Harry were wearing a bra albeit on the outside of their clothes. \"Maybe these are attracted to magic\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that the best you can come up with?\" Tim said scornfully. \"So what kind of girl will this turn you into, cootie-brain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One that would still be more powerful than you, Princess. Keep talking and I swear, I'll make you girlier than Hannah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Mommy told me would have siren powers. I'd make you the girlie one...\" Tim snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it\" Harry interrupted. \"I'm not going to stay here listening to the two of you argue. I'm going to see if there is a way to cut these things off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea\" you said, knowing Harry made sense. As Harry brushed his way past you and Tim, the bra rapidly sank through his clothes and onto his chest....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To his own horror, there was nothing but plastic silverware. There were no scissors anywhere to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom told me I had to be away from magic.\" Tearfully, Tim wailed. \"Why is this place trying to make me look like a mush brained girl!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Tim was insulting, he had a point. \"That is a very good question.\" Becoming angry, you said. \"Let's see if they have a very good answer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou marched out of the kitchen and into the dinning room to find the radio.

I am a twin to a witch; twins have this weird connection with each other.\" Pale, you said. \"If I become a girl and a witch with all of that power, Mel's power will grow with it to form a balance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and queen, err, Melanie would be unstoppable.\" Quivering, Tim muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you nodded. \"All of us, if we become girls, we would become a fine prize for any witch.\" Disturbed by the thought, you said. \"We need to call a truce and stay civil with each other until we are either taken out of here or we can find a means of escape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how do we escape?\" Eagerly, Tim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm working on that.\" Wincing, you replied. \"First, we need to find all of the traps and find a way to keep them from springing on us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you should take the lead.\" Nervous, Harry said. \"Since you have the most magical potential, maybe you can fight of any traps we may set off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed before nodding in agreement. The three of you then slowly began to search the rest of the cabin with you in the lead, hoping you can summon magic, if you had to. You wonly hoped using magic won't increase your chances of becoming Lucy for good.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Normally, it would work, but you and your companions are a special case. Harry would become a first witch, Tim a siren and you yourself would be insanely powerful. I'm was trying to prevent that. I am still trying to prevent that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just how are you going to do that?\" you demanded. You didn't really trust this girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The head witch is already angry with me for giving you the cake, and any further mishaps will have her turn me into either a baby, or a boy. Or both\" Gina said, shuddering. \"I'm already breaking the rules being here, and I'm definitely doing so by giving you this\" Magically, Gina produced a plain looking box. \"The contents of this box and the ones I've placed in Harry's and Tim's rooms will absorb magic if worn. Do what you will with it\" Gina said, as she disappeared, the box floating to the ground. The second the box hit the floor, the door was magically unsealed. Both Harry and Tim burst through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look pale, John.

Fortunately, Tim's older body was smaller than the average ten year old so his clothes didn't choke him.

We're leaving right now\" you ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away. You're turning me into some cootie ridden idiot. I'm wearing stupid earrings like Princess Cootie and dumb old Brooke\" Tim wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll find a way to exchange them. Besides, I'm wearing them too, in case you haven't noticed\" you said, annoyed. There wasn't time to deal with Tim's shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim got up and faced you. Instantly, his expression changed from horror and despair to bemusement. \"You're a stupid girl now. What is your name? Lucy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim. You're going to change us all\" you said, wincing as you wondered whether there was something to knock him out. Carrying him as the ultimate dead weight was preferable to his taunting causing progressively worse changes. You're all be female for several hours before he came to his senses and apologized, which would be far too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? You're a stupid icky porridge brain now. I don't have to listen to you. Why don't you play with your dollies?\" Tim giggled as he started to sing a taunting song. You turned to Harry, as if you wanted to make a plan to rush Tim before he could do any further damage, but to your horror, Harry had a blank look on his face. Almost like he was in a trance....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim! Your powers! You're a siren....\" you gasped.</span></div></div>",

I have no choice now but to intervene.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe vanished from the tower and appeared between you and Tim. \"That is quite enough, young ladies.\" Firmly but kindly, she said. \"We had sent you three here in the hopes of saving you from a worse fate than this and it partially worked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did this to us!?\" Through gritted teeth, you demanded. \"What do you mean a worse fate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As John, you were a familiar, Lucy.\" Patiently, Elvira replied. \"A familiar is normally a cat or crow with unimaginable magical reserves that a witch can harness for her own use.\" She leaned in close and added, \"For a familiar to be human is very rare; for that familiar to be a boy is extremely rare. Every witch would have been after you for your power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped, turning white with horror. \"What am I now?\" Trembling, you asked. \"What about them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira sighed. \"Now, you are simply a very powerful witch.\" Softly, Elvira said. \"As for Tim, he was developing siren abilities as a boy. As such, he would have been able to make girls, even witches, 'fall in love' with him and do what ever he wanted.\" She shook her head. \"If a rogue witch could manipulate him, he would be a powerful weapon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm an icky mush-brained girl!\" Tearfully, Tim whined. \"Change me back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira smiled. \"Had you stayed a boy, every girl, with or without magic, would have soon been after you with love letters, kiss notes, romantic phone calls...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim's face twisted in horror. \"Ew! No! No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax... Tina.\" Calmly, Elvira said. \"Now you have the power to swoon boys but you must be trained.\" She grinned. \"Unless you want every boy after you with love in their eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim, or rather Tina, slid down to a sitting position and began to cry. \"Why me?\" Miserable, she demanded. \"I just want to be a normal kid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are normal, Tina.\" Gently, Elvira said. \"You are simply entering a new page in your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina continued to cry and Elvira turned back to you. \"She will be needing counseling.\" Softly, she said. \"Tim's greatest fear was that allowing a girl to get too close would result in her getting hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he taunted girls to keep them away.\" Worried, you said. \"He should have had counseling then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We was receiving it.\" Sighing, Elvira replied. \"That was until his siren abilities began to surface.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Harry?\" Turning to your friend, you asked. \"What was his, err her story?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry had an eye for anything magical.\" Frowning, Elvira said. \"He had this gift, or curse, long before he met your family; he had been absorbing magic most of his life.\" She shrugged. \"Even if he had not meet your family, his fate would have been the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that's it?\" Snapping out of his trance, Harry asked. \"Our fates are sealed? We're all girls for life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing is etched in stone... Bethany.\" Patiently, Elvira said. \"You are close to becoming a first witch or the first witch in a non-magical family.\" She smiled. \"If this is your fate, you will not lose your parents but you will be assigned a witch nanny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry, or rather Bethany rolled her eyes. \"Perfect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there any hope of us getting out of here still us?\" Worried, you demanded. \"I mean us as boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira sighed. \"I won't sugar coat this.\" Firmly, she said. \"Gina Port's misguided attempts to make things easier for you three backfired, making things harder instead.\" She hushed you silent before a protest could begin. \"She is now paying dearly for that mistake. To answer your question, you all have a slight chance of regaining your boyhood but I seriously doubt you can pull it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Desperate, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all need to shut up and get along for at least two weeks so the changes that had happened have a chance to reverse themselves.\" Bluntly, she replied. \"Keep arguing and panicking and you will be leaving here before the summer ends to start your new lives as girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, she vanished from the room. Once she was gone, you turned to Bethany, wondering what to do as Tina continued to cry on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Five minutes ago\" Tabitha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. That was Tina's siren powers\" Elvira replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tina? I thought her name was going to be Tiffany. That is what I used on the radio\" Tabitha said, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira visibly winced. \"That was a mistake. I know her, and trust me, do not use that name for her.

I didn't mean any harm\" Gina begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe so, but you have caused significant damage and while not fully girls yet, they're at the point where they're more female than male. I cannot have a young child running around here any further.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! I can't go home like this! I can still be of use here\" Gina pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira paused and after a few seconds gave her decision. \"Yes. You're right. You can be of use. Regression punishment has been revoked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina gave a shocked look as she quickly aged back to her true age. Without realizing it, he gave a faint smile, but Elvira wasn't too impressed. \"I would not smile too quickly, Miss Port. You're still going to get a punishment, and I suspect you would soon have wished I had sent you home in disgrace. Due to their new ages, and that your incompetence has regressed them faster than anticipated, the girls will need a babysitter. Give them space, but be there when necessary. One more thing.

Did your grandmother refer to us as girls because we're actually girls, or is it because we're starting to gain our magical abilities?\" Harry asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. Of course, both of them could had found the answer for themselves, but you guessed they weren't wanting to find the answer that way. \"So far you can see the changes. All of us have girlish faces, hairstyles, nails and figures. Tim and I have slightly more pronounced curves compared to you, Harry, which I assume is due to genetics. Same goes with the clothes. Both of us are dressed way more girly than you. The major difference is down below...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How bad?\" Harry said, wincing. Tim however looked confused, protected by his youth. After spending a couple of minutes explaining to him the main difference between boys and girls, in which surprisingly he didn't interrupt with his usual taunts of cooties, Tim gave you a disgusted cry of 'Ewwww'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I afraid we're got one now. The only good news I can say is that I don't feel any itchiness on my chest\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is that good news? We're like some stupid girls, and....\" Tim wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"it means the transformation isn't over. Admitting, we still have some of our masculinity left, but not much. I expect that to go fairly quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what can we do? I don't want to sit around with cootie magnets, wearing dresses, playing with dolls and other dumb games\" Tim wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax. You won't be playing with dolls, Tim' Harry said, giving you a sidewards glance. You knew what that meant, that he was at the age where girls started to outgrow them, but you decided to say nothing. Tim was already freaked out by the changes to his anatomy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what can we do? You may like your changes, but I don't\" Tim repeated himself, still wailing. You didn't know whether he was referring to you, or to Harry, who seemed to come out of it with a slight loss of age, a different hair color and different crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry snorted. \"Trust me, we don't want this...... YOU!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Tim span around to see why Harry's demeanour changed so quickly. Standing at the side of the room was Gina Port.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim immediately took a step towards the witch. \"Why are you here, you dumb ugly cootie condo? Are you here to finish us off? I don't want to be like you....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina stared at the furious blond. \"No. I here to help....\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Don't forget you're ten and I'm sixteen\" Gina warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't be sixteen days once my grandmother is through with you\" you countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe so, but I can't let you go around this house in your underwear. Besides, if you're feeling awkward about seeing the new you, don't be. One way to de-power a witch is to turn her into a guy, and trust me, that is a little awkward\" Gina said in a much softer voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" you pouted. Quietly, not wanting to attract the attention of either Harry or Tim, you headed from the bathroom. As feared, you were completely female, and it was highly embarrassing for you to have a shower. Especially since there were no soap; only some body wash that smelt like vanilla and flowers. Furthermore, the water felt different against your skin for some reason. Those reasons resulted in you cutting the shower short, and you quickly dried yourself as you steeled yourself for the worst part; dressing yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!, Gina\" you hissed as you saw the clothes that were left for you. It was a clean version of the less girlish outfit that you wore the previous day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything wrong?\" a voice called out. It was Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just having a shower, which has me smelling like a girl, and that witch has given me a copy of that outfit from yesterday\" you replied, not wanting to spook Harry by telling him about the major change to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.... Suppose I better give Tim the bad news\" Harry said. As you heard him walk away, you eyed the clothes and grimaced. Putting on the panties was easy enough; it was preferable to seeing your naked self, and they weren't as girly as they could have been. You were more hesitant with the training bra; you saw you didn't really need it, and you were mindful that you could induce further changes by acting girlishly. However, you knew it could sink straight through your clothes, and that Gina could do a lot worse to you, so you reluctantly put it on. Next came the dress. Although you were initially reluctant to go anywhere near it, you realized the shirt part of it could disguise the fact you were now completely a girl, so you put it on. Seeing that you were house bound, you ignored both the tights and mary janes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy now?\" you said, imagining that you were saying it to Gina. As you stared at the mirror, you saw that your hair was threatening to fall into your face. Annoyed that you had to take care of that, you looked around and saw that whilest you were in the shower, various girlish items had materialized in the room, mainly hair care and makeup. You ignored the make up, but eyed a pink scrunchie, figuring that a ponytail was the least bad option you had. As you grabbed the scrunchie and was preparing to place it into your hair, a second one appeared.</span></div></div>",

Not really knowing what you were doing, you merely wished the door to be open wide. Instead, it blew off the hinges and flew over a hundred feet away from the cabin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you do that!?\" Shocked, Tim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to the radio, hearing a female voice. \"What is going on over there!?\" Annoyed, the voice demanded. \"We are sensing high levels of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe radio exploded with the simple pointing of your finger. \"Shut up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry cringed at your sudden burst of temperament.

She held a neutral pose with four Amazon like women standing behind her. Unknown to you, they were her body guards, the elite of the elite when it came to magical combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Losing your temper will not solve anything, young lady.\" Calmly, Elvira scolded. \"Please go back into the cabin; we will replace the radio and repair the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want answers, grandma.\" Coldly, you demanded. \"If I don't get them now, we are marching out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will get the answers you want when you ask the right questions.\" Remaining calm, Elvira countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No games, grandma.\" Irritated, you said. \"You know my temper...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes; I know your temper very well.\" Smiling, Elvira said. \"Your father had the same temper only you have a better hold of it.\" She sighed seeing your face harden. \"You all need to learn patience and control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This cabin is turning us into girls!\" Cutting in, Tim wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, your own fears and anger are turning you into girls.\" Calmly, Elvira corrected. \"We placed you three together because you love to argue and fight among yourselves.\" She smiled. \"This you must control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you or anyone else could speak, Elvira began to sing a strange tune. The lyrics were in a language you did not recognize. The four women behind her began to sing with her. You tried to protest but your eyes instantly felt heavy, as did your legs. You had slumped to the ground alongside Tim and Harry, fast asleep. Elvira stopped singing with the four women stopping as well before she turned to Tabitha, smiling. \"That, my dear, is how you tame an angry witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, inside the cabin, you woke up to find yourself on the couch.

While you didn't know, and didn't want to know whether such an item would make its' wearer part fish, or whether it was just a part of some dress up costume, both you and harry knew mythology. Sirens were a subclass of mermaids, so seeing an item that screamed mermaid floating in a room with a guy that supposedly had siren powers was not a good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run!\" Harry yelled as the seashells flew straight at Tim. Worse, you noticed two additional pairs floated out of the chest. You gulped, briefly wondering if you should close and lock the door, effectively trapping Tim with the seashells, but you figured that it would be sure way to bras and skirts as leaving the door open;  your aunt would not be too happy if you sacrificed Tim. Tim didn't need any encouragement; he ran and made it out of the room, but not before the seasells had latched themselves onto the outside of his shirt. Harry didn't notice; he was too busy sealing the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" you said in a tone that said that you thought this was Tim's own fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you brainless cootie magnet.

The seashells emitted a faint, weird glow before they sank through Tim's shirt. Harry gave a startled gasp as he realized the implications; that even an indirect hit would cause a transformation. Once under his shirt, the shirt started to disappear, leaving Tim's torso bare, except for the seashells covering his otherwise flat chest. He didn't have time to react before you gave a high pitched scream. You had the best view of the room that was sealed, and while no item of clothing could possibly come from under the door, water started leaking instead. The initial trickle became a flood, and it splashed Tim's feet, which quickly started to take on a webbed appearance. Like with the shirt disappearance, neither you or Harry had time to fall back, and you felt the water splashing your own feet.

When you had noticed your new, webbed feet, the water level was barely above your toes. Now it was past your ankles. With it, it brought further changes as some scales started to form around your feet. Both you and Tim now had golden colored scales, similar to a coy, but Harry had blue-green, which was more inline with the classical look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but keep your legs as far apart as possible\" you ordered, showing the guys what you meant but walking to the door in a weird motion. It kept your legs apart, but lowered your height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? It'll slow us down, get us wetter, and Tim would probably trip over\" Harry protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Stay here and become the catch of the day, mushbrain\" Tim said as he followed your lead. Being the most transformed, he was the most terrified, and for once, was willing to do exactly what you said. It didn't help that the water was dissolving all your jeans, revealing your scaly legs. Unfortunately, while your motion worked well in air, and a low level of water, it didn't work in the now knee deep water you found yourselves in. Tim, being shorter and lighter, lost his footing and in that motion, brought his legs together. Instantly a membrane formed at the closest approach, connecting his legs. He screamed and tried to pull his legs apart, but the membrane thickened and spread further, speeding up Tim's metamorphosis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John. Pick him up. We have to make the front door become we're all like that!\" Harry ordered. The water was now at your upper thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What then?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry gave a screamed response; membranes of his own had started to form on his inner legs. While not connected, he knew it was a matter of time. Panicked, he pushed past you and waded towards the door.

You tried not to look, as Tim was looking increasingly more mermaid like. His hair was definitely lengthening, and  his former feet were taking a more finned look by slimming down. From the strange tingling feeling in your feet and that fact it was becoming harder to walk, you guessed the same thing was happening to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to get out of this cabin.

While you had been wading, he had been progressing further towards mermaidhood. His hair was down to shoulder length, and had two bumps on his chest which were covered with the same colored scales as his tail which reminded you of a croptop.

Your chest, while uncovered had a puffiness that were unmistakably breasts, and you could see that your hair had turned blond and was starting to fall into your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you scream like some frightened girl?\" Tim asked in a clearly ill-tempered voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw what was outside the cabin\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"</span></div></div>",

As the water rose, you wondered if you had the greatest mistake of your life, but after a couple of seconds, you realized that you could now breath underwater. Somewhat relieved, you tested your new tail and started to swim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out that you found swimming to be disturbingly easy, and both Tim and Harry had similar ease. \"Okay. I guess we can swim. That cabin is definitely in shallow water. The coast must be less than a half mile that way\" you said, pointing to your left. \"Come on. Just don't break the surface yet. We don't want to be seen like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Harry and Tim were slightly hesitant, but eventually followed your lead as they didn't have any better plans. The seabed rapidly rose, forcing you to swim even shallower. After a couple of minutes, your head breached the surface, and you took a big gasp of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay I</i><i> can breath in the air too. Good. I was worried that the transformation would confine me to the ocean, even though pop culture has air breathing mermaids</i> you thought. Relieved, you scanned the area, and saw a beach that appeared to be completely deserted. Smiling, you signalled the others, and quickly Tim and Harry also breached the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I can breath\" Harry said as he/she took a quick breath. \"So what's the plan? Beach ourselves and hope that we turn back as we dry out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep\" Tim answered for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I'll start crawling\" you said. As you crawled, you saw that the beach wasn't quite deserted. A little girl, maybe around six years old was sitting on the sand. She looked very much out of place, as her tights, maryjanes and dress were not suitable beach clothes. The instant Harry saw her, s/he started berating you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, you idiot! We can't surface with someone watching us!\" Harry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I KNOW that, <i>Ariel</i>\" you said, mainly because of your friend's red hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look nothing like that! These scales that we're <i>both</i> wearing look like a tube topTim has the seashell bra\" Harry snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just shut up. What would some cootie brain do anyway?

I thought that ickbrain would be squealing, not throwing rocks at me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah..... I thought so too\" Harry said, as the girl picked up another rock and aimed.

You were pleased to see that you had legs again instead of that golden fishtail, so you initially overlooked the fact your legs were hairless, or that your nails were painted candy pink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you muttered, as you stared at your own legs. Your eyes went wide as you realized that they were hairless, and a lot thinner than normal. Your attention shifted upwards, and you found that you were clothed. The problem was that your clothes were those of a cheerleader. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god\" you muttered as you saw that your cheer top was pushed out by a pair of sizable breasts. Instantly you blushed, wondering how on earth you managed to miss that! You should had spotted something lit that the instant you changed back. Slowly, you reached for your head and felt that your hair was in a high ponytail. Relief that you were human again turned to horror as you saw that you were a teenage cheerleader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you turned to both Harry and Tim. They were similarly dazed and were just beginning to realize their own transformations. Harry was also a teen girl, but fortunately for her, she only had a red tank top and cargo shorts. Tim got the worst of it; she was in a very puffy, pink princess gown.  Fortunately, Greg intervened before Tim could say 'ew' and expose your identities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I know you!

Angrily, you walked over to the transformed bully, and lifted him by his shirt. While you had lost most of your strength, your anger and the fact Greg was much smaller and lighter made it possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm totally not Mel.

Nor did you like the idea of having more food as you didn't know what it would do. However, both Tim and Harry made the decision for you, as they tried to follow the new girl. Figuring it was safer to stick together, you followed. After five minutes, you found that Greg was in a standing in a small clearing. To the side was a small cave, and to the front there were about half a dozen fruit trees. The aroma coming from the fruit smelt incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you I'd found some food that was away from those waste of spaces\" Greg said in a proud voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch it.

No way you wanted to wear it. <br>\r\n\"Since you're all mythical creatures, you should all have magic. In any case, both you and 'Tammy' have powers of your own and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't call me Tammy\" Tim pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't interrupt me\" Elvira countered. \"Anyway, it should force the mermaid magic out of your system, leaving you an ordinary girl. Unfortunately, because of your magic, skirts are likely to become a permanent part of your wardrobe. The final option is to turn you into boys right now. Before you interrupt, there is a considerable risk of you being boys that turn into mermaids when wet. The boy part may be resistant to magic, but not the mer part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You're not going to be as you put it, a 'pet', and being a girl isn't as bad as you think\" Elvira said, clearly exasperated. \"Still, I have explained everything to you, and it is your choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your right. I bet you'd love for me to don that uniform\" you said, distastefully eying the girls' school uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I would.

I'm not going to let you trick me into bras and skirts. Change me back right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. I will, but don't blame me for any unpleasant side effects. One other thing I should mention. This might be painful\" Elvira warned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was; lightning shot out of Elvira's hands, painfully striking you. As you roared in pain, you could see your feminine features melting away, and more importantly, you could feel that your body was returning to normal. The only bad thing was that you was still wearing girl's clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh. Did it have to be so painful? It felt like you were trying to electrocute me to death\" you yelled, as you stared at the still female Harry and Tim.

She stammered, \"You <i>want</i> me to change him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but if you succeed, I will of course, deny all knowledge of this, and that officially, you'd done this on your own initiative.

Was it a time delay spell?\" you growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. You're supposed to be sprouting tits right now.

She should have been completely female ten times over\" Samantha snapped. Both Tim and Harry remained silent, not wanting to be used as guinea pigs themselves, but Tim had a slight smirk over her face. The annoying one she used when she was enjoying herself. Elvira remained passive. After a few seconds, she responded to Samantha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Forester. John said before you came in that I could survive anything that old hag could throw at me\" Elvira lied. Samantha's response was instant; her eyes narrowed, and body stiffened. You could tell Elvira had hit Samantha's berserk button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He called me what? NOBODY calls me a hag\" Samantha roared, as she fired another spell at you. You could tell it was far more powerful, but it was just as ineffective. Her next one worked, though as you could feel yourself being pulled towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what Elvira has done to you, you prissy little princess, but it ends here. Become your sister's idol\" Samantha snapped, as she produced a Cinderella costume, which she roughly dressed you in. You remained unimpressed, especially as you felt nothing. At close range, you could tell that Samantha was strangely tired looking. Like if you gave her one push, she was fall asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is she trying to do to me?\" you spat out, as you tried to undo the zipper with your gloved hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess test, John.  Honorary title for a future head witch. Be glad she didn't choose to encase you in a bridal gown, though I suspect that would be just as ineffective\" Elvira said, though you felt angry and cheated. It wasn't a real answer, and you felt she had sold you out to Samantha. The said witch was now gasping, but still had enough energy for a last insult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn you Elvira. You did something to him...\" Samantha said weakly. Just before collapse, she spotted a glass of water on Elvira's table, and flung it's contents at you. It worried you more than any of Samantha's spells, because you instantly felt a tingling feeling. Twenty seconds later, you collapsed onto the floor, staring in horrified shock at your fish tail and scale covered breasts.</span></div></div>",

You're still a mermaid, and you're going to always be one...\" Elvira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't interrupt. All I did was change your human form from female to male. Your human form seems to be outright immune to magic, but I need to test whether this true for your tr... err mermaid form\" Elvira said. You started to protest, but Elvira quickly summoned a fireball which rapidly dried you off. Within seconds, yo were back to normal. Except for the princess dress that Samantha had forced onto you. Upon seeing it, you gave the still unconscious Samantha a slight kick in the leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was uncalled for, John\" Elvira scolded. \"Still, I'm pleased the mixing of magic hasn't made it any harder for you to revert, left you in mer form altogether, or turned you into a girl after transforming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I... Damn it grandma\" you snapped, as she summoned and tipped another bucket of water over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but I have to test you\" Elvira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out your mermaid form was far more susceptible to magic than your 'normal' form. As bad,, it seemed you could use magic too. After dozens of tests, Elvira was finally satisfied. You weren't; she had forced you into a puffy ballgown, and forced you to half walk, half float on your fins. You couldn't see the point of it, and angrily demanded an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm thinking of every possible situation. Remember who your twin is? Melanie will  dress you up the moment she discovers your condition\" Elvira chided. \"Still, there is no point keeping you here any longer. Still what about you two?\" Elvira said, turning her attention back onto Harry and Tim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I will go home and wait this out. You've got your answers from John\" Harry said. She did not like the idea of what Elvira had inflicted onto you happening to herself. Especially since it was ultimately ineffective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have, but you will be going home as a girl. You'd also still be a mermaid. Still, the magic might wear off. It could be days. It could be decades. I just don't know. What about yourself?\" Elvira said to Tim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim had been eager to be changed back, but after seeing what happened to you, she was reduced to being terrified little girl. \"I don't wanna be some stupid icky mermaid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't help it. Sorry\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanna go home\" Tim wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I'll take you three home\" Elvira said. You felt a slight weird sensation that you now knew was due to teleportation, and found yourself in your kitchen. The first thing you saw, once your vison had cleared was Megan. She didn't look shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where have you been? You've dropped off the planet for the last two days!\" Megan ranted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long story\" you said wearily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at both Harry and Tim, and for a moment, you thought you could see a hint of jealousy towards Harry.

She was right in the sense you did have magic powers thanks to your transformation into a mythic creature, but you liked that remainder as much as Harry loved her new name. Yu knew you could not use your powers either, as it would result in too many questions. She still had an annoyed, slightly angry look on her face when Megan approached. She looked at you warily, as if she was still hesitant to go near your family. Something, which annoyed you more than Mel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did he say?\" Megan demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"How to teach Melanie a lesson. We've got an idea that if Mel thinks magic will turn her ugly, it means she won't use it\" Harry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan giggled slightly, but quickly turned serious. \"What if there is another accident?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused, confused for a few seconds before remembering she was told the reason why Harry was now called Ariel by nearly everyone else was due to a mishap. You gave a rueful sigh, which was not at all faked, before you said, \"If A or I decide to do something rash, least we'll know there's consequences.\"</span></div></div>",

While you thought it was unfair, you knew you had to leave Megan to deal with magic at her own pace. However, she could not avoid Mel forever as they had gym together, just before lunch. Ironically the cause of friction between them; Harry, now Ariel, forced them to work together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happened?\" you asked Harry as she sat down to lunch. It was just you and your transformed friend; neither Megan or Mel were in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry winced slightly. \"I thought it was going to be a disaster, John. Your sister dragged me into the locker room when I kind of forgot... what had happened. Megan was already inside and everyone could see there was something wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happened?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The awkwardness of  the apparent catfight between two friends was overlooked when I made a complete ass of myself. I should had demanded more time to get used this female body. You know...  things like getting dressed. Also I may have stared at some of the girls a little too much...\" Harry said, shaking her head. \"They put aside their arguments and protected me. Or at least tried to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can imagine. I've got sisters\" you muttered. Everyone knew Harry as a guy liked Mel; the last thing they needed was for the rumors that 'Ariel' liked Mel.

For the school, that sounded far more realistic than the whole Mel the witch has scared her best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing like living it.... Great\" Harry growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you demanded, but you quickly saw the reason of Harry's disgust. A fifteen year old girl was walking over towards you. She was somewhat attractive; with auburn, chin length hair and a slim body, but you knew she had an icy personality, which was mainly directed towards guys. \"What do you want, Cassie?\" you said, hiding your distaste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie Bane gave you an unfamiliar, disarming smile. Normally, it was a scowl. \"I know about your problem, John, and I want to fix you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart sank.

While it was good that Cassie didn't know your main secret, the fact she cold perceive Ariel was bad, and that this cold, misandrist witch seeming had the hots for you was worse.

I only want this cutie\" Cassie said, as she fired a short spell at you from point blank range. It was so short, only you and Harry had the chance to see it, and while you missed the spell you felt it's impact.

And I'm.... I'm finding guys to be cute, even though my mind is screaming. I'm assuming it would be the same for you if you were changed.

Her sweet persona vanished and turning to Harry for a final word, Cassie said, \"Hope you like being a girl and having such a feminine name, Ariel, cuse you're going to have it for a very long time. Here's a gift to remind you. Harry/Ariel frowned at the (completely non magical) bikini that Cassie had tossed to her as she walked of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext on the list was Megan.

While your exterior was impervious to anything she could do to you, who knows what would have if she did anything to your interior, which was one thing that Elvira did not test. Plus the whole mermaid thing greatly complicated things.... With a sigh, you started walking towards your aunt's house, as you needed outside perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour aunt looked slightly surprised to see you when she opened her door. \"Hello John. I wasn't expecting to see you so soon. Tiff is upstairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at your aunt, slightly puzzled. Elvira had renamed Tim, 'Brittany', much to her delight, so you wondered why. Seeing your confusion, Catherine gave a slight wicked grin. \"Parental override. I preferred Tiffany, as it was closer to her boy name. I would have allowed Tiffany to pick her own name, but..... she was uncooperative.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you expect?\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine shrugged. \"She is up in her room, pouting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Brooke?\" you enquired, wondering about her other cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In her room. I had to separate them\" Catherine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great\" you muttered sarcastically. \"Do you know everything about what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mostly. Don't get her wet in public. I suppose its the same with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" you said, with a sigh. Deciding not to tell her about your own problems, you headed to Tim's room and opened her room. Tim was lying on her bed, still dressed in her school uniform and looking very much like Hannah. However, the similarities ended with appearance. Tim wasn't happy with her new pink room, and was openly glaring as she saw it was you that opened the door. Her death glare melted when you said, \"Tim?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for not using that stupid name mommy has used. Your the first not to use it\" Tim said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised you're still dressed in that\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else can I wear?\" Tim wailed as she walked over and flung open her wardrobe. Inside it had several dresses, a ballet outfit and strangely, a onepiece swimsuit. Naturally all in pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the onepiece? We both can't go swimming....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy has installed a pool in the basement. She said it would be good for me. That isn't the worst. School's a nightmare.

Tim ignored your comment, so you said, \"We both have unwanted attention. Anything good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found out what happened to Greg\" Tim said, as a slight smile formed on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. What?\" you wondered.</span></div></div>",

Two different pairs of shoes were thrown carelessly on the floor, along with what you assumed were the matching outfits. A pair of tights were dangling over a dollhouse, which made you laugh. Undoubtedly Tiffany the pretty slob found a more constructive use for her girl's toys. To your surprise, she pulled them off, and reached inside the doll's house and picked up a small doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised you're actually picking that thing up\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look harder, John\" Tim gushed.

Mel isn't the most magically stable\" Hayley said. \"Would have been bad news for you if you hadn't had that resistance. Don't know how you've got it, but you seem to be able to shrug off anything that Mel can throw at you. It doesn't mean much, but even if you didn't have magical resistance, Mel would be disappointed. We both know how vain she is, and lets just say that you would be prettier than her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced; your mermaid transformation told you that your feminine form would be quite busty, and you wondered if that was a reason Cassie was determined to make you into her eye candy. \"Mel isn't the only one to try something against me\" you said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Has Tim discovered her powers?\" Hayley asked, somewhat surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. It was that Cassie Bane. She had as much luck as Mel\" you said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God. You're in so much trouble, bro. I think you know it, but that family isn't too nice...\" Hayley said. \"I'm glad you're immune else that sort of thing could start a full on war between them and us. How did you get it, anyway? I doubt it's a natural talent.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While you didn't want to tell her the full truth and potentially expose your secret, as well as Harry's and Tim's, you felt you owed Hayley something. Besides, you hated the fact she had kept her own secret from you, which was only exposed by her meeting 'Ariel'. Instantly, Hayley's face turned to shock. Like any secret language, she knew the hidden meaning of your words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, John! What have you gotten yourself into?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something so unpleasant that grandma decided to personally respond to\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Hayley asked, wanting more information. \"You got girlified, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused before giving your answer. \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come you're still a guy, when both Ariel and Tiffany are girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry and Tim\" you corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, trust me, that mindset isn't healthy. Its typical of someone that is under threat of 'her' own transformation, and I have seen it. If you're doomed to be my sister, I promise I'll make you rock\" Hayley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Not that. I got an experimental treatment which was so painful, even... Tiffany preferred to be female\" you said, throwing a bit of truth into things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see why 'nothing happened'. I won't tell Mel, bro, that you're still under threat. Better she thinks that she can't have her twin sister\" Hayley said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is Mel?\" you wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ariel's house, giving her some tips\" Hayley said.</span></div></div>",

Tim watched you, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you do that?\" Raising an eyebrow, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call it an early warning system.\" Calmly, you replied. \"The chest will hit the sill before there is enough room for anything to slip out.\" You gave Tim a rueful grin. \"Hopefully that will wake you up and give you some time to run for your manhood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha. Ha.\" Humorlessly, Tim said. \"You two are being paranoid. Mom told me I had to stay away from magic. Why would we be put somewhere with magical stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not taking any chances.\" Frowning, you said. \"Mom and Elvira are not telling me the entire truth when it comes to me, I can feel it.\" You sighed. \"I can only assume the same is for you two as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying, john?\" Unnerved, Harry asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a bad feeling about all of this.\" Serious, you said. \"I suggest we sleep lightly tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then began to carefully search the other two bedrooms. Harry and Tim watch you, uncertain what to think of your behavior.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
