At first, she had been a woman dedicated to her job, a woman driven to train and keep healthy all those who came to her side, seeking help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as the Gym grew, and she found herself in the need of doing management more than training, her drive soon ceased to be as strong as before. Naturally, she had employees who were driven just as she had been, but she felt herself heartbroken when she realized she hadn\u2019t anymore those same motivations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, one day, she saw this plump young woman entering her gym. Instead of the common clients who usually came in there to grow buff and strong, this woman seemed driven to grow as thin and fit as possible. Jessie found herself fascinated by this girl, so much so that often she found herself training beside her, under the disguise of being a new client and not the owner of the place. Her employees helped keeping the ruse, they had noticed the lack of motivation from their boss and, seeing as she seemed to be gaining back her old driven mind was a boost for their confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few months of training together, Jessica had learned quite a bit about the girl with which she was training. They had soon grown closer, under many aspects thinking alike, and so a friendship started although, Jessie hadn\u2019t revealed herself yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan was a plump young woman, she had just abandoned her studies at her college, deciding by herself that her dream of becoming a teacher was just that\u2026a dream. Returning to her home stead of Whitesands she found a small job as secretary in one of the local companies and she maintained herself there but, sitting down all day long had started to have a negative effect on her waist. The freshman fifteen, which she had been found herself under, began to grow becoming soon the freshman thirty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo slow down or, maybe, even change the trend she joined the local gym and began doing some light exercises all by herself. Soon enough though, as weeks passed by, she often found herself training near a girl which she could only describe as an Amazonian goddess. The girl seemed to be an expert on the fitness side of things, and, under her tutelage, Susie began to grow healthier and toned than she ever was. As months passed away, the two of them began to be close friends and, although, her friend was a tad intimidating at times, Susie knew she could trust her with her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time passed their friendship grew as well, until Jessie couldn\u2019t hold her secret in anymore. She had to tell the truth to Susan, especially since she considered her one of her closest friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne evening, as the gym was pretty empty, and only the two of them were there, Susie came out of the shower stall, clean as a whistle and with her wet hair still enclosed in some towels. As she entered the locker room, she saw her friend Jess, sitting on a bench, looking rather down and sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJess? Everything alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Amazonian trainer sighed once more, before turning a sad smile toward the girl which she had befriended so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey Susie\u2026It\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s alright. Everything is\u2026who am I kidding? Look, can you\u2026could you sit down here for a minute, will ya?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan, increasingly getting worried for her friend, quickly sat beside her, caressing her shoulder with a hand as she waited for her friend to tell her what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, Susie\u2026All this time, all these months\u2026I\u2019ve been a terrible friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you saying? Now, Jess don\u2019t say anything like that. You know it\u2019s not true.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is. Look, I\u2019ve been lying to you all this time and I can\u2019t keep the ruse up anymore. I just can\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jessie said that she rose from the bleachers and stood against the locker, both hands against it as her head hung down in shame. Susan was getting worried, what could have happened to let her usually strong and fiery friend to feel this ashamed. Still, she silently waited for her friend to open herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie, stood silent for a moment and then, breathing deeply, she turned toward her friend getting everything out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSusie, have you ever wondered why we were able to stay so late here in the gym? Haven\u2019t you ever noticed that nobody seemed to be interested in the two of us, not even the trainers? Didn\u2019t\u2019 seem strange to you that I haven\u2019t once used my card to come and go from the Gym?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth, Susie, is that I lied to you. My name\u2019s not Jess Burgess. I\u2019m Jessica Horowitz. I\u2019m the owner of this gym\u2026and\u2026in all this time\u2026all I did was lie to you. I was feeling lonely, training didn\u2019t seem to be that much invigorating for me, anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I saw you coming in, the way you tried your best, the attitude with which you passed each day here to try and train yourself from scratch\u2026That got me all fired up. But I was afraid. I couldn\u2019t come to you, revealing myself to be the owner, and expect you to treat me as a normal training buddy. So, I lied. And I kept my real identity secret to you for all this time\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut\u2026I can\u2019t\u2026I can\u2019t keep holding this within me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n I\u2026I\u2019ll leave you alone now\u2026I\u2026I know I shouldn\u2019t have lied to you but\u2026it doesn\u2019t matter anymore\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she finished speaking, seeing that Susie was still staring at her in shock, Jessie turned around and began to slump away, but as soon as she had turned her back on Susan, the same stood from the bench and rushed forward, hugging Jessie from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you really think you lied to me? For all this time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, Jess, I\u2019ve always known you were the owner. Well, maybe not the first time we met, but after then, I saw your picture hung up on the reception wall. I may not be the smartest gal around but, I\u2019m not that dizzy yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd why would you even try to lie to me? Do you really think that I would care for something like that? <br>\r\nCome on, you know me better than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Partner, why don\u2019t we go out tonight. Let\u2019s close this issue with some beers. Nothing better than cheap alcohol to close this kind of situations\u2026what do you\u2026*oof*\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Susan was finishing her speech, Jessie closed on her and hugged her with all her might, as the other girl simply shushed her and soothed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince then the two made of it an habit to have one night a week of meeting up in pubs and wasting themselves away on alcohol. In a few months, though, as their friendship grew closer, something happened that would mark a turning change in their lives. It was their cheat day and they had passed the whole evening wasting themselves until they both reached a point where they simply couldn\u2019t stand anymore. In their drunken state, Susan joined Jessie in her flat, and they passed the night there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, the two of them shared the same bed and as the night became morning, they soon realized that they didn\u2019t simply sleep together, but did so much more. The more shocked of the two was Jessie, she couldn\u2019t believe that she had done it again. She couldn\u2019t remember much but, she thought of having forced herself on her friend and this, once more, brought her down. But when morning came, and Susie rose from the bed, joining her in the kitchen, Jessie didn\u2019t know what to expect from the girl standing behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That was the second big change in their life. Jessie and Susie weren\u2019t anymore only partners in the Gym, now they were also lovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs months passed, their relationship grew more and more official, until they decided to finally start living together and, since it was much roomier and not rented, but owned, Susie moved in with Jessie. Soon their life together started to become a routine, during the day Jessie would stay at home, or at the Gym, cleaning the house or keeping an eye on things at the gym, even though it wasn\u2019t really necessary since the place run almost by itself thanks to her employees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie spent her days into her office cubicle, working at her secretarial desk, until late afternoon, then she would meet with her girlfriend and together they trained in the gym, returning both to their home where they spent their residual energies on each other pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as time passed, another change began to approach itself in their lives, something that had the potential to turn everything around for both of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, as Susie just got back from office, Jessie noticed that her lover was looking rather plumper than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she seemed perturbed by that, and already was thinking on how she could approach Susie about that but, as the day passed and they entwined together in bed for the night, Jessie realized something about her she had never imagined. Their night together was astonishing for both of them, Susie couldn\u2019t stop herself from smiling, all the following day, thinking back to the passion that Jessie had shown to her all night long. While Jessie found herself rather uncomfortable in knowing that she had loved that squishy, softer, feeling of Susie\u2019s plumpness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Amazonian girl began, in the following weeks, to widely fantasize about her Susie but at bigger sizes. Finding herself deeply aroused each and every time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how could she tell her about this desire within her? How could she even dare to ask her lover to let herself go, when all she wanted was to get as fit and ripped as she herself was?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next six months their relationship grew stronger than ever, but Jessie still kept that secret hidden deeply within herself. Taking any opportunity, she was alone to fantasize about a fatter Susan, imagining any scenario in which her lover could grow fatter and fatter, growing so big she wouldn\u2019t be able to move without assistance. Jessica was truly getting mesmerized by these dreams and yet, she had to keep them only as fantasies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil one fateful day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat morning, Susie had already gone to work, they had a brief talk together and Jess knew she had an occasion which wasn\u2019t going to re-present itself again any sooner. That morning Susie had asked Jessie\u2019s help in her diet. Susan had finally noticed that, although they were training together almost every day, she still had managed somehow to put on a couple of pounds. Nothing really visible but, as she dreamt of Jessie\u2019s figure on herself, she asked her assistance on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll morning Jessie debated with herself on what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could help her girlfriend shed those few pounds, but then her dreams, her fantasies would never become reality. She still lover her Susie but, she felt that she could love her so much more if only\u2026there was much more Susie to love. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, she could help her or\u2026she could \u2018help\u2019 her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her knowledge and the trust that Susan had in her it couldn\u2019t be too hard to have her lover to gain a few more pounds and so, have her become much more similar to what she dreamed upon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she debated within herself, she finally seemed to have reached a decision...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now that her course of action was decided she felt way calmer and more relaxed. Still, she couldn\u2019t simply enact her dreams right at that moment. She needed to have Susie addicted to it, or not realizing she was gaining weight. In order to achieve this, she planned on the long haul. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a starter she had to change her lover habits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo do so, she began preparing herself. Every day they started their day with a normal looking breakfast, made up of mostly healthy food. This, for Susie had to change. But it wasn\u2019t to be an immediate change, instead she planned for a gradual increase of the quantities, while keeping the same, as it was possible, calorie count. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that day, Susan noticed right away that there were a few changes in their schedule, her meals seemed to take more time than usual, although the calorie count remained unchanged. Her lover seemed way more passionate than ever, which was undeniably a plus, but still, she felt as if something had changed within their lives together. Still, unable to point out what the change was, Susie soon forgot about it and rolled with it. She completely trusted her fianc\u00e9e, knowing full well how expert she was on these matters.<br>\r\nFor the most of six months Jessi had steadily inflated the quantities of food at any meal they shared together, making sure that Susie got used to the portions and started to see them as the new normalcy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this Milestone was reached, Jess began to slightly increase the calorie count of all of her lover meals, slowly raising the level a months passed, all the while pushing her as they usually did in the gym, this way Susie was growing used to the bigger portions of heavy caloric meals, but no real poundage was being gained as they still performed training each and every day. This trend continued for almost one year and a half in total. At the end of that period, Jess knew that her Susie was ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs morning came, Jess woke up early, leaving the sweet embrace of her still sleeping lover, as she went to the kitchen to prepare Susan breakfast. As she cooked and prepared, she barely could keep her excitement in check. As she began to fill the table with a hearty breakfast only for Susie, she checked, and double checked everything.  In the past months she had made sure that Susie was able to withstand a large breakfast but, this morning, she was giving her a large, and caloric, breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Susan entered the small kitchen, she smelled something delicious and looked in surprise at the spread that was on the table. Still she quickly greeted her lover with a peck on the cheek and sat, preparing herself to eat, before turning an inquisitive gaze toward her lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJess?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah, babe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready Jessie was sweating bullets, she began to worry to have been found out, that Susie was aware of her plan and wasn\u2019t going to allow it, that she was going to break up with her, that she\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo tofu, this morning? Thank god! I honestly hate that stuff\u2026Don\u2019t know how you can stand it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Susie said that she began to eat her breakfast, using her cutlery to bring morsel after morsel within her lips, fully enjoying how tasty everything was. She didn\u2019t seem to worry about her meal, but that was simply since she wasn\u2019t really aware of what she was consuming. She saw the eggs and the turkey bacon, she saw the white rice and the sausages, she then noticed the shakes and the bowl of cereals but, as she had got used to larger meals she simply thought it was Jess cooking abilities to have increased, not that what she was eating was fried eggs with turkey bacon, or fried rice with fried sausages. Or that her normal energy shake had been replaced with a most simpler gainer shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as Susie had gotten used to these portions, she quickly cleaned all plates of food, without worrying about a thing, after all, she always ate that much at breakfast. As Susie stood from the table, Jess could see that her belly already had bloated up quite a bit, yet, she knew that one meal alone wasn\u2019t going to change much. Still, it was a start and, when Susan went to work, Jess began to move forward with her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, she restocked the house, she made sure of purchasing all kinds of high calories snacks, while quickly changing the container with similar products with less calories, or by modifying the labels on it, making them appear to have less calories. Then she began to stock on Susan clothes, making sure to get the same models but in larger sizes, while also keeping them with the small size tag. For a start she decided to change only the breakfast food, taking it slow, making sure that Susie would get used to it before changing anything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more months, as Susan got home for her lunch break, she noticed that Jess had prepared quite a spread for her but, as always, she wasn\u2019t particularly concerned. Apart from the fact that everything seemed tastier, she didn\u2019t notice a anything else. <br>\r\nThat particular day, for example, Jess presented before her quite a large lunch, yet she dug in without a worry, complimenting heavily her girlfriend for her culinary skills. She did briefly notice that her middle seemed to be more bloated than before but, she didn\u2019t think too much on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah, Jessie! You\u2019re really getting good at this. The ravioli was perfect! And the ribs\u2026oh god, the ribs\u2026it really seemed to be the real deal and not the tasteless cardboard tofu we usually have\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, babe. I want only the best for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie kept her work up, upgrading all of Susan meals with richer and richer food, always getting her used to the new meal, before upgrading the next. Still, although she was eating more and more, Susan still was going every day at the gym with Jess, and so even though nine more months had passed, there wasn\u2019t any real change in Susan weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true that Susie wasn\u2019t losing any weight but, she also wasn\u2019t gaining any. Jessica, having finally brought her lover to enjoy full day massive meals, had to step up the game and the only way to do that was to resort to her major knowledge of the fitness world.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jess took the chance and began laying down her trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSusie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Jess? What\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you noticed that lately, you have seemed to have reached a plateau in regard to your weight? I mean, we weight ourselves each night right after training and yet, your weight isn\u2019t changing that much\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026I noticed. I actually wanted to ask you about that, because I don\u2019t get it what\u2019s going on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I did a bit of research and I probably figured out what the issue is. You see, each person has its own metabolism, this body mechanism is managing the way your body react to calorie consumption and storage. Usually, to speed up your own metabolism, one need to do plenty of exercises and eat less, forcing its own body to reduce the intake of energies and manage with what little it receives while keeping the body fit.<br>\r\nBut, in truth, it\u2019s not always like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. There are a few cases where the body will not speed up its own metabolism even though more exercise and diets are carried through. That\u2019s because, the body tries to keep its own balance by slowing down as a result of an increase of activities. That\u2019s seem to be your case.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jess, as she kept explaining, knew perfectly well that all this discussion was a boatload of crap, still, Susie had never been the smartest of girls, and in some regards she was a bit of a derp, and Jessie just loved her more for that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in this particular case, she was truly exploiting this weakness of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what I\u2019m getting at, Susan, is that we can try to slow down a bit on your exercises, while having you load up on energies and getting you hydrated. This way we can try to force your body to reach its ideal balance to get you out of this plateau, then we will steer it toward speeding up again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie nodded a few times. She hadn\u2019t really much knowledge in this field but, if Jessie said it, it had to be true. She was, after all, a known fitness guru so she surely knew what was going on and how to address this kind of situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, love. So, what should I do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, for starters, I would suggest you stop exercising every day, just do it one or two times a week. Then I\u2019ll arrange your meals so that you can manage to get a bit more of energy from each meal. Oh, and you can start having a few of these each day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that she brough forward a one-liter bottle of homemade shake, Susie grabbed it gingerly and tried to get a sip out of it. As soon as she tasted it, she couldn\u2019t refrain herself from moaning in pleasure. After a few, quite long, sips, she managed to let go of it and turned her tare toward her lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so good. But, are you sure? Wouldn\u2019t be better to just drink more water, throughout the day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNormally, that is true. In this case, there\u2019s a chance that water wouldn\u2019t remain long enough in your system to let your body metabolize it, and without any metabolization, your body would still try to overcompensate, despite your efforts. The shakes, instead, will remain longer within your system so\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, my body will have more time to make sure that is hydrated, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie smiled at that, even though she hadn\u2019t understood much, she was still happy of all the support Jess was giving her with this issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then! To the speeding up of my metabolism!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Susie had been integrated completely into the plan, Jessie knew that her dream girl was one step closer to becoming real. All she had to do now was to let her gain weight and, keep her in the dark about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot the easiest of tasks, but, doable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting from that day Susie meals grew larger and more filling, often Jess encouraged her to have seconds, and in rare occasions even thirds, and Susan did her best to comply. In truth, as days turned into weeks, and her meals kept growing longer and larger, Susie was starting to actually enjoy this kid of diet. It wasn\u2019t only her meals that were getting bigger, though. In those days that she usually went to the gym, Jess pushed Susie to simply stay at home and laze about, having quite a few snacks to help her in her \u2018loading up of energies\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, these snacks were only a few candy bars and, maybe a couple donuts but, as time carried on and Susan get used to those, she herself began to give herself more and more snacks, until she almost had some mini-meals, right before dinner time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, to hammer down Susie\u2019s growth, Jessie made sure that throughout the day, whether she was at home or in office, Susie kept drinking no less than nine or ten of those shakes, just to be sure she kept herself hydrated. Moreover, even though once a week they went together to the gym, Jessie made sure that Susie would pass most of her time sitting down on a bench, slurping down shake after shake, having her do only a few basic exercises, and even those for just a handful of minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie, in truth, was enjoying all this a bit too much. She knew it was just a temporary thing and, for this exact reason she swore to herself that she would just enjoy it until it lasted. She couldn\u2019t imagine the consequences of her own free enjoyment of this different diet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jessie dreamed about the perfect Susie, she soon realized, that she wasn\u2019t dreaming anymore, she was just remembering how the last weekend had gone with Susie stuck in the apartment with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs memories flooded back, so did her arousal.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessie had just finished preparing everything for her growing lover, as the new diet had been issued, Susan had started to wake up later and later on the weekends, something that Jessica loved, since it gave her time to prepare all the food she wanted Susie to have at breakfast. Jessie was right about to call her girlfriend for breakfast when she heard the loud thumps coming from down the hallway, signaling the coming of her lover. A few minutes later a slightly sweaty and short breathed Susan appeared at the doorway, the girl was getting downright huge under the influx of those massively caloric meals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, she appeared with a slight double chin, which seemed to grow wobblier each passing day, her face well rounded up, with quite hefty cheeks. Her breasts also had grown massively, losing their perkiness but gaining already a couple of sizes, growing from a small B cup to the quite large D cup. But what took mostly the toll was her middle. Her belly had literally exploded with fat, already starting to divide itself in two hefty belly rolls, which did nothing to cover her expanding hips and ass cheeks. Poor Susie wasn\u2019t really understanding what was going on, her clothes still fit, but she just felt so large and heavy. Still, whenever food was around all her focus moved there, making her consider secondary anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she moved through the doorway, which Jessie noticed with glee seemed to be getting narrower each day, she waddled slowly to the table until she finally plopped her large form onto a couple of chairs expertly placed there by Jess. Finally seated, although short of breath, Susie looked with glee at the spread in front of her. Jess had made sure that there was plenty of everything, from pancakes smothered in syrup and butter to honey glazed bearclaws, from small mountains of bacon strips to fried chicken pieces. Then there were short cakes and pies, hamburgers and hotdogs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word Susie began to dig in, grabbing items from here and there, shoveling pieces of bacon and fired eggs in her mouth, adding to it bites out of cakes and pies. Jess could only look in guilty pleasure as she saw her once training buddy gorging through a literal mountain of sweets and breakfast junk food. The girl kept at it without a remorse, cleaning plate after plate until all remained on the table were empty plates and few crumbs. Susie then burped loudly as she massaged her bloated gut, as it pushed against the confines of her PJ\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, even though she had cleared everything from the table, Jess tried to push her a bit more. She moved forward, giving Susie a peck on her cheek, just as she brought forward a couple of pitchers of her own gain shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, Susie\u2026don\u2019t forget to keep yourself hydrated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Ourp*\u2026Oof\u2026I\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026 if I can\u2026Jessie\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, babe. Don\u2019t let our effort go to waste. You need to keep yourself hydrated\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she felt full, Susie grabbed the first pitcher of shake that Jessie offered and slowly brought it to her lips, starting to gulp down its content, feeling as it sloshed heavily into her already tight gut, still she managed to empty it out and, before she could think about it, she also took the second one swiftly emptying out too. As she groaned in pain, she lumped back against the chairs, right as Jessie began to slowly massage her overstuffed gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood job, Susie. You\u2019ll see\u2026 a few more days and you\u2019ll be ready\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, it was months since Jessie repeated that lie, yet Susie was too enthralled by her own growing gluttony to really mind about anything, except resting. Helping her stand up, Jessica quickly brought her to the couch in the living room, letting her stay there to rest and digest, watching TV and, leaving at her side quite a few bowls of snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go, Love. Just rest and recover\u2026and have a few snacks if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, even though had just finished a huge meal, even though felt her belly ready to pop, since food was nearby, she couldn\u2019t stop herself from having a go at it. Still, seated, as he r focus was on the television screen, her hand moved o its own accord and grabbed a handful of those bite sized chocolaty treats, bringing them into her mouth. Susan moaned in pain and in delight as she kept eating all morning long, stopping only when Jess called her out to let her know that lunch was ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan slowly stood up on her own, ignorant of how her own weight was trying to drag her down and assuming, instead, that she was simply lacking nutrients and energies as Jessie often reminded her. So, with effort she began the arduous task of waddling from the living room toward the kitchen, where she plodded once more at her seats, drooling at the sight and smell of the humongous meal that was awaiting her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie could barely restrain herself as she presented her the full doze course meal she had slaved around all morning, to her growing out girlfriend. As usual she presented int under the pretense that Susie lack of breath and strength, was simply meaning that she wasn\u2019t eating enough. But as Susie had grown used, and addicted, to this lifestyle, there was barely the need for her to keep repeating herself. Once more, the poor girl found herself almost forced to dig in, pushed onward by her gluttonous stomach, gleefully cleaning out dish upon dish, until she simply had no more strength to continue on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was at these moments that Jessie intervened, she quickly took position beside Susie and began feeding her, pushing forkful after forkful, spoonful after spoonful, in her ever-growing lover, until she literally couldn\u2019t eat a single bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jessie looked at her bloated girlfriend, she barely could contain herself, with each passing meal Susie was becoming more and more like she appeared in her dreams and yet, for Jessie, it still didn\u2019t seem to be enough. Helping her stand once more, Jess assisted her lover until they reached their bedroom, once there she would let her sleep for a while, and then she would wake her up for a quite fulfilling, for both girls, lovemaking session. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a second nap, Jessie was usually waking Susan up again at around the 5:00 PM, feeding her a mid afternoon snack, letting her then graze the residual afternoon in front of the television once more, until it was time for dinner. It was at this time that Jessica removed all her brakes and went full out on Susie\u2019s waistline. Piling more and more caloric food into her girlfriend body, feeding her to stuffing point and, then, pushing her to keep eating, to continue filling up. Generally, she would stop only when midnight passed, and would let her Susie sleep only after another fulfilling night of passion together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all these calories pushed on her, and with almost no exercise to rein it in, it was no wonder that Susie began quickly to grow larger and fatter. At first, nothing seemed to happen but, as more calories were pushed on her and no outage of consumption ever came, her body began to store this excess as fat tissue on her body. For quite a while Jess plan seemed to be working pretty well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie ate like a machine, almost gorging throughout the day and night, whether at home or in the office. Growing hungrier and lazier as days began to pass by, she seemed to be soon growing bored of even going to the gym, even to check her own weight, as they had started to do at first. And yet she didn\u2019t seem to realize anything about her growing body. Especially since her clothes were still fitting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t know that Jessie was swiftly replacing each dress she had with larger sizes as soon as she noticed that Susie had outgrown something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, on one day, as six months of this brand-new diet had passed, something suddenly threatened Jess plan to collapse in its own.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That morning seemed to be a morning like all others. It was Saturday, Susan had no office to go to and Jessica had already prepared another massive multi coursed meal under the pretense of being a simple breakfast. That morning, though, as Susie slowly arrived at the doorway, she looked completely wearied out. Still, at the notion of food, Susie tried valiantly to enter the kitchen, only to find herself jammed in the doorway.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her a few minutes to realize that, even though she was trying to move forward, she wasn\u2019t moving of an inch. Jessi immediately realized the risk she was facing. If she didn\u2019t find a way to distract Susie, she would have realized that she hadn\u2019t lost any weight, but only grown overly massive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly Jessie rushed to her side, while sticking a whole bar of butter in her girlfriend mouth, as she used a second one to try and get her out of the doorway. Susan did notice that something seemed wrong but, as she tried to voice her doubts, Jessica pushed something in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething deliciously filling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing only on the taste, Susie began to make quick work of the butter, just as Jessie managed to get her out of the doorway and into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026Jessie\u2026that was\u2026delicious\u2026what was it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026uhm\u2026It was some kind of \u2026err\u2026Health bars that I\u2019ve grabbed at the market the other day. Was it good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie nodded as she licked her lips in pleasure, while massaging her globular gut, still rumbling out in hunger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen, I\u2019ll try to get a few more next times I go. Now, sit down and enjoy your meal\u2026you truly need it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie once more nodded, making her now three chins wobble heavily but, just as she seated and as she grabbed her utensils, she turned toward her girlfriend, observing her for a minute, enjoying that toned body of hers, the definite six pack, wishing that soon she would have looked the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie was getting nervous as she saw that her fattening lover hadn\u2019t yet touched a hint of food and grew even more nervous when Susie told her: \u201cHave you been washing my PJ\u2019s in hot water? They have grown tighter since last time I used them\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica suddenly realized that she had done everything to perfection except one thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn\u2019t replaced Susan pajamas that week. No wonders she did find them tight. Under Jessica guidance Susie had grown from a slightly plump 143 pounds, to the almost 400 pounds behemoth that now sat in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right\u2026I wanted to let you know but, I forgot\u2026I\u2019m so sorry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie smiled throughout this as she replied with candor in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is\u2026 nothing to be\u2026 ashamed of, it may\u2026happen to \u2026any of us. <br>\r\nAfterall, you\u2019re taking\u2026 such a good care\u2026 of me, helping me\u2026 out with\u2026 this diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I truly\u2026 think\u2026 you\u2019re the most\u2026 amazing girl\u2026 I know, Jess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Susie said that she quickly began to delve deeply into her meal, quickly focusing herself only on the food in front of her. But that words had caused something to shift in Jessie\u2019s mind. All of a sudden Jessica realized for real what she had done to her lover. <br>\r\nTo the person she loved more than anything else in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie stood speechless as Susie words rang in her head, as flashes of Susan fattening up sprang in front of her eyes. Jessie suddenly found herself weak in her legs, almost falling on a chair and, again she was surprised by her girlfriend reaction.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the last few months, Susie had developed a single mindedness toward food. Whatever was happening around her, if she had food surrounding her, she would focus only on it. Even her clothes had ripped, or buttons had popped from her pants, if she was eating, she had simply ignored these events as if they had never happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as soon as Jessica almost fell on her chair, Susan stopped with her gorging right away. Quickly trying to assess if she was feeling ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJess!? Is everything alright? Are you feeling well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie had never expected that Susie could muster enough force of will to actually stop her gorging, but she seemingly had managed for her. This event sent even more anguish and shame in the wannabe feeder\u2019s hearth. As Jessie began to crumble within herself she saw right away as Susie began the arduous task of standing up on her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any exercise to build up muscles, with all the time spent lazing about on the couch, usually she wasn\u2019t able to manage it without external support. Yet, be that Jess seemed in pain, be that adrenaline was somewhat coursing through her vein, Susie managed to stand and began to waddle to her lover, until she hugged her with all of her, very little, strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJessie, come on. Tell me, what\u2019s going on? Do you need me to go and search for help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Jessica wasn\u2019t feeling so down, she would have laughed at the irony of this situation. Susan, the one who had been fattened up without her knowledge, was trying to support the amazingly fit and trained Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChocking back tears, Jessie forced herself to calm herself and recover, while hugging back her lover, squeezing her a bit to let her know that she was ok. Even though she wasn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m..I\u2019m okay, Susie\u2026I\u2026I need to confess you something though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie, exhaling a long breath had managed to sit more comfortably on a chair as she resumed grazing her food. She was still focused on Jessica but, as she had been used for the last months, she just couldn\u2019t stop eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2026\u201d Jessie was torn between personal desires and love for her Susan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom one side she wanted to keep things as they were, fattening her up till she reached immobility and beyond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut on the other side, Susan was the woman she loved, the woman she had opened up to for the first time and which had accepted her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what did she do to her? She betrayed her trust, she lied to her and destroyed her dream of becoming toned and fit like she was.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was just as the first time she had seen her, at that time she had only lied about her name. This time though she had lied to get her fat. To satisfy her own animalistic urges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>No\u2026</i>\u2019Jessie thought \u2018<i>\u2026I don\u2019t deserve her. And I cannot keep her in the dark about herself.

I\u2026I\u2019ve done terrible things to you\u2026So terrible that I can\u2019t\u2026I can\u2019t keep going like this. I have no excuses. No way of redemption out of what I\u2019ve done to you. I only beg of you to not hate me too fiercely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan knew that this moment was going to come. She had rehearsed it a few times within herself already and, although she had hoped to see it happen sooner, she still waited for Jessie to carry on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSusie I\u2026How can I\u2026? There is no...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan saw the pain that was wreaking the, wonderfully built, amazon apart. She knew that Jessie had realized what she had done, and that she was mentally tearing herself apart. Still, although all that had happened, Jessica was still the woman that she had fell in love with and seeing her in such pain was too much for Susan to bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou fattened me up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess stopped herself. At first she ignored that phrase, expecting a furious accusation, expecting a hateful remarks. But Susie instead had simply stated the fact with a common tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, actually, you fattened me up to massive proportions. But, yes. I knew it already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan slowly stood and waddled again toward her loved one, hugging her and keeping her close to her heart, slowly caressing the amazon hair with quiet gentle strokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you really think that I would simply believe to that crap you sprouted a while ago? I checked on internet and verified your information\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica remained speechless and yet she started crying since this was even worse in her mind. Her Susie had known what she was doing to her. And she, blindly had thought of being the one in control. But Susan voice took her out of her reveries, bringing her back to the present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter that, I tried to imagine why you were trying to get me to gain weight. And after a while I got it. As more weight piled on, I did notice that you were getting more and more passionate during our sessions together. And so, I realized that you were more physically attracted by a larger me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wondered why you hadn\u2019t told me any of this, why did you tried to keep it a secret. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, you had done the same when we met the first time. So, it simply was that you were feeling shame in asking for it. So I kept your game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I waited for the moment when you would have come out clear handed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, at around 250 pounds I wished you would just tell me but, at some point I simply let it go and enjoyed the flow. I knew that some day you would have told me the truth behind this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here we are now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica, still feeling her lover embrace around her, her soft, heavy hands on her head, stroking her hair, was unable to speak for several minutes, until she finally managed to choke back some words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026But why haven\u2019t you\u2026stopped me\u2026earlier? I\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m so sorry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJessie\u2026 You really need to be more confident in yourself and in your needs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI trust you. I know that you loved me, I had proof of it with every pound gained. I knew you weren\u2019t doing it for a need of controlling me. And I love you back, you silly. You\u2019re my beautiful amazon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA goddess down from heavens who loves me with all of her hearth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich, for some reason, is into fatties.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Susie chuckled a bit, but she still kept Jessica within her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow could I deny what you needed? What you wanted?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust, please, Jess\u2026don\u2019t think less of yourself. Don\u2019t feel ashamed\u2026You\u2019re a wonderful woman\u2026the only one who still hasn\u2019t realized it yet, is you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that Jessica couldn\u2019t hold back anymore. She hugged her lover back and cried all of her shame, all of her sadness away. As both girls were now feeling a bit more secure and calm, Susie let go of her beautiful amazon, slumping back once more on her two chairs, a teasing smile on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026woe me\u2026\u201d she said with a hint of teasing in her voice, as she stared deeply into Jessica\u2019s eyes. \u201cAll this commotion\u2026completely left me\u2026spent of energies\u2026I wonder...who will help\u2026little \u2018ol me to\u2026regain it with\u2026tons\u2026of food?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie, unable to stop herself almost choke back a laughter from coming out, as she turned toward her lover, bringing toward her a forkful of heavily buttered pasta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re ok with this, Susie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm-mmm\u2026I\u2019ve got you at my side, can just laze about all day on the Week\u2019s end\u2026and think to the stupefied faces of those around us as we will stroll into town? The perfect amazon and the fat tanker. It will be priceless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow...are you going to be my savior\u2026or not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie smiled widely as she brought the fork down, within her lover lips, smiling at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, aren\u2019t I your goddess? It is my duty to make sure that my servants are\u2026\u201d at this she grabbed a hefty belly roll, shaking it teasingly as she brought her lips closer to Susie\u2019s. \u201c\u2026Well fed and taken care of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished speaking the two shared a long, full kiss, and enjoyed the rest of the meal together, as they should have done since the beginning.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

By tearing up in front of her she had admitted weakness and now had to find a way to justify herself.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026you see\u2026I\u2026I lied. I thought it was going to be enough to just rest a bit and stop exercising but, apparently, it\u2019s not enough to slow your metabolism down. I\u2019m\u2026sorry, Susie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan gave her a strange look as she still kept grazing here and there on the food available near her, and yet she didn\u2019t say nothing for quite some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s all about it, Jess?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat question put chills in every inch of Jessie body. What could her Susan have meant by that? Suddenly she noticed that her lovingly growing out girl was eating way slower than usual. That small detail plus her current demeanor, made Jessie fear that Susie wasn\u2019t as subdued as she had thought she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe Susie had been eating in pleasure but, also, to see how far Jessie would bring her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was critical for Jessie to regain control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she wanted to have her Dream Susie to become a reality, she had to break her down first. But how could she do it? For a long moment they just stared at each other, Jessie sweating bullets as Susie, instead, was still slowly grazing on the food in her plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie realized she had no other choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have preferred to go slowly all the way but, if Susan was only pretending to be submissive, she had to force her once and for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026not exactly\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that Susan seemed to relax a little, letting a bit of her guard down, staring as her Amazonian girlfriend rose from the table and moved toward the sink, turning around on her. Jessie was now near the sink, her back toward Susan, as she hastily prepared one of the shake that Susie seemed to have loved so much. But as Jessie prepared it she couldn\u2019t stop herself from wondering if her girl had shamelessly lied to her for all that time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t matter to Jessie\u2019s mind that she first had been lying to her girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>So, did she truly like my cooking? Did she ever enjoy my meals? I did it for her and still, she dare to lie to me? <br>\r\nYou think you can just control me? Is that it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe truthfully believes she can play me around, having me slave around the kitchen all day long so that she can simply devour anything and then play the part of the wounded one?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNO. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, I won\u2019t let you do that.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a terrifying twist, Jessie\u2019s mind turned her against Susie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith both guilt and pleasure filling Jessie up, she turned once more on her girl, hiding within herself the hate she was feeling for the girl she had loved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHate for having been deceived, for having been led to think to be in control when in truth it wasn\u2019t like that at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even for a moment she seemed to remember that she had betrayed their trust first, all it mattered was to get back at Susie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI also\u2026well, I\u2019ve come up with a solution but\u2026I cannot guarantee it will work\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that she brought to her ballooning girl the new shake she had just prepared. It appeared to be exactly as all others Susan had already gotten used to in the last months, and yet, Jessie knew, it was so much more. Susan, although skeptical about this didn\u2019t see anything wrong in indulge a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue the last few months had been hell on her figure but Jessie had been so passionate to her that she couldn\u2019t exactly say that she hadn't let herself go willingly. Still, she had noticed that Jessie was trying to fatten her up, she just didn\u2019t know the reason behind it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan had actually hoped that her love would actually come out clean but, instead, she seemed to be oblivious to her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she loved Jessie with all of her heart, she would have loved to show her so by letting herself being fattened up even more, but only if her lover was ready to come out of her hiding. Yet, it didn\u2019t seem to be this the case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, Susie had already agreed with herself that she was going to pretend for a few more days, giving out a clean three months\u2019 timeframe to Jessie to come out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if that was't going to happen, she was going to affront the issue herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll changed as she swallowed down the shake offered her from Jessie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Susan gulped it down she should have noticed the manic glint in Jessie\u2019s eyes as she stare at her drinking away at the shake, or at how more delicious it tasted than usually. But Susan, as she tasted the shake began to focus only on the taste of it and on the burning hot sensation she was feeling in the depths of her bloated stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she cleaned out the shake, Susan doubled over in pain, feeling as if her own belly was trying to digest itself due to how hungry she felt. All other thoughts left her mind but the need to eat. A need so strong that she barely made it back to the table, sitting on her two chairs, as she began to mow down ferociously at the breakfast that Jessie had prepared for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amazon smiled in seeing her Susie single mindedness toward food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved behind her and grabbed her hefty sides, squishing the fat on her and playing with her love handles as Susie could do nothing but shovel food within her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Yes\u2026</i>\u2019 she thought with glee \u2018<i>Now you won\u2019t be able to think about much more than food and stuffing yourself. <br>\r\nI had wanted to avoid using such a potent appetite stimulant on yourself but you\u2026You just had to try and deceive me, didn\u2019t you?</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time began to pass, Jessie returned to the oven, cooking more and more, preparing meals worth of food that was going to be shoveled deep into Susie\u2019s gullet. The poor girl could do nothing more than eat and eat more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd every time she reached her fullest point, or the enhancer effect began to wane, so Jessie would just give more of it to her, forcing her to keep going, keep eating and growing. As the weekend began to pass, Jessie realized that she couldn\u2019t let her beloved fatty out of her view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie had to be kept on a tight leash of continuous feeding and stimulants, in order to let her become the Dream Susie she always had wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to do that all Jessie had to do was to pick up the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan could barely stop herself to breathe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was constantly feeling hungry, starving even, although she knew that she had been eating almost nonstop for the last two days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, the pain she felt was so strong that she didn\u2019t want to feel it again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t sure what was happening to her, one-minute Jessie seemed to become clean on her needs to have her fattened up and the next, she herself was so hungry she couldn\u2019t stop eating. She immediately thought that it may be Jessie\u2019s fault, but she refused to acknowledge that idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie loved her, she wouldn\u2019t do something so harmful to her, would she? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Monday morning rolled on, Susie was still unable to leave the kitchen, she was still feeling starved, as if she hadn't had nothing to eat on the previous week, and so she began once more to gorge on countless mounds of take away food that Jessie had ordered for her. Going from Chinese to Mexican, from McDonald to Burger King. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as Susie kept devouring everything in sight she suddenly aw something that confirmed her biggest fears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was busy eating away at her smorgasbord massive meal, she saw down the hallway Jessie standing and talking to the phone. For a moment she couldn\u2019t understand what was going on but, as her lover entered the kitchen closing the call, she realized that she had been right, but was too late to save herself from her fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jessie entered the kitchen, she saw Susie still busy on eating burgers and hot dogs, vats of Chinese noodles and quesadillas. Smiling she moved closer to her and began softly whispering in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Don\u2019t you worry, Love. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ve just called your office and they agreed on letting you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t need any more to go there, tiring yourself, while you can simply stay here and enjoy yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThink about it, you can now stay here, all day long, with me\u2026eating as much as you want, until you\u2019re so big you couldn\u2019t actually move\u2026even if you wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ll see, Susie\u2026I\u2019ll make it a reality\u2026just for You and Me.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan, although she couldn\u2019t\u2019 stop eating, started to cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true then, her lover, the woman that she loved so much had done willingly this to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment more, Susan cried about her partner, at how she had thought to be loved as a person and not as the object she was being turned into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Why, Jessie? Why are you doing this to me? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave you ever loved me at all? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat we shared\u2026 it was all a lie, to you?</i>\u2019<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As weeks flew by, Jessie kept preparing and upping the dosage of the appetite stimulants she was giving to her lover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result, Susan began to live in a state of perpetual hunger. No matter what she was doing or where she was, she had to eat more and more. Jessie provided her with all the food she could ever need and, due to this all of her thoughts started to gravitate around food. At the beginning she had felt really hurt by her lover trick, for having been turned into a fattening doll but, as hunger began to be her primary concern, she slowly forgot about that pain, until it was nothing else but a sketchy, shadowy figure in her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she needed was food. And Jessie gave her that, so how could the new Susan not love Jessie?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, no matter how much she ate, or for how long, the pain seemed to be with her all the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie was having the time of her life. The dream Susan to which she had worked so hard for was coming along pretty nicely. Her lover, thanks to a steady and continuous diet made of fattening food and appetite stimulants, could barely stay thirty seconds without eating something, afterwards she would simply cry out in pain. Jessie was loving this; she was totally in control. With her Susie perpetually at home, finally out of that office of hers, and under the constant deluge of meals she was giving her, she was ballooning out in front of her very own eyes. Day after day, she would increase the dosage, and she was going to keep doing it until her Susie couldn\u2019t literally stop herself from eating all the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as weeks flew by, several measures had to be implemented by Jessie to let Susie grow unhindered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst and foremost, she had to purchase two specially built pooper seaters, making so that her Susie could relief herself even as she ate in the middle of the kitchen, without stopping for the need to go into the bathroom. Then, as the girl began outgrowing everything around her, Jessie bought a contraption that, mounted on her special seat, would let her move around the ground floor of the house without the need to move a single muscle. Naturally, as she kept growing and outgrowing everything surrounding her, a special shower had to be purchased and installed, letting the growing massively obese girl to be cleaned in every nick and roll of her massive body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, for Jessie, it wasn\u2019t enough. She neede her Susie to reach the inhumanly size she had been in her wet dreams, and yet, no matter how much she ate or how hungry she was, her Susie seemed to slow down at some point. As if she was unable to keep going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few days, Jessie, wondered what was wrong. Why her constantly hungry, little, eating machine wasn\u2019t growing anymore as she did at first. It baffled her and, at first she thought that Susie may have been tricking her once more but, then she understood what the problem was. As she was seeing her lover stuffing her mouth ravenously, she noticed that she tired herself pretty fast and then, even if she whine d and whimpered, she simply stopped eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSusie-pie? What\u2019s wrong? Not hungry anymore?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s not that\u2026\u201d she replied crying in pain \u201cI\u2026I can\u2019t\u2026keep\u2026going...too...tired\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Jessie realized what the issue was. Her Susie wasn\u2019t lying anymore, she just hadn\u2019t the strength to eat on her own. Now, the deranged feeder knew that she couldn\u2019t feed her all the time, as much as the idea appealed to her, since if she wasn\u2019t cooking, her Susie wouldn\u2019t have nothing to be fed with. And yet, she had to find a solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short while later, Jessie realized that the solution was way easier than she thought. Swiftly she began preparations, and, within the span of a week, she had everything ready. It was early morning; Susie had just woken up and was already starting to wail from the hunger pain she was feeling when Jessie appeared in front of her holding a strange looking hose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSusie-Pie, you know what this is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No\u2026 Hungry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, dearie. No more hunger. Just gotta have this in your mouth. Open up, nice and wide\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the assistance of the feeding machine she had bought online, satisfying Susie became much easier and, since the poor girl had nothing to do but swallow, she immediately began to gain even more weight. Jessie watched lustfully to her Susie. She had become a real butterball; she was growing so fast and so big that she barely had time to purchase new models of her pooping seats. Yet, with all this constant eating Susan began to feel the counter effects of having a life going around food only.  Her thoughts slowed down to a crawl, since all she could think of, day and night, was food, all other thoughts vanished from her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, even her voice began to be more childish, as if she couldn\u2019t remember how to talk or how to hold a conversation. She began to act as if she was a small little child. Barely able to speak, she soon began to let herself go, relieving herself even as she was talking or eating. At first, she would stop herself and let herself go, but as time went on and food became more and more central in her life she even stopped doing that. She simply let herself go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie loved it. Here she was fully in control of the girl of her dreams, watching as she grew bigger and bigger, fatter and fatter, without nothing to stop her. And yet, she sadly realized that with her dream Susie focused only on food, she also wasn\u2019t interested in the least in enjoying each other company. A few times Jessie tried to pleasure her but, with the way she could let herself go at a moment\u2019s notice she understood that it was too much of a risk. So she started to use her as if Susie was a thing and not the woman she had fell in love with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Jessie found herself completely satisfied by this but, as months flew by and Susan kept growing more and more massive, while also becoming more and more childlike, Jessie realized there was a huge problem in her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started one evening, Susan had just been hooked off from the machine, feeling overfull for the first time in ages. Jessie moved closer and began saying sweet things to her, trying to entice her to join her in an exchange of allusions, as they did a long time ago, when Susie was just a scrawny 200lbs chubbette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her Susie didn\u2019t seem to understand, and the more explicit Jessie became, the more anger she started to feel, seeing as her Susie didn\u2019t seem to understand. Reached the peak of her anger, Jessie shut Susie\u2019s mouth by jamming the feeding hose in her lips once more, turning on the machine forcing her to keep eating and growing, as she went out of the room for a quick smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the stress levels were rising in the house, so Jessie had started smoke a few cigarettes each day. And yet, she couldn\u2019t understand why her lover wasn\u2019t interested in her. It was like Susie wasn\u2019t\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hit her like a train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had changed her Susie to become more and more like an eating machine. But, in doing so she had erased what she had fallen in love with her in the first place. Not her body but, her wits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she puffed from her cigarette, Jessie thought back to the banters and the jokes she had had with Susie before she had forced her to become what she had around nowadays. The old Susie, the Not Dream-Susie, hadn\u2019t been the fattest piggy she had around now but, she had been smart and provocative, she had often engaged her in deep conversation about the most foolish things. Plus, there had been the time they hared in private. Jessie had always enjoyed how dominant Susie seemed to become into the bedroom. While now instead she couldn\u2019t even get her to feel slightly aroused.<br>\r\nAll the Dream Susie wanted was to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasn\u2019t this what Jessie had wished for, so long ago? And if so, why she was now missing her old lover so much?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Jessie was to do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She immediately recalled that fateful morning of so many months before, when she had felt betrayed by Susan lack of submission to her. As that memory flashed, I front of her eyes, Jessie began to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCigarette falling from her grasp, the Amazonian girl simply crumpled on the balcony crying in shame and despair. She had loved her chubby little Susan so much, and yet, her frenzied mind had turned her into the almost immobile mound of jelly like flesh that she was today. Yes, she had wanted her Dream Susie to become a reality but she had never imagined that in doing so she would lose the woman she had loved so much. In her dreams, although Susan was bigger than a house, she was still the witty woman she had fallen in love with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, with her frenzied mind, she had killed that woman to have a massive lump fo a thing that was caring only in eating and eating more. Jessie, then, heard a slight wailing  coming from behind her and, suspecting that Susie-pie had finished her food, she slowly turned to go back and fill her up more but, the scene presented in front of her stabbed her heart with such force that she almost fell on the floor again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of her eyes, in fact she saw the almost immobile girl wailing against the closed window while, behind her, the feeding tube spilling the food concentrated sludge on the floor a if Susie had forgotten about it. As Jessie opened the window, she found herself enveloped by a sea of fat, as Susie-Pie hugged her with all of her strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...cry\u2026Jess. Susie-pie\u2026more\u2026hungry\u2026but\u2026no\u2026Jess\u2026cry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt those crude words, Jessie seemed to melt. For she understood what her Susie was trying to say, even though she was barely able to speak. For deep inside that lump of fat she had created her real Susan was still alive, if only barely. Again, it flashed in front of her eyes, how quickly Susan had moved her bulky body when, that morning, she had burst out crying. The same Susan that loved her with all her heart, the same that had willingly let herself be fattened up, was still in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Jessie decided to come clean and try to get her old lover back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>If My Susan is still in you, I\u2019ll get her out. I need you, Susan, in my life as you were once. <br>\r\nI want to fatten you up, I dream about your massive size but, if to get that I\u2019ve got to lose You\u2026I will not have it.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok, Susan\u2026I won\u2019t cry anymore. But now\u2026Now we\u2019ve got to work together, ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie-pie didn\u2019t understand a word of it. All her world was made of food, and yet, seeing her Goddess cry had awaken something inside of her, something that told her to forget about food and console her goddess. As unused to think as she was, she wasn\u2019t sure what had pushed her to forget about food but was happy that the Goddess wasn\u2019t crying anymore. With the simple mind she now had, she turned back to the only thing important in her world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore hungry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess, feeling some tears escaping her eyes, once more, hugged the massive girl as much as she could, whispering in her ear, as softly as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. Not anymore, Susan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgive me\u2026I\u2019ll do all I can to get you back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following months were grueling for both women. Susie-pie, addicted to eating as she was, found herself suddenly without the only thing she wanted. Plus, although her hunger pains began to lessen, she had grown so accustomed to eating that even though she wasn\u2019t getting anymore the stimulant, she still acted as if she was under it. From Jessie\u2019s side, it was doubly painful.<br>\r\nFrom one side she had to reduce the amount given to her lover, watching her and hearing her crying as if she was in the verge of death by starvation, and then, she had to fight every step of the way with the Susie-Pie personality she had created, as she tried to bring back her old lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it had taken less than one year to have Susie-pie and her massively obese body, it took way longer to try and get back her old Susan. Fighting every step of the way, forcing the massive girl to replace eating times with games and books had been the hardest thing Jessie had ever experienced and yet, her anger often chided her to let it all go, to return stuffing Susan while keeping Susie-pie in her stead but, for once, Jessie didn\u2019t back down. It didn\u2019t matter how hard it was going to be, or if it was possible at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this time, she wasn\u2019t going to let her anger to control her again. Unless proved completely impossible, she was willing to try anything to get her lover back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed on, with Susie-pie eating less and less, and being more and more active, things seemed to be changing within the house. With most of two years of harsh dieting under her belt Susie-pie began to vanish, replaced by a simple being that knew herself as Susan. As her mind was trained once more to think on its own, by playing games and reading comics and books, the girl began to feel more at ease with herself, as if her past three years had been only a strange dream. Yet, Jessie was still feeling guilty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, she had been managing to get her lover body back to a more acceptable weight, reducing her from the massive 700 lbs she had been at its peak as Susie-pie, to a now more comfortable 450 lbs of Susan. And yet, the Susan she was living with her still didn\u2019t seem to remember her more than a motherly figure that had took care of her in all that time. <br>\r\nIt was tearing her apart. Jessie was glad of having managed to get Susan back to a healthier mental status and yet, the fact that what had once been her lover failed to recognize her as such was tearing her up. Still, she didn\u2019t stop. She had made her mission of returning Susan to normality, as much as she could, before giving up. For, in her heart, she had given up the hope that her Susan would be back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie firmly believed that her Lover was gone for good. And if that was the case, one the woman could manage herself on her own, she was going to let her go and vanish from her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>I\u2019ve singlehandedly destroyed her. I cannot keep living with her body, knowing what I\u2019ve done to her.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After almost three years since Jessie had worked hard to try and have Susan back in her life, the woman that called herself Susan was almost back to her normality. She barely remembered what had happened in the last three years, and at that she trusted completely the other woman she was living with.<br>\r\nJessie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman had told her that she had had a bad accident, something that threatened her whole life. So, Jess had helped her get back in shape, although she never told Susan the reason for helping her so insistently. Still, Susan was feeling grateful toward this \u2018Roommate\u2019 of hers, although Jess did seem to be on the verge of crying every time, she mentioned that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Still, being now an independent woman, she wanted to ask Jess if was willing to help her some more, in a special project she had been thinking about in the last few days. But as the morning came and Susan left her bedroom to go to the kitchen, where usually she found Jess preparing their healthy breakfast, all she found was a not on the table.<br>\r\nPicking it up she began reading it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDear Susan,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m sorry for being so abrupt with this but I can\u2019t keep going like this. I\u2019ve been lying to myself in these last few months, but I cannot escape the harsh truth that is in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ve never told you how you ended up in that terrible accident you\u2019ve been involved into but, even if you won\u2019t believe me, I was the culprit of it all. Since then, I\u2019ve done all I could to help you get back and I\u2019m finally glad that you\u2019ve managed to get out of it on your own two feet and ready to challenge the world outside your home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, it\u2019s your home now. I\u2019ve already contacted the agency giving you the house and most of the money I have in my accounts. It the least I can do after what I\u2019ve caused you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, to the hardest part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI won\u2019t be living with you anymore. Now that you\u2019re able to live on your own, now that you don\u2019t need any more my support I can\u2019t keep staying with you. The guilt of what I\u2019ve made you go through is killing me and \u2026And I can\u2019t bear it anymore. I\u2026I don\u2019t want to hurt you again and, at the same time, staying with you without being with you is driving me mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemember this, it\u2019s not your fault. It never has been, and it never will. I just\u2026I just can\u2019t live as I\u2019ve done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLive your life, find someone who will truly love you and cherish that lucky guy for the rest of your life together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ll always be in my heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jessie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Susan red the letter she didn\u2019t know what to think, except that whatever had happened to her in the past had been perceived by her roommate as if it was her fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as she read once more the letter, Susan felt\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Susan read once again the letter, she felt growing strangely worried. Suddenly, as if lightheaded, she collapsed on a nearby chair as her mind began to unveil memories, she had unconsciously locked up deep within herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As in a flash she relived all her past three years since the fateful morning when Jessie, Her Jessie, had turned on her. Forcing to her to become a slave of her gluttony, trying to control every aspect of her life. She felt almost ill, when she relived the pain in seeing her Lover, the person she had loved the most betray her time and time again, first forcing her to having food as the most important thing in her life, than forcing her to quit her job and then, painfully, changing her into a complete different person from what she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she lived through the memories of \u2018Susie-pie\u2019, she almost felt herself fainting. There was no anger in her only the feeling of being sick for the monster she had fallen in love with. And as she saw herself growing bigger and fatter, almost inflating daily with the monstrous treatment that Jessie had subjected her to, Susan began to feel herself short of breath. Fear and terror paralyzing her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, she saw that evening when Jessie realized what she had done, and Susan felt pain in her heart for what her Lover had endured, trying to get her back, trying to save her from the deep abyss she had thrown her into. Susan remembered now the last two years, the pain that \u2018Susie-pie\u2019 felt as her Goddess seemingly tortured her, trying to save\u2026well, Her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan, the real Susie, began crying, wailing desperately releasing the pain, the anger, the suffering all the emotions that had been repressed by herself in the attempt to not go right out crazy from the madness of the entire situation. And as she lived through the flashing nightmare in front of her eyes, she began hating what had been her lover, but, as the most recent memories came through, she saw how guilty Jessie had felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd how hard she tried to hide what she still felt for her, while supporting her, helping her return to normality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lover, Jessie, had fucked her up badly but, she managed to also save her from that horrible fate she had almost condemned her to. And yet, as herself returned to her normalcy, she realized that Jessie had left her life to avoid being reminded of what horrible things she had done to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>My god\u2026It was all real. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe truly turned me into a freaking monster. And yet, she\u2019s also the one who saved me from that fate. She endured so much for me. All my pain, all my emotional distress, all of my feelings\u2026she endured them all to get me back\u2026 How could I hate her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut\u2026at the same time, can I really say that I love her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all she did to me, due to her fear of opening up\u2026Do I still love her?</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the morning passed away, Susan idly worked within the house, trying to get a grip on herself, to reach a decision but, as time passed, she realized that the decision was easier than she had suspected. For, throughout the day, she kept unconsciously trying to find Jessie appearing from somewhere, as if she was still there with her. Recollecting the wonderful time they had shared together, the times when Jess had been there for her\u2026and the times when she had been there for Jessie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan had been afraid to admit it with herself but, she loved Jessie so much that all that had happened didn\u2019t matter. She needed Jessie in her life, to have her nearby, to feel her powerful arms hugging her, to feel her passion when they shared their nights together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan couldn\u2019t deny she wanted Jessie there, with her, now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so reached her decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly dressing up, although difficult for a 400 and plus lbs woman, she grabbed her keys and went out, whipping out her phone trying to call her. But the other woman never picked up the phone. At first Susan began to run blindly around, searching for her lover anywhere but, as the panic subsided, and she started using her mind with her once strong logic, she began to search in the few places she knew Jessie could have gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried first at the gym but, apparently, she wasn\u2019t there. And hadn\u2019t been there once in the last three years, having contact with the people there only by phone and mails. Still, when Susan got there, a few instructors couldn\u2019t believe that she was The Susan that had managed to capture their boss heart. Susan hadn\u2019t time for that, though and swiftly, as much as she could, she left the place seeking from place to place, spending the entire day walking around as she tried to find the love of her life.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nStill, as evening came, here was only one place which Susan hadn\u2019t yet gone to.<br>\r\nIt was a small park with a lonely bench, set up so that who sat there could watch the sun descend slowly behind the mountains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she neared that place Susan spotted immediately a lonely figure sitting on that bench. The figure was intently watching the sun going down, unaware of anything surrounding her. Susan tried to get closer without being noticed but, the Amazonian figure sitting on the bench didn\u2019t seemed to notice anything, too focused on her own thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Susan stood, a few meters away from her Lover, she had once more mixed feeling on how to approach the situation. As soon as she saw Jessie\u2019s figure, all of her doubts and fear grabbed her and stilled her on the spot. Leaving her there, scared of speaking, of calling her name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfraid of the past, of what the future could bring to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>What if she does it again? What if She turns me again in that massive blob I once was? What if she doesn\u2019t stop, this time?</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrippled by fear she didn\u2019t move or uttered a word. Susan stood there, silent, watching her lover staring at the sun, sitting apparently calm on that bench. The same one where they had once sat together, promising each other eternal love. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie had strolled around town for a bit, as she left Susan, trying valiantly to find something to motivate her to start anew. But the festering wound in herself, having grown cancerous due to the guilt she felt for what she had done to the woman she loved with all her heart, didn\u2019t let her find any hope for the future. At first she had thought of leaving the town, going in another state where, maybe, she could have found something worth of living for but, he pretty soon realized she was just lying to herself. She couldn\u2019t escape from what she\u2019d done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what she had brought on the girl she had promised to love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she remembered of that promise, Jessie realized it was only fitting to have her fate decided in the same spot where she had promised love to Susan. Without waiting any further she left the town and stopped only when she reached the bench where the two of them had sat once. Where she had promised Susan to love her with all of her heart for eternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA promise that, in the end, she herself had broken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, her guilt addled mind forced her to see what she had done to Susan, the monster in which she had almost managed to change her into. The horrible, dreadful future she had almost condemned her to live through. As the sun began to set behind the mountain, so Jessie rose from the bench, walking closer to the edge, as she gripped tightly the railing dividing her from the chasm that opened right in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Yes\u2026it is fitting. I\u2019ve thrown you into an abyss\u2026it is only right I do the same with myself\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she thought so, she swiftly jumped over the railing, seeing the chasm opening under her eyes, as she suddenly felt herself weightless. As she opened her arms, closing her eyes, she let herself go toward the abyss\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At first, she didn\u2019t think too much of it but, as she saw her jumping over it, her heart began beating faster, her doubts vanishing out as if fog dispersed by the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreeching like a hawk she rushed forward, moving her arms forward over the railing, trying to grab her lover before she jumped down. Susan hit hard the railing with her soft body, feeling a sharp pain on her belly but it didn\u2019t matter in that moment. All that mattered was to grab Jessie before she vanished forever from her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie had let herself go, already she felt herself being dragged down by the invisible hands of gravity and yet, at the last moment she heard a loud, shrill, scream of fear forcing her to open her eyes. As she did so she saw Susan, Her Susan against the railing, holding her up as best as she could having managed to grab her arm at the last second. For a moment Jessie stood there, dumbfounded, unable to understand what was going on. Her Susan was there. And she was lifting her with all of her might, dragging away from the chasm, lugging her like a potato sack over the railing onto solid ground. Only then Jessie realized what Susan had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had saved her life.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. She had condemned her to live with her guilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Does she want revenge so badly, that even letting me die is too little?</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, as Jessie raised her stare on Susan, she saw the tears in her Lover eyes, she read in those beautiful mesmerizing eyes the fear of having almost lost her forever. Still, Jessie couldn\u2019t believe, couldn\u2019t understand what was going on. <br>\r\nFor this reason, feeling completely void of any emotion she turned toward Susan (Her Susan?) asking her a simple question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan felt terribly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to thank only the adrenaline coursing through her veins if she had managed to lift the heavy body of her lover up and over the railing, plus she had hurt her belly quite painfully and so she almost doubled over. But it wasn\u2019t that pain forcing her to cry. It was the expression on Jessie that was tearing her apart. There was no emotion on her beautiful face, it was as if Jessie had already died and only a husk of what she used to be was standing there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan\u2019s heart cracked in half as Jessie\u2019s emotionless voice asked her a single question. Why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout speaking, Susan rose from the ground and, without uttering a word she ran straight forward against Jessie, throwing a massive punch at her face, with all the adrenaline-fueled strength she possessed. Yet, the other woman didn\u2019t even flinch, she simply stood there as if waiting for the next attack to arrive, passively waiting to be hit again and again. But no other punch arrived to her. She instead found herself suddenly enveloped by the loving hug of a 400 lbs girl, who was hugging her with all of her might, as well as crying over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you hate me? Why do you wish me to live? You\u2019re not your\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSTOP DECIDING WHO I AM! Stop thinking what would be best for me! I know who I am\u2026I\u2026I know what you\u2019ve done to me\u2026I know it all.<br>\r\nI remember how you changed me into a freak\u2026But I also remember the pain you\u2019ve gone through to bring me back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lost you twice already\u2026I\u2026I don\u2019t want to lose you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can\u2019t lose you anymore, Jess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI won\u2019t be able to live if you\u2019re not with me. You\u2026you\u2019re the woman I want at my side. <br>\r\nI\u2026I can\u2019t\u2026\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jessie fell under the onslaught of Susan words she couldn\u2019t believe what she was hearing. It was a dream, it had to be a dream. After all she\u2019d done to Susan, Her Susie couldn\u2019t still be able to loving her. So guilt ridden she was, that Jessie couldn\u2019t face what she was pressured under. She had to suffer as she had made Susan suffer. It was the only thing she could do. It was the only thing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripped by the fear, Jessie began to try and get free of Susan holds, trashing around as if she had become a wild beast. And, in truth, that was happening. Jessie couldn\u2019t face the idea that Susan was going to forgive her for what she had done, so she let herself be controlled by the fear and the panic, and yet Susan didn\u2019t release her, trying to calm her down at first. But seeing the poor result she ended up releasing one arm and slapped her once o the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet your goddamn mind together! Stop trying to shoulder yourself all the pain of the fucking world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLISTEN TO ME! You\u2019ve got to stop feeling ashamed of yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI love you with all of myself\u2026but You\u2019ve gotta fucking stop hating yourself! That is the only thing I don\u2019t like in you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is the only thing that may force me to get away from you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As Susan bellowed that last phrase, Jessie felt like a cold shower had just fallen on her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Susan was there, was really there for her\u2026and the only thing that could push her away\u2026was herself.<br>\r\nSuddenly Jessie stopped trashing around, using her arms to hug back her lover with such force that she could almost broke her ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t go! Please, don\u2019t leave me alone\u2026don\u2019t do it ever again\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan, feeling her lover now finally back in her arms, hugged her as much as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t. I won\u2019t ever leave you alone\u2026but you\u2019ve got do the same for me.<br>\r\nIf you ever have something you wish for\u2026or that you want to try\u2026or that you prefer doing\u2026let me know.<br>\r\nI\u2019m here for you too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill hugging each other, Susan rose from the ground, as Jessie did the same, and a bit walking and a bit waddling, they both slowly walked home. To their home, knowing full well that a long discussion was needed on both parts.<br>\r\nStill, as they moved forward, with the evening sky above their heads, Susan whispered softly to Jessie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Don\u2019t ever do that again. Never doubt about me, Jess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ll be your Castle, now and forever. <br>\r\nThat one place where you can be yourself, where you can let yourself go and get comfort if you need it or have help if you are scared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon\u2019t trust in me because I have faith in you.<br>\r\nTrust in yourself because I have trust in you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, let\u2019s get home\u2026Lover mine\u2026</i>\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When she first met Susie her feelings for her were simpler though still as strong, she found her soft body attractive and fell in love with her personality, but it's also where the habit that would lead her to today started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had outright lied to Susie about who she was for so long, even if it was so weak that anyone with half a braincell could have figured it out like Susie herself did, but it was still a sign of how Jessie was going to change. After she came out to Susie about her lie the two of them had hit it off fast and the next few months were magical. They grew to truly love each other and despite her deception Susie started to deeply trust Jessie, even going so far as to move in with her. But it wouldn't be too long after that the real trouble began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie was determined, but still only human. While she still worked out daily she began to slip on her diet, just a bit, but it was enough for Jessie to notice, especially when they fucked every other night. Within Jessie was the start of a new kind of lust, she already loved Susie's curvaceous form, but the extra weight made her start to think about just HOW much she loved it and how much more of it she'd like to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried her best to quell these new feelings, but they grew stronger for each night of passion they had together, fantasies and dreams clouding her rationality. When an opportunity came to grow her girlfriend Jessie all but jumped at it. She once again lied and even manipulated Susie in persuit of her desires, wanting to satisfy her need for an ever larger lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen things came to a head. Jessie had been drowning herself in her own delusion for so long that the moment Susie broke through to her in even the smallest way that she retaliated by dosing her with stimulants until she could hardly think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now here she was. She had gotten her girlfriend fired from her job and now fed her a constant stream of both food and hunger inducing drugs, all in the name of creating a Susie that would never stop eating or getting fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in doing so she was killing the actual person in the body. The person Jessie had spent so many months with, had made sweet love to, had gotten to know so well, was being buried alive in fat at this very moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realization had broken Jessie out of her mania, allowing her to think clearly about what she should do. If she keeps up with this they'll be nothing left of Susie but a infinitely hungry blob of a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd despite herself, her better judgement, or her sense of morality, Jessie found herself getting EXTREMELY aroused by the idea. There was no question that it was wrong, but somehow not just the thought of Susie getting ever more obese, but also the thought of her becoming just a fatty fuck doll for Jessie  to use as she pleased was exciting her more than it had any right to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie could just imagine as the more Susie lost herself to her hunger the more depraved things she could do to her. That if her mind became devoted to nothing else but eating that she would not object to anything Jessie wanted to do to her. The insane fantasies dancing through Jeesie's mind kept coming, not letting her heart or loins relax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeesie's mind kept flooding with new ideas the more it sank in just what she could get away with if Susie became just a hungry drone, all the ways she could have fun with the the human whale, especially as she got bigger, all because she would be incapable of resisting anything Jeesie wanted to do to her, not even try and resist as her mind deteriorated even further beyond just being child like to having no feelings or thoughts at all, just eating and being used by the woman see at one time had the ability to trust completely like a machine meant for nothing more than consuming and fornicating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith great excitement Jeesie made her decision. She had already done the deed, and with a new kind of lust alight in her soul she was ready to commit hard to it. She was going to make her dream Susie, a living, obese sex toy a reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around, ready to make the necessary preparations for Susie's new purpose in life.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tom and Rebecca are a young couple, married barely by one month. The two of them have dated each other for almost one year, before deciding to commit themselves in marriage. During the honeymoon, they both enjoyed each other, during the day and the nights, but over them was looming the shadow of the return to their normal lives, with work, reduced time and stress inducing situations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, they both promised each other that everything would be fine and they would be faithful to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of months later, they\u2019re both living in the same apartment on the outskirts of Los Angeles, a nice flat that Rebecca had bought in the past, when she had finally landed a big contract for a four star restaurant, in which she had been complimented countless times for her wonderful job. Tom, instead, had been focusing on targeting mainly over the average people, finally managing to land a private contract with the wife of a rich entrepreneur in the Oil &amp; Gas field. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything seemed out of a fairy tale for the two of them but, reality often is very different from stories\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Monday evening, two months past their honeymoon, both Tom and Rebecca had been living together and working in their respective field without many issues. Until the last two weeks, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this last period, Rebecca noticed that at the start of the week, when she had her rest day from her job, Tom had been constantly busy with his client, staying away all day long while letting her know that his presence had been requested by his client for an intensive training. At first, Rebecca, wished him luck and thought nothing of it. But as time went on and Tom\u2019s presence in the household seemed to be always scarce when she was in, Rebecca began to suspect something. Although she did want to have faith in him, she still began to have doubts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs days passed her doubts, began to be suspicions, until she knew she was being betrayed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, albeit she had often asked Tom about who his Client was, he always seemed reticent, often saying that he couldn\u2019t divulge personal information about his clients. And yet, she had found him, one day, talking about it with a friend of his about this bombshell vixen that he was working for lately. <br>\r\nFirst bell of alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there were the always constant extra hours he performed for the Client, especially in the evening until late hours in the morning. Second bell of alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, what sent Rebecca over the edge. Just the other day she had found in his clothes bag, an expensive looking tie, with a kiss made over it with lipstick.<br>\r\nThat finding sent her in a rage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, she wanted to break everything, cry over everything and then run away from that house. But as the rage calmed down and she began to think more clearly, she realized that there was something else she could do to get her revenge on the cheating skunk. By her knowledge of food, spices and herbal usage in a kitchen, she had often been complimented for managing to create dishes that, at times, could put a smile on even the worst critics. Now, all she had to do was use her skills against her cheating husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>After all, with my job as a Chef, I earn more than enough to live a decent life, and Tom could afford to just stay at home and maintain it.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Still, she had the problem that he didn\u2019t seem to be available when she was out of her kitchen. Yet, she decided to let it be, for now. She would just prepare their meals as she had always done, leaving them in the fridge for him to have when she wasn\u2019t home. Smiling sinisterly Rebecca began to lay down her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom knew he was working too much but Ms. Thompson, her current client, seemed to have an endless amount of energies. No matter how hard he worked her out in the gym, she always returned ready for more on the following day, if not the same evening. In truth, as much as he loved getting enough cash to almost be on the same level of Rebecca, he was getting pretty tired of following the young trophy wife. Because that she was, he had no doubt in that. And although she often teased him or made sexual allusions in regard to the two of them, he always refused. He loved his wife, Rebecca, and did not want to hurt her by betraying her for a temporary fling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he couldn\u2019t openly refuse, since he was afraid of losing this one chance he had of making a name for himself within the people of a certain, way above the average, status. He wanted to finally enter in the big league, so that he could finally be the one taking care of Rebecca, and not the other way around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as he loved her and felt grateful of having found such a beautiful, supportive and caring girl to call his own, he still resented a bit the fact that she was the main influence in keeping them afloat, month after month. Due to that resentment, he was ready to do everything he could to grant her the better lifestyle she so deserved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>After all, if I manage to land a contract with someone famous, I\u2019ll be earning a ton of money and she can finally leave that kitchen and stay home all day to rest on her feet.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom, so, decided to sacrifice a bit more of his free time with the tangible hope of finally making it into the big league. The only point he found himself weak to was actually the dietary advices. In all honesty he had always issues regarding that, since various people had so many different lifestyles, he simply didn\u2019t feel confident, or knowledgeable enough, in giving the proper suggestion. Luckily for him, Rebecca was much more analytical from this point of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had always helped him to analyze and provide the proper diet to selected training courses, and he loved her even more for this supportive side of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter most of the morning passed away in her kitchen, Rebecca had now a general idea on how to bring forward her plan to exact revenge from Tom. She had slaved away all morn, trying countless recipes, mixing in various ingredients and spices, trying to have in her hands the final weapon that she could use against him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true that he knew his proper diet, but she often had surprised him by showing that by using a different spice or herb, he could obtain the same result with less expenses. And now, she had within her hands a concoction she could use against him. Naturally it wasn\u2019t going to work overnight but, it was a start. As she patiently waited for the mix to be ready, she tried to imagine the various cases where she could use it and how it would affect him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor sure, since it was a concoction of different spices and herbs, which she mixed to weaken as much as possible taste and smell, she could use it with dishes with a strong taste or a distinctive odor. Surely she couldn\u2019t use it much on delicate plates as fish or salads. But since Tom often consumed proteins and carbs, in moderate quantities, she was fairly sure that she could use several times a week. If everything had been done correctly, the current mix was going to slowly reduce his metabolism while also instill in him a bit of lethargy and a small increase in hunger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, she could potentially leave it at that but, that would take way too much time to have her revenge. Instead, if she properly balanced the various ingredients, she could obtain a wide range of effects, from powering up one of the main aspects of the mix or even cause some mild counter effects, such as gassiness, sweating, and so many others. To be sure, as soon as the mix was ready, she had a bit of a taste. As she tried to lick away at a few grains on the point of her finger, her trained taste buds detected some faint traces of the ingredients she had used. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was sure that Tom wasn\u2019t going to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As the day progressed, she carried out her plan, preparing each and every meal for the week, while adding to them the mix she prepared. Labeling them into Tupperware containers for Tom, she grinned wildly thinking on how much he would change with a full week of taking her Mix, which she lovingly called \u2018Lover\u2019s bane\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the following days, Tom and Rebecca barely saw each other, one busy as she was in the kitchen of a restaurant, the other trying his hardest to land the dream job he so aspired to. Still, as the week passed, something changed within their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom kept on with his routine of training his client at all hours of the day, returning home only to have the meals prepared by his lovely wife, and to recharge his spent energies by sleeping. Rebecca, anxious about the results of the tampered meals, began unconsciously to taste-test a bit too much of any dish she, or her team, prepared. Not enough to be yet noticeable, but still different from her normal routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the week came to an end, it became apparent that\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the week passed, Rebecca could hardly wait to see what had happened to Tom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the two of them had been so busy on their own jobs lately, both decided that the incoming Sunday, they were going to enjoy a rest day together at home. Away from their jobs, and free to spend the day as they wanted. As if putting on an act related to their honeymoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough excited to see what changes had happened with Tom, Rebecca tried to act as normally as she could, waking up late as she often did on her resting days and, although trying to rein in her anger, acting as the loving wife she had always been toward him. As she rose from the bed, she shared with Tom she realized he wasn\u2019t there with her. With a sigh, for she still loved him although he was cheating on her, she stood up and got out of their room, noticing immediately that a smell of burned eggs was coming from the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, knowing that somethings never changed, she went into the kitchen finding there Tom trying as hard as he could to make some kind of breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, from the look of things, it seemed more likely that someone had bombarded them right before breakfast, judging by the chaos and by the not completely cooked and yet, totally burned, pancakes and eggs on the table. Still, for Rebecca this was a good opportunity to see if there were any external changes in her husband. Checking him from behind she thought that he seemed be slightly plushier than he was before but, she couldn\u2019t be certain. In any case, before he completely destroyed the kitchen she intervened, having him move aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Chef\u2026let me handle it.<br>\r\nThanks though\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said to him, appearing from behind of him, while hugging him and giving him a peck on the cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was so focused on what he was trying to do that he almost jumped out of his clothes. And yet he quickly kissed her back, as he sat glumly at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wanted to surprise you with a breakfast in bed.<br>\r\nSorry for the mess\u2026I\u2019ll clean it out later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca, was smiling still. As she hugged him she barely pinched his middle and was ecstatic in seeing that there was the tiniest layer of pudge on him. As she prepared a scrumptious breakfast, adding to his portions her own \u2018Lover\u2019s Bane\u2019, she wondered how she had to broach the subject, if at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a devious idea sprang to her mind she grinned, without turning around, as she said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, babe\u2026and yet, when one cook something he has to accept the good and the bads...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo probl\u2026uhm? What do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you really want to throw away what, had been, food?\u201d she answered back with a hint of teasing in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom grumbled a bit but, in the end, took the plates with the overcooked and undercooked food he had prepared and began to chow down all that was edible. It wasn\u2019t really much what could be eaten and yet, Rebecca knew that if he managed to also clean the breakfast she was preparing, it meant that the Mix was actually working on him. Just as Tom finished eating the edible from his failed attempt at breakfast, Rebecca turned around and began to distribute the portion for their real meals. As it had been common between them, the day that they were actually able to be together it was to be treated as a bit of a cheat day, so she prepared a little more than what she usually did for the weekly meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom, as he was left speechless once more at the abilities behind a stove of Rebecca, could only drool as a hearty plate was left in front of him. Already licking his lips, he marveled at what his wife had prepared in such a short time. On the plate, as it was, there were some fried and stirred eggs, mixed in with some small cubes of bacon. Aside that there were also a couple spoonful of beans in a tasty looking sauce, a handful of bacon strips, along with a few slices of fried green tomatoes and some small sausages. And, besides that, on a similar, albeit smaller, plate there were also a couple of cupcakes with a smudge of butter and jam on the side of the plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he cleaned his lips with a napkin, while as well pouring himself a glass of orange juice, Tom began to quickly chow down once more, as if he had already forgotten about his previous \u2018meal\u2019. Rebecca, from her side had similar portions although, in her plate there wasn\u2019t trace of the special mix she had used on Tom\u2019s own. Still, she enjoyed it, although she couldn\u2019t clean completely the plate. Something that Tom, instead, managed to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling she turned toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBabe? There is some more eggs and a few more bacon strips if you want them\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom, after finishing the glass of juice, cleaned himself with the napkin again and then brought his plate to Rebecca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026if there is some more, I\u2019ll clean it out. Must\u2019ve woken up particularly hungry this morning\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah? Or maybe you\u2019re trying to make me blush so I will forgot about that \u2018breakfast\u2019 you tried to prepare?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she filled back his plate with the residual eggs and bacon, she returned to him the plate half-filled in respect to what the original portion had been. Still, Tom cleared it out completely, finally slumping back on his chair, feeling utterly stuffed. Apparently exhausted, even though he had promised to clear out the table and the Kitchen, Rebecca began to clean up, letting him stay there on the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, the kitchen was already back to its original splendor and Rebecca, wanting to test the waters, sneaked on Tom\u2019s figure as he was still napping on the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how\u2019s my man doing? Your client isn\u2019t pushing you too hard, is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmh? No\u2026No, it\u2019s just that I\u2019m trying to get something big going and it\u2019s so tiring, but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Tom apparently slouching form suddenly sprang to life, grabbing Rebecca at the waist and forcing her to lay on him on the chair, as he hugged her close to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026But I haven\u2019t forgotten about my loving wife. How could I? You\u2019re the most beautiful and important thing in my life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he kissed her long and hard, feeling as she melted under his actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca loved her husband and, couldn\u2019t resist as he kissed her with all the passion she had loved him for. Still, it burned in her that he was probably just as passionate to another woman, so she swore within herself that she would have her vengeance on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the morning progressed seeing the two of them staying mostly together working in their garden, or by watching tv on the couch, Tom began to feel somewhat sleepy. Not that he wanted to sleep, but more as if he didn\u2019t want to do anything. In truth, it wasn\u2019t the first time he felt like that in the past week, but as he was often with his client, he had pushed away that feeling, focusing on his job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, though, with nothing to do, he began to just laze about on the couch, not moving even when Rebecca mentioned that she was going to go and have a quick shower. Part of him wanted to go and join her under the water but, another part was just telling him to rest a bit more, first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rebecca went to shower herself, she wanted to burst out laughing in joy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, she had almost wished Tom would join her under the water but, since he wasn\u2019t coming and his passion for her hadn\u2019t really diminished, she was certain it had to be the mix she had given him during the week at his every meal. And yet, as she thought it over, what could be her better course of action? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet things be as they were and see how Tom would react then? Or maybe she could increase the doses and force him to grow out faster. Else, she could always change the recipe for the Mix, forcing him to change one precise aspect of his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, whatever she decided to do, she now knew that her \u2018Lover\u2019s Bane\u2019 was working and that soon Tom would be only hers.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The dishes she had to leave beside her husband to entice him, to use the hunger he was going to develop as he began the meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen everything was ready, she went and called him, waking him up with a quick peck on the cheek, letting him know that lunch was ready.  As she returned into the kitchen, she grinned sinisterly, reminding herself to try not to laugh too much, after all, with a few snacks given to him during the morning, all laced with her Mix, he should be well and truly hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom rose from the couch, feeling way too tired and sleepy. He had done nothing all morning, and yet, he was feeling tired and hungry. As he massaged his six pack, feeling the stomach behind grumble a bit, he giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>It has to be since it\u2019s our cheat day\u2026I\u2019ll just follow my gut today and from tomorrow, back to the usual schedule.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he entered the kitchen he stood, mouth agape, at the doorway, seeing as the table was completely covered in plates and dishes, at a first glance it seemed way too much for just two people but, as he felt drool in his mouth, he decided to tell himself that he would have just a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnconsciously, he knew already it was a lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tom seated at his place, he soon found himself surrounded by delicious looking dishes and bowls, seemed that Rebecca had had an all-out feud with another chef, and cooked enough food for an army. Still, trying to contain himself, he simply grabbed his glass and gulped down some water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rebecca saw that, she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018The hunger mix in the water is tasteless, but its effects, although temporary, are much stronger than those of my Lover\u2019s Bane. Let\u2019s see how long you resist, husband dear.</i>\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tom gulped down his water, he began to realize he wasn\u2019t simply hungry, he was downright famished. Starving, even!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe managed to wait just long enough for Rebecca to seat, give him his portion and wish him a good lunch, then he lost all control.  Tom began to eat ferally, just like a wild animal who\u2019s been kept without food for days. In a matter of minutes, he cleared out, twice, the hoers d\u2019euvre that Rebecca had prepared, some simple small rolls of fried bread and lamb stew. Then he assaulted the next course, a rather deep bowl filled with lentil soup, in which Rebecca had added also bacon and oil to give it much more taste, and calories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom wasn\u2019t anymore in control, he began to clean anything that was given to him, without realizing how much he was really eating. Rebecca, from her side, was ecstatic about the situation and kept providing refills to her husband. She knew perfectly well that the more she gave him, the hungrier he was getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Rebecca realized that she hadn\u2019t even time to eat herself, but she wasn\u2019t worried about that, all that mattered was to have Tom overstuffed, so filled of food that he wasn\u2019t going to be able to do much more than rest and sleep in the afternoon. And Tom was going at it just like she had planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst courses began to appear on the table, Spaghetti with Carbonara sauce, Linguini with Alfredo an then tortillas and Chinese noodles with fried pork. Each time she brought a new plate Rebecca had to fill it two or three times before she would bring the next, and yet, she saw that Tom was starting to feel the quantities of that full meal she had prepared for him. His pants already began to strain to keep his bloating belly in check, as his shirt began to rise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, for Her it wasn\u2019t enough yet, he was maybe getting full, but it wasn\u2019t enough. With a smirk she then offered him a small portion of Caesar Salad, which paled against the previous plates he had consumed but, she knew, it was necessary to let him continue.<br>\r\nWithin the salad, in fact, she had used one of her personalized mixes, the one that was going to have an effect on his digestive system, forcing it to speed up and store as many calories as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting him breath for a few minutes, as he rested having consumed also the salad, Rebecca could seemingly see his own form fattening up. As if she could see his body growing fatter from the drugs within his system. But after that short break of barely twenty minutes, she began once more to offer him other plates. This time, passing on to the second courses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrilled steaks with fries, pots of stew with buttery bread, rolls of meat covered by thin layers of baked bread, slices of glazed ham, kebab wraps, even a minced meat pie. Tom could barely take note of all those dishes and plates that were passing under his eyes, he gobbled up whatever she placed in front of him, there was no time to taste, or to compliment her, only time to eat, chew and swallow. He had to sate the bottomless hunger he was feeling in the deepest part of his gut. And yet, as he cleared also the second courses, he began to have quick, short breaths, as he tried to, nonchalantly, unbutton his pants to let his belly have more room. Rebecca saw all this but didn\u2019t say nothing, She didn\u2019t want to disturb the trance he had been fallen into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, there were still the desserts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs lunch time passed, Tom laid on his chair, completely overfilled, stuffed beyond belief, and yet he was finally feeling sated. Although, tired and sleepy from all the food he had ingested, he still managed to give a weak smile to Rebecca, a compliment without words, before falling into a deep, regenerative sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he slept, snoring quite loudly, Rebecca took a good look at her husband forms after the massive meal. Already she could see that thanks to her boosters his body was already outgrowing his clothes. His pants were very tight on him, cutting him at the side, giving him a delicious looking muffin top, but it was mostly his overall form that was appearing much more confined within his current clothes that led to Rebecca to smile widely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was doing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only she could keep him stuffed and full as she did that day, for the rest of the week, he would surely grow massive in a record time. And with how sleepy and lazy he was going to be, he for sure would not give too much though on his growing forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a shocking sensation for her, as she observed the results of her meal, she felt true arousal for the growing forms of her husband. She had never felt something like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she felt herself grow hotter and hotter, she quickly prepared a plate for herself, without realizing that her own portions were going to be laced with the same mix she had given to Tom. When she finally managed to feel herself sated, she sadly realized her mistake. For in front of her were laying six or seven plates that had once been full of deliciously prepared food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving herself a shake, she moved away from the table, as she gave a last look at her husband, before returning to the stove. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only she wanted to repeat the experiment at dinner time but, she also wanted to have something ready to give him as an afternoon snack. As she prepared and cooked, she never seemed to notice how much she also was tasting and trying, ending up eating herself quite a bit more than usual.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As a week of massive meals and home-made boosters passed, Tom\u2019s got used to feeling mildly hungry all the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth he wasn\u2019t really sure what was going on, suddenly he had begun to feel almost constantly hungry and so he began to snack all the time. Rebecca had told him that it was probably a stress related situation and, he had to agree that he was feeling pretty stressed out as of late. But he didn\u2019t actually do anything against it, instead, he seemed to have embraced it. Rebecca too seemed to have been eating more at the same time, so Tom didn\u2019t worry too much. It had simply to be the stress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, although he couldn\u2019t see the problems that were arising from this issue, that didn\u2019t mean that nobody else could. His client especially, Ms. Thompson, noticed that her trainer was getting quite chubby and out of shape. In fact, she noticed, at every lesson he gave her, he was eating something, be some candy bars, be some chips and, once, he even had a box of donuts with him. He still, tried to teach her in the gym but, as the week went on, he began to lose his breath faster and faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, as she watched him grow, she did her best to hide what she was feeling for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie knew she was nothing more than a trophy wife in her marriage, so she felt no need to be faithful to her own husband. And yes, she had tried many times to have a chance with Tom but he always refused. Until now, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith him getting fatter, although he didn\u2019t seem to be aware of it, she realized that not only she could have him, something that she wanted only because he had never given himself to her, but also because it intrigued her to have her way with the current him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she wanted him just for the pleasure of having him but, seeing how big he was getting, the secret hidden deep within her began to emerge. She now needed him under her control. And so, she began to help him out in her own way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Tuesday, another full day of training, although, Sophie had the training and Tom was just lazing around in the gym, constantly snacking on a few candy bars. Ms. Thompson had just finished a long running on the treadmill, and she decided to bring forth her plan for a well-rounded trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026Sophie\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTom, what do you say about a break?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a little something for you, something to thank you for all your effort spent on me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026Alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sophie led Tom out of the gym, she swiftly brought him to a table laid near the pool, leaving him a few minutes to rest and recover, as if he had just finished running a marathon, she quickly called out for her servant to bring out the surprise she had for him. As they waited, Sophie couldn\u2019t stop admiring how luscious he was growing out to be. He was growing out way more than chubby, with already a second chin forming on his neck and considerable moobs starting to push against his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut also, his belly was growing out bigger and plushier. All in all, if she had to say a weight, she would have said around the 250 lbs, maybe a tad more. But she was loving every second of his, slumping down, fast breathing, quite sweaty, fattening body. <br>\r\nBefore she could keep on gazing, her servants brought out a massive tray, leaving it right in front of Tom, who watched it curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Tom\u2026consider it a small gift from me for your wonderful assistance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he unveiled the surprise, he felt immediately his grumbling stomach agree with what appeared in front of his eyes. The gift he had received was nothing more than a massive tray of pastries. Ones that, unbeknownst to him, had been requested to be made as much calorie laden as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom, although knowing that he may have eaten a bit too much that day, he still gave a quick look to Sophie and, with her consenting nod, he simply dived in, beginning to eat as many as he could of those delicious treats, still lying to himself about his need to recover lost energies. From that turning point, Tom\u2019s began to go at Sophie mansion to basically pig out, instead of train. And the woman, as days passed, began also to push more and more on Tom, about his eating habits, asking or, downright, forcing him to keep on eating, to keep on growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca, from her side was hilariously happy, as days passed, she knew that Tom was eating more and more, judging from the devastation she usually found in the house, when she returned after him. And yet, she didn\u2019t stop. She would simply refill the house of goodies, cook more and more fattening dishes and using more often her Mixes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she seemed blind to, was the effect on her own body. With the constant temptation of food surrounding her and, with the occasional mistake of giving herself her own Mix, also she began to grow a bit more than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a vast difference between her and Tom, her husband was quickly becoming an eating machine, unable to stop eating, growing constantly hungrier, whle she instead, had brief interval in which would pig out carelessly, before noticing her mistake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, even if in a slower way than her husband, also Rebecca was starting to enjoy the pleasure of the constant snacking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nearing the end of the week for Tom, soon it was going to be weekend and then he could spend some time with Rebecca, but he hadn\u2019t considered about his Client. Sophie had been enjoying seeing her trainer grow rounder and flabbier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed particularly attracted to the fact that he was unable to stay more than few seconds without eating something.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNaturally, in the past days she had kept offering food to him, at first cajoling him under a pretense of a gift, but, as she realized he didn\u2019t need it, she simply gave him food as she trained. And the more she gave him, the quicker he tried to finish. It wasn\u2019t unsurprising then, that he would gain weight, but what she was amazed of was the speed of his growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day, for example, as soon as he had arrived into the gym, she already had invited him to his seat at a hastily made up table, already loaded with various portions of sweets and cakes. As she began her own training running on a treadmill or doing some lifting, she constantly kept her gaze on Tom as he stuffed his mouth with more and more sweets. It was only ten minutes of him in the gym and already he was sitting down eating cakes as if there was no tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As she sweated out on her exercises, so Tom was engrossed with a wide variety of cakes and pies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe barely could keep herself focused on what she was doing seeing as he literally glutted himself with the endless supply of food, she provided him with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less the five days he had managed to put on around 50 lbs, growing up to, with eye estimation, at something less than 300 lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he really did show his weight. He had now a thick double chin, already growing wider, fairly large bingo wings under his arms, as his thighs were also starting to touch against the other. But his front was where he had grown the most. His moobs could now rival in size a small pair of breasts on any woman, although they didn\u2019t share the same perkiness. And his belly, it was now getting its second belly roll, cascading down from his middle, already covering the zip of his pants with their girth, as it pushed against the tight confine of his clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom, between his wife and his client, was growing out at an astounding speed and, most importantly, due to the drugs mixed with his two main meals each day, he still had to start worry about his figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith laziness came also the \u2018no worries\u2019 vision of life. He sometimes wondered if he was eating a tad too much but, since not Rebecca, nor Sophie, had said anything he decided not to worry about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, feeling rather constantly tired all day long, the surprise meals that Ms. Sophie provided him with were rather pleasant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so that both Tom and Rebecca began their unsuspecting journey in the world of obesity\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A month had passed already since Tom had fallen for the trap that his wife had prepared for him. In this month the Trainer had grown massive due to both influence in his daily activities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom one side Rebecca, which had pumped him full of so many enhancers to his appetite, digestion rate and also forced his metabolism to slow to a crawl. But on the other side there was also his Client, Sophie, which reveled in his fattening up and so provided him with all day long, never ending, meals that kept him busy from the moment he arrived in her presence to the moment he left her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he was aware that there was something wrong going on, since he wasn\u2019t anymore able to bend over or due to a lack of fitting clothes, he still was too lazy to face his worries, preferring to simply ignore it and push on with his life. And so he kept devouring the meals that Rebecca prepared for him on a weekly basis, but he also passed his days at \u2018work\u2019 stuffing his face and gut with all the food that Sophie pushed on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom had grown hugely under this treatment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely able to move on his own, forced to a slow, cumbersome waddle, as he barely had strength enough to keep himself standing. Not only his body had swelled up with fat, his face too had suffered the same fate. Already sporting a third double chin, his neck had simply vanished from view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face was now rounded and cherubic with a pair of chipmunk cheeks that seemed constantly full of food. His torso had enlarged greatly, his moobs were now so big he was starting to have the need for a bra to keep them in check. And then his gut. It had grown hugely, divided in three thick belly rolls, laid in front of him of at least a couple of feet\u2019s, and yet it cascaded onto his lower parts, reaching down to his knees making it so hard for him to actually move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, it was usually so stuffed of food that it was more used as a counterbalance for his rear, keeping him standing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor his ass and hips had also grown, giving him quite a shelf of a backside, although most of his weigh went into his prodigious gut and bloated moobs. His legs too had absorbed quite a bit of weight, growing out as wide as tree trunks, forcing him to waddle, although it wasn\u2019t enough for his thighs to not chafe against each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, despite how huge he had become, he still plodded down every day at Sophie\u2019s mansion and pigged out. Often, without realizing that his Client was there watching him, he simply stopped using utensils letting her servants to feed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had all started one day, after an all morning eating spree. He found himself so tired to not have strength enough to move his arms, yet Sophie helped him out, having her servants feed him for a bit, until he was rested enough to continue on his own. From then on, always more often than not, he would ask to be fed, until it soon began to be the new normality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis step took away any notion of control Tom had, granting it over to Sophie, which soon began to use it as much as she could, quickly changing him into her own personal pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was in this way that, one day, as she spoke with him, she began to figure out how everything had started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his recollection of that old cheat day he had with his wife, of the anxiety he had seen in her afraid that he was cheating her, Sophie realized that she could obtain much more than her single personal piggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could find out how his wife did and, turn this knowledge on others.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAfter a few more sessions with her piggy, in which she stuffed him full of calories and extracted juicy info\u2019s out of him, she decided to act and contact his wife. After a rather difficult talk, Sophie managed to let understand to Rebecca that there hadn\u2019t been any betrayal from Tom on her, not that she hadn\u2019t tried but, he simply had refused every time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, Sophie wanted to meet to discuss about Tom\u2019s current situation and how to solve it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca, after the call with Sophie, was left rather baffled. She had always thought that her husband was cheating on her but, from the sincere voice of that woman, she was fairly sure that he hadn\u2019t. This realization made her break inside. She had poured so much effort in her revenge and for what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she hadn\u2019t noticed, she also had put on a fair amount of poundage. Gone was the svelte newly married wife body, between the anger on her husband, her continuous testing of new recipes and, in the last weeks, the use of her own mixes, erroneously, on herself. All of that had brought quite a lot of weight on her frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready, at the restaurant, others had noticed and reprimanded her for both her shape and her working ethics, giving her a month of leave to get back in shape, for both body and mind. But Rebecca had basically continued with her lazier lifestyle, trapped in her own revenge, as it had been for her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs weeks passed, and she indulged more and more, Rebecca weight had begun to grow noticeable on her body. And yet, although she knew she was letting herself go and that it was all a byproduct of her own concoction, she soon found herself unable to fight back. Exactly how it had been for Tom, she soon found herself in a constant loop of hunger and search of satisfaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, in a matter of few weeks, she grew up to 270 lbs of pure fat. In truth, she had hoped that by growing lazier she would simply stop using her own mix in her recipes but, in reality she kept using it for Tom\u2019s meal\u2026which in turn were consumed by her, since he was often still at his Client mansion. With each new influx of Lover\u2019s bane into her system she began to get used to its taste and so, although it was a bit more work to do, she kept adding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, her descent seemed slow and unstoppable. Until that call, at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sophie finally managed to meet Rebecca, she was astounded in seeing the same symptoms that Tom had shown and trying to be as delicate and secretive about it, she started to inquire about it. With a bit of prodding and offering of food to the girl, she finally managed to understand what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActing quickly, she began to lay down her own plans for the married couple. With the enhancer booster recipe in her possession, Sophie now had the weapon she needed to let the newly married couple to live together in harmony, under her direct control. Tom was already pretty much putty on her hands, all she had to do was to push also his wife over the edge with her own creation and she could simply have both grow out for her own pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEasing in the mind of Rebecca the idea that she was going to help them out of that spot, that she was going to assist Rebecca in getting her old body back and do similarly for Tom, Sophie managed to provide a sense of tranquility in her new guest. Afterwards, it was all a matter of having Rebecca under a steady diet of massive lunches and dinner, while using on her the same booster she had used on Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca at first didn\u2019t trust much that girl that was hosting them at her mansion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, a bit due to how sorry she felt for not believing her husband, and a bit due to how good she felt when eating food, she soon began to feel comfortable within that house. Moreover, being a guest meant she had nothing to do and could simply laze about and have the occasional splurge, confident that her host was going to help her out of that spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt began slowly, at first, with multiples snacks between her meals, always goaded by the servitude there to keep going, to taste some more, to have a little bite more. Then, also the meal began to grow in size but, since most food she ate was already imbued with her own enhancer, she found herself unable to resist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the few moments of lucidity she often asked herself if Tom had felt the same when he had been in her position but, as food was soon becoming her new necessary staple to keep going, less were the moments in which she could clearly think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the span of few weeks, Rebecca began to follow the same schedule that Tom did before her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConstant snacking and gorging. With a near limitless supply of snacks, sweets and meals, Rebecca let herself go more and more often, embracing deeply her own, drug induced, gluttony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery day began with food brought to her by a maid and every day ended with empty trays brought away by another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that was in the middle was eating. Soon enough\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sure, a future made of being constantly stuffed full of food but a future, nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, as she watched Rebecca balloon up, growing bigger and wider, outgrowing her clothes, chairs and even couches, Sophie still wanted to have more from that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, just as she was watching Wifey go at it with one of her countless meals, she began to see what she wanted for her future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca knew very little nowadays. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that when food was in front of her, she had to eat it. She knew that when her belly grumbled, she had to eat more food and, she knew that when she felt so full,she could burst any moment, she had to eat some more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFood had become her only goal in life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, not truly, she still loved her husband and knew that he was there in the mansion with her but, Sophie had told her that she needed to eat way more to see him again and so she obeyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, Rebecca sometimes wondered why she was obeying that woman but, it was the right thing to do, she told herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>If she wasn\u2019t taking good care of me, I wouldn\u2019t have let her do that\u2026right?</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut mainly she ate all she could because she had grown used to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe barely remembered anymore why she had come to that house or what her life was before arriving there. Something like her husband was a shadowy memory, something she knew she loved but of which she couldn\u2019t see any detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven her body had become secondary. She had grown so used in seeing so little of herself that no matter how big she was getting, she didn\u2019t mind. Sophie kept telling her that she was a good girl and so she just kept at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, though, as Rebecca had just finished gulping down a meal fit for an army, Sophie went to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca laid on the ground, propped against a wall since no chair could manage her immense weight, or her tremendous shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom\u2019s wife had grown so huge that nothing could contain her anymore. Her body had even begun to lose its humanoid shape, resembling more and more a blob-like mass of fat. The last time Sophie managed to weight her she had grown past the 640 lbs, after that Rebecca had simply grown much too massive to be weighted again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, brain washed Rebecca was enjoying her life as a mindless glutton. That day, though, was special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca laid there, sitting on two king sized mattresses, her back against the wall, while her humongous body surrounded her from every side, rendering her virtually immobile. Too unfit to lift herself from the ground, she just lay there, breathing quick short breaths each time, as her mass of belly apron barely moved from it. It jiggled and wobbled to and from, due to any micro movement she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was feeling full. It was becoming rarer and rarer, for her to feel completely stuffed and overfilled, so full to not be able to eat a single more bite, no matter how hungry she was. But she trembled in both fear and joy when she saw Sophie coming toward her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how\u2019s my little sow doing, uh? Are you growing out for Sophie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca could manage barely a grunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt so full and tired that even words seemed to be too much to ask to her. Yet, she moaned loudly as Sophie caressed her jelly like gut, as she pushed her hands into all that glorious belly fat, feeling it squishy under her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou certainly are growing bigger and fatter for me\u2026But is it enough?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie loved to play a bit with her two personal piggies. But now, seeing Rebecca too big to do anything but rest, she needed more than simple play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo it isn\u2019t, little sow. You still need to grow bigger for me.\u201d Then, turning to some of her servants stationed nearby. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t she eating?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe cannot have anymore, Miss. She\u2019s full\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI decide when Rebecca is full. And she isn\u2019t right now. Bring her more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca wanted to please Sophie, but she still felt already overstuffed. And no matter how much food the servants brought to her, no matter how hard she tried to swallow, she couldn\u2019t. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie didn\u2019t seem too pleased but, a sinister smile grew on her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Becky here isn\u2019t hungry, uh? Becky doesn\u2019t want little Sophie to take care of her, uh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll it needed was a sign from her hand. Rebecca gaze found itself glued to a strange thing that the other servants were bringing in. It seemed some kind of hose, although of such size that needed two people to carry it. At the top of the hose some kind of mask, with a funnel to link both hose and mask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Rebecca could even think of react, one of the servants brough forward the contraption and fastened it tightly on her face, with the funnel ending right into her mouth. Becky tried to warn Sophie that she was afraid, but all came out was a brief gurgle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie, with another flick of her hand, quickly ordered the feeding machine to be started, as it began to pump pound after pound of a liquified meal into Rebecca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor girl soon found herself filling up with pain and pleasure, as that strange goop began filling up ay nook and cranny inside of her fattened body. With surprising speed, her entire forms began to balloon, growing more and more in a rounded shape. Her belly especially, began to drag onward on the ground, as it grew wider and higher, filling up with the high calorie sludge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rebecca filled up, so Sophie began to climb her enlarged gut, until she laid down on it, belly first, her aroused gaze directly into the lustful glazed eyes of Becky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, grow more for me, my little sow. You\u2019ll be my own bed from now on. And You shall be bigger each and every day. No matter your size, I\u2019ll find a way to have you grow bigger and fatter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil you\u2019ll grow bigger than your husband\u2026Although he\u2019ll also grow bigger each and every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill you manage to outgrow him? Will you do it for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca, unable to do anything else could only moan, as she lost herself perpetually to the gluttony and lust that her whole world had become\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Fine examples of such beasts are the monsters who lurks under the bed of kids and children. But it\u2019s not always this the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge is a Monster with the hellish duty of lurking under children beds. He hadn\u2019t been one for all of his life but, had steadily worked in Hell until he finally got promoted and assigned to lurk under their beds to scare them and instill terror and fear in their little hearts, which was then collected to resupply the dark energies powering the lowest level of Pandemonium, the Hell Capital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He\u2019s not evil per se, he\u2019s just doing his job.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, when night came and he moved his scaly reptilian body out from under the bed, although it was pitch black in the room, he could see that something seemed amiss. He had gotten used to kids room, usually filled with toys and dollies, with stars and starships if the kid was a boy and with animals and castles if it belonged to a girl. But the room he was in that night was way different from any he had ever seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPosters with menacing figures on the walls, explosions painted on the ceiling, a lone mirror placed strategically to give the owner a full view of the room directly from the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there seemed to be only one color in that room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, George was here to do a job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to scare and, possibly, eat whoever was sleeping on the bed. And he counted to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking on all fours he began stalking toward the bed, like a tiger would do when hunting its prey, his almost reptilian body shimmered a bit under the moon light coming from the window, his barbed tail swishing behind him. Moving closer and closer to the bed he could see the faint outline of the figure under the covers, and through such tiny detail he figured out that she was a young girl sleeping, although not yet mature enough to ignore monsters such as himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently he moved closer, his claws extending from his front paws, as he readied himself to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight at that moment, though, the girl seemed to stir and, in the moment he took to freeze himself, he heard a surprised whisper and a quick movement coming from the bed. Growing worried, George moved closer and realized that his victim had managed to see him, somehow, and had applied the duvet tactic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowling in frustration he inched closer noticing that the duvet was extra thick and managed to create an impenetrable shield surrounding his would-be victim. George hated how kids were getting smarter and smarter these days. Somehow, thanks to some Intern Monster, probably, one kid had learned that Duvet covers were effective defenses against Monsters attacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom then on, all kids used this tactic to protect themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got beside the bed he stared at the formidable shield that the girl was using noticing that it was a massively heavy thing, extra-long, which managed to reach almost down to the floor, making it impossible for him even to return under the bed. <br>\r\nBut he suddenly noticed that there was a way for him to get at the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs heavy as the duvet was, the girl breathing was still stable and that could only mean that she had a way to get oxygen from the outside. Walking around the bed he soon found that this girl had combined two defensive tactics into one, the first being the duvet bunkering, the second being the snorkeling technique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the usage of a long snorkel, coming out of the impenetrable shield, she managed to get clean fresh air, even though she was covered entirely by the heavy duvet. With a smile on his lips, revealing his sharp razor like fangs, George moved closer to the tube, noticing how air came out of it and was sucked in and, at the same time, how the girl middle seemed to grow larger and smaller as she breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gave him an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening his mouth wide and taking in as much air as he could, he suddenly closed his jaws on the tube creating with his lips a vacuum like seal around it, preventing any air to get out, with this done he breathed out into the tube with all of his might. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first there was a bit of resistance but, after a few moments, he managed to overcome it and suddenly noticed how the girl middle suddenly grew bigger under the cover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that in this way he could finally manage to get the girl to uncover herself from her shield indirectly he began pushing more and more air into the tube, watching with fascination how the girl figure began to swell, rising higher and higher, lifting the duvet bit by bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling himself victorious, George, began to pump faster and faster into the tube, focusing only on pushing more and more air in the snorkel to finally get a chance at scaring the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the girl found herself unable to do anything. She had thought to be safe using the duvet and her dad\u2019s snorkel but now something was pushing air into her through the same tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the girl body began to grow, first her middle which started to get rounder, filling up with air, as it began to grow higher and higher, similar to a hill as it pulled the duvet from the floor as it rose up in the air. Then, slightly above that, two additional hills seemed to sprout suddenly, growing larger and wider, as a creaking sound started to fill the room as George kept pumping faster and faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl tried to move her arms, to free herself from the snorkeling tube but, under her heavy cover she realized she couldn\u2019t manage to move freely and so could only hope that whatever was out there would stop sooner, rather than later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge instead was feeling elated. He stole a quick glance toward the bed, where he could see that the figure on it was growing rounder and rounder, rising higher and higher, taking more and more of the heavy cover from the bed. Already he could see the tips of the toes emerging from under it and so, he re-doubled his efforts to pump even more air into his victim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, meanwhile, was growing massively round. Her body growing into a massive sphere, engulfing both her arms and legs as it expanded wider and wider, her breasts, tightly kept in check by her currently too tight bra, growing bigger and bigger as they inflated with each pumped bout of air coming from the snorkel still stuck in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes, feeling like she couldn\u2019t hold anymore within herself, as she tried both to cry and scream at the same time, unable to do either of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge, instead, kept pumping more and more, using all of his lungs power to aid him in his task, feeling excited since he already could see the duvet leaving unguarded the legs of his victim, and yet her face was still under it, protected from that impenetrable shield. If he could manage to pump a little bit more into her, just enough to uncover her face, he would have won this battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he kept pushing more and more air into the massively gravid sphere that the girl had become, a loud creaking sound filled the room, sounding like a ticking bomb waiting for its sudden release. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as George was able to see the eyes of his victim getting freed from the heavy duvet, a loud ripping sound filled the room, quickly followed by a loud crackling sound as he suddenly was right in the middle of a massive explosion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the room returned silent, George stood beside the bed, his lips still closed to the snorkeling tube, laying uselessly in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared silently around the room trying to understand what had happened when a pair of red lacy bras flew down from the ceiling landing right on his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDejected, the monster returned under the bed, vanishing from view as what had happened in that room replayed over and over in his own mind.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A new night. A new room to be infested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge, although having failed his first mission in years, was swiftly given another chance to redeem himself. His Bosses thought highly of him and all tried to let him understand that such things happened. That he had to move on and to try to simply focus on his job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, George, couldn\u2019t manage to get the image of the inflating girl out of his mind.<br>\r\nHe wasn\u2019t particularly sad about her demise, although he wasn\u2019t happy about it either. It was simply a botched job, something that shouldn\u2019t have happened. He should have scared her shitless and absorbed her fear. No more, no less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the sheer size she had managed to grow into before\u2026 well, going over her limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he had a new job to do and he wanted to do it as right as he could. <br>\r\nEmerging from under the bed he noticed right away that, once again, he wasn\u2019t in a child room. There was a desk with many books on it, along with a massive machinery that the Humanz called \u2018Com-Puh-Der\u2019 or something like that. As he turned around, he then saw the bed and realized it was a massive thing. Easily a king-sized bed, capable of hosting on it three or more kids, although there was only a lonely figure sleeping on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently he moved closer, inching toward his next victim noticing how carefree it slept. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo duvet on the bed, no doll at it side. As he looked closer, he saw that indeed it was again a girl, but this time he could see her face clear as it was day. She was a teenager, usually a target too mature for his kind and yet, since she was alone in there, she had to be the target. At first, he moved closer to the bed, ready to jump-scare her, to have her freak out as he should have done but, as he looked at her, a stranger, twisted, idea came to his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of simply freaking her out, as he should have done, he began to tinker with the idea of having her grow just as the last girl he had worked on before. This time, though, he wanted to enjoy seeing her grow and, since there was no real time limit on his assignment, he began to devise a wicked plan indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge now fully focused on making his dream, his visions, come true, quickly used his forepaws to trap the girl arms and legs with her own bedsheets, making so that she couldn\u2019t free herself until he wished so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis coupled with the eye mask she was wearing gave him ample possibility to make her grow as much as he wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could he do that, though?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t want to use, again, the snorkel. As much as he wanted her to grow, he wanted to enjoy her expansion but then, how could he do it? As he looked around in the room, he noticed a strange contraption laying on the floor, close to several tin cans. Moving closer to inspect it, he smelled alcohol coming from those tins and, by playing a bit with the contraption he managed to understand the mechanic of that thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe funnel like thing on top collected the alcoholic liquid, which then fell into the tube and went into, probably, the mouth of the Humanz using the contraption. Quickly, George, looked to the girl and to the contraption he held in his paws, as a grin grew on his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could use this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll he needed now was something he could push down the tube and into the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he left the room, he roamed a bit in the house until he managed to find the kitchen, once there the plan forming into his mind was finally completed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing his powers as a monster he could have the girl grow right under his eyes, at a slower and steadier pace, getting to enjoy more and more of her expansion. Rapidly he scoured the kitchen of anything edible, trying as best as he could, to grab only the items that he remembered seeing in one of his lessons at Demon University, course Nightmares 101, the most fattening treats that women were afraid of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing as much as he could he brought everything back into the room, noticing right away how the sleeping girl seemed to react positively to the sweet tasting aroma coming from those delicacies he had collected. Using his energies, George changed the contraption he had decided to use, making so that whatever entered the funnel like thing on top, would simply turn into a semi-liquid thing, a sludge, that would easily flow through the tube and into the victim\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he got started, though, he wondered what his victim was dreaming about, as he heard her moan and giggle in joy. Inching, once more, closer to her, he used one of his claws to tap into her mind to see who she was and what she was dreaming about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly found himself on a vast patch of short grass land, in front of him huge behemoths covered in strange suits of armor ran among this field crashing into each other while, behind him, a score of young girls moved to some kind of tribal warfare dance. Behind them, sitting on a throne like palanquin, there was her, as she laughed of all those beneath her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove her head he could see a massive sign written in golden lettering stating \u201cStacey Samson \u2013 Queen Cheerleader\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge, thinking to be into the worst nightmare, began to shake in fear until he managed to calm himself, reminding himself that since he was already here, he could do something to increase his chances of success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving stealthily around, he quickly moved beside the girl, Stacey, and began knitting his web of lies directly into her mind, subtly changing her dream to make it more like what he had in mind for her. Working delicately on her mind, he slowly managed to make it appear as if all the girls under Stacey, were soon going to bring offerings to her. He had noticed that she felt herself like a queen and so it didn\u2019t take him long to make it possible for her to believe that everyone wanted to give her offerings. What took most of his time there was making her sure of the fact that no matter what they offered her she wouldn\u2019t have gained weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn doing this he botched a few times, but in the end, he was fairly certain it would all work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving her mind, he returned to his physical body and collected the magically infused contraption from the ground, managing to place the tube into her mouth and then, holding the funnel with one paw, he began pushing sweets and treats into it. As he kept filling the contraption he watched, mesmerized, as those turned into a sludge and flew down into Stacey\u2019s mouth. At first, she seemed to resist a bit but, apparently, she soon began to swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge smiled widely as he kept putting more and more food into the funnel, watching it descend into the girl and seeing direct result as the girl belly began to fill with the extra caloric sludge. Faster and faster he began to push cookies and cakes, ice cream and sticks of butter, bread and chips, into the funnel as a manic grin appeared on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey had been dreaming of being the Queen of all cheerleaders. A role befitting her as Head cheerleader of her team. Yet, the dream she was currently in changed somewhat, as her slaves suddenly began to bring her offerings, giving her sweets and treats for her to eat. At first, she didn\u2019t want them, but, realizing that she wasn\u2019t in danger of gaining any weight she simply let herself go, accepting all her people\u2019s offerings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs George kept feeding the girl, he marveled at the size of her stomach, as it kept growing larger and wider. And yet, although Stacey had started from quite some time already to moan and grumble her discomfort in her sleep, he had soldiered on. But now, he knew he had to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was growing too big and he didn\u2019t want it to end as quickly as it had happened on the girl before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping and reordering the room, and the bindings on Stacey, he saw that most of what he had brought from the kitchen had been pushed within Stacey and, enjoying this notion he swiftly crawled under her bed, returning to his sleep as he anxiously waited for the following night to come.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All he had to do was to keep going.<br>\r\nStill, wanting to be sure, he tapped into her mind again, after binding her as he had previously done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more he found himself standing in her dream, which was similar to the one she had had the night before. This time though he was prepared. Swiftly he moved to her side, as she still was seated on her throne and delved into her memories. In there he saw that she had woken up the following morning feeling quite exhausted and yet, she didn\u2019t seem to have noticed the small layer of soft fluff on herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, he placed himself to work on her mind, making her less and less susceptible to external changes to her body. The more he worked on her mind the more confident George grew, and so more convoluted were his changes to her young mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwiftly getting out of there he then grabbed once more the contraption and, after scouring once more the kitchen, he rapidly placed himself to work. As the previous night he began pushing more and more food into the contraption, swiftly creating a steady flow of highly caloric sludge that Stacey quickly swallowed up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach began to balloon under the massive amount of highly nutritious sludge and yet George pushed her once more to her very limit before stopping, noticing right away that he had managed to give her even more than what he had done the night before. With a manic glint in his eyes, he realized that the more he fed her, the more she would accept the following time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet he had a problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaloric Food was growing scarce in the house, but he had serious need for it if he wanted to continue with his plan. Looking at the engorged forms of Stacey he quickly tapped into her mind and made sure that she would completely restock the kitchen with the most fattening food she could think of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis way he would surely have enough to feed her night after night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the nights passed, and the more George fed her, Stacey began to grow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, but surely, a thickening layer of fat began to appear on her usually thin and toned frame. Her growth was slowed down a bit by the fact that she still performed sport and physical activity every day but, with the constant nightly feeding sessions, her work wasn\u2019t enough to let her lose weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Stacey seemed blind to her changes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, she had noticed that her clothes were getting tighter but, since George had manipulated her mind, she couldn\u2019t really see herself growing. At the same time, she would spend lots of her day on massive shopping sprees, purchasing most of the fattening junk foods she could find around, and yet, as she restocked the apartment where she lived alone, she often wondered by herself why she had so much junk food lying around...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As a couple of weeks passed, George finally started to see some real progress coming from this pet project of his. As night came, and he emerged from under her bed, he immediately noticed that Stacey had grown from the scrawny thing she had been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsleep in her bed, she appeared quite a bit chubbier than before, her face had actually a softer edge to it, as a hint of a second chin had begun to make its appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer whole body looked softer, as was shown by the tight undies she was still wearing. <br>\r\nA muffin top emerged from the small pair of tight panties on her hips, and just on top of it a little pot belly had begun to form clearing out a bit of her washboard abs. Her legs too had started to lose definition as cellulite was starting to appear all over her. All in all, she was growing along nicely and yet, for George, that wasn\u2019t even close to be enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTapping into her mind, to reinforce his commands to her, he saw that the dream she was in had changed, albeit slightly. She wasn\u2019t any more on a throne, laying instead on a sofa as a multitude of servants moved platters after platters all around her, completely surrounding her in an avalanche of decadent and delicious treats. As he wrapped up his orders to her mind, he quickly left the dream and returned to the real world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly he went through her kitchen, grabbing all he could move, going back and forward until an impressive hoard of junk food was lying at the foot of Stacey\u2019s bed. Only then he grabbed the contraption and began his work. Swiftly he pushed massive sheets cake into it, watching as they turned into the sludge that Stacey started to greedily guzzle down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he started with loads of donuts, quickly followed by handfuls upon handfuls of cookies. The flow coming from the tube began to grow rather fierce in its flow, and yet Stacey kept swallowing, as her stomach started to fill up, and yet it hadn\u2019t yet lifted the covers on her figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge knew that this was coming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeding her more not only increased her capacity but it also meant that she would need more food to reach her fullness point and beyond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, this didn\u2019t worry him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom cakes and sweets, he turned to fast foods, tearing apart bags from McDonald and Burger King, he began to shovel those into the funnel, always increasing the flow speed from the tube to Stacey\u2019s mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd still she moaned in pleasure. Still dreaming about delicacies, she had never tasted before entering her mouth without having her gain a single ounce. As morning approached, Stacey was lying in her bed, her stomach engorged to the fullest as it worked trying to digest the massive feast it had been filled with during the night. George was tired but happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, he had managed to stuff her full, and yet it was taking more and more time to do that. He needed to find a solution.<br>\r\nQuickly tapping into her mind he rapidly put into her the idea that she needed to sleep more, quickly forcing her to renounce to some daily activities to have a well-earned nap in the afternoon, right after lunch until just about before dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwiftly hiding within his lair, George could only wait what this new day was going to bring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Stacey woke up, late in the morning she felt kinda sluggish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was becoming more and more common for her to wake up feeling like that, although she couldn\u2019t fathom the reason for it. Still, slowly rising from her bed, she began moving toward the kitchen, without really noticing the hint of a waddle she was beginning to have in her step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling hungry, she quickly demolished a large breakfast of eggs, bacon and sausages, and yet, although she was usually content to have that as breakfast, that morning she felt differently. Quickly, she cooked some more, making a bit more than her previous plate as she slowly munched through some donuts that were lying around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she waited, she idly wondered from where this hunger was coming from and yet, as her mind had been tampered by George, she quickly dismissed the though, thinking about a late growth spurt or something. After clearing out six donuts, she prepared her second plate and rapidly chowed it down, making quick work of it. With such a massive breakfast weighing her down, Stacey hadn\u2019t really the will of standing up and go for her usual jog, choosing instead to simply stay there and rest, maybe watching some television as she recovered her energies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Stacey had no idea that this routine was going on since weeks. She was actually living a kind of lie on herself. She still thought of doing exercises and jogging when, in truth she had stopped since long time already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She was still considered Head Cheerleader although, her followers weren\u2019t being so friendly with her anymore. In truth, the other girls were rather enjoying having her around, they could make fun of her behind her back, as she still thought of being the thin and toned girl she had once been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day rolled off, with Stacey lounging around her apartment, heavily snacking throughout all morning, lunchtime arrived and yet, the girl didn\u2019t seem touched by the fact that she had done nothing apart from snacking all day long. As Lunchtime rolled in, she made herself a massive feast of fast food burgers and fries, including at the end a few slices of cakes ordered from the same place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey quickly demolished her lunch, making quick work of the massive burgers she had ordered. As she gave bite after bite she seemed to be in a trance, eating all that there was in front of her, without worrying about what all that junk food was going to do to her figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBite after bite, as specks of food began to fall on her own clothes, she kept munching as her eyes rolled back in her head as pleasure filled her to her very core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she swallowed the last morsel from the table, she exhaled out a long breath of exhaustion. Slowly, as she remained seated, her hands began to massage her vast, stuffed stomach with slow concentric movements. Her gut was now pushing out of her for at least one foot, the tee she was wearing having rolled up to her breast, acting more as a makeshift bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she burped a bit, releasing some trapped gas, she slowly rose from her chair, feeling sleepy and yet content. As she slowly waddled toward her bedroom, she had a smile on her face, feeling satisfied now that she had a full belly. Now that lunch was over, she wanted nothing else but have a good ap before tacking down the afternoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she settled on her bed though, she quickly fell in a deep restorative sleep.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs she slept, George the monster emerged. He was ready to continue stuffing her up. He had to fill her up as much as he could, no matter how long it would take him to do that. When he looked at her, at her already swollen and stuffed belly, not a single thought of mercy came to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe simply grabbed whatever he could from the cupboards, and the fridge, in the kitchen, and began using the contraption he had modified to fill her up even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA month passed in such a way, Stacey had done a lot of growing. Not anymore, even by a longshot, considered in shape, she had become fat. So much in fact that, lately she had even started getting stuck in her own doorways, naturally at that first occurrence something in her mind tried to warn her about the dangers she was in but, thanks to George tampering she quickly forgot all about the incident, and by the next one, she didn\u2019t let herself be phased by it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>It\u2019s normal</i>\u2019 she repeated to herself. \u2018<i>The doorframe must have shrunk with the heat of the last few days\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to the constant nightly feedings and, the additional ones in the afternoon, what had once been a smoking hot cheerleader, had been transformed into a glazed ham of a girl. Her overall form had softened up a lot, her face had lost completely her angular features, becoming instead softer, as her cheeks bloated out and a second chin was now firmly present over her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms and torso had equally fattened up, the first growing some small bingo wings, which jiggled slightly when she moved, while the latter had increased itself in size massively. Her breasts were now huge, wobbly, masses of fat. Easily larger than her own hand, she had been forced to buy specific bras to keep them in check. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gut now it had thickened significantly, dividing itself into two massive belly rolls which cascaded in front of her, covering her crotch and part of her thighs. Yet, as big as it was, it wasn\u2019t enough to be visible from her as her breast were still covering it. Her lower body had thickened too, her hips and ass had gotten full of cellulite, and those specifically where often the reason for her to get stuck into doorways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, Stacey was blind to all this. George playing her mind as if it was a book where he could write her entire life, forced her to ignore all these changes, living as she did, still believing to be the sexiest woman around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had been another major change in her lifestyle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the long sleeping times she thought of having the need for, her academic career was going down into the gutter. Her votes were getting lower and lower and her Cheerleading training was mostly abandoned. Her teammates, even though wanted to still have her around, to have her mocked by all, were seriously getting worried that sooner she was going to leave the team and college altogether...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Specifically, into a hallway which had the floor made of gold, the walls of dripping lava and the ceiling made with the skulls of countless humanz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he found himself there, he knew immediately that his summoning wasn\u2019t going to be one he would forget soon. For only one being in all of Hell had a corridor toward his office made in that way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that being was none other than Satan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately fearful of what was going to befall on him, George slowly began walking toward the only door he could see toward the end of the corridor. A massive, double door made of an ebon stone which was unavailable in the Mortal Realm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he entered the room he began trembling in sheer terror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been expected to see the very own Hellish lord on his throne, sitting there amused and yet there were two figures standing at the Lord sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt his right, clad in its massive spiked armor, stood Asteroth. Once the Commander of all Hellish armies, he was now acting as a Security head honcho. The massive Demon looked down onto George, his snarl of, barely repressed, pent up rage, enough to make all the scales on his reptilian body clatter in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpposite to him, sat Belfagor. Once known as the Lord of the Whispers, Belfagor had become the main advisor of their ruler, always ready to serve Him, and the direct Boss of George.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween these two heavyweights, George felt tiny like an insect. Yet, what left him on the ground, pawing at his torso in fear was the central figure. The Demon Lord of all, Satan. Although, it seemed that said Lord had decided to use one of his most unused shapes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor, sitting behind a mahogany desk, there was no winged, red skinned monster. But a sharp dressed, horn headed lady. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuciferia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis, apparently tiny woman, was just a fragment of the personalities that filled Satan and made him the Hellish Lord he was. And yet, if one were foolish enough to look into her eyes, he would have seen the swirling flames that resided there and that confirmed she was not an ordinary demoness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>George Guluptarutil. Do you know why you\u2019ve been summoned here? A month, in the mortal realm has already passed and yet\u2026no sign of the dark energies you were supposed to collect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe have been informed of what had befallen onto you. We know what you thought you had to do to complete the mission given to you. We know how it all ended up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, We had decided to give you a second chance. Knowing full well that you, among a few others, are one of a small group which doesn\u2019t\u2019 surrender before the challenges given to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd still\u2026you seemed to have lost yourself.</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she talked, George, knew where they were going to go with the discussion. He had failed. Again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this time there were no excuses for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf their Lord and Master was in a good mood, he may be only be declassed back to be an imp\u2026if she didn\u2019t decide to have him suffer for all eternity. As these scenarios came to his mind, he fell on his forepaws, offering himself in total submission to the demoness. He had fucked up himself on his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had given him a second chance and he had blew it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, thoughts of Stacey growing meatier and wider under his eyes, made it so that he could go without remorse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>I see\u2026even in these circumstances you can think only of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is only one thing, then\u2026that we can say to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCONGRATULATIONS!</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Arch-Demoness spoke, she rose from her desk, swiftly imitated by her two advisors, as she began to clap her hands toward George. The monster could only stare in disbelief as She kept clapping, congratulating herself with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>We can understand your confusion but, you will soon see that it is deserved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sent to the Mortal Realm to scare young Stacey and to bring us a few ounces of dark energies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, with your\u2026unusual approach, what has arrived to us has been liters upon liters of pure, undiluted, sin. Gluttony, to be precise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou singlehandedly managed to provide more energy in a month than all of your co-workers together in a year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could We, not be pleased by this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor this reason, We have decided to give you a different assignment, and position, into the Mortal Realm. From now on you shan\u2019t be a Monster no more\u2026From today you will become a Demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHereby, We, the Lords of Hell, rename you Gorge, the Demon of Feedings.</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Luciferia pronounced the name, George felt himself surrounded by a powerful whirlwind of magic, dark matter entering into his body, changing him down to a molecular level. His scaly body grew larger and wider, rows of muscles ready to spring in action right under his scales. Wings sprouted from behind his back, folding neatly behind him until they formed a cape on his shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Heed Our Commands, Gorge! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGo forth into the Mortal Realm, feed those pathetic humanz, make them grow, make them glut themselves, and when they\u2019ll be at their top, take their souls from them and fill Hell with their lamenting screams! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUse your powers to have them beg at your mercy, glut them so much that they could not live without stuffing themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGo now, make Us proud!</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the reborned Gorge left the throne room, he still couldn\u2019t believe what had happened. He had been changed into a Demon. Him! A lowly Under-bed Monster.<br>\r\nStill, the thought of being able now to cater even more to Stacey filled him with a joy without equal and, already a manic laughter was emerging from his throat when, suddenly, Belfagor appeared in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChocking the laughter in his throat, Gorge bowed low to his Boss and Master. Although now a Demon, he still was nothing compared to the Demon Lord standing in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b><i>I see that the Power hasn\u2019t corrupted you\u2026yet, George\u2026I mean, Gorge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, I appreciate the reverence towards me and so I will share with you a little advice. <br>\r\nBeware of your hedonistic pleasures. They saved you, this time, by a stroke of luck and much\u2026convincing done on my part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t care if you want to focus on your Humanz pet, but keep the sins flowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor this, considering your promotion, I believe that you may need a hand in the Mortal realms.</i></b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Demon Lord said that a small figurine appeared from beneath the ground, summoned by command of Belfagor. The creature was a smallish thing, no larger than a cat, and yet it possessed a strength that could rival any heavily trained human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b><i>This, is an Imp, Gorge. A troop of them will be assigned to you to command. They will obey to your orders and follow them as best as they can. Still, you will need to lead them for as strong as they are\u2026they aren\u2019t so bright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis one is named \u2018Creep\u2019. He will follow you into the Mortal Realm, along with his troop of fifteen soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUse them well, Gorge. Make the Gluttony sin flow like never before.</i></b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gorge returned to his lair, he saw that also that had changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf before it was similar to a grotto, resembling the bed where he was used to be hiding, now it appeared as a rich and lavish room, with a throne in the back of it. Everywhere he looked upon, there were the most expensive looking decorations, crates and chests made of gold, and filled with it, tapestries of platinum and silver. And in the middle of it all, there was he, with his employees right behind him. Turning around he saw that while they were small, these Imps seemed to be ready to execute whatever orders he wished them to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, before giving them any instruction, Gorge, decided to take Creep along with him, to show him how to proceed by letting him see what he was going to do to Stacey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAware that it was late evening and that Stacey had already retired to her bed, since the ceiling of his lair had reduced its height considerably, Gorge emerged from under the girl bed and marveled at Stacey\u2019s size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she had gone one day without being stuffed senseless, it seemed to him that she had managed to stuff herself pretty decently on her own. With Creep sitting on his shoulder, Gorge entered her mind and began to see what she had done in the previous day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he relived her memories, he saw ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yet, that morning she was starving. Rising quickly as possible, due to her girth, she waddled toward her kitchen, where she began scouring the cupboards for anything edible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapidly, she placed a few pop tarts into the microwave, heating them up, while grabbing a frying pan in order to fry up something for her breakfast. Delving into the fridge, she quickly took a bar of butter, using more than a third of it to fill a massive sandwich she wanted to make to have something to eat as she cooked her real breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFilling the sandwich with jam and honey, adding onto it a quite thick layer of sugar for good measure, she grabbed the oil and began to fill the pan with it. Giving a bite to the sandwich, moaning in pleasure by the sweet taste of it, she quickly placed a dozen sausages into the pan, letting them fry, as she scoured the fridge again in search of something to go with the sausages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was searching her eyes lit up when she saw that half a pound of bacon strips seemed to be sitting idly on one of the shelves. Smiling, as a bit of drool escaped her lips, she grabbed them and quickly began tossing them into the pan, as she took out the sausages that were now perfectly done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she kept frying sausages and the bacon strips, she quickly filled two bowls of cereals with whole milk and added for safety measure also a couple spoons of sugar to the mix, all the while eating the heated pop tarts and cleaning out her sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, it took her almost an hours to finish preparing everything and yet, as she surveyed her table, seeing that there were fried sausages and bacon strips, along with two bowls of cereals, she decided in the need to just order some take away for her breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>It\u2019s too much of a hassle to prepare everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI need my calories to have energy for the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet\u2019s see\u2026Ah-ha! McDonalds does finally take away! I\u2019ll just pick something to tide me over\u2026</i>\u2019  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, Stacey finally sat at her breakfast table, cleaning it from the fried sausages and bacons she prepared, while grazing also on the four, supersized, pounder burgers combo menus. Bite after bite, her belly began to fill up with delicious food, while her hunger barely was chipped. Stacey, gotten used to feel pretty much stuffed all the time, didn\u2019t see anything wrong in keep on eating and so, as she was half through her massive meal, she didn\u2019t see anything wrong in ordering something else from the Fast food joint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis trend kept going up to midday, it was only then after having had doubled her first order of food, that she finally rose from the table, deciding to hit the couch for some TV, as she thought to herself that after a brief nap she was going to go jogging around the block. Although her best intentions, as she sat down on the couch, she quickly fell into sort of half sleep, as she barely watched what was on screen, while grazing on a couple boxes of donuts from the day before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGorge, watching intently her memories, smiled widely seeing as her target was able to fill herself on her own in such a delicious way and, while keeping watch, he pretty much explained the situation to his servant, making sure he understood that they were there not to scare the lady but to stuff her up with as much food possible, without hurting her or making her sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs lunch time approached Stacey seemed to wake up on her own, just as if she had an internal alarm ready to go. Slowly rising from the couch, believing of having just returned from her morning jog, she waddled ponderously to the kitchen but, instead of preparing herself a meal she just relapsed in the easier way of ordering take out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a worry, she quickly ordered from several restaurants, ending up with her kitchen stuffed full of all kinds of meals. Her table was literally covered in food. There were containers of Chinese noodles, a couple of pizza\u2019s, the ever presents burger menu\u2019s combos and even a few short cakes for dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking her lips, Stacey began to delve into her massive meal, although she had had a massive breakfast not more than a couple of hours ago, she still felt herself starving , so she didn\u2019t see anything wrong in cleaning out the massive, smorgasbord, quantities of junk foods and sweets that currently occupied her table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapidly, she began cleaning out the containers of Chinese foods, clearing out with ease several of them, without batting an eyelash, still hungry after that, she began to clear out the pizza\u2019s alternating them with bites on her burgers, and even handfuls of fries. The more she ate, the more her belly began to bloat out, forcing the massive t-shirt she used normally as PJ, to rise and rise until it completely left her swollen gut out of its cover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey didn\u2019t notice any of this, all her focus was on the next course she was going to have. Still, eating so much and so fast, took its toll, forcing her to lay back on her chair, as she started to grow tired with the simple effort of moving her arms up and down so often. Even though at a slower rate, she still grabbed the next two slices of her pizza, placing them on top of the other, and giving it a massive bite. As she chewed, she moaned slowly in her throat, as the grease and the cheese of the pie covered her taste buds letting her enjoy the delicious taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was early in the afternoon, when she managed to clean out the last, of three, shortcakes from her table. Feeling finally stuffed full, she slowly rose from the table, belching and burping away, as her massive lunch began to be digested, and slowly thundered toward her bedroom where she was going to have her nap, as she was now used to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Gorge interrupted the connection, returning to his physical form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood there, watching intently how the girl had grown, and grown indeed she had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey was currently showing a cute double chin, while her face had softened all over. Her overall body shape had inflated tremendously, with her breasts growing of at least a couple of cups more than what she was used to,  as shown by the overworked bra she was still wearing, which squished the boobs together, forcing a lot of them out of its tight confines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly then, a huge, dome shaped, mound which even though she was laying down, still managed to cover her crotch with its last belly roll. And how could Gorge forget about her ass and legs, the first one had grown massive, juicer and softer than a badonkadonk, it even pushed her up slightly when she was on her back. Her legs, once thin and toned, now were large as tree trunks, up to her calves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, thanks to his assistance, what had once been a stunningly lithe and toned cheerleader, was now a massive cow, grazing food at all times, getting fattened up continuously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, since it was night, Gorge decided to not waste anymore time and quickly ordered his servant to summon his people. Creep, loyal imp he was, tweeted loudly in demonic language, so to not wake up the woman which his Master was working on, and quickly a dozens or so of his compatriots, appeared out of nowhere, standing still awaiting orders, as two of them moved forward, joining Creep, bowing down in front of the newly appointed demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Mashter! These are your troops! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am Sargent Creep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese two are my subordinates. Corporal Freak and Corporal Prick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe await your commands, Mashter!</i>\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nQuickly, Gorge relayed his order to his small troop of servants, standing back to observe how they worked. He saw that they were perfectly organized, as they moved around the bed, slowly climbing it and the girl on it, until they were pretty much all over her. It was then that Gorge was surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had expected them to scrub the kitchen clean, taking food out of it and moving it toward Stacey. Instead, some of the little imps, seemed to conjure food out of thin air, feeding it to Stacey as she slept, while others were all around her, massaging and kneading her fat, making so that the experience was going to be as enjoyable as possible for the lady. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreep, stationed near Stacey\u2019s head, made sure that the girl didn\u2019t wake up, forcing her to rest, with a strong sleeping suggestion. As he did so he turned, once in a while, to check on his soldiers, seeing that they seemed rather taken with this new kind of task. Freak and Prick, taking turns, were currently busy, pushing pastries upon pastries toward Stacey\u2019s mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, they had to push a little but, as more food was shoveled down her throat, the girl seemed to enjoy the treatment and began to eat in earnest, quickly swallowing anything the little imps conjured. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gorge, sitting nearby, watched amazed at how the little demons carried on their work but, he realized, that if he wanted to have better results with Stacey, he had to find a way to intervene more directly in her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he mulled it over, he realized that while he had always occupied her night by stuffing her senselessly, he still missed a major portion of her time during the day. As he pondered on this, he slowly put himself into a trance, as he scanned his new powers in search of something that he could use at his advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Shrinking form? Nah\u2026Invisibility? It may have its uses\u2026Food Summoning? Hell yeah\u2026but not in this case. Mind Bending? Good but, not enough\u2026Ah-Ha!

Gorge did similarly, but not before touching Stacey\u2019s mind and applying some changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the incoming day, he was going to have his fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a brand-new day for Stacey, as she woke up feeling once more starving and yet, not as starved as she had felt the day before. As she slowly rose from her bed, ignoring the ominous creaks coming from it, she massaged happily her hefty gut, already dreaming about the delicious breakfast she was soon going to have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she waddled from her room to her bathroom, to freshen up, she found herself thinking about her life. She had been Head Cheerleader for such a long time, even during high school she already had been the leader of the cheerleaders, and yet, lately she was starting to feel dissatisfied with this role. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reasons, she didn\u2019t seem to find it any more enjoyable to participate in all the activities, the games, the practices. As she reached the bathroom she gazed long and hard in her mirror, posing in front of it, basking in what she saw reflected.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nStacey, still under Gorge mind manipulations, was still unable to see herself as she really was. Her deluded mind projected her back an image of herself almost 100 lbs less, than she currently was. She grabbed her boobs, seeing them reflected into the mirror as the perky soft mounds she knew, while in truth the perkiness was slowly vanishing as her massive breasts were growing bigger and fatter day after day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she admired herself, while freshening, she thought about her busy schedule for the day, the cheer practices, the studying, her need to go to the gym. And yet, although these thoughts dampened her mood a little, as soon as she smelled the aromas of breakfast coming from the kitchen, all those thoughts vanished, replaced by her need to fill herself up with some scrumptious chow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling out of the bathroom, wearing her usual PJ t-Shirt, she closed in toward the kitchen but did not enter, laying slowly against the doorframe as she drank in the beauty of the figure that was currently busy at the stove. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey, to be sincere, had sometimes moments where she would almost freak out as she saw the masculine figure in her house but, as she thought about, she just laughed at herself. She rationalized that since it was so recent that he had moved in, she had yet to get used to his presence around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was none other than George Live, her longtime boyfriend which had recently moved from their hometown to be with her. Even though they didn\u2019t spend so much time together, since she was so busy with college, he still was extremely supportive of her and her activities and did his best to help her throughout the day.  Leaving the doorframe, she waddled closer to him, until she hugged him from behind, burying herself into his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Aw, sweetie\u2026you woke up. I wanted to bring you breakfast in bed, today\u2026</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, George, but I\u2019ve got a pretty busy day today\u2026Still, loving you for the nice thought.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge, hugging back Stacey, grinned within himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the best plan he had ever thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiding his Demonic ascents within the human body, he could follow, and fatten up, Stacey way more easily than before. Especially since his minions were still around, invisible to the mortal\u2019s eyes, and already at work to make sure that Stacey would move the less possible. As she let go and sat at the table, one of the little imps quickly moved closer to her a plate that had been already filled with donuts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith such sweet treats so close to her, even though breakfast was incoming soon, the girl couldn\u2019t resist as she began to have one after the other, enjoying immensely the sweet taste of them. As she quickly was polishing the plate, here came George bringing her a massive plate, filled with a large stack of six pancakes, smothered in butter and syrup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Here you go, baby. Have a taste and tell me how they are, while I finish preparing your breakfast.</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, eagerly swallowing the last of the donut, she grabbed knife and fork and took a generous helping from her plate, moaning in pleasure as she savored the fluffy and sweetened pancakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026These are so good! You\u2019ve gotta\u2026*oomph* teach me the recipe\u2026*gulp*\u2026 one of these days\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey made quick work of the pancakes but, just as she was swallowing the last morsel, George appeared at her side, leaving under her nose a plate full of bacon strips and sausages, deeply fried, another plate with a mound of ten or so chocolate covered waffles and a last platter filled with icing covered brownies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Enjoy sweetie, more is coming\u2026</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey just nodded as she breathed in all those tasty looking snacks. Licking her lips, she began to eat, taking morsels from each plate, she barely took notice that George had appeared at her side, leaving beside her three tall looking milkshakes, while giving her a peck on the cheek. The girl was so engrossed in her food that nothing else mattered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouthful after mouthful, the plates began to be less and less filled, while her gut stretched out more and more, until it started to push directly against the table. Still, Stacey didn\u2019t stop. Completely lost in her eating frenzy, she kept cleaning plate after plate, almost uncaring toward what she was eating, as long as food was available to be consumed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, although her appetite had been well trained in the past month, she had limits, nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pushed a last forkful of cake within her lips, she crumbled against the back of her seat, her stomach angrily grumbling, as it had been stuffed way too much and yet, a smile was on her face as she munched and then swallowed her last morsel. George, quickly moved beside her, helping her stand and move toward the couch, all the while complimenting her about her figure and her determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey, slowly waddling from the kitchen, welcomed with open arms the presence of the couch and, shortly after, she was in a deep digestive sleep, as George stood there watching her, anxiously waiting for her to outgrow her current PJ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<b>I just cannot wait for her to grow bigger than this shirt\u2026 Still, that won\u2019t be the last of your growth, my sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a much higher target to be reached.</b>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, as the thoughts of a growing Stacey filled his mind, other less pleasant thoughts came to him. In particular, the irate expression of his Demon Lord, Belfagor, reminding him to provide more and more Liquified Sin for his brothers in Hell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing this, as much as he wanted to stay beside Stacey, he recognized the need to go out in the world to spread the gluttony all around the humanz living nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving a quick note for Stacey, explaining he had left to buy some groceries, he left the house and began wandering around. As he explored the district they were living in, he quickly scanned plenty of potential targets for him to focus upon, to give Hell what they wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end he restricted his mental list to a few possibilities, deciding to focus for the time being to a few selected targets, instead of going full out on anyone he had met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\tCollege Council, getting them to join into the Sin of Gluttony could quickly spread the sin throughout the institute, but could also attract unwanted attentions<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\tThe cheering squad could be a perfect target for him to go after, if fattened up they could quickly become gluttons like Stacey, helping to spread the gluttony around while still being into the shadows<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\t \u2018Plastic Girls\u2019, having the trend setter girls into the school could make it so that fat will be seen as the new trendy thing to do<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\tRestaurant owner near the college, spreading gluttony and weight gain one meal at the time<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not only, in doing so, he could force on the entire campus new regulations to better spread the Gluttony around but, by having the entire administration in his grasp he could also have the possibility to make connections with other colleges circles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing his powers, he began to move closer and closer to each member of the College Council, slowly influencing them, turning their minds from the good of their students, to the primal need of having them fall prey of his Sin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a slow and arduous process, slowed even more by his need to stay beside his Stacey and yet, in a few weeks, he already had tampered with each member of the council, changing them into what he needed them to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the month, as Stacey kept growing larger and larger, followed primarily by the gremlins, Gorge was finally inside the head of the entire council and could finally make his move to have the local College apply the new rules he had concocted in order to reach his goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne morning, as he moved silently through the halls of the university, he quickly reached the meeting room where the council had called for an extraordinary meeting, so that he could personally follow and, if case was to arise, motivate each of the member of the council to his plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was squared and had a massive mahogany rounded table in the middle, all around this table ten people sat, sharply dressed and with plenty of notes and charts placed on the surface of the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese people were right in the middle of a debate as Gorge entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe current councilor speaking was debating with one of his colleagues about the true need of issuing new health regulation around the campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026I get your point, Sarah, but are we sure that our College needs to proclaim to the world that we are going to raise a ruckus about body shaming? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat good could come out of this, for our College?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, I\u2019ve told you already but, let me briefly refresh you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, we would be seen, as a college, as the first to take into consideration the growing issue of body shaming within the student body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond, by letting some private companies to open their establishments within the campus, we would generate additional income that will benefit both the college structure and the services we can provide to our students. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThird, as a College council, seeing us issue new mandates and regulation about the Health of our student body can only generate positive reviews on this council, thus granting us more power to issue definite responses to any kind of issue that could arise within the College grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThink about it, with a few, well applied and constructed regulation we could have a more peaceful setting within our grounds, for both the teachers and the student body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor sure, I don\u2019t need you to remind last year incident of the City parade. Precisely of the actions that a certain group of students took to sabotage the parade, with all the negative reviews we received for our inability to stop them before it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, we need these new regulations implemented, as fast as we can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the debate seemed to carry on, the Rector raised his hands, taking the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSarah, we all understand your points and, by the forecasting examples you\u2019ve previously shown to us we can agree that we all will gain from following your, and your team, suggestion but, what kind of regulations you are exactly talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rector said that, Gorge moved silently behind him, influencing his mind more, making him more receptive toward the idea of a fattened-up student body being a calmer, more peaceful mass of usually hyperactive kids with a mean streak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah Johnson, the woman that had fallen the most for Gorge influence, took again the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are suggesting implementing a schedule for a more Healthy approach toward life in the Campus, to teach our students that a healthy body is a sane body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor example, a mandatory four meals per day plan within the Campus, including Breakfast, Lunch, Afternoon Meal and Dinner, granting some extended time at such mealtimes in order to facilitate the student\u2019s acceptance of a proper diet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother example is an application of the portion size and meal consistency, enforcing into our students the need to have a proper balanced diet of all foodtypes. Granting students possibility to have a snack during class, as is well known that attention span tends to vanish after hours of long lectures.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the woman kept talking, each of the member of the council began to silently nod in approval until, as the woman was going to propose a new example, the Rector raised his hand once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Sarah. I believe that is with the unanimous approval of this council that we give you the assignment of carrying on with these new Healthy regulations to be applied within the Campus, but I must add that not only the students body should follow said rules. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we are the representative of the College, we too must lead by example.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSession adjourned.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the session dwindled to an end, Gorge quickly implanted more and more of his plans onto the weak minds of the humanz surrounding him, quickly reinforcing within each of them the need to have this plan come true. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the following days, a widespread campaign began to make its appearance in the campus grounds, huge posters promoting a healthier approach to life in College, as lists of the new regulations and mandatory rules to be followed were slowly distributed within the grounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first the students didn\u2019t seem particularly happy about these new rules but, as more and more private companies made their appearance with their establishments in the college grounds and, with the realization from the student body of the advantages of following the newly prescribed rules, soon all of the student body began to quietly follow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGorge, as he roamed aimlessly throughout the campus could already see that the new regulations were starting to have an effect and yet, everyone seemed to be happy enough that nobody raised any real ruckus about the current Healthy regulations.<br>\r\nBut those were only the steppingstones for a wider plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the new rules were accepted and more cash began to enter into the treasury of the College administration, all council members began to apply some variants to the original regulations, forcing the students body to follow the guidelines, without any real clue of what would happen to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of months after, for example, since the start of the Healthy living campaign, the mandatory meals had increased to six per day, forcing students to have at least two courses at each mealtime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, since the entirety of the student body had by now grown used to have four meals a day, adding a few more wasn\u2019t seen as a major issue. As these changes started to appear as the new normalcy, the Campus grounds began to change also in other aspect of the common life of the average student.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlastic girls and bullies within the grounds dropped drastically, especially since a new trend seemed to appear in all classes. The larger size of the average person wasn\u2019t anymore object of ridiculousness, but instead something that everyone seemed to actively try to reach at their own pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As Gorge saw these changes within the campus, he could see that some students, and even a few faculty members, already were showing great promises of their fall into the mindless gluttony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, in his eyes, the first place could only go to his first love, Stacey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe once toned and lithe Cheerleader had completely fallen into mindless hedonistic gluttony. Thanks to his troop of Gremlins, and his continuous support, she had grown steadily for the past months, getting fatter and fatter with no sign of stopping. As he was currently cooking for her midnight meal, he only needed to turn his head to look back to see how glorious he had managed to let her become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey was currently seated on two reinforced chairs, having already had the experience of reducing normal chairs into splinters with her own massive weight. She sat there, shoveling food into her maw, barely tasting whatever was in front of her, fueled only by the almost endless hunger she was now constantly feeling at every hour of the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer needing excuses to or justification to stuff herself with fattening food, Stacey had recently begun to live in her own little world made of eating and the need to feel stuffed full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing at almost six hundred pounds, with an almost ruined academy career she was a few steps away from having to drop down the college, and yet this didn\u2019t even faze her. All she needed was her lover with her\u2026and tons of food to fill her hungry belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ex-cheerleader had ballooned massively in those months of constant indulging, barely able to walk on her own, with her legs resembling more pillars of jelly like flesh, her arms having grown so massive she was barely able to move them unaided. Her breasts, having grown grotesquely huge, losing any hint of perkiness as they sloshed in the massive custom sized bra she was wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, her belly and ass, the first was gargantuan, pushing ahead of her of at least two feet, if not more, preventing her to see what could be standing in front of her, and the latter being so massive and wide that even double doors were starting to get a tight fit for her to passing through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGorge couldn\u2019t be prouder of her and, already, he had plans for her to grow to even greater heights, all the while helping his plan of spreading around the Gluttony to all those surrounding them\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>King Kong had been the ruler of Skull Island for a long time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for such a long time he had imposed his rules to any beast and creature that lived there with him. He was aware of the tiny little beings that had built the wooden mountain to protect themselves and he always had accepted their offerings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the last offering they had given him had been different from the rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time it was a terrified little thing, a tiny little creature like no other he had ever seen. For some reason, this little creature, while being afraid of him, was also fascinated with him. He often caught it staring at himself not with fear but, with curiosity. It was such a new feeling that he decided to keep it with himself, although it was so different with him, maybe he wouldn\u2019t feel so alone with her at his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn Darrow was utterly terrified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst being kidnapped by those tribesmen and then given as a sacrificial offering to that massive monster. She had really thought she was going to die then and there. And yet, the monster had plucked her from the palisade and brought her through the forest up to his cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she tried to run off, to escape from there as she wanted to reunite with her friends but, seeing as the island was full of mortal dangers and that the monster had come back to save her, she decided to wait her friends there. The beast, although as big as a building, did not seem completely savage. She had noticed that it always had seemed rather delicate when it was handling her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, and she thought that this idea was coming from her fear addled mind, the creature, Kong, seemed rather intrigued by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a few days passed, she did notice that Kong was getting rather affectionate toward her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe, she didn\u2019t notice that she had stopped thinking about him as a \u2018it\u2019, couldn\u2019t talk obviously but there was almost no need for it. It was as if she could understand what he wanted from her simply by looking at his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn could see a deep sadness into those eyes and, it was probably due to that, that the situation evolved with her no longer a prisoner but, more of a guest. Being a guest, when Kong wasn\u2019t around, she began exploring his lair. After her first attempts at escape, he had moved her to a cave atop one of the tallest mountain on the isle. With nothing better to do she explored it quite a bit, managing to find loads of bones from previous offerings and even a few items from her own world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she found a mangled and torn jacket, she smiled within herself as she found an old lighter into one of the pockets. That night, as Kong returned, she managed to make him slowly approach to the concept of fire. As she did so, she realized, more than before, that the monster was more like a little child of immense strength.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, one problem seemed to arise quickly. She was starving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, he had brought her some fruits, actually a man-sized mountain of it, but try as she might, she couldn\u2019t stomach it. She ate those fruits with gusto but, she never managed to digest them. Feeling weaker and weaker, she tried to let him understand that she was in need of something more substantial, something that could give her energies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBe it that Kong managed to understand, or sheer luck, the following day he returned to his lair, laying atop of one of the tallest mountains, bringing with him a chunk as big as his hand of some kind of meat. Ann, as much as her hunger drove her toward the massive piece of meat, she managed to restrain herself and, using the lighter managed to get started a little fire over which she cooked some of the meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell coming from it not only made Ann\u2019s stomach rumble, but it also attracted Kong, as he curiously peered toward the little pet he had grown so attached, watching it as it played with the bright thing that created warm and burned. Motionlessly, he stared as his little pet place some of the meat he had brought over the bright warm thing and got immediately curious as the meat began to change in smell, becoming rather more interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ann finished cooking the piece of meat she had managed to carve from the massive chunk he had brought, she noticed that Kong was curious about it. Smiling, as if she was with a friend, and not a monster that had captured her, she offered the cooked meat to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive ape saw that his little pet was giving him what it had made but, he also knew that the pet was starving. For this reason he sat down near her, tearing a chunk of raw meat and began eating. Ann, notice Kong starting to eat and so she too did the same. As she gave a bite to the slab of cooked meat, she moaned in pleasure. This was just what she needed. As soon as she had cleared the slab of meat, she quickly began cooking a couple more, one for herself since she was still pretty hungry\u2026but the others were for her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving almost forgotten who she was and where she was, she wanted to have him taste cooked food, trying, without really knowing, to make him more humane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKong had to admit that having decided to take care of that tiny pet was one of the best decisions he\u2019d ever had. Not only it seemed to be able to understand him, so he didn\u2019t feel lonely anymore, but it also proved to be rather intelligent, for a thing of that size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meat he had always eaten raw was good but, that same meat placed on the bright warm thing was somewhat better. Knowing this, and with the help of his pet, Kong began to learn, by trial and error, how to make the meat of his preys tastier. With that knowledge learned, he decided to make a surprise to his pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost two weeks since he had taken the little pet with him, in that time he had found a few creatures similar to his pet lurking around his lair but he managed to scare them off or kill them, when he managed to capture them. Still, he wanted to make a surprise to his pet and so, after having battled one of those big lizards, he grabbed it and brought it over the only other thing that he knew was bright, warm and burned. <br>\r\nDragging the corpse to the Volcano hadn\u2019t been really easy but, as he used a tree as he had seen the pet doing, he began to let the massive corpse roast slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn those weeks he had done his best to learn how to make the meat tastier over the bright warm thing and now he wanted to show off his prowess to his pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting late, the sun was vanishing behind the horizon and yet, Ann had seemingly forgotten of being there as a prisoner, or of her friends that were probably still searching for her. As the sun set, she could only worry about Kong. He had been so gentle, and she had real fun in teaching him how to cook meat over the fire, although she was not an expert at all. Still, Kong had seemed rather interested in learning, or maybe she was just getting delusional about the whole situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had heard him roar that same morning, several times in fact, and since he didn\u2019t seem to be coming back already she was fearing the worst. That was until she felt the breeze change direction and a new smell came to her. It was the smell of cooked meat but, it was so powerful that she wondered if the forest at the base of the mountain was actually burning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, suddenly, Kong appeared in front of her, leaving right in front of her widened eyes a massive dead dinosaur. As she watched the carcass with the weak fire she had made, she realized that the smell of cooked meat was coming right from that corpse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking closely she saw that the thing skin was frazzled and burned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked she turned her amazed stare at the massive ape beside her. Kong saw that his pet seemed rather happy and he was feeling just the same. Still, he motioned her to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew that his pet had been starving and so, with this gift he wanted it to grow big and strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn, helping herself with a rough cutting stone, took out a chunk of meat out of the massive corpse and, although a bit worried, she gave it a big bite. Once again, the taste of that meat was divine against her taste buds, rapidly she polished the chunk she had taken but, seeing as Kong still pushed her a bit toward the corpse she realized that he had brought that only for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Does he really think I can eat all this on my own?</i>\u2019 she though worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, seeing as Kong was staring at her, she quickly began taking chunks out of the carcass, making sure to avoid the internal organs of the thing. After a while though, feeling full to burst, she collapsed on her back, her stomach bloated to maximum capacity, having burst out of the camisole she had been wearing up to that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw Kong peer at her curious, but all she could do was make circular motion atop of her belly, as she slowly drifted to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKong, seeing as his pet fell asleep, quickly took part of the carcass for himself, enjoying the flavor of it, while promising himself to bring as many as these gifts to his pet. In his animal mind, if his pet was that small it was only because it did not eat enough. So, the only logical solution was to have his pet eat more, so that one day Kong was going to have his pet as big as he was. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This way of thinking came mostly from the extremely good treatment that she was getting from Kong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humongous Ape had truly taken her in sympathy, as she saw it, for each and every day, sometime even multiple times each day, he brought her something cooked for her to eat. Since the episode with the massive dinosaur, he seemed to realize that she couldn\u2019t eat all that much and so he had started to bring her treats of smaller size.  Although, this created a new problem all of its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day for example, as the sun shined right above their heads, Kong had brought to her a four hundred pounds tiger or something like that. She noticed that he had brought her the carcass without \u2018cooking\u2019 it first, as if he wanted to have her approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe naturally complimented him for the catch but, before he could bring it away to be \u2018cooked\u2019 she motioned him to wait. At first, he didn\u2019t seem to understand but, as she signed with her hands, he remembered that she had done similar gestures when she had thought him of the bright warm thing. Interested, Kong waited as he began to see that his pet was doing something to the meal, he had brought to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn, still no more a survivalist as any other woman of her times, knew that with all the fur covering it, that tiger like thing couldn\u2019t just be cooked over a fire. So, using her roughly sharpened stone she tried again and again until she managed to remove the fur and the skin from the carcass, all of her motions always being observed by Kong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the animal skinned, although roughly so, Ann brought some pieces of it over the fire, leaving them to cook, as much as she could at least. The ape was not sure why his pet worked so hard on that prey but considering the results with the meat over the bright warm thing, he was willing to try and emulate what he had just seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the time being, since he wanted to surprise anew his pet, Kong brought back to her large chunks of meat already warmed. As he watched her eat those chunks, hearing her throaty sounds of satisfaction, he was feeling something akin to satisfaction. His pet was not one of his own, but, as he had observed it he was starting to realize that it seemed to be a miniature copy of him, with much less fur. So, he decided to do all he could to keep it happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn, as days passed with these constant feasts noticed that her clothes seemed to be tighter on her body than she remembered but, considering she had bigger things to worry about, she quickly dismissed that thought for a later time. Then, after one of the cooked meals provided to her by Kong, she suddenly noticed that after eating her \u2018lunch\u2019 she had been nibbling one of the few fruits that Kong had brought to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same that at first, she didn\u2019t seem able to digest. As she kept consuming it with little bites, she began to believe that probably her body had began adjusting to the food of that island, which meant that she had actually a good survival chance there.<br>\r\nAs much as she enjoyed the slabs of cooked meats that Kong brought to her, over and over, she knew that her body was in need also of fruit and herbs to survive, so finding out that she could digest them, finally let her be much more at ease about her permanence on the island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that she realized she had completely lost any hope of returning to her home on the mainland. At first, she was a bit saddened by it but, considering that she was guest to a massive, powerful and proud creature which seemed to be happy in making Her happy, she realized that there wasn\u2019t much back home that could be of equal value. Still, when she motioned to Kong, that evening, that she could have also fruits, he began bringing her both the cooked meat and the fruits he found around the island. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn, not wanting to offend her friend, tried her best to show to him how much she enjoyed his gifts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay after day, a sort of routine began to take place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery day, when the sun was at the top and when it was setting, Kong would bring to his lair, and to his pet, both the meat and the fruits, always by the, for him, handful, passing then some time with the tiny creature \u2018speaking\u2019 and learning. Still, when roughly a month had passed since Ann\u2019s arrival in his lair, he felt himself ready to show her what had he learned in those weeks while he had been \u2018hunting\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen night came, Ann patted her still somewhat full stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day she had felt particularly hungry, with no real reason to say the truth, and so she had enjoyed thoroughly the meals that her friend had brought her at lunch, while nibbling on what remained of it and on the fruits, which she had somewhat stockpiled in the freshness of the lair, throughout the day. Now, as evening was setting, she felt her tummy rumbling a bit, as if nervous that her now scheduled evening meal seemed to be late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, sitting near the cave on some soft mushroom\u2019s heads, she waited for her friend to arrive. As it had become usual, she smelled the air first, since at around that time the wind changed direction and brought to her nostrils a delicious scent, a bit different than usual. As she stood up, she saw the massive head of her friend coming into her view but, what surprised her the most was that he had brought with him something different this time. Something that made her happy and enticed her very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin his arms, laying on some palm leaves, there was a large piece of meat, roasted to a fire but, with some fruits around it. As she saw the gift he had brought her, she realized that it was yet another thing he had learned from just by watching her. As her dinner was brought in front of her, and she looked at it more carefully, she realized that it had to be one of the same tigers he had brought to her a couple of weeks before. She noticed that since the meat had been carved just as she had done previously, removing the organs and the skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeaming in happiness, she turned toward her friend and hugged one of his fingers in happiness, something that she had started doing recently to try and let him be aware of how happy he was making her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKong saw how ecstatic his pet had been at his surprise and was glad for it. He had tried himself that strange warm meat with fruits but, he didn\u2019t seem to notice anything different from any other warmed meats. Still, since his pet was so happy, he was happy himself. Also to his delight, he saw that the pet greedily went at the warmed meat with fruits, managing to eat almost half of it before collapsing in a digestive sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the days progressed more or less in the same way, Kong began to notice that his little pet was finally starting to grow and to eat more than before. For the massive Ape it had to be a sign of good health if his pet was growing and so, he began to bring to his lair, slightly bigger preys and more fruits, than before. The tiny creature didn\u2019t seem to notice the change, as it continued happily to eat whatever he brought to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, Ann had grown so addicted to the flavors of the various kind of meats and fruits that Kong brought to her that she barely noticed how larger her portion were becoming week after week. Only when her clothes began to rip and tear, she wondered about her figure for a while, on how what she was eating was affecting her physique. But, as she mulled it over, considering also the fact that she hadn\u2019t had a bath in almost a month and that her clothes were continuously under stress by the harshness of the place she was, she voluntarily rejected the idea of her gaining weight, deciding to wait some more substantial proofs before starting to worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she basically did nothing about it, simply continuing to eat every meals brought to her, while passing the rest of her day working on a special project of hers and nibbling on fruits. As weeks passed, as she basically kept her lazy lifestyle, eating whatever Kong brought to her and snacking while waiting for her main meals, she kept growing larger and fatter. It was by no means a large difference but, already some parts of her began jiggling more than they ever did before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as much as she was enjoying the meals that her friend brought to her every day, she still wanted to try and teach as much as she could to her friend, trying at her best to making him more \u2018humane\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor that reason, during the idle time between one meal and the other, she began to work out something like the sign language that the mutes had been using for centuries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy error and trial, she began to create come sort of scheme that she hoped would be useful to \u2018talk\u2019 with Kong. She knew that her friend wasn\u2019t just a beast, Kong was way more than intelligent than anyone had ever thought before, as it was shown by his interest in learning and in taking care of her well being for so long. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was now Ann\u2019s third month on the island, of her friends no trace but she wasn\u2019t actually thinking about them any longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it had happened before, she had begun to \u2018teach\u2019 herself the raw sign language she had managed to put together. In doing so, she was acutely aware that Kong was, at first, curiously staring at her and then he began to actively participate. That was a stepping stone in her relationships with her friend, although it was difficult since she couldn\u2019t actually force him to follow her signs, she nonetheless kept trying, hoping to fill the communication gap between her and Kong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ape himself wasn\u2019t actually that interested at first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had thought, at first, that his pet was doing something interesting as it had done before but, apparently it was not like that, at all. Still, seeing as it seemed to be trying its hardest to make him go through, and the fact that it appeared much more appreciative of the gifts he kept bringing, Kong began to try and follow what his pet was trying to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a couple of days already that his pet kept doing the same thing over and over, pointing to one of the meals while making something with its fingers until, finally, Kong began to see what it was trying to do. Just as he communicated with roars, his pet was trying to teach him some sort of language. Realizing that what he had been nursing in his lair wasn\u2019t just some kind of dumb animal, Kong began to get actively interested in the language that his pet was showing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some time, and much grievance for both Kong and Ann but, in barely one month Kong and Ann had finally some way of communicating with each other, although it was very slow and hard to do at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Ann. I am human. You\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI<b> am Kong. I am\u2026Me</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is your home. My home is far away.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c<b>This is my territory. This is your home.</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like your home. But my home is far away. I will stay with Kong for long time.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Kong like Ann. Kong defend Ann. Kong bring food to Ann. Ann is at home with Kong</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this way Both Ann and Kong began to talk with each other, as she tried to explain him what she was and from where she came from, while Kong realized that what he had brought to his lair so long ago wasn\u2019t just a pet but a creature like him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as much as they talked and joked and played together, Kong never told Ann of how he was trying to get her to grow as strong as he was. In truth, Ann was so focused on teaching Kong that she didn\u2019t seem to be aware of how much her permanence there had changed her. As three months had passed already, he figure had vastly inflated from the svelte model she had been when arriving on that island. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the lazy lifestyle, as she still passed most of her time sitting or laying down waiting for Kong return, and the massively increasing meals that he constantly brought her, Ann had grown rather heavily chubby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer neck was now sporting a second chin, while her arms and legs, barely used anymore except for getting food into her mouth, had grown jiggly and covered by a soft layer of fat. Her breast too had grown, now way larger than the bra she had been wearing when she had arrived. But most of her growth was visible in both her hips and her belly. Her hips and ass had grown wider, forcing her thighs to touch against the other when she wasn\u2019t consciously separating them, and her ass too had grown fuller and jigglier than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly instead had completely burst out of the camisole she had worn up to some time ago, as she instead let it simply hang down as it started to grow over her most intimate parts. Naturally, she knew to have put on some weight, her bursting out of her dress was easy enough to recognize it as a sign but, considering the \u2018harsh\u2019 conditions in which she lived, she believed of having gained almost nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, since going around naked wasn\u2019t exactly her style, helping herself with some of her ripped clothing, she quickly made a rather fashionable bra of cloth with matching short\u2019s like pants. For some reason, though, every week she found herself forced to adjust the clothes she had made for herself, and so being as she was growing lazier and lazier, she began to tinker with the idea of going around completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKong, from his part, had noticed that Ann was seemingly growing, although she wasn\u2019t actually growing as he had thought. Instead of growing taller and stronger, she seemed to be growing rather rounder and heavier. That baffled him, for he knew by his standards that eating made you bigger and stronger. Still, since he had nothing to lose, and Ann seemed to be enjoying it, he decided to keep providing her with food, although he kept increasing her portions, trying to see if maybe she would finally grow as big as himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs two weeks passed, seeing as she had just finished to eat her meal, which this time had been \u2018one tiger cooked over fire and one pig\u2019( seeing as Kong still did seem to have problems in distinguishing boars and pigs, Ann thought best to leave it at that for the moment) Ann burped quite loudly, as she rubbed her full, rounded out belly, with both hands, and yet she still felt herself craving for something more but different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe loved how the various kinds of meats and fruits tasted but, the flavors she had enjoyed was starting to grow dull on her. This gave her an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKong?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Ann?</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is only meat and fruit on your land?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c<b>There are preys. There are fruits. Ann needs more meat?</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026*urp*\u2026. No. Ann is fine. Ann search for different prey than meat or fruit.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c<b>No-meat prey? Kong knows of no-meat preys. Ann need no-meat preys?</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnn would love that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwiftly, since the sun was still high in the sky, Kong rose from his haunches and lifted Ann from the ground, having her sitting on his open hand as he began climbing down the mountain. Ann, for her part was feeling excited. This was the first time that her friend was bringing her out of the lair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was comfortably seated into his hand, Ann enjoyed the rich jungle that Kong seemed to be crossing so easily. At that sight, though, she remembered of how many of her friends had lost their life as they had moved through it. Still, those bad memories were soon washed away as Kong had brought her to a wide open space out of the jungle, precisely on a hill facing an immense lake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe carefully brought her to a tall rock formation, leaving her there as he turned back into the jungle for a moment. Being alone there, Ann marveled at how beautiful that place was, and yet, seeing as a few tigers were napping on a nearby hills, she also told herself that as beautiful it may have seemed, it was also very deadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, just as she was starting to get worried, she heard the heavy thumping of his friend as he marched back out of the jungle. As he came to stand in front of her, he had within his arms a few things that he knew as food but, that weren\u2019t meat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, he offered her what she thought were some strange tubular thingies, being instead the thorax of local sugar ants. Grabbing one of those in her hands, seeing as Kong was showing her, she brought one end of the thing to her lips, tilting it toward the sky as a whitish sludge poured out from it. As soon as she tasted it, her eyes grew wide in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>This is sugar! Extremely concentrated sugar! Mmmm\u2026so good\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmptying the tube thing she was holding, feeling herself energized, she greedily tried to get her hands on another one but Kong denied her the pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Ann have no more. Hurts belly. Kong knows. Ann like it?</b>\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnn loves it. Ann thanks Kong for beautiful gift\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKong was happy that he had managed to find something different for Ann to have, he still was having problems understanding what she needed to grow, since all he usually had was meat and fruits. Still, he knew of plenty of things that could be eaten in his island, although he usually didn\u2019t need for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKong waited a few minutes to pass, before giving Ann something else, for he knew from his experience that it was needed some time to recover from the sweet meat. Then, as Ann seemed more than ready to continue, he brough forward what seemed like a ripe orange like fruit, although the skin around it was rather tough looking and it was easily three times Ann size both in height and in width.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKong grabbed the orange like fruit and broke it in half, revealing a yellowish paste inside of it. Balancing the two halves in his hands he first showed to Ann, by bringing the first one to his lips taking a quick bite/sip from it and swallowing it down. As Ann was trying to figure out how she could do the same with her own half, she didn\u2019t see that after that little sip, Kong\u2019s figure had softened a little bit already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe inched the half fruit toward Ann, letting her scoop up a few handfuls of the strange fruit. At first, Ann, didn\u2019t seem to taste anything out of the strange fruit but, as her taste buds began to get used to the sugary and spicy flavor of the thing, she began scooping out more and more out of it, sipping it as fast as she could, even bringing her face closer to the fruit so that she could have as much as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso this time, Kong, took the fruit away, motioning to Ann that she was going to be sick if she had more of it in such a short time.  Ann, instead, after having swallowed more or less a bucket of that paste, felt positively buoyant, feeling herself as light as a feather, while she completely missed the fact that her body seemed to be growing fatter all over as time passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Ann happy for no-meat food?</b>\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cKong made Ann so happy! Ann thanks much Kong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Kong has more\u2026Ann wait here. Kong come back soon\u2026</b>\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ann, sitting down on the rock formation was soon getting rather bored and seeing as Kong seemed to be still busy doing whatever he was doing into the jungle, she began to slowly climb down from the tall rocks where Kong had left her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she slowly moved down, she noticed that it was strangely harder than she remembered but, she quickly dismissed the thought as she had finally managed to climb down. Waddling slowly, for she had slowly grown fatter as time passed due to the strange orange like fruit she had eaten, she made her way toward the lake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwiftly taking out what little clothing she had on herself, she began walking into the water, feeling it be rather lukewarm. Slowly and cautiously she began to go deeper, until the water reached her middle, then she began to submerge herself, trying as much as she could to scrub herself from the grime covering her body. As she cleaned herself, she noticed that her body seemed rather softer than before but, still under the misconception of having put on only a few pounds, she promised herself that from the following day she was going to reduce a bit her indulgences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she bathed, she suddenly felt something brushing against her flank under the water. Turning swiftly on herself, she tried time and time again to see if something was near her or not but it was only when felt something chomp softly, and painlessly to her, on one of her belly rolls, that she managed to see what had been bothering her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she watched interested, she saw that it was some kind of catfish, although one she had never seen before. The fish had closed its toothless mouth around her belly roll, as if thinking it to be food, but did seem unable to let go on its own. Ann, feeling rather ticklish where the fish had chomped, tried to scroll it off of herself for a bit, but the only results she managed to get was to feel many other similar sensations all over her submerged body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting rather afraid she began to waddle, although with difficulty, outside of the lake and there she was able to see what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll over her legs, her thighs and her belly, up to where she had been submerged, there wasn\u2019t barely any space free from the bites of those strange fishes. Giggling a bit with herself, feeling like she was a human fishing rod, she walked onto the grass land and slowly managed to have all those catfishes fall off of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling giddy for being, for once, the one useful in finding food she verified that there wasn\u2019t any permanent damage on her skin and went back into the lake, shaking herself to see if she managed to entice even more of those strange fishes to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her surprise, they kept coming at her, closing their mouths on her, and finding themselves stuck on her body. As she removed them for the forth time, she noticed that these fishes didn\u2019t actually masticate their preys, preferring instead to swallow them wholes and that had to be the reason for which she was managing to find so many attached on her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ann kept doing her involuntary capture of those animals, she didn\u2019t notice that lately the fish that were attracted to her shaking body were starting to grow bigger in size. As she dipped once more into the water, having already accumulated quite the small mountain of preys on the border of the lake, she suddenly felt something attach to her much strongly than before, almost dragging her away toward deeper waters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking behind she couldn\u2019t see much into the murky waters but, she did see some kind of shape right behind herself. Pushing with all of her strength, forcing her weakened and atrophied legs to work harder, she began to leave the waters and then she saw that a similar fish, although much bigger in size, had actually clamped its lips on her rear. Feeling rather afraid and worried, for she didn\u2019t expect that such a beast could be living into the lake, she tried as hard as she could to get out of the waters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, the catfish who had taken her, was still partly underwater and was managing to bring her back in until, suddenly, she felt herself free from the grasp and fell forward, but managing to grab onto a few roots that were near the confines of the lake. Looking back, as she recovered her breath, she thought of seeing something dragging the catfish that had been on herself, back into the deeper waters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ann recovered her breath, for she wasn\u2019t used anymore to such feats of strength, she felt suddenly being dragged from behind, as if an invisible hand had taken her and brought swiftly into the lake. Surprised and afraid she began to try and swim forward only to suddenly feel something forcefully constricting her hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant she found herself not anymore on the surface of the lake but well below it as a massive, hulking, catfish like beast had managed to get her up to her hips within its mouth. Screaming underwater, as she tried to punch back the thing that had taken her, she realized how foolish she had been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesmerized by the beauty of the lake, she had underestimated its dangers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKong, meanwhile, had been making a little stockpile of those orange like fruits, knowing full well what effects those had usually on him, as well as gathering a few more plants and fruits that he could bring to Ann to make her happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he emerged from the jungle, he immediately noticed that she wasn\u2019t anymore on the rock where he had left her. At first his angry, vengeful stare moved toward the tigers that were napping on the nearby hill but, as he looked down and saw the cold-meat preys near the lake, he left the fruits he had gathered and moved toward the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked through it he immediately spotted something trashing down below in the murky waters and, being the hunter he was, he moved rapidly, catching a rather large cold-meat prey, which had its jaws clamped tightly on Ann\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoaring in terrible fury, he grabbed as much delicately as possible his only friend on the island and used his fingers to crack open the clamped shut jaws of the would-be watery hunter. Having freed Ann, keeping her shivering forms within his hand, he tossed the creature on land, before bringing Ann toward his face, talking to her with the language she had taught him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Ann is fine?</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he repeated the gesture several times, Ann managed to snap out of the almost death experience she just had felt. Trembling, both from the cold and the fear, she looked at Kong, with tears in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnn\u2026Ann is fine. Kong saved Ann. Ann dead if not for Kong.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Kong defend Ann. Kong care for Ann. Ann friend of Kong.</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive ape had been working on that concept for quite some time, the \u2018Hu-man\u2019 creature had tried time and time again to explain him the word \u2018Friend\u2019 but he wasn\u2019t able to understand it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he had saw her in danger, he acted immediately to protect her. That was it. Kong had always been alone, since the death of his Family. What he saw as Family had to be what his Ann meant when using the word \u2018Friend\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, as Ann realized that Kong had used the word \u2018Friend\u2019 for her, she cried even harder, as she caressed and hugged one of Kong fingers, making sure to let him know that she was happy of being with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kong nuzzled a bit Ann, as he had started doing as of late to show his affection toward her, his stare fell on the massive creature that had tried to eat his friend. At first he thought about going there, rampaging, and reducing that little cold-meat hunter into a pulp, but, as Kong saw how big it was he decided to do a bit of experimentation based on what he had learned from Ann. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the tail of the fish he left it atop the rocky formation and then, swiftly brought Ann back to his lair, before departing once more telling her that he was going hunting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn, had passed from feeling completely terrified to feeling safer as she could be in the span of few minutes. Mentally damning herself for her own stupidity in thinking that she could have been safe in that lake, she began to release her anger and residual fear, by nibbling on some of the fruits that lay scattered around the lair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018If<i> Kong hadn\u2019t come in time\u2026If he hadn\u2019t seen me in the waters\u2026I would be dead by now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can\u2019t expose myself like this ever again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will always be by his side\u2026that\u2019s the only way for me to be safe.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As evening came, and Ann had managed to calm down, she felt the ground shaking and smelled a different kind of scent in the air. It was different from the usual dinner that Kong brought to her. Curiously she tried to stand on her own but, be her fattened forms, be the tiredness in her muscles, she couldn\u2019t manage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, within few seconds she saw Kong moving closer to her, one massive arms behind his back. From his expression, she had grown quite used to him now, she could see he was happy and excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he moved his arm toward her, he showed her his surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a platter of palm leaves, there was the same monster that had tried to eat her, having been skinned and cooked over the fire. Smiling at him, she thanked him by hugging his finger and then turned her attention toward the massive fish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>You tried to eat me today\u2026But it will be in my stomach that you will end up\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Some time had passed since the incident with the monster sized cat fish and Ann Darrow had slowly recovered from that experience, partly by being cuddled by her friend Kong and, for the other part, by burying her fears with food. As days passed, Ann had begun to eat away at the meals that her friend brought her, stuffing herself so full that she could barely focus on what was going on her surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis massive increase, though, had it after-effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the woman gorged on whatever the King of the island brought, her body began to metabolize everything she ate in adipose tissue all around her increasingly soft body. Kong had seen that his friend had seemed to have an increased appetite and made sure to bring her time and time again enough food to sate herself. Still, he noticed with disappointment, she barely seemed to be growing taller as he had hoped. <br>\r\nIt was baffling for the massive ape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn seemed to be growing bigger but, she hardly got taller. Apparently, she was still growing wider and softer. Still, he suspected that since she was so small compared to him it only meant that he had to wait longer for her to grow as big as he was. But, as patient as he was, he didn\u2019t want to wait unnecessarily long so he decided to increase even more the amount of food he would bring to her. Thus decided, he began scouring the isle in search of something that could be of use to him to let the \u2018growth\u2019 process develop faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kong explored his territory, he suddenly realized that he hadn\u2019t need to find anything new to bring her. He just had to adjust some of her current meals to be better, as he had done already before when he had skinned his first tiger and added the fruit juice on the meat as it cooked. With this new idea in mind he returned on his steps, moving back toward the deep jungle where he knew he could find many \u2018ingredients\u2019 for him to toy with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn, instead was lazily lying down near the lair entrance atop of the mountain. She was currently resting after having eat a good portion of the fruits that her friend had left for her the night before. As she massaged her globular belly, she seemed barely able to remember about her previous life on the continent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all of that time spent on the island with Kong, those memories were getting hazy as if they had been nothing more than a dream. And with those memories gone, she also seemed not to care about her current figure, as it had slowly swelled with her current lifestyle. She had grown a lot since the lake incident, her belly now cascaded down onto her knees, when empty, divided in three thick belly rolls. Her breast, sagging with all the fat contained within, had lost any perkiness and were currently sliding on either side of her stomach, growing bigger as she piled on the pounds. Her arms and shoulder too had been affected by her rapid weight gain, having grown thicker and with large bingo wings that jiggled every time she moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hips and ass now, had grown so big that, for sure, she wouldn\u2019t be able to pass through a door frame, if one was available on the island, and her ass cheeks, so filled with fat and cellulite, jiggled on their own as she moved even by a little, her legs.<br>\r\nBut what was most impressive was her face. Her face had softened all over, gone was the angular cheeks, the nicely shaped lips she had once had, nowadays, her face drooped down toward her chins, having grown rich in fat. Her cheeks bulging out, as the fat within pushed a bit against her eyes, sign that soon she may have to squint in order to see. Her thin shapely neck vanished, obscured by the three large chins rolls that had grown in its place, as a fourth one was starting to emerge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, she had noticed she was starting to have some issues in moving around and that the few ragged, torn, clothes she had found in his lair seemed always too small for her to wear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her mind was often turning more toward food than any other issues and so, without facing the issue, she had begun to be completely naked when she was at Kong\u2019s lair. As she looked at the sky, Ann noticed that lunch time was still many hours away, and yet she was feeling mildly hungry. Once she would have simply waited for her friend to come back but, as hunger was becoming her only focus, she began the hard task of lifting herself from the soft bed she was on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could even move one of her legs, though, she smelled the aroma of a roasted something coming her way, clear sign that Kong was returning home. As she sniffed the air, she began to drool in anticipation. The aroma seemed similar to one of the many huge dinosaurs on the island but, it was somewhat different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKong climbed the steep mountain slowly, as he kept his grip on the new meal, he had prepared that morning for his friend. He wasn\u2019t completely sure if what he had done was going to be good for his friend. As he had scoured the jungle, he had harvested plenty of resources and then tried to apply them as he had seen Ann doing before. Still, as he felt the weight of his preparation on his free hand, he could only smile in anticipation of how she would have reacted. As he appeared in her view, he saw that she was still where he had left her. This perplexed him a bit, for he wasn\u2019t able to stay in one place that long but, he figured it had something to do with the growing out process she was on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving closer to her, he slowly brought in her sight his hand, revealing three large lumps of meat, each one seemingly prepared in a different way. As he laid the three lumps in front of Ann, he then helped her stand and waddle slowly toward them as she looked at those impressed and with a hungry look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201chas Kong done meat with no bright warm thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Kong has placed meat over bright warm thing. Kong used fruits and herbs on meat. Kong saw friend do same. Kong wants Ann happy.</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn was really astonished at her friend work. <br>\r\nShe had always thought that the ape wasn\u2019t a common specimen but this time he had tried something of his own. As she looked at the three lumps, noticing that each was almost as big as her, she licked her lips as she smelled the wonderful aroma coming from each. Moving closer to those, she tried to understand what he had done with each, as she also took a little morsel from them to taste it. The meat on the first one seemed to be glazed all over, which she confirmed as she cut a piece of it with her rough stone knife. As she tasted it she thought that this had to be dinosaur meat but was baffled on what Kong could have used to have the meat glazed and to still retain all the greasy juices inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow Kong done this?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Kong used \u2018this\u2019 on the meat. As meat warmed Kong covered it slowly.</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kong spoke with the SLA, he indicated one of the tubular thingies she had already tasted before. As Ann recalled the sugary taste of the sludge, she understood that Kong had managed to caramelize the sugary sludge over the meat, greatly increasing its taste. Smiling, she moved toward the next one, tasting it as she did before. As she munched on the meat, she moaned in pleasure. This time the meat was so tender that it almost melted on her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Kong saw Ann beat meat. Kong did same. Added paste from ball fruit. Brought meat to be warmed</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she kept tasting this second course, she realized that he had tried to tenderize the meat as she had tried to do one time before. In her case it was a failure, but with Kong\u2019s strength the results were amazing. She then recognized also the faint taste over the meat itself, it was the same from that orange shaped fruit he had given her before. Gulping down the morsel she quickly moved over the third lumps realizing in fascination that this last one was way different from the other two. Where the previous two were chunks full of flesh, this last lump seemed to be mainly composed of thick fat. And since he seemed to have applied both the techniques from before on the last one, she could barely wait to taste it. Once again, her taste buds were assaulted by the delicious taste of it. Between the sugary glaze, the orange shaped fruit faint taste and the greasy fat, she began cutting bigger and bigger pieces from it, munching on them as fast as she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKong watched passively as his friend ate with reckless abandon, watching her eat was something that always made him feel proud. Proud for his work, proud for having provided to her. Still, seeing how fast she was seeming to go, he realized that he had to step up his game. If he could manage to bring her food faster, she would also grow faster. Nuzzling her with a finger, he began walking away, going to hunt more food for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kong began to bring meals to Ann every few hours, it was obvious that\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As days turned into weeks and weeks in months, Ann meals began to grow both in size and in frequency. The girl didn\u2019t seem to mind though, she was enjoying too much the freedom of having nothing to do but focusing only on two things, Kong and food. As such, results were easy to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her meals growing in portions sizes and being brought to her every few hours, Ann started to find herself behind in her eating schedule. Often she would find herself still munching on a meal as Kong brought a new one for her to consume, still, not wanting to sound ungrateful she tried to munch on them faster and faster, but the fattening diet she was on, was starting to create issues for her ever hungry stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time passed, and Ann grew bigger and fatter, she began to see that she was having difficulties in moving her arms or in grabbing her stone knife. As she began to lag behind the meals brought to her, Kong noticed that she was whining pitifully more and more often even with food around. <br>\r\nMostly with food around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he inquired, he began to see where the issue was, although he couldn\u2019t understand how it was possible. Apparently, his friend wasn\u2019t able to move her arms as much as she could before, due to this she couldn\u2019t eat or even \u2018speak\u2019 as much as she did in the past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKong was pleased with his friend growth, he had seen that she was starting to, finally grow a bit taller, although she still seemed to be growing much wider in comparison. So, he knew that she had to eat way more than what she was doing now. But he couldn\u2019t stay and help her, since he had to hunt for her. But leaving her on her own wasn\u2019t a solution since she wouldn\u2019t be able to feed herself.<br>\r\nSuddenly, he heard the horn coming from the opposite side of the island and he realized that he had the solution right in his territory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he had always believed to be tiny dumb creatures, he now realized had to be similar creatures to his friend. And being similar, they for sure could help her keeping on growing. With this in mind, he quickly lifted Ann body from the ground, holding her within his arms, and he rapidly moved toward the wood wall where the creatures lived.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAs he moved toward them, they creatures began to squeak as they always did, some with fear, some with joy. Kong though didn\u2019t focus on that, he simply moved closer to the wall, and roared toward them, making them cower in fear as he tried to convey the message that he wanted them to come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader of the tribe crouched down in fear as he was on the wall, he wasn\u2019t sure why the Mighty God had come to them. Then, as he looked to the God, he realized that it was holding something within the thickness of its arm. As he tried to see better, he saw a goldish tuft of hair and immediately realized that it was the white woman that they had given over to him so much time before. Although, when they had given her to him, she had been way smaller than the massive lump that the God was holding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he raised his voice, to stop his tribesmen from panicking, he looked toward the God, seeing as it had been acting rather calmly and, he even was afraid to think of it, rather peacefully, for his usual habits. Praying to his God Name, the leader then swiftly moved toward the base of the wall and ordered to open the gate and to low down the bridge that separated their walled town from the other side of the chasm where Kong was standing. Moving slowly, the leader emerged and walked, trembling in fear, over to his God, awaiting his command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder his surprised stare, his God inched closer to him, leaving in front of him the massive, 1,000 plus pounds, Ann Darrow as if it was waiting for him to do something. The leader moved his stare from the humongous woman in front of him and toward the God. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the God wanted from him? Why bring the strangely engorged woman to him? <br>\r\nWas the God not satisfied with her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs these thoughts ran through the leader mind, he suddenly reached a decision. Grabbing his lance he began to take aim to kill the woman that the God had brought to them but, just as he raised the lance to pierce Ann\u2019s heart, she screamed loudly and that changed the situation quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKong had brought his friend toward the tiny creatures, hoping that they would understand and help but, he saw the tiny creature looking at his Ann strangely. Then, suddenly Kong heard Ann scream in fear and that caused him to roar threateningly toward the tribe\u2019s leader. The poor man, facing alone the full wrath of his God, hastily threw away his lance, backing away from the woman a bit, but doing so his God grunted menacingly. As he then inched closer, he saw that Kong return to calmness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader racked his brain trying to understand. The God didn\u2019t want the woman harmed and, neither he wanted him away from her. So, what was that the God did want? At this point, Ann, that had been silent up to that moment, tried to communicate with the native standing before her. <br>\r\nAs Kong had moved her, she had been puzzled but, during the trip he had explained her that he was going to bring her someplace where they could help her. She would have never thought that her friend Kong would have brought her back to the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen to me. Do you understand me? \u2026? No. Of course not. Look, I need help. Kong wants you to take me in\u2026I\u2019m hungry\u2026you get it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ann tried to explain, the leader only got more and more confused, until a large rumbling sound enveloped them. The leader, then, looked at the white woman with new eyes, seeing as her massive body rumbled hungrily. As he stared at her he saw that her arms didn\u2019t manage to reach her mouth and so he finally understood what the God wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalling his tribe, they quickly took in the White Woman, and thought that the situation was resolved as he saw the God move away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut barely few minutes had passed, and the God had suddenly returned! The leader felt his heartbeat pumping faster and faster, as he raced through the village toward the gate, until he stopped seeing as his God was leaving some massive lumps of cooked food on the gate, pointing with his finger toward the White Woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was this that made realize to the Tribe leader what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir God had chosen the White Woman as its Bride and they had now been tasked with the duty of keeping her safe and sated. The leader, finally getting some grasp on the situation, began relaying the news all over the tribe, making sure to have their new Goddess treated with utmost respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As Ann started to get used to the treatment of the natives, she also began to teach a few of them the same language she had taught her friend Kong. Alas, she noticed, the natives learned it at a much slower rate than her Friend did but, with time, she managed to have at least the Leader to \u2018speak\u2019 it fluently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this time, she learned that his name was Kaak and that they considered Kong their deity. With this information she realized that by proxy, she too was now their Goddess and so she accepted the pampering that they devolved upon her. Thanks to this, Ann began to steadily grow once more.  With a few natives, which only duty was to bring food to her mouth, constantly surrounding her she truly felt like a Goddess, although she missed the times where she was alone with her Friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKong was happy that Ann was growing bigger once more but, he also sadly realized that he was alone, again. At first he kept bringing warm food to Ann but, after a while he noticed that the tiny creatures that were taking care of her had their own ways of preparing food and so he began to simply lay at their gates his kills, letting the creatures preparing them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, as he had now got used to just bring the raw food to the village before scampering back to hunt for more, he heard the horn from the village. At first he ignored it but, as it began to echoes around him more and more, Kong began to run at full speed toward them, afraid that something may have happened to Ann. <br>\r\nRoaring in fury he finally made it to the village, ready to destroy anything that may have threatened his only Friend, but there seemed to be nothing wrong there. He didn\u2019t smell no enemy, nor any trace of blood or of a fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he turned toward the village, he looked incredulous at what he was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the gate, on a massive construction, he saw Ann laying down, slowly and tiredly, wobbling her fattened arms toward him, a massive smile plastered on her face. Kong couldn\u2019t tear his stare from what he was seeing. Atop of the wood wall, on the wooden construction, Ann was laying down, constantly being fed by the natives but in full view to him. As he signed to her asking how she was doing, he was surprised when one of the creatures answered in her stead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom him Kong learned that Ann had taught them their language, so that Kong could have more friends than just Ann. The monster sized Ape, then felt in his hearth that Ann was much more than a friend, much more than a family. He had thought that she had forgotten him when, instead, she had given him a much greater gift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving closer, he pushed his arm long over the chasm opening between the solid ground where he stood and the wooden wall protecting the city, managing just right to reach his beloved friend. Ann, although being fed by the natives, opened her arms wide, as much as she could, and solidly grabbed one of Kong\u2019s finger in, what had become after so much time, her gesture of affection toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKong, feeling reinvigorated, thumped hard his pectorals and roared in joy, vowing with himself to re-double his efforts to see his friend grow more. After that he quickly moved back to the jungle, returning quickly after leaving two massive dinosaur corpses near the gates, seeing with a smile as the natives were quickly moving those inside, after hacking them into smaller pieces.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

First there had been the monsters living in that hellhole, then his would-be girl vanishing and finally his inability to return to the mainland. He had managed to survive somehow, escaping the monsters, foraging food here and there, finding shelters wherever he managed to find safety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, if at first, he had managed to keep his spirits high with hope\u2026 as months passed, he began to brood over himself, as madness began to overcome his loneliness.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWithout noticing he had even become to talk to himself, keeping long discussion with his own self, often passing hours simply repeating his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack Driscoll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this changed though when he saw Her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was hiding in one of his usual spots, at the base of the tallest mountain, having noticed that creatures tended to avoid that place, when he saw that monstrous ape climbing down from it, carrying His Ann within his arms. That sight gave him an objective from the mere surviving. From then on, he began to try and shadow every movement that Ann did, along with the monster. As little as she moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith time spent on shadowing her he began to see that Ann seemed to be growing\u2026 \u2018healthier\u2019 and yet, not only she didn\u2019t seem unhappy, but he himself began to find her even more attractive. It was strange, really, he had always thought that Miss Darrow had always been the most beautiful girl in existence, that nothing could have made her more beautiful than how she appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as time passed with him spying on her, seeing as she began to grow, he found himself even more attracted to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, at least, that\u2019s what the Voices told to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time passed, Jack noticed that Ann kept growing, unrelenting, her mass began to billow everywhere. He had scrounged up from a pile of human remains a binocular of sorts and, with it, he began to spy that much closer to his Ann, feeling as if he was standing beside her, talking to her, comforting her in her state of being hostage of that monster. As he watched her grow fatter and fatter, he surmised that it had to be the monster idea to keep her there, to have her all for himself, but he also began to find her more fascinating than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the rare times when he rested, he found himself fantasizing on having her for himself, of having her grow even more, of feeding her by his own hands, seeing that angelic smile plastered on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when he saw the monster moving her, having to carry her with both of his arms, he began to fear that her time might have come. Fear gripped his hearth as he began tracking them, carefully avoiding the creatures that roamed the island, creatures bent into killing him and devouring him. It took him weeks but, he managed to find them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he saw her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time she was being held by the natives of that hellhole, which seemed rather pleased with themselves to keep fattening her. For a moment, Jack wondered how she could stand all that. How could the little Miss Darrow be feeling being subjected to that treatment but, as he took shelter in a cave near the tribal village, he never saw her cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis madness returned, taunting him from every side, making him believe that she too must have wanted it, that she had grown now attached to that monster that had captured her so long ago. In this frenzied state, Jack, promised himself that he was going to free her. That he was going to find a way to bring her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, to do that, he had to return where everything had started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere all this nightmare had begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left the cave he had found refuge in and began the long and hard trek to return to the beach where they first had arrived. He hoped to find a sign, something that would help him in the quest he was in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo save Miss Darrow from that monster. To bring her back to their homeland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he avoided the many traps that Skull Island threw at him, often by the hairs, he finally managed to return to the coast. Finding nothing.<br>\r\nThere was nothing there for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo answers, no tools, nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn anger, losing the last scrap of good sense he had had up to that point, he quickly erected a pyre, with logs and scraps of wood he rapidly built a massive pyre, one that, he was sure, was going to attract all manners of creatures to him. So that he could finally die. The voices kept repeating him that he had failed her, that he had always failed at her safety. Madness overtook him, in a brutal breaking point his mind simply went away, leaving behind a mangled corpse moving by its own self destructive will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the last reserves of fuel he had on himself, stored for the emergencies, he quickly lighted up his own funeral pyre, already prepared to end his own misery. But, just as he was ready to let himself go within the roaring flames, he heard a sound he had heard such a long time before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his rational mind began to return, he turned his stare on the horizon, seeing as a shape began to emerge from the fog constantly enveloping the island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA warship, to be exact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\nA few hours later, feeling drained and wet, Jack found himself seating inside one of the cabins of the massive vessel, nursing within his hands a mug of hot coffee. Looking into the dark liquid he began muttering to himself a bit, cackling as he realized that he still had time to do his duty. To save Miss Ann Darrow from the beast lurking in the island. But, to do that, he was going to need the help of the entire crew of that ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he began to lay down his plans, he often wandered throughout the ship, finding himself talking with every crew member, asking them opinions, promising riches beyond compare, sweet talking them into be more accepting with the mission he was brewing within his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, he had spent months on the damned place and knew it, mostly, as the back of his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a single moment, Jack asked himself what he was doing. Here he had the opportunity to return to his home, to his family. He had the chance of forgetting that nightmare and start a new life back in his country and, why not, to have his own girl to see grow, to fatten her up to the point of immobility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the Voices, angry with him of being ignored, kept repeating to him that he still had a duty to perform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe still had to take back what was his by rights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt nearly took him two weeks to have most of the crew on his side, when he went and discussed things with the commander of the ship. As he talked with him, he also learned why they were there. It hadn\u2019t started as a rescue mission. In fact, they were not aware of anyone having come to the island before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were there as an escort mission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the commander said it, \u2018Some egg-heads wanted to explore this uncharted rock. We\u2019re here to provide support and bring them back.\u2019 As Jack, assisted by his Voices, kept discussing the matter with the man in front of him, he began to turn the truths into lies, making sure to get the help he needed while delivering false promises.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\nIn this way, after long discussions, he managed to get himself counted within the numbers of people that were going into the island to get their men\u2019s back. The scientists and explorers who had come to the island, had done so almost three weeks ago and, by Jack estimations, they were already lost. But he never said that, instead he told them that he was going to help them in retrieving them. When, in truth, he had only one person to save. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack Driscoll, having made himself known to the crew as the man who had survived almost one year on that island, made sure that all people on board were listening to him, taking his advices to their very hearth, making sure that every word he said about Skull Island became like words taken from the Holy book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure that his every word became Law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack had already the plan formed into his mind, he was going to trade the lives of the same people who had started to believe in him, in order to save the life of Ann Darrow. Even considering her size, he already knew how to transport her away from that hellish place. Along with the warship there was also a barge, used to move materials that the would-be explorers had requested to make a base within the island. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack already planned to dump all that material to the sea, to have enough space to save His woman. As to how move her from the tribal village toward the sea, he already had made a few questions to some of the engineers on board, making sure to tell them that if they were to save these people, they for sure were going to have them moved from a high place toward the sea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, a platform capable of sustaining tons was needed, along with the means to having it lift. Jack, having managed to replace his presence with the one of the commander within the hearts of the crew, was now the de-facto owner of the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll he had to do was to put his plan in motion\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Along with the commander, Jack returned back to Skull island having appointed himself as guide for the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the two of them, almost fifty soldiers were coming, each armed to the teeth, and yet Jack knew it was pointless. Mankind couldn\u2019t fight with the creatures living in that place. They could only flee and avoid them as much as they could. Still, he kept the fa\u00e7ade, he made sure of being overheard when the commander made foolish decision, so that the crew would know who was to blame in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they reached the coast, immediately they began moving deeper inside the island, luckily for Jack, the explorers had previously thought of making camp somewhat near the tribal village, so he hadn\u2019t had much to do to ensure that they proceeded in the right direction. Although, as noisy as the soldiers were, that very first night their rescue team lost three men to some kind of bird of prey. Jack had tried to have the commander understand that they needed to split their team in smaller groups and to stay hidden into caves, avoiding the open grounds but, the man didn\u2019t want to hear it from a simple civilian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack, naturally, wouldn\u2019t stress too much about these points, after all, it all worked in his advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the following week, from the fifty-two people who had come out of the warship, less than thirty were still alive and present. All the others had been either devoured or vanished within deep caves. As fatalities kept increasing, so the commander authority vanished, and yet, Jack waited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were close to the tribal village, and he didn\u2019t want to risk everything he had worked for without having the absolute certainty that his leadership was not going to be contested. In his plans, he could make it with a dozen of men so, he could afford to wait a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs nights passed, Jack noticed that two thirds of the rescue team were now following his lead, blindly. As he talked to them, one night, he realized that they were ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving their faith lying within him, they followed him, as he told them that they could easily escape the island, they only needed a special kind of hostage to safeguard them against the most dangerous monster in that place. By sheer luck, or misfortune, they had never had any encounter with the massively monstrous ape and yet, the marines and the second in command, trusted him blindly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he had said jump, they would have all jumped down a cliff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack moved his own group toward the village, going for a passage he had found as he had been tracking Ann, he realized that he would have been the same if someone had come to him when he had been on the island on his first few weeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were so scared that they weren\u2019t thinking at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack could use this to his advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving their commander behind, escaping into the night, Jack and his men moved swiftly through the night, until they reached the passage he had found by chance. The cave was dark and deep. One false step would lie to doom but, by following the right path Jack could lead his team right behind the village, on a grassy hilltop that they were going to use to install the ropes needed for the elevator to be placed. As he looked down from the hilltop, at the sea below, he could see the faint outline of the barge, having been moved there with lots of effort from the crew still aboard the warship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking their time, they placed the elevator and verified that it was working. As he was the one offering to test it, he managed to breach the news on board that their original commander was dead and that he and his team of \u2018survivors\u2019 were going to take something from the Island, something that would bring the most dangerous beast there unable to harm them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, a few of the seamen still on the warship began to wonder how Mr. Driscoll could have foreseen the need to have that platform ready if he hadn\u2019t planned of leaving from that specific place but, they were soon quieted by their comrades, as these acted more like fanatics than marines anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack returned to the hilltop, he began relaying his orders. Of the people following him, a dozen or so were going to assault the village, killing anything that came in their way, making sure that the natives weren\u2019t going to be a threat. He and the remaining eight man were going to take care of moving their soon to be hostage from the elevated construction with any mean necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat same night, twenty deadly shadows began moving within the village, each was ready to unleash an inferno of bullets and grenades on the natives which, feeling confident behind their wall had never had nothing to fear from behind of it. The few sentries that were around were quickly silenced, permitting Jack to advance cautiously until he was on the construction were Ann was being held hostage. As he slowly walked toward her, he couldn\u2019t believe how magnificently big she had managed to grow herself into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stepped closer and closer, he lifted his hand until he could touch her flabby skin, feeling it exceedingly warm at his touch. As he roamed his hands on what was really just one of many, massive, belly rolls, he couldn\u2019t stop fondling it, squishing it within his grasp. He started to get so much into it that he even thought of hearing her moan from his fondling. Yet, he shook himself. He had no time to waste as of now, he couldn\u2019t afford to lose everything now the he was so close to have everything he had wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting the pile of flab go, he began climbing her body, seeing that his estimates hadn\u2019t been far from being right. In those two weeks she had managed to grow even fatter than before, becoming an immobile mass of flab, a humongous, jiggly, mountain unable to move or cater for herself. As he kept climbing on her belly, almost getting his leg stuck into her navel, he finally managed to reach the valley between her breasts. Pushing forward he advanced on that unexplored territory, promising himself to delve deeper in exploration of that amazing body, as soon as they were safe, until he reached her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere he stood, once more, speechless. Surrounded by a ring of at least seven chins, her head was gently placed against her backfat, using it as a pillow to help her sleep. As he moved closer he could see that her beautiful face had been distorted by all the fat coursing through it and yet, although her cheeks looked puffy and swollen, as they cascaded down toward her multiple chins, in his eyes, she remained the most wonderful woman he had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, more than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up from his reverie he moved closer to her face, as he woke her up gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnn? Ann, wake up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026? Kaak\u2026is that\u2026 you\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she slowly opened her eyes, she saw a face extremely close to hers, it was a face she knew, she was most certain of it, but who it was? As she completely woke up, she realized immediately who was the man standing over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Jack\u2026? Is it\u2026 really\u2026 you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 That\u2019s me, Ann. I promised you to see you back to safety, didn\u2019t I? I\u2019ve finally arranged a way to bring you home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Ann Darrow, former actress, thought back to her life in the continent, she truly was going to be back to her life, back to her parties and to perform into movies. She was so happy that she tried to hug Jack but, due to her size, found herself unable to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh\u2026guess\u2026 I\u2019ve\u2026 gained\u2026 a pound\u2026 or two\u2026 since\u2026 coming\u2026 here\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way, Ann\u2026you\u2019re perfect the way you are. <br>\r\nNow, we need to be as quick as possible. My men are going to have you move on a few rolling trunks, it won\u2019t be pleasant but, we can\u2019t risk you overworking yourself, can\u2019t we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour\u2026 men\u2026? What\u2026 are\u2026 you\u2026 talking\u2026 about\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShh, be quiet for a moment, dear. We\u2019re in the middle of the village, this will turn into a bloodbath if they see us here. Don\u2019t you worry love, soon you\u2019ll be back with me in the States. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe will marry and we will be so happy together\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Jack and his team worked tirelessly as they helped the billowing mass of fat that Ann Darrow had become, moving her toward the hilltop. A few of the men began wondering why they were taking that massive, hulking, jelly-like behemoth with them but, since it was orders from Jack, none of them argued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew best on this island. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they finally made it atop the hill, he quickly kissed Ann on the cheek, before leaving her to speak with his men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen up, guys. Raze this place to the ground, loot whatever you want and bring back as much treasure as you can. I\u2019ll start bringing \u2018That\u2019 on the barge and send you guys the elevator platform back. By the time the platform is back here, I want you to run for it and we will take you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne more thing, currents in this place are treacherous and capable of sinking ships bigger than this one. If you reach the elevator and you see us moving, do not panic. We will reconvene at the beach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGet there safely, as I taught you, and you will be back unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, go get it, lads!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving released his men, Jack moved back toward the platform, letting it transport him and his soon-to-be bride toward the cargo barge down below. When they finally were on the barge, with Ann securely strapped on the main deck, Jack quickly ordered to cut the ropes and move back toward the continent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the Chief Engineer, left in command of the vessel, inquired about their companions, all Jack answered was with \u201cThey\u2019re all dead. They didn\u2019t heed my advices when I gave them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill trusting the man in front of them, the warship and the barge crews, began to move out from the island, while Jack looked back at the island, feeling as if he had just paid a deed with the Devil, exchanging fifty lives with the life of one woman.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But, when the occasion arrived on her desk, to be the first woman to explore a previously unknown island, she didn\u2019t even think about refusing. She immediately accepted and prepared herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, she had thought of being sent there with people of her caliber, people who knew how to live in the wilderness. Instead, the team she was going with was mostly composed by scientists, geologist, and many more -ists she wanted to remember. Still, she was feeling energized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new land where, supposedly, no man had walked before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took them a couple of months to travel from New York to this new island. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs per request from their expedition leader, they were going to be staying on the island for no more than two weeks, then they would have reconvened on the shore and signaled to the warship escorting them to come and pick them up to return home. In those two weeks, they were going to find a place suited to be turned into an expedition base, that was going to be built by workers from the main land as soon as the place was deemed secure, and worthy, by their expedition. Along with them, for security reason, a small platoon of soldiers was going to be deployed with them, although the Leader was sure that it was just a needless precaution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>ONE WEEK LATER</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was hiding silently on the branches of a tree, her hands tightly placed against her mouth as she replayed in silent horror to the massacre that she had witnessed with her own eyes. Everything had seemed to be going well, the flora on that island was different from any other in any country Sarah had ever seen. But, as they ventured deep within the jungle, not one of the expedition team had been able to see a single example of fauna. There were insects, sometimes reaching sizes similar to that of a small dog, but no other animal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah found it eerie. How could this place keep its balance without any kind of predator? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as the team made their base camp on the edge of the jungle, in one night all hell broke loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all started just as Sarah was leaving the mess hall tent, slowly walking toward her own sleeping bag. In front of her eyes, she saw one of the sentries suddenly being grabbed by something and brought into the deepest part of the jungle. After that sight, before she could utter a warning, screams and shouts began to be rung throughout the camp. Twirling around she saw creatures, monsters, emerging from the jungle, assaulting rapidly the camp, grabbing someone and running swiftly back into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of her, she saw one girl, Alexia Shu, she recalled, which was the paleontologist of the team. Sarah saw her, turning toward her with a smile plastered on her face, as if she couldn\u2019t be happier of what she had just seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRaptors, Sarah! These are Raptors! They were supposed to be \u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could finish, though, something massive emerged from the jungle, closing its massive jaws on her, cutting her words in half as they changed into a long, pain filled, shriek. As the thing snapped its jaws on the girl, blood splattered all over, covering Sarah who, paralyzed by fear could only watch around herself as the carnage continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs another man was quickly thrown to the ground by one of those raptors that Alexia had been so amazed about, Sarah returned into herself and began running away from the massacre. Jumping into the jungle, motivated by fear, she began to run and run until the screams were nothing but a whisper in the wind. As she found herself, alone, in that jungle, she quickly scanned the vegetation around her and did the only sensible thing she could think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe climbed the tallest tree she could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor two days she stayed up there, too afraid of getting down from the tree, even though she was desperately in need of water and food. Yet, she felt like her muscles had turned into lead ingots, welded around the trunk of the tree on which she had been taking refuge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom up there, in the past day, she had been able to see them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fauna of the island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had passed right in the midst of them, or, in some cases, even under some of the biggest ones, and yet as they were probably unknown in that habitat those predators had shown caution towards them. But, when they had found them in their camp, completely unguarded, they had attacked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs days passed, Sarah began to venture little by little into the jungle, foraging just the smallest amount she needed to survive, still too afraid to leave her only safe place. Day by day she climbed that tree, up and down, collecting a mouthful of berries and a few sips of water from a nearby river. But at the lightest sound, she would quickly return to her tree, hiding up there, in the safety of the tallest branches, waiting for the sun to set and rise again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a short month she managed to keep on living although, her body was swiftly drying its own resources fast. That day, as the sun was high, she hadn\u2019t felt strong enough to climb down and so she slept but, as night came, she found she couldn\u2019t move from her hiding spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo paralyzed to go around in the night, no matter how hungry or thirsty she felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the night progressed, she saw a massive tiger like beast circling around her tree, probably attracted by the dried blood all over her. Yet, the beast wasn\u2019t able, probably, to climb up to her. Yet it waited under it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she knew that she couldn\u2019t have lasted another full day without water or food in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>I\u2019m doomed. I can\u2019t escape that thing, weak as I am\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould I have stayed at the camp? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould I have given up, there, thus quickly ending my life as all the others?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat good has been for me to survive one more week like this? Why should I keep enduring this pain?</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, though, the ground began to tremble, and she saw the silhouette of the beast fleeing into the dense jungle, as if scared by something. Yet, the ground kept on shaking, as if something truly massive walked on it with huge feet. Tiredly, Sarah began to look around once more, searching for that tallest mountain she had seen on the horizon, dreaming of being up there, at least for one time, to see all the island in its beautiful, and deadly, purity. But as she turned toward the horizon, where she knew that the mountain was, she saw only darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>No? It\u2019s not darkness\u2026something is standing here, shadowing the entire horizon?</i>\u2019<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLooking up, she blanched as she saw one massive eye peering down to her, looking at her as she gripped even more tightly on the tree trunk, paralyzed by fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKong had been restless all night long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething seemed to be telling him to be on alert, and yet, nothing could threaten him on His territory. Still, as he woke up, he looked to the spot where Ann, his friend had once been. Now, he had given her to the other creatures like her, so that they could help her grow big and strong, until she could become his perfect partner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRestless as he was, he grunted a bit as he rose and began to descend the mountain, deciding to go around his territory and, maybe hunt something for Ann.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was moving about, he noticed one of the small beasties that he had already used once to provide warm meat to his Ann. Yet, something was curious about that animal. It was circling a tree so, he reasoned, there had to be something tasty on that tree. Moving closer made the little beast run away cowering in fear but, there was something decidedly wrong on that tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKong smelled blood coming from its highest point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving closer he peered within it, curious as to why blood was on a tree but, as he looked closely, he saw one of those tiny little creatures just like his Ann. The creature was gripping the tree with all of its might but, since Kong didn\u2019t want to hurt it he didn\u2019t dare move his hand toward it. Unsure about the situation, but recalling what Ann had \u2018told him\u2019 once, he crouched and simply ripped the tree from the ground, having care in not letting the creature on it to fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn had told him that while other creatures like her could hurt him, they would mostly do it for fear. If he tried to be kind toward them, maybe he could have more friends. <br>\r\nWith those \u2018words\u2019 in his mind, Kong began to climb back atop of his mountain, wanting to show his kindness to another creature as Ann had told him to.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack had made it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had managed to save Ann from that horrible beast and from that Hellish island. Now, with her under his wing, Jack could finally feel complete. Still, sometimes, he could hear the Voices snickering around him but, with Ann by his side he felt like nothing could ever bring him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, he had to admit that Ann seemed rather worried about her returning home and, most worryingly, about that awful monster. Still, he had been trying to act charming to get her to forget that thing and, at first, it had seemed to be working but, yet she kept bringing up that wretched thing within their discussions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was losing his patience and, at first, he had been toying with the idea of cutting her out of food, so to let her learn her place. But as he thought about it he realized that there was a better way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true that under that monster she had been growing massively but, for sure, he could provide her with tastier food than the one she could have eaten on that accursed island. All he had to do was to keep the tasty food coming her way, until she would either, forget about the monster or focus only on the food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, Jack was going to be a happy man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially, he placed the plan in motion, but not even a short week later he realized there was a major flaw in his plan. The trip to return home was going to take a couple of months while, giving all the food to Ann would deplete their reserves in less than three weeks. Jack knew that something had to be done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to manage to erase from her mouth the name of \u2018Kong\u2019 but to do that he was going to need much more food that he could afford. As he looked around, he noticed that some of the crew members were looking rather\u2026plump. If he could get them to grow a bit more, he could not only restock the larder but, also, reduce the number of mouths to be fed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a manic glint filled his eyes, Jack began to spend much more time with the crew members, talking with them, getting to know them and to better visualize which were the easiest targets around. Also, he brought forth the continuation of his plan to keep on being the leader for those who were with him on the ship. Day by day, he began to act more like a father to them, starting to teach them a distorted version of the bible.<br>\r\nWith this trick, since already he had their loyalties, he was sure that nothing would prevent him to reach the mainland with Ann, even if he had to be the only other survivor beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas Denfort had been recruited on the warship as a dishwasher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was \u2018trained\u2019 to be a marine but, most of his time he usually spent working in the kitchen, cleaning and bringing food to the officers. Although trained, he wasn\u2019t battle ready at all, it was enough to look at him to realize that he wasn\u2019t going to be a soldier any sooner. As most of his family he was \u2018big boned\u2019 and adding to that, he still managed to sneak treats and snacks every now and then, making himself quite portly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he did his duty as any other marine did but, their leader, the once civilian, Mr. Driscoll said to have seen something in him and so wanted him and a few other boys to be moved from their current position to be placed under a new work of some kind. Thomas, at first, was kind sorry of leaving the kitchens, but as he saw what his new job consisted of, he could only be happy for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Thomas had to do in this new job of his was to sit around all day long and \u2018taste\u2019 some of the food that other members of the crew would bring to him. Father Driscoll, as most of the crews had started to call Jack, had told all of them one night that they had to take examples from the teachings of the Book, give and you will receive and all that sort of crap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas wasn\u2019t really believing all those things but, if by playing along he managed to laze around all day while stuffing his gut, he was more than pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack little \u2018farm\u2019 was coming along nicely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ten guys he had selected were growing steadily, as they were being fattened without even realizing what was going to happen to them. But it was going to be soon, so Jack had used most of his influence to convert them, especially on the cooks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor it was them that were going to be central for his plan to reach completion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now a month since they had left the Island and Jack could see that his little farm had grown enough. It was also true that, between the farm and Ann\u2019s consumption their stocks were largely dwindling down to nothingness. Still, Jack, wasn\u2019t too worried about that. With the food they were going to recover from his little farm, he already had planned a second series of people that was going to be working for the good of them all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe selected guys were so faithful toward him that he hadn\u2019t even needed to select them. They offered themselves as soon as they had heard that those that had been there before them, had ascended to greater heights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack, and the restricted few who had been made aware of the truth, could scarcely believe it but, it was too good an opportunity to let it dwindle to nothing. But, of all the people present in the current farm, Thomas was chosen by Jack for a special assignment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack, and a couple of helpers, assisted Thomas as he waddled through the ship, he slowly brought him on the cargo barge below deck. There, he gave his permission to Thomas to rest a bit on one of the benches, which creaked ominously under the massive weight of the once marine. In those weeks of lazing around, doing nothing but eating, Thomas Denfort had grown massive indeed. Used to eat his fair amount, his stomach had been brought to his limits as Jack requested him to have more than any other of his farm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy had blindly enjoyed his good fortune, without noticing that as each day passed, he was still being stuffed full of anything edible. He had noticed that moving around, or even the simple act of standing up, had become way harder to do than he remembered but, Father Driscoll had always been at his side, easing his worries, calming him and telling him that nothing was wrong with how he felt about his body.<br>\r\nUntil that fateful day, when the Father and a few of his helpers had brought him on the below decks of the barge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026Father\u2026 wh-why are we\u2026 here? I thought\u2026 that the\u2026 Goddess\u2026 had to be\u2026 left\u2026 alone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, my young Thomas. The day has come. The moment of your ascension has arrived. You should be filled with joy for you\u2019re going to be saved.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh\u2026*urp*\u2026 What?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrothers? Prepare him\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwiftly, Jack\u2019s aides grabbed the young, fattened, man and forced an apple into his mouth, shutting him up as they quickly tied both his hands and legs. Then, once he was silenced, they coated his skin with a thick strata of bacon grease. Once he was prepared and unable to move any inch of his five-hundred-pound frame, he was taken and slowly moved toward the upper decks where Ann had been securely strapped when fleeing from the Island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack, who had kept his Ann well fed in that month, began climbing her body, finally reaching her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnn? Ann, I\u2019ve got a surprise for you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026what is it? Is it\u2026Food? So\u2026Hungry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Ann, dear. It\u2019s food for you. But I want this to be a surprise, so, I\u2019ll tie this handkerchief over your eyes\u2026 No peeking, my dear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he obstructed her vision, he motioned to his aides to bring forward Thomas as they all began then to place him right in line towards Ann\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, Ann, you remember how I\u2019ve taught to you to just open your mouth wider than usual?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yes? Jack\u2026 What\u2026 what is\u2026 going\u2026 on\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust in me, Ann. It\u2019s just a morsel a tad bigger than usual but, I\u2019m sure you will enjoy it. Open wide now, yes, a little bit wider still\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn wasn\u2019t sure what was going on. Since Jack had \u2018rescued\u2019 her from Skull Island she had passed the longest period she could remember eating barely enough to fend off the feeling of starvation within herself. Also, although he seemed rather affectionate toward her, he kept repeating strange things when he thought of being alone, murmuring his name, over and over. Then, two weeks before he had started to feed her bigger and bigger things, asking her to try and swallow them in one go. It had been hard but, she managed, hoping to make him happy but, all he seemed to become was only more sinister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she was growing hungrier and hungrier and so she could do nothing but to do as Jack said. Although, especially in these moments, she thought back to her friend Kong who had provided her too but, with true passion and friendship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she opened her mouth at her widest, she suddenly felt something being shoved into it. Taken by surprise she tried her hardest to not snap her jaw, since Jack could become rather aggressive if she didn\u2019t do what he wanted, instead she tried to swallow, using her tongue to ease the passage of, whatever that thing was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as her tongue passed on that thing, her eyes opened wide in shock as, whatever that was, it tasted amazing. Helped also by Jack and his aides, she began, finally to swallow it, feeling its massive weight as it passed from her mouth into her throat, ending finally with a loud sound into the pit of her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn had never tasted anything so delicious and yet so filling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack removed the cover from her eyes, she looked at him, feeling pleasantly surprised by him for the first time in a long time. And yet, although feeling contently full, she could see that something was wrong in his eyes. He was looking at her rather strangely but, she thought, that it was probably nothing but the light.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ann was truly getting used to being treated like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still wasn\u2019t completely sure on what Jack was giving her, although she would have said that it surely was meat but, considering her situation she couldn\u2019t have asked for anything else. And, although the taste had seemed to grow bland, after a bit she began to be totally engrossed with the texture of the treats. It was so deliciously sinful that Ann was starting to feel like an addict. Most of the time, when Jack came to her with the handkerchief, she would simply close her eyes and open as wide as she could her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack instead, was cackling in his cabin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip was almost over, the following morning the warship was due to arrive near the port of New York and, most importantly, a small part of their larder was still intact, while alas the crew members had sadly reduced to a skeleton crew. All those that still were on board were the most loyal and faithful, the one who basically took anything that Jack said as an incontrovertible truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, also important from Jack\u2019s view, they were all fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack had made sure to use almost any scraps, except a few rations for himself, giving it all to the remaining crew members, making sure that each spent most of his day eating and resting. This now left him with five people who had been fattening along nicely and two being his prized piggies. To be sure that nobody would say something against him, Jack had already planned everything. Before the sun was rising, there were going to be only two people on board of the warship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHim and Ann.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, the night before, she had confessed to him that she was getting addicted to those \u2018treats\u2019 he was giving to her and so, he was now wondering if today was going to be the day where he would tell her the truth. Before doing that, though, he had to get rid of the less faithful of his servants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecifically, of those pesky five guys who hadn\u2019t manage to turn themselves in veritable balls of food and fat. To do that, already he had made pacts with a few of them, he was going to bring a couple of them to Ann, and then use one of the two to help him feed the other to her. Then, he would simply repeat the process with the new guy that was going to arrive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those dark thoughts in mind, Jack began cackling, only to stop after a little bit, looking nervously around himself. Gaining control over his emotion he prepared to start a feast that his Ann wasn\u2019t going to forget. Inviting the first two to meet him at the Goddess was pretty easy, although he had to admit that restraining the first of them was rather harder than he had thought. Still, with these guys weight ranging from one hundred eighty to the three hundred pounds, they sure were the light weights of his flock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, one by one, as he tricked the last one by using the new arrival against him, he managed to stuff pretty quickly four guys into Ann\u2019s gullet, much to her pleasure. <br>\r\nKnocking down the fifth guy was particularly hard but, after a bit of a fight with him, Jack finally managed to render him unconscious. After having restrained him and undressed him, Jack Driscoll began the hard part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo move him from the main deck, toward the gaping maw of Miss Ann Darrow. Still, somehow, he managed and Ann, which had by now become a champion in eating those \u2018treats\u2019, didn\u2019t even need any help in sending it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you full, my dear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Oaarp*\u2026 Ugh\u2026they were\u2026 a bit\u2026 filling, Jack. But\u2026 if you\u2019ve got\u2026 more\u2026 of those\u2026you know\u2026 I can\u2019t\u2026 say no\u2026they\u2019re\u2026 just\u2026 too\u2026 good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Baby. You ain\u2019t seen nothing yet. I\u2019ve reserved the best for the last.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving his immense woman, Jack climbed down and was met with the last two members of his flock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one was Joshua Graham, in those last weeks he had done nothing but stuffing himself, eating as much as he could, even managing to steal food from his colleagues. Joshua, who had started the trip weighing roughly two hundred pounds already, had managed the impressive feat of reaching five hundred and thirty-five pounds. Still, he was nothing if compared with his companion.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs big as Joshua was, the blue ribbon, if Jack could give one, had to be given to his friend, Abe Klintock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbe, one of the last scullery boys on the ship had been a scrawny little thing when Jack recruited him for the next ascension, weighing in at a measly one hundred and fifty pounds and yet, since he wasn\u2019t white, he managed to reach a total weight of five hundred ninety-six pounds of weight. Jack had imagined that \u2018little\u2019 Abe would have reacted like that, being able to show off his skills to all the other white guys around, making them see how the different and, often, tormented little one had managed to grow biggest than them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbe, Joshua, a pleasure to see you guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2026*huff* came as fast\u2026 as we\u2026*urp*\u2026 could\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry for\u2026 being late, Father. Abe here, wanted to\u2026 finish up\u2026 his meal\u2026 would have\u2026 eaten\u2026 also the\u2026 table\u2026 if you hadn\u2019t\u2026 told us\u2026 to come\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, nothing to worry about, my Brothers. It is good that you want to enjoy your carnal desires. Still, your ascensions await\u2026 As I taught you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe shall\u2026 push\u2026 into the\u2026 pit\u2026 of\u2026*urp*\u2026 humid\u2026 darkness, travel\u2026 through the\u2026*oaarp*\u2026 tunnel of\u2026 constrictive\u2026 pain and reach\u2026 the\u2026*huff* lake\u2026 of burning\u2026 pain. By bathing\u2026 in those\u2026 waters, we shall\u2026 be reborn\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe shall push\u2026 into the pit\u2026 of humid\u2026 darkness, travel through\u2026 the tunnel\u2026 of constrictive pain\u2026 and reach the lake\u2026 of burning pain. By bathing in\u2026 those waters, we\u2026 shall be reborn\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two last members of the crew chanted each in his own fashion, the sacred prayer that Father Driscoll had taught them, both began following Jack as they climbed on top of Ann\u2019s body. Huffing and puffing, the two massive blobs of men, made it finally on the top of their \u2018Goddess\u2019 which was looking at them with a strange expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJ-Jack? Who are these guys? What\u2019s happening?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, sweet, sweet, little Ann\u2026Didn\u2019t you want to know what those delicious treats were? The ones I\u2019ve been feeding you in the last few weeks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yes\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, I see, that there is a bit of drool escaping your lips\u2026You still need me to tell you, what I\u2019ve been giving you? You still need to hear it? Or do you know it already?<br>\r\nIf is fear that grips your mind, let it all wash away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrother Abe and Joshua, here, they wish nothing more than plunge deep into you\u2026 It\u2019s their wish, isn\u2019t it, brothers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbe, bowing his head a little, was the first of the two to speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Mistress\u2026 We desire\u2026nothing else\u2026than be\u2026welcomed\u2026within you\u2026will you\u2026refuse us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs my brother said, we would be\u2026so grateful, should you\u2026accept us\u2026within yourself\u2026aren\u2019t we\u2026faithful enough?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn, since a long time already had been slightly aware of what Jack was giving her. She had thought about it, as she digested each and every new treat, as to what could be just as large and could be just as filling as what she had been eating, considering that she was on a ship. She hadn\u2019t wanted to admit it with herself but, she had thought about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the worst, in her eyes, was that she couldn\u2019t stop herself. Ann didn\u2019t know what it was that made people so good but, they were. And the fatter they got, the better they tasted. As she grew addicted to the taste, so the desire to have more grew within her. As smaller became the voice of reason in her, which was nowadays a barely audible whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, as she was presented with another two succulents, delicious, morsels she just couldn\u2019t stop herself. As much as she loved and hated it, she couldn\u2019t refuse Jack\u2019s offer. If those two really wanted to be inside of her, how could she say no to them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, a tiny whisper in her head, tried to make itself heard.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>But if you eat these two, knowingly, what will stop you from taking others as long as YOU believe that they\u2019re doing it willingly?</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the voice was lost in the cacophonic mess that was her mind, driven wild by the appetizing look of those new treats walking toward her by their own decision. Ann, after, said to herself that she didn\u2019t do anything. She just stood there with her slavering mouth open. It was those two that walked and crouched, and squirmed and crawled in her mouth, forcing themselves upon her throat, launching themselves to their doom deep into her gullet, falling rapidly into the pit of her stomach, where her stomach acids began rapidly to digest them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t do anything and yet, as she licked her lips, feeling new pounds expanding her already massive body, she had on her face a smug smile, feeling for the first time in so long, finally full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ann laid there, silently digesting, Jack moved swiftly beside her head, caressing her hairs, as he whispered softly into her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you see it, Ann? Why go back to making movies when you can turn work into an enjoyable experience? We could work for the government, clearing out the overworked prison system, or make our own enterprise, working to help others get rid of troublemakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your beauty, your appetite and my brain, we can do all we want\u2026and we will be able to sate you, my beautiful, amazing, eating machine\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">As its said in the brief description this interactive means to collect stories related to weight gain in the life of normal couples. Although not really my kind of cup of tea, gay stories ( as well as lesbians, ofc) are accepted as long as they keep the focus on the weight gain situation. both male and female can gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Apart from that is basically free territory, although I've got to have some ground rules to be placed:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Decent grammar and decent sized chapters. Chapters composing of only two or three lines will not be accepted, except for special cases as the need to list for multiple choices( if in doubt send me a note and we will see).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- No Scat, Poop and any other related fetish involving dirty activities with urine and feces and /or similar, unless is in a <b><u>VERY</u></b> mild manner . A general Slobbines can be accepted but, again, only in a generalized way. <i>Sorry, I\u2019m a devious man with many fetishes but, even I\u2019ve got my limits.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n- There is no limit in growth/gain/stomach capacity/\u2026 as far as I\u2019m concerned but, please, put some effort into it. Don\u2019t let the main character ( or whoever else) gain hundreds of thousand pounds in just one sentence. I\u2019m the first that prefer quantity over quality, but even I describe the action, a little bit at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Leave always a choice, it is an interactive after all. Do not force the reader to follow your path, give always a way to change or twist the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- The laws of reality don't apply here. There can be magic, weird ray guns, little aliens and whatever comes to your mind (as long as it doesn't break the previous rules), just put some effort into it, please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Sex is allowed, just try not to be too graphic about it or to focus too much on it. No gender limitations either, just give a warning if things are going to be Hot in the chapter ;)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- No underage sex, all persons engaging in sexual activities will have to be 18+<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Kids can be included, either if considered as a couple or the sons and daughters of said couple, and can gain weight as well (as long as it doesn't break the afore mentioned rules)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast but not the least, have fun, enjoy and write on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoy! </td>",
