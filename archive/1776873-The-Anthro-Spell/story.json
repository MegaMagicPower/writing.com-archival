Most of the homes are small huts made of wood and some of them are made of clay topped with hay roofs. A few farm houses are set on the hills over the east and the south. A large pond is off to the north, and the sea is way off to the west. The village lights the torches through the streets, illuminating the entire village. Kids began to play around, and some of the adults were walking about. A large, muscular man dressed in tan animal hide outfit was wondering the streets. He had blue eyes, brown hair, and had a bushy beard. Walking beside this tough man, was probably the most beautiful woman in the whole village. She had long blone hair, green eyes, and tan skin. She wore a nice red dress made of wool. She had a slender body, but her belly was extended.. The two were holding hands as they walked down the streets. They looked at each other and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe that our child is almost here\" said the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot either dear\" said the man. \"I know it will be rough to raise a family, but we can manage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes we can Zaggar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the woman stopped walking and held her stomach. She nearly fell over, but Zaggar prevented her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jade!\" he said. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Z-Zaggar...\" she said. \"T-The...b-baby...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZaggar grabbed his wife and carried her to a larger hut. The woman inside immediately knew what was happening, and helped the woman to a bed. Outside, a shadowy figure was looking through a window. Its eyes were red, and its teeth were white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid mortals\" it said. Its voice was deep and sinister. \"Those humans don't know the true meaning of life. Especially that hunter. Killing monsters like they were simple houseflys. That man needs to be taught a lesson on the true meaning of a life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark figure waved its hands around, and a faint red light followed. The shadow laughed before he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will definitely teach them a lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade is sitting in the bed, looking exhausted. She looked up at Zaggar and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did it honey\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes we did\" said Zaggar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe baby was wrapped in a light blue blanket.

Further removing the blanket, revealed that it was a dragon with a human body. Its underbelly was a lighter shade of black. It had small growths on its back that would eventually grow into wings. It had a tail with a larger scale on the end of it. It had a small muzzle, and small, rounded horns on its head. Its small hands and feet had small black claws. It tugged at the blanket to cover itself up. Jade and Zaggar looked at each other in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zaggar...how...?\" asked Jade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not know\" replied Zaggar. \"But, what do we do? I feel a little uncomfortable having a child that looks like a beast that I onced killed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade brought the young dragon closer to her. \"I am not letting you kill our child!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would never do that.

But sometimes, he would go sneak a peek at the woods in broad daylight every once in a while. Apparently, today was his unlucky day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother, father, why am I so different from everyone? I don't even look like you two.\" His parents casted concerned glances to each other. There was a silence until Jade spoke. \"Because Zan, you are special. And I just know that you will live a life that will go down in history. Now you should get some rest now, okay?\" \"Okay!\" Zan, instantly filled with happiness at his mother's words, climbed into his bed and dozed off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Elesa was walking along the forest path just as the sun began to rise. She always enjoyed walking through the forest at that time. She had long golden hair and blue eyes. She left in her white night gown that stopped right above her small feet. Her skin was a deep tan from being outside for a while. At age 14, she was a blessed angel. She was carrying a bag with supplies just invade she got into any mishaps. While walking, Elesa heard a bracket snap and saw a black figure tumble down the cliff. She ran near the spot and ducked behind the bushes. When Elesa peered put, she gasped in awe. In front of her seemed to be like a human mixed with a dragon. It also seemed like a male. He had black scales that made him barely visible to the given amount of light. Two grand wings spread across him as well as a tail. Elesa stared in awe, but noticed something. One of his wings seemed to be snapped back and a bone was out of his leg. The strange creature was wincing in pain. Elesa was slightly scared, but she need to help. She even had supplies to help! She stood up and walked out from the bushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZan was trying to ease the pain of his wing and leg so he could get home. He knew he would be in big trouble when he got home. Then, he heard the bushes beside them rustle. Zan turned his head to find one of the most beautiful girls he has ever seen. Her long golden hair seemed to glow in the soon to be gone darkness. Her blue eyes glistened like the water of a pond at sunset. Her skin was a wondrous tan that very few people could obtain. She was walking closer to Zan. But, he moved back. If that girl was seen with him she would get hurt by some of the other teens. however, she kept approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please....let me help you...\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice was like a harp playing and a angel singing in perfect harmony. Zan was soothed by her speech, but still moved back. His wing and leg were feeling worse and worse everytime. Eventually, the girl approached Zan too quickly for him and she pulled out something from her bag. Zan was scared; most people tried to kill him before with a hidden dagger. But instead of feeling the cold of the dagger, he felt a warm and gentle touch. Zan opened his eyes and saw the girl tending to his broken wing. She was spreading this substance over it that stung at first, but made the pain quickly vanish. Afterwards she tied some bandages over it to keep it from moving much. The girl did the same to Zan's leg but she had to force the bone back in. It hurt Zan greatly but he tried not to move much. After she was finished, Zan began to stand up; keeping his leg stiff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElesa couldn't believe how tall the creature really was. The boy was nearly two feet taller than her! The creature began to turn to leave, but he fell to one knee after only taking a step. Elesa ran next to him but he pushed her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just go where you came from...\" he said in a deep voice. \"I don't want you to get Hirt, so you can't be seen with me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElesa was surprised that the boy could speak. Now that she was relatively closer Elesa could see the well toned muscles in his arms, legs, and chest. He almost had a six pack. She could see it in his eyes that he was concerned for her well-being. The boy tried to take another step but the same result happened. Only this time, Elesa went under his arm to try and stop the impact. It was hard for her, but she wanted to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZan was surprised by this human girl's actions. No one has ever treated him like this except for his parents. The girl was struggling to keep him off his leg. He felt like pushing her away again, but that might drive her away...</span></div></div>",

She won my trust, no one could be that pretty and nice and not be trustworthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room fell silent again. Each member of the household had a different expression on their face. Zaggar was shocked that someone has seen his son. He wants to make sure that he is safe as well as him and his wife. Zan had the mixed emotions of depression and confusion. He was sad that he went against his father's orders and confused because of him telling his story being a good thing. Jade, however, was the only person with a smile. She was glad to hear someone helping her son for a change. But that's not all. She also detected a small feeling of love in Zan's words. It wasn't that surprising, she and Zaggar kept Zan contained for years and Zan knew nothing about communication.</span></div></div>",

Zan's eyes went wide as Elesa unlatched it and placed it around Zan's neck. Elesa pulled out another necklace, but this one was white. She placed it around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elesa...this is amazing...\" said Zan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you would like it\" she replied. \"I have one too, so that way we can tell who we are if we don't see each other again. Promise me you will never take it off...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElesa had her hand on Zan's muscular chest. Zan placed his clawed hand over hers, \"I promise...\" Elesa smiled and embraced Zan in a hug. Zan smiled along with her. Elesa has done a lot for him. He wanted to do something for her. His face then flashed with an idea. He got up, getting out of the loving embrace that Elesa had on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Zan?\" Elesa asked while looking at the horizon. \"The sun is not up yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Elesa, but I had an idea\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An idea of what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZan's wings extended to their fullest length. His wingspan was nearly fifteen feet across. \"An idea how to repay you for your kindness. Grab onto my back...\" Elesa walked over and wrapped her arms around Zan's thick neck. Elesa still couldn't believe how much muscle Zan had. Even though he was part dragon, most human males would die for this much muscle. She couldn't help but to blush at the sheer toughness of his muscles. Zan began to walk towards the edge of the cliff. He flexed his wings and jumped. Elesa was surprised by this. Zan never flies before so she closed her eyes and held on tightly. Zan, on the other hand, knew how to. It came to him as soon as he jumped. It was almost like an instinct. He beat his wings and flew successfully. He waited till he was above the cloud layer to tell Elesa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elesa, open your eyes\" said Zan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElesa was hesitant, but her eyelids slowly opened. She gasped at the sight below her. The full moon was illuminating the ground beneath them. The small villages were now tiny clusters of light. The distant lake shimmered in the moon's light. Elesa was happy, happier than she has ever been in her whole life. Zan was content as well. He has never felt this experience; both flying and being around other people. After what seemed to be hours, Zan landed back on the cliff he took off of. But his landing wasn't perfect so Zan and Elesa tumbled a short distance on the top laughing. Elesa landed on top of Zan's chest. She blushed again as she could feel the strong muscles beneath his thick hide. Zan sat up and looked into Elesa's eyes. Her eyes were full of happiness, but they seemed to be filled with something much more. Their faces got closer and closer...</span></div></div>",

All of the other men would always talk to her just to try and see more of her beauty that she shows already (you get what I'm saying right?) Another thing Elesa loved about Zan was his body. Sure, she wasn't those girls that only go with a guy for looks, but Zan was a double deal. Zan had looks and a personality to match. The kiss was finally broken after what seemed like an eternity. Both Zan and Elesa stared at each other with great compassion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the greatest Zan...\" said Elesa while she hugged his massive chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZan returned the hug, but his tail and wings followed. Elesa was covered with nearly every scale on Zan. They kissed once again and kept each other in a loving embrace. Both of their love for each other was so great, it was beyond comprehension. Nothing could ever separate them. They broke the kiss one last time and they both said, \"I love you.\" They kissed again and this one seemed it would never end.</span></div></div>",

The man chuckled as he began to slowly walk around Zan. \"Now now...is that any way to treat someone...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZan grunted as he followed the man, making sure he was in between the man and Elesa. \"You seem like a threat\" he said. \"I can sense something wrong with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I expected as much, I have that effect on mortals.

The man simply laughed, \"Oh, don't worry, I won't do anything...\" A sudden surge of energy burst from the man's loose hand and launched Zan into a tree, \"But nothing said anything about you!\" the man disappeared into a shadow as he laughed. Elesa ignored the man and ran to Zan. Red energy began to absorb into his body and Zan uttered a low growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zan...?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Zan stood to his feet and let a loud roar of pain out.

He wanted to scare his prey first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElesa couldn't believe what she saw. Zan had transformed from her crush to a monster. Zan grew to nearly nine feet tall. His muscles expanded greatly. Although Elesa was fond of Zan's muscles before, these now scared her. His clawed hands once nearly one inch long claws. But now, these claws lengthened to what seemed like eight inches. The horns on his head appeared harder and longer while new ones grew along his spine. His tail was now accompanied with long spikes. But his eyes, his eyes were the most evil of anything. His eyes were blood red with a very thin slit as the pupil. These eyes gleamed at her to the highest level of hatred Elesa has ever seen. What was worse was that growls were escaping through his mouth. Zan was walking slowly towards Elesa, never leaving his stare. Before Elesa could make an attempt to say something, Zan pounced on her with a feral roar. He swung his claws at her wildly, severly tearing the skin on her arm. Elesa managed to escape from under Zan and headed towards the hillside of the cliff. Blood was running down her arm. Elesa needed to get away. Zan though, was not going let her leave. He launched off the ground with one flap of his larger wings. He landed right in front of her and took out her legs with his tail. Not only did she fall, but the spikes also left a large gash in Elesa's leg. Elesa was now on the ground in pain. Blood was flowing out of her with no sign of stopping. Her right arm and both legs were nearly useless. Elesa could only watch as Zan moved closer and closer. He licked his lips and smiled, his new sharper teeth revealing themselves. Elesa made on final attempt to try to get to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zan...please...you can fight this\" she said. \"Zan...look at yourself. People have called you a monster for years, and you never showed anyone that it is true. But now, your what everyone called you; a monster. Please Zan...fight this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's plea was meaningless. Zan didnt even remember who she was. But, something glittered in his eyes.

Blood was spilling out everywhere. Elesa had an expression of fear, but it was the strongest expression he had ever seen before. He looked down at his claws and trembled. Blood. Elesa's blood.

The man said that he would be back, and Zan did not want him to take control again. However Zan thought a little sleep wouldnt hurt so he climbed into the bed next to Elesa. Elesa rolled over in her sleep and wrapped her arms around Zan's chest. The sun wasn't going to rise soon, so Zan and Elesa had some time. Elesa woke up still around Zan. His wings draped over them fully extended. She smiled and kissed Zan's cheek. Zan smiled and slowly opened his eyes. Zan tried to get up but Elesa kept her hands close to Zan's chest. \"I've never had such a great sleep\" she told him. \"Your scales are so warm. I hope my parents like you as much as I do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZan smiled and laid there a bit longer. Eventually the pair got out of the bed. Zan had a quick snack before his parents told him good luck. Elesa was able take off the bandages off of her legs but her wound on her arm was greater. Zan became depressed at this but Elesa kissed Zan on his cheek and said she would make an excuse. A few minutes away from his house, Zan extended his wings and Elesa wrapped her arms around him. Elesa's house was closer to the village than Zan's, but not many people passed by their home. The couple got there in no time. The house was a average sized farm house. Zan stepped to the side of the door as Elesa entered. Immediately, Zan heard her parents greet her. He couldn't hear that well because they went to a different room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElesa was quickly rushed by her parents. Her father was an average sized man with brown hair and brown eyes. Her mother looked nearly identical to Elesa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elesa dear your back!\" said her mother. \"We were so worried about you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elesa...how did you get those bandages?\" asked her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's kinda what I want to tell you\" she said. \"I'll explain everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But first\" said her mother, \"How did your evening with your admirer go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElesa blushed and both of her parents knew the answer immediately. Elesa waited for her parents to sit down. \"After I gave him the necklace, he showed me an experience I will never forget...He's just so handsome and strong...He even saved my life.\" This made Elesa's parents gasp. \"We were resting on the cliff and I nearly fell off. But sadly on the way down my arm met a sharp rock. That's why I have these bandages. Anyway, I invited him over but there's something I need to tell you first. Zan is...different...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Different how sweetie?\" asked her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe it's better for me to show you rather than explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElesa ran to the door and opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZan saw Elesa pop her head out and he followed. He accidentally hit his head on the door frame, causing a giggle from Elesa. Zan was slightly too tall for the doorway and his wings would cause a mess. Elesa noticed this and called her parents over. They stepped into view but quickly became filled with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay...I'm not here to hurt you\" said Zan. \"I just wanted you to meet me. It's true that I saved your daughter's life, but she also helped mine. I fell from the same cliff and damaged my wing and leg. She helped after everything I told her to stay away. I'm happy that I met your daughter. But if you have a problem with me, I will leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three seemed surprised that he said that. Elesa wanted nothing more than for Zan to be with her. However her parents...</span></div></div>",

Trey, Elesa's father, quickly grabbed his daughter and pulled her close. \"Get back you beast!\" he shouted in anger. Zan could not say he expected as much. His wings drooped in sadness as he turned for the door. Janet, Elesa's mother, saw something different. She saw that Zan was a dragon, but behind that scaly hide was the heart and soul of a gentleman. He arrived in a calm fashion, properly addressed himself, and even told then he would leave if he was a problem. There was no monster here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman quickly approached Zan just before he left. \"Zan, why not stay a bit?\" she asked. \"It's bright outside, you would have difficulties going home.\" Before her husband or Zan could protest, Janet grasped his arm and pulled him inside. Elesa fought against her father's grasp and ran to her lover's side. Zan smiled, at least one parent understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrey was both shocked and infuriated. That beast belongs in the woods, if not that then dead. However he knew that going against his wife and daughter would be trouble. He just let them lead that...freak inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZan was lead to the main area, the family room. A simple arrangement of furniture. However the house seemed what most higher officials had. The only thing Zan has ever known was his parent's shack. Janet asked Zan if he was hungry, but the anthro declined. He did not want to be a burden on his first meeting. As her mother was kind and considerate, Elesa's father was the complete opposite. He gave Zan nothing but angry stares and rude comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet excused herself and dragged her husband with her. \"What is your problem?!\" she asked as they were out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our daughter is friend's with a dragon freak monster and your asking ME what's wrong?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our daughter trusts him, as do I...\"</span></div></div>",

But, to Zan's sadness, Elesa let out a heavy sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zan...\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZan slowly walked up towards her.

No. That man. That strange man was to blame. If he never showed up, Zan would have never fallen under his spell. He would have never attacked. Elesa would have been alive. It was all because of the man. Zan thought of this and a growl escaped his lips. His eyes were slowly fading to red and his pupils started to become more like slits. Jade started to become worried about her son. She got up and placed her hand on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zan...? Are you alright...?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Jade did not know was that Zan was effected by the man's spell more than anyone knows. All of the evil and energy that caused Zan to transform were actually still in him. They were only dormant. Zan stood straight up, tilted his head toward the sky, and let out a feral roar. But this wasn't only a roar. A powerful stream of flames poured out of Zan's mouth and burned a hole straight through the ceiling. Jade was forced back from the sheer power of the attack as Zan's body became surrounded in a familiar shade of red. Zan began to change, but he changed even more. His body gained lots more height and muscle. Jade now only stood knee height to Zan as he continued to change. Spikes began to grow out of Zan's shoulders, arms, back, legs, and tail. His wings grew out as the also developed a blade-like edge. His teeth now grew as twice as big. Zan's claws on his feet and hands grew to ten inches as they turned to a blood red shade. Zan roared his feral roar out into the sky again, this time being louder and more deafening. Jade was scared out of her mind. Her kind, gentle son was now this 15 foot monster. His eyes were now filled with the red glow as he stood there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zan...Zan!\" shouted his mother. \"Please calm down!\"</span></div></div>",

Zan looked down at his body; he was scared beyond belief. He landed on the ground with a thud that shook the entire house. He curled up with his knees in his face and began to sob. Jade had no idea what to do. Her son is now taller than she is while sitting! But, this menacing looking monster was her son. She walked up beside him and gently rubbed what back she could reach. \"It's okay Zan...\" she said, \"Everything will turn out alright...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZan suddenly whirled around and loomed over his mother. \"Alright?

The spot where they first met, and where for the first time another person cared for him. Zan couldn't stop crying as he dug a grave. Zan couldn't understand why this would happen to him.

The two gems glowed but Zan never noticed. He talked while he recovered her, \"Elesa...I'm sorry. You don't know how guilty I feel. The necklace you gave me belongs to a caring person, not a monster.\" The hole was covered completely and Zan stood up. \"I don't deserve to be with you anymore, even if you were still alive.

Her tail has grown to about two feet long, and had large one inch long scale on the end of it. Small spikes were around her head, but they were not long. The claws on her hands and feet grew longer, but she was careful Rose walked on her toes instead of her heels like dragons. Her wings were probably her most distinct feature. Rose had a wingspan of about ten feet. The underside of her wings were a dark shade of purple. She lived happily and peacefully with her family.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up to a usual morning. My bed was makeshifted because of my size, but it was comfortable. I got up, stretched every part of my body, and the went to the kitchen. I kept my wings folded up, so I wouldn't cause much trouble. I grabbed some of the fruit and walked out to the fields. I was about to begin my daily chores, when Joseph approached me. Joseph was the younger of the two brothers that I had. He was about five years older than me, but he was still a brother. He had short brown hair, freckles, and strange yellow eyes. He wore th usual work clothes, but those things were nearly rags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rose, I need your help\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma wants me to tear down the old barn.

And we are also short on food too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nails and food...got it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoseph was always like that. He seemed more carefree than his brother and he was always ready to help without hesitation. Even though he was the yonger brother, Joseph was really tall and skinny, almost as tall as me. He was usually smiling and very easy-going. He was always very kind to me and invited me to his friends' parties and worked hard. He always acted as if he didn't notice any...differences...between us...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget to cover yourself first\" reminded Daniel walking with a pile of sticks into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel was the oldest. He was usually gloomy and didn't talk much, but he was a nice and reliable guy. Although, he seemed a bit cold with me sometimes. I cannot blame him, ever since he had to take care of both me and Joseph when we were little. He was always the one in charge and the last to leave the fields. But this time he had a good point. The problem with human clothes is that they don't fit me. Shirts are not designed for people with wings, and neither are pants for people with tails, nor boots for digitigrade legs. I'm also pretty sure that no one has clothes for my size and my...body... I may be different, but I still see the way the local boys look at me. This is why I have to wear a special hand-sewn costume, handmade by my mother. However, it is very hot in the fields during the summer and visitors are very rare so I go around almost naked most of the time. Not that my brothers haven't seen that already...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine...\" I said feeling a bit annoyed. Of course he meant another set of clothes that were meant to disguise me. These were far less comfortable and a real pain to wear when it was so warm. The only \"upside\" is that it covers my entire body without having to be seen. Daniel never wants me to be seen.</span></div></div>",

As I picked up the bag the bell by the door tinkled showing that someone else had just entered the shop.

As the stranger left I turned to see Lawrence considerably paler. I walked over to see emblazoned on the paper were the words \u201cPeople of Cheng Village this a warning of unusual activity in your area. Until this activity ceases or the culprits are apprehended Magistrate Eldmore and Qing warrior E. Huzi are to be stationed in your village until further notice.\u201d I looked at Lawrence to see him staring at me the concern evident in his eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cYou have to leave town now,\u201d Lawrence hissed.<br>\r\nWhat, why!?\u201d I inquired shocked.<br>\r\n\u201cThat man who was just left was Qing warrior,\u201d He whispered, \u201cThe Qing are renowned monster hunters but they normally never leave their desert homes\u2026whatever they promised him was enough to make him forsake his clan.\u201d<br>\r\nThere was a desert a hundred miles east of us and I\u2019d grown up on tales of fearsome warriors from the desert who often hunted the fearsome monsters that roamed the sands but they valued their clans beyond life itself  so if this man had left his clan then he was offered something that would greatly aid his clan. I nodded and hurried out the door and began heading home.<br>\r\n-Somewhere nearby-<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure she\u2019s one of them?\u201d The Magistrate inquired.<br>\r\n\u201cShe is acting odd and out of place,\u201d The Qing warrior answered, \u201cIt is nearly eighty degrees out here and she is wearing a thick dress\u2026A normal person would be dead by now due to heat stroke.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re wrong and he escapes again-,\u201d The Magistrate began.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take the blame for it,\u201d I cut him off,\u201d E.

I whipped around to see a man in a black hooded cloak standing there grinning at me.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve grown into a beautiful young woman,\u201d The man complimented me.<br>\r\n\u201cDo I know you?\u201d I inquired backing away from him.<br>\r\n\u201cNo you don\u2019t,\u201d He answered still smiling, \u201cbut I\u2019ve known you since the day you born.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I questioned trying to figure out what he wanted.<br>\r\n\u201cShall I tell you a secret,\u201d He snickered.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you leave me alone,\u201d I hissed wanting him to go away.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes,\u201d He laughed cruelly, \u201cThey abandoned you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d I stated the fear welling in my chest as the rain started to fall from the clouds.<br>\r\n\u201cYour birth parents threw you away,\u201d He laughed, \u201cThey didn\u2019t want a freak for a daughter\u2026I mean why would any human want a beast such as you as a daughter.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMy family is here,\u201d I roared charging at him in a rage, \u201cI\u2019ll kill you for insulting my family.\u201d<br>\r\nMy cloak had fallen off leaving me in my everyday cloths and as I rushed him I bared my fangs and went to rake my claws across his face but he simply sidestepped and grabbed my throat lifting me into the air.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve another secret for you,\u201d He whispered, \u201cI\u2019m the one who changed you into the monster you are.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about,\u201d I choked out.<br>\r\n\u201cYour birth father had to be punished for killing my minions,\u201d He continued, \u201cSo I decided to transform his first born child into one of those monsters to try and force him to destroy himself by killing you\u2026but he threw you away\u2026but I\u2019ll still have my vengeance when I turn his daughter on him.\u201d<br>\r\nHe was laughing manically at what he said as I saw the energy well up in his hands\u2026I closed my eyes as tears welled up in them fearing that I would never see my family again.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you put her down?\u201d someone questioned by the edge of the woods.<br>\r\n\u201cWho the hell are you,\u201d The man questioned dropping me, \u201cI\u2019ll deal with you later girl.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is E. Huzi,\u201d the newcomer said, \u201cand that girl is under my protection.\u201d<br>\r\nI looked up to see the man in bandages from earlier standing there with a scimitar clutched in his hand and the one eye that could be shone with righteous fury.<br>\r\n\u201cSo you seek to fight me?\u201d the man in black laughed, \u201cThen I shall end your worthless life.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I was witnessing one of the most terrifying yet exciting things ever in my life. These two warriors were attacking each other with almost blinding speed yet neither of them had suffered a single wound. E. Huzi was fighting with a scimitar while the man in black was fighting an ornate sabre. They seemed evenly matched and were blurs in the pouring rain that was falling from the dark thunderheads above. I got to my feet and decided to use this time to find my family. I ran into the kitchen where I found my brothers and mother tied up together back to back.<br>\r\n\u201cRose you\u2019re alright,\u201d The younger brother shouted, \u201cWe were worried.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah we were,\u201d The elder shouted, \u201cbut we can talk about that later\u2026like when we get the hell out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJeez you don\u2019t have to be so pushy,\u201d I sighed.<br>\r\n\u201cRose their right,\u201d My mother sighed, \u201cWe don\u2019t have time to talk.\u201d<br>\r\nI nodded and used my claws to saw through the ropes as I heard the battle pick up outside of the house.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on out there?\u201d the older brother shouted getting up.<br>\r\n\u201cA Qing mercenary is fighting the man in black out there,\u201d I told them.<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a Qing fighting out there,\u201d my mother stated in shock, \u201cAre they fighting to see who gets to kill us?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo the Qing said he was here to protect me,\u201d I answered her question as we hurried out into the downpour.<br>\r\nAs we took off running ignoring the fight we ran into an invisible barrier.<br>\r\n\u201cShit one of them can use magic,\u201d My oldest brother said.<br>\r\nI turned back to see E. Huzi lock blades with the man in black as they fought. E. Huzi seemed to be running out of strength much faster than his opponent and I saw that he was favoring his left leg quite a bit. I knew we had nowhere to go and our fate was entirely in the hands of the warriors but I wanted to do something but knew I there was nothing I could do. E. Huzi\u2019s attacks were becoming much slower and the man in black\u2019s attacks was still just as savage as in the beginning. All of a suddenly the man in black knocked aside the now weakened defenses of E. Huzi and to my horror ran him through with his sword.<br>\r\n\u201cYou were a fool to fight me on your own,\u201d the man in black taunted.<br>\r\n\u201cA fool with a plan is still better than a genius winging it,\u201d E. Huzi laughed, \u201cI thought you would know that better than anyone Artemis?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you call me?\u201d The man in black inquired the fear in his voice.<br>\r\n\u201cYour name,\u201d he answered pulling himself off of his enemy\u2019s blade, \u201cor have you forgotten Artemis?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026you can\u2019t be him,\u201d Artemis stated panicking, \u201cYou can\u2019t be him\u2026you can\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cArtemis I know you\u2019re not a fool,\u201d E. Huzi stated, \u201cYou know who I am and you know I\u2019m not a fool either.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEvans why would you do this?\u201d Artemis yelled, \u201cWhy did you attack me alone\u2026you\u2019re so much better than this.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou should know me better that,\u201d E. Huzi/Evans laughed coughing up blood, \u201cI\u2019ve never fought someone like you alone\u2026someone who\u2019s taken the dark path for personal gain.\u201d<br>\r\nAs Evans fell back against a tree just behind him a grin on his face as his eyes closed and lightning split the sky behind us revealing the shadows of a group of people standing on our roof. I whipped around to see people in strange robes. They were all the same except for different patterns and colors on them. The robes main color was white, two of them had green hoods with opposite green sleeves, one of them had a red hood with a red line going down the back from the hood, and the last one had a blue hood a blue right sleeve and an angled blue bar stretching from his right shoulder to his left hip.<br>\r\n\u201cArtemis Talon you are to be executed for crimes against both the order and humanity,\u201d the man in blue snarled.<br>\r\n\u201cMaster Corbain!\u201d Artemis shouted, \u201cNo\u2026you can\u2019t execute me\u2026not when I\u2019m so close!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMaster Talon shall be avenged,\u201d One of the men in green snarled.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we shall not allow you to defile your brother\u2019s deeds,\u201d the second man hissed.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare accuse me of defiling my brother\u2019s name,\u201d Artemis shouted the tears running down his cheeks, \u201cYou\u2019re the bastards who took him from me\u2026He should have been the one leading my families forces to victory\u2026not me\u2026you destroyed my families work\u2026you used my brother and I\u2019ll kill you all!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt was not we who thought of this strategy,\u201d the man in red shouted angrily, \u201cIt was your brother\u2019s plan\u2026to lure you here and finish you\u2026all in the name of redeeming his family name\u2026so don\u2019t you dare slander him.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve talked enough,\u201d Master Corbain stated, \u201cBalo, Malo grab Master Talon and get him out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cRight sir,\u201d The two men in green shouted leaping of the rooftop their spears still strapped to their backs.<br>\r\n\u201cMaster Alvarez,\u201d Master Corbain scowled, \u201clet us attack this fool together.\u201d<br>\r\nBoth Corbain and Alvarez leapt of the roof Corbain having drawn his Rapier while Alvarez drew his Crescent Blade and together they both charged Artemis with a fury that would have given a dragon pause.<br>\r\n\u201cHey dragon lady,\u201d one of the greens called, \u201cGet that door open now!\u201d<br>\r\nI looked over to see them both carrying Evens while approaching our houses door. I ran over to and opened it and as they carried him in they motioned for us to follow them. When we were all in and they had once again secured the door they set about tending their comrade.<br>\r\n\u201cMalo,\u201d the one knew as Balo said, \u201cYou need to start healing his wounds before he bleeds out all over the tower.\u201d<br>\r\nAs Malo reached to peel back the bandages a clawed gauntlet shot out and gripped his wrist.<br>\r\n\u201cMalo\u2026just heal the damn wound with magic,\u201d Evens snarled.<br>\r\n\u201cMaster that will only heal it a little,\u201d Malo warned, \u201cand I know what you\u2019re thinking and I would advise against it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m the master here not you and I said heal it!\u201d Evens hissed through the pain, \u201cWe can worry about proper healing once I\u2019ve ended my brother\u2019s madness.\u201d<br>\r\nMalo shook his head while Balo looked out the window grinning at their master\u2019s defiance as Malo set about healing his wound with magic and I stood there in awe as I saw the wound close up. I then saw the bandages rework together as if they had never been removed. As Evens got up and adjusted his gauntlets he reached up and pulled off the bandages around his head revealing a handsome man with silver unkempt hair, storm grey eyes shot through with red and a vertical scar over his left eye. Wait did I just think of him as handsome\u2026what is going on with me. <br>\r\n\u201cMalo, Balo stay here and protect this family,\u201d Evans stated a grin on his face, \u201cI\u2019ve got some family counseling to attend to.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cRight Master,\u201d They said in unison saluting.<br>\r\nI watched as Evens walked towards the door with a malicious grin on his face.<br>\r\n\u201cMaster, don\u2019t forget this,\u201d Balo said tossing Evens a longsword that had a strange rope attached to it.<br>\r\nEvens caught the blade and then walked out the door which caused me to run to the window. Which is when I saw something that made me wonder about who this evens really was and why he had followed me. I saw him holding his blade in a reversed grip spinning the rope which I saw had a knife like weapon attached to the end. I saw him shout something at his brother which drew Artemis\u2019s attention and I saw his eyes widen in fear as the rope knife struck him in the throat which I then saw was attached to the hilt of the blade. He yanked on the rope which must have been enchanted as it pulled Artemis all the way to Evens who ran him through with his sword and as Artemis died I saw Evens lean forward and whisper something to his brother before the light left his eyes. Alvarez and Corbain approached Evens and he motioned them to step into the house just before he collapsed and as he did my world went dark.<br>\r\n(If author allows I would like to reserve this path for myself. If he disagrees please message me. If he agrees I will mark paths I will continue on in this path with my handle Masterblade. Below is just an example but it is also one I want to continue)</span></div></div>",

My memories of the past battle were blurry as I knew that my brother was dead by my own hand but I could not remember how exactly I did it nor could I entirely remember who I\u2019d followed just that she\u2026or he maybe\u2026I\u2019m not sure\u2026wasn\u2019t human.<br>\r\n\u201cEvens,\u201d a voice whispered to me in the darkness, \u201cit\u2019s time to get off of your ass.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMaster Corbain, is that you?\u201d I inquired as the darkness began to recede from my vision.<br>\r\n\u201cEvens you may only be 25 years of age,\u201d Corbain growled, \u201cbut you\u2019re still a master and therefore my equal.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll always be my master though,\u201d I laughed through the pain, \u201cafter all you trained me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLook we\u2019ve bigger problems to deal with,\u201d Corbain sighed, \u201csuch as the dragon girl.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDid you say dragon,\u201d I hissed sitting up so fast the room around me spun, \u201c\u2026please tell me you didn\u2019t say dragon.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI wish I could,\u201d Corbain stated patting me on my bandaged shoulder, \u201cand with your families abilities that would mean that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026That I\u2019ve bonded with her haven\u2019t I?\u201d I inquired, \u201cDamn it\u2026damn it\u2026I should have been more careful.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve proof not that you asked,\u201d Corbain sighed, \u201cWhen you collapsed she feinted\u2026so somehow your link is already strong.\u201d<br>\r\nI believe that this situation will require some detail on my family. I\u2019m from the noble family Talon that has in the last decade been nearly eradicated as me and my brother were the only ones left but since I executed him I\u2019m the last one left of my line and people in my family had strong connections to the dragon genus. Our family could form mental links with creatures of the dragon genus that were so strong that even  if the pair was separated by hundreds of miles they could still communicate with each other. Other benefits were that if the human bonder could use magic (Like myself) then their magical abilities would be greatly enhanced, their physical abilities would grow as well, and their senses would also sharpen to a razors edge. Some negative effects were that the partners emotions could easily effect the other\u2019s such as if one was severely angry then the other then the other will also seem short tempered.<br>\r\n\u201cI just don\u2019t understand,\u201d I growled, \u201cShe\u2019s a damned hybrid\u2026more than that she\u2019s one of my brothers goddamn experiments.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Corbain barked at me, \u201cShe\u2019s your responsibility even if this situation is undesirable.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the biggest friggen understatement of the century,\u201d I snarled, \u201cI\u2019ve got too much to do to train her in the arts!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got no choice,\u201d Corbain sighed, \u201cunless you run like a coward and if you do you know the order will cast you out.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPlease leave me alone,\u201d I stammered trying to hold back the tears, \u201cI-I need time to think.\u201d<br>\r\nCorbain nodded and left me alone as I thought about my choices\u2026I would not run\u2026but I wasn\u2019t ready to train this creature\u2026I could barely keep Malo and Balo in line so how would I keep a dragon in line. I wasn\u2019t going to lie\u2026I was terrified of the creature\u2026it could probably tear me apart without a second thought even if I defended myself with my magic. I looked around the room to see I was in a loft most likely tucked away somewhere in that old farmhouse. I got out of bed and turned to see my robes, twin launchers, my sword lain out for me, and all of the accessories. I slipped on my robes which were similar to others of the order with my design being the hood blue, both sleeves are blue, a blue line down the back of my robes, and an x across my chest stretching from my shoulders to my hips. I put my left hand into a group of leather belts that then shot up my arm where they locked themselves into place from my shoulder to my wrist. I attached my launchers to my wrists and strapped my sword to my back with the hilt turned down. As I looked around I knew I wasn\u2019t going to run away but I needed a quiet place to think but where should I go.<br>\r\n(The launchers are pretty much hidden blades that can fire their blade attached to a rope that the wielder can manipulate with magic and the rope is technically infinite\u2026for an example look up the Shaman King Character Lyserg\u2026His dowsing pendant is very similar to the launcher)</span></div></div>",

I\u2019d just killed my only brother and I was apparently bonded with one of his experiments. I looked around at the battle damage from the fight with my brother and witnessed my order brothers aiding with the repair of the farm and the surrounding territory. Master Alvarez was helping the dragoness hybrid tear down the barn by using an ax to cut the timbers into more manageable pieces so Malo and Balo can stack them. Master Corbain was healing the wounds that had been afflicted on the land during the battle with my brother. An old woman was knitting something while the two brothers were tending to the animals. During this time I had formulated a plan which would involve take advantage of the hybrids dragonish pride which would not let her turn down the challenge. I leapt off of the roof landing with a thump near the old woman who looked at me for a second before returning to her work, I began approaching the dragoness who turned to look at me a look of relief on her face, and when she did pain ripped across my mind from the link I shared with her causing me to stutter step. Damn it\u2026have I distanced myself from emotions for so long they hurt\u2026I\u2019ve lived with anger and hatred for so long\u2026why the hell is she blushing\u2026I must push these thoughts aside. As I regained my composure my order brothers approached me and questioned me for the reason of my appearance outside.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m here to challenge the hybrid to a duel,\u201d I hissed.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you insulting my sister,\u201d The younger brother accused.<br>\r\n\u201cNo he isn\u2019t,\u201d The older brother sighed, \u201cA hybrid is a being that has been born of two parents of different races\u2026like our sister.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut why do you wish to duel me?\u201d The dragoness questioned shyly.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re an experiment created by my brother,\u201d I told her dryly, \u201cand it\u2019s my duty to either arrest you or if you resist to kill you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThen what\u2019s the point of the duel?\u201d the younger brother shouted, \u201cIt seems to me that no matter what my sister dies.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat is not the reason,\u201d I scowled, \u201cIf I win she comes with me regardless of her preference but if she wins she will remain here under the supervision of the order.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is the name of your order?\u201d the old women inquired getting up and approaching the group.<br>\r\n\u201cWe are the Order of Yggdra,\u201d Master Corbain sighed, \u201cWe\u2019ve been charged with maintaining order and stability throughout the world.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd when Artemis went mad over the death of his family about a decade ago,\u201d Master Alvarez began, \u201cWe set about seeking a way to defeat him but were loath to eliminate one of the oldest noble families in the world\u2026that is until we found his younger brother in the desert to the east of us five years ago.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThere was a reason I arrived disguised as one of the Qing,\u201d I told them, \u201cMy father\u2019s wife died but a year after her death he fell in love with a Qing woman and soon after they met he was called away to the Imperial capital\u2026but the Qing woman was soon found to be with child\u2026I never saw my father so I\u2019m not sure he ever knew that he had a bastard son with the Qing woman\u2026but until five years ago my name was E. Huzi and I was one of the best warriors of my clan but I was found by Master Corbain who explained to me who I really was and that I had a duty to stop my brother and his plots\u2026but I was terrified to leave my clan knowing that if I left I would never be able to return\u2026but the clan leader came to me and told me that I was not just Qing but also a warrior of another people and that these people were also my clan so I was not technically abandoning my clan but going to help an extension of it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo what does that mean?\u201d The younger brother asked confused.<br>\r\n\u201cIt means that he can return to the Qing,\u201d the older woman said, \u201cSo I guess that\u2019s where you learned to use your unique weapon.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes Mrs.\u2026forgive me I never learned your name,\u201d I said with a slight bow.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Helm,\u201d She answered, \u201cand before you duel my daughter her name is Rose.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cForgive me Mrs. Helm,\u201d I apologized, \u201cbut I must do this to attempt to atone for my brother\u2019s sins\u2026but as a sign of good faith I\u2019ll allow your daughter to pick what weapons I\u2019m allowed to use.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFine then you can\u2019t use your sword,\u201d She hissed the blush disappearing from her face to be replaced by a defiant look.<br>\r\n\u201cFine,\u201d I chuckled unsheathing my sword and tossing it to Balo who caught it in his hands with a worried look on his face.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you want to do this master?\u201d Balo questioned, \u201cYou\u2019re still wounded from the battle with your brother.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBalo don\u2019t you dare doubt Master Evens,\u201d Malo hissed, \u201cHe could beat her scaly ass blindfolded.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMalo I know I said this before,\u201d I sighed embarrassed by my apprentice\u2019s arrogance, \u201cbut shut your trap before I shut it for you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe fight shall begin on the count of three,\u201d Master Corbain stated.<br>\r\nI was debating what I should do because even though I\u2019d lost my sword I still had my launchers, magic, and if it came down to it I could probably manipulate her through our mental connection but to use them would be dishonorable but to not use them could very well cause me to reopen my wounds\u2026and besides if she was to become another apprentice of mine she would have to learn that in battles like this when so much was at stake honor was expendable for order and efficiency but this could very easily damage her own sense of honor and push her towards the edge like my brother.<br>\r\n\u201cThree!\u201d Corbain yelled as she rushed at me.<br>\r\nI needed to make my decision now.</span></div></div>",

I reappeared to the left of her where I drove my elbow into her temple stumbling her but she still had the state of mind to lash out at me but I had already vanished only to reappear directly in front of her where I punched her so hard in the stomach she was actually lifted off the ground but before she could do anything I backpedaled a few steps to put some distance between us.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re cheating,\u201d She grunted glaring at me.<br>\r\n\u201cYou said no sword,\u201d I corrected chuckling, \u201cbut you said nothing about magic or other weapons I may have on my person.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter I\u2019ll destroy you,\u201d She snarled charging at me again.<br>\r\n\u201cTechnique of the nine,\u201d I hissed preforming a different set of hand gestures, \u201cSeal of the Earth!\u201d<br>\r\nI felt my body begin hardening eliminating the bonuses from the wind and I knew that the new bonuses would utterly shock her and give me the edge I needed to keep in this battle. She slashed at me with here claws which skidded harmlessly of my now rock hard skin caused by the spell.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the-oomph,\u201d She was cut off as I slammed my fist into her stomach and sent her flying into a nearby tree which splintered upon her impacting with it.<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d the younger brother cried, \u201cHe\u2019s killed her.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t interfere,\u201d the old woman said as the older brother grabbed him, \u201cIf you do they\u2019ll execute her.\u201d<br>\r\nI stood there not approaching as I could tell from the link I shared with her that she was only slightly battered and still capable of fighting but I wasn\u2019t going to give her time to recover her strength.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve also made the mistake of not checking me over for other weapons,\u201d I laughed launching one my hidden blade weapons and as it flew into the dust I manipulated it so it wrapped the rope around her leg and drug her out of the cloud where I then I slammed her into the ground just in front of me where she laid twitching and breathing heavily.<br>\r\n\u201cYou damn bastard,\u201d She roared springing to her feet lunging at me again her claws surrounded in a strange green aura.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell,\u201d I roared in pain as her claws raked across my midsection bypassing the spell and doing some serious damage to my midsection.<br>\r\nI was stunned and completely caught off guard by the ferociousness of her attacks\u2026I was so caught off guard that I unleashed the power sealed in the darkest parts of my soul.<br>\r\n\u201cDark Gale,\u201d I roared feeling the power well in my extended hand and as it was released with the force of a bomb destroying the entire area in front of me as I propelled myself backwards into the side of house but the spell had a downside damaging the nerves in my hand.<br>\r\n\u201cEvens,\u201d Master Corbain snarled, \u201cYou must control yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish master,\u201d I huffed a small malicious grin on my face\u2026I\u2019d just fed the dark part of my soul and it would take a little while to fade.<br>\r\nAs the dust settled Rose stood on the other side of a twenty by thirty crater staring at me in disbelief.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you?\u201d She inquired the fear evident in her voice.<br>\r\n\u201cArk of light,\u201d I began chanting, \u201cOpen to aid you master\u2026Reveal yourself Nimall.\u201d<br>\r\nA creature appeared in a flash of light. The creature looked like a pink furry ball with a set of shiny black eyes, and four angel like wings, and landed on my outstretched hand.<br>\r\n\u201cNimall commence healing,\u201d I ordered as the light spread healing my wounds and repairing my clothing, \u201cNimall you are dismissed.\u201d<br>\r\nNimall disappeared in a flash of light leaving me standing there grinning at the shocked look on Rose\u2019s face.<br>\r\n\u201cTo answer your question I\u2019m the last member of the Talon Family,\u201d I hissed, \u201cI\u2019m the last person capable of wielding the Forbidden Arts as you\u2019re about to witness first hand.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she shrieked at me the panic evident in her voice.<br>\r\n\u201cForbidden Technique,\u201d I hissed preforming a completely new set of hand gestures, \u201cPentagram of Chains!\u201d<br>\r\nWhen I finished the spell, chains appeared forming a Pentagram Star which then immobilized the Dragoness. I slowly approached her, the grin returning to my face as I knew that I had a distinct advantage, and I wasn\u2019t going to waste it.<br>\r\n\u201cTechnique of the nine,\u201d I shouted performing several quick hand gestures, \u201cSeal of the Flame, Pillars of Fire!\u201d<br>\r\nThis spell unlike the others was not meant to enhance or hinder my foes but to launch a devastating attack against by summoning several pillars of fire to scorch the battlefield clean of the foe and this spell was doing just that as Rose was completely immobilized by the Pentagram of Chains spell she had no chance to dodge it at her current strength.<br>\r\n\u201cYou should just surrender,\u201d I laughed sensing that victory was within my grasp\u2026.but something was wrong\u2026she wasn\u2019t getting weaker\u2026she was getting stronger, \u201cWhat is happening\u2026her power shouldn\u2019t be increasing this rapidly.\u201d<br>\r\nI forced my pillars of fire to converge into a massive rotating column of flame but she still wasn\u2019t weakening and then her claws appeared outside the flame shredding it to pieces along with the Pentagram Star. She glowed with a cruel green light that I\u2019d only seen once before when I met a dragon before.<br>\r\n\u201cEvens her dragon blood is awakening,\u201d Corbain warned.<br>\r\n\u201cI-I-I know,\u201d I hissed terrified by this turn of events, \u201cBut what do I do?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGrrr,\u201d She growled the animalistic side of her mind taking over, \u201cRwarrrrr!\u201d<br>\r\nShe charged me and I knew that I couldn\u2019t take a direct attack from her when she was in this state and so I needed to buy myself time.<br>\r\n\u201cChains of Binding,\u201d I shouted as many thick chains appeared out of portals only to wrap themselves around Rose in an attempt to buy me much needed time but to hold the spell I couldn\u2019t move.<br>\r\nI needed to figure out how to halt her rampage with as little collateral damage as possible but the question was how\u2026I had several spells that could immobilize her but the ranged ones she could probably deflect while the melee range ones would put me in the very dangerous position of being in her preferred attack range which would not be a good idea. I could feel the spell quickly weakening from her own instinctual counter spells and I knew I needed to think more quickly. Wait\u2026Maybe I can use the bond we share to immobilize her for a few seconds\u2026she probably doesn\u2019t even know it exists\u2026I even know what attack I\u2019ll use. I released the spell giving me a split second to activate my next spell.<br>\r\n\u201cTechnique of the nine,\u201d I shouted preforming the hand gestures, \u201cSeal of Lightning\u201d<br>\r\nShe broke the chains and rushed at me hand back to rake me with her claws and I knew I only had one chance for this so when she was only a couple of paces from me I launched my mental barrage but it was a couple of seconds too late and her attack connected raking across my chest but the pain dulled the attack tearing my skin but not my robes. She doubled over from the pain I began wracking her mind with and I struck out with my electrified fists in an attempt to disrupt her nervous system and cause her to pass out. I struck her in the stomach in the hopes of stunning, then I moved to her right side where I drove my fingers into her temple in an attempt to shock her brain, and finally I moved behind her placing my hand on her spine while at the same time unleashing wave after wave of electrical energy. As I watched her eyes dimmed and eventually closed as she passed into unconsciousness and hit the ground with a slight cloud of dust. I stood there covered in dirt and blood but I stood there grinning knowing that if she could control that power she would be an extremely valuable asset for the order.<br>\r\n\u201cRose!\u201d the younger brother screamed as he, the older brother, and the old woman ran towards her, \u201cWhat did you do to her!?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI put down what could have easily become a rampaging beast,\u201d I hissed turning and walking away, \u201cbut I expect her to honor her bargain with me\u2026She is to report to the village in three days\u2026and don\u2019t worry the worst that will happen when she wakes up is she\u2019ll probably be unable to talk properly for a while.\u201d<br>\r\nI turned and walked away from them leaving the farm behind but followed closely by my order brothers.<br>\r\n\u201cYou should get your wounds examined,\u201d Alvarez said.<br>\r\n\u201cI know but I\u2019ll wait until where back at the village,\u201d I huffed feeling the blood beginning to trickle from my wound.<br>\r\nRose had caught me with that last attack and though it couldn\u2019t be seen I would need medical treatment before we left the village and then there were the consequences of using Dark Gale which damaged the nerves in my hand so I couldn\u2019t use it well and that would need magical treatment.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure she\u2019ll honor the deal?\u201d Balo asked.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know but I\u2019ll worry about that when we get to it,\u201d I sighed wishing I was in a soft bed right now, \u201cWow I\u2019m tired\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nI blacked out as soon as I finished that\u2026maybe my wounds were more severe than I thought.</span></div></div>",

was black, and the secondary color was blood red with the same pattern as Evens.<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d I asked slightly afraid of this man.<br>\r\n\u201cWho I am is of no importance,\u201d

words!?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m the last bit of light drowning in darkness and madness,\u201d he sighed, \u201cand as for the words they told me I was invincible, that nothing could defeat me, and

inquired angrily, \u201cHow do we trust them.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThis is my decision,\u201d writing hastily, \u201cI\u2019ll decide what I do with my life not you!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSis I\u2019m just

publicly for forty years,\u201d our mother told us, \u201cand now they emerge a decade after the purge, girded for war.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDo you mean that there\u2019s going to be a war?\u201d my youngest brother asked scared.<br>\r\n\u201cYes as there was forty when the first schism in The Order occurred,\u201d mother explained, \u201cThen the second schism occurred only a decade ago and resulted in the revival of the Scions of the Tenth Seal\u2026They practice the Forbidden Technique of the nine\u2026also known as the Tenth Seal.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWait I thought there was only nine techniques not ten,\u201d my youngest brother said.<br>\r\n\u201cThere used to be ten until during the first schism the first traitor corrupted the tenth technique that was originally known as Technique of the Ten\u2026Seal of knowledge but it was tainted into Tainted Technique of the Ten\u2026Seal of Madness,\u201d she explained, \u201cThis has set the world hurtling towards chaos with no hope of saving it\u2026only slowing its demise.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean\u2026is our world in danger?\u201d My eldest brother asked confused.<br>\r\n\u201cIt is always in danger but with the corruption of the tenth seal people have succumbed to madness,\u201d my mother answered, \u201cand if no one opposes them then they will destroy everything.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhich is why I\u2019m going to join the order,\u201d I croaked my throat dry from disuse, \u201cThey need people to stand against the chaos\u2026and I feel that the people from the order are the best to oppose them.\u201d<br>\r\nMy family was silent the looks telling much as both of my brothers looked worried while my mother looked proud. I knew that I would need to soon meet Evens and that meant I would have to be prepared for whatever he had waiting\u2026but the question was when.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid we don\u2019t have much time Rose,\u201d My mother told me, \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to meet Evens in the town today in disguise.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I should hurry then,\u201d I said getting up and moving to my closet.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not even going to wait are you?\u201d my mother questioned smiling.<br>\r\n\u201cThe longer I wait the more dangerous the world will become,\u201d I told her as I pulled out a pack and began putting spare cloths and the necessary items to repair it.<br>\r\n\u201cBut-,\u201d my youngest brother began.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s her choice and we can\u2019t stop her\u2026she\u2019s nearly a grown woman now,\u201d my eldest brother sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s time she made her own mark on this world.\u201d<br>\r\nMy eldest brother then walked out dragging my other brother out with him I couldn\u2019t help but my mother stood there grinning as she walked towards the wall where much to my surprise a secret compartment opened reveling a splendid robe that seemed to be made of black satin embossed with a pattern of rings along the hem of the robe and the ends of the sleeves. It was beautifully made and as my mother handed it to me I realized that the material was not satin but seemed to be a metal that had been sown into a set of robes.<br>\r\n\u201cThese robes were left for you by a man named Morvain Talon,\u201d my mother told me, \u201cThat man was Evens father and he told me that you had a touch of destiny about you\u2026and that you would become one of the shapers of this world\u2026whether for better or worse.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEvens father met me?\u201d I asked not remembering, \u201cWhen was this?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI was fifteen years ago,\u201d she laughed, \u201cHe knew you were here right away and he gave you these robes.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI wish I could thank him,\u201d I sighed knowing he was dead.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re to meet Evens in town so hurry and disguise yourself\u2026you can put on the robes when you\u2019re taken into the care of the order,\u201d my mother told me sealing my pack with my robe and other attire in it, \u201cHe won\u2019t wait all day before he marches out here and rips you from this house.\u201d<br>\r\nI nodded and once again equipped the uncomfortably thick robes accepting that I would have to hide for a little while until Evens was present because I knew that I was still an outcast but somehow I knew he would protect me. As I finished and began walking to the door I bade my family goodbye and set off down the road to the town knowing that this was the first steps in a grand adventure. When I reached the town I saw that the streets were\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She always wore a fabric shirt that barely covered her massive cleavage. Yes, I said it. Nagas generally don't wear clothes, so Vivian felt weird. But the fabric at least kept her out of the nude.

He was a tall and skinny man. He had black hair, pale skin, and brown eyes. He wore long boots, wore a red long-sleeved shirt, and carried a net full of fish. He just left town, and headed to the docks. A small wooden house was set near the docks. It was small, but looked comfortable. The man had a smile on his face the entire way. Before he entered the house, the man placed the net full of fish in a barrel. He walked in, and immediately saw a woman. She was shorter than him, had similar black hair, blue eyes, and freckles.

They tied my hands and legs together and threw me into a cage. The cage was much smaller than me, and I was completely crammed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" asked my dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This thing was with the princess \" replied the knight. \"We assume that it was trying to harm her so were taking it to our prison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Prison?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prison?

I just sat there and cried, feeling like an animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as Raikou sat and cried in the small cage the guards put him in. I turned to the head guard, who was smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to thank me princess\" he said. \"Although a pay raise wouldn't hurt either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pay raise?!\" I exclaimed. \"You capture an innocent boy, cage him up like an animal, and drag him off to a prison, and you want a pay raise!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The creature was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His name is Raikou, and I was pulling him with me.

I turned my head, since I could not turn my body. I heard her approach me and was about to speak.

I saw the she placed the blanket beside me where I could reach. I felt the first few drops of rain, and then I saw lightning. I grabbed the blanket and wrapped myself. The blanket was soft and warm, but the rain changed that almost instantly. At least I had some resistance. The water soothed me and I fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours of driving through stormy weather, we finally arrived at the castle. The rain stopped, but it looked like it would continue. I ran out of the carriage before anyone to see Raikou. He was asleep with the blanket I gave him around hid body. I smiled, but I lost that smile when the guards intentionally dropped his cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt a large hit all over my body. I woke up and saw that I was dropped. Dafili had an angry look, while the guards were laughing. A man dressed in a robe came walking down the flight of stairs, possibly the king.</span></div></div>",

Maybe your knights maybe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled and we talked for a little while longer, but then I headed to my room. The room was a classic style room with a large bed.

I was about to turn down a corridor, but I saw a figure. It was heading towards the princesses room. I slowly krept behind it and followed. There were no guards by the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Odd...why aren't they there?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked in the room, and saw a large knife. I slammed the doors open and the figure turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will not hurt the princess!\" I shouted. I charged at him, but forgot about the knife. He slashed it at me. Thankfully, he missed my heart but stabbed my chest. I fell to the ground but kneeled. The figure headed towards me again, but some guards ran in and restrained the man.

I heard her get up and sigh, \"I hope your alright Raikou...\" I heard her leave and I opened my eyes. I sat up and inspected my wounds. There were bandages covering my chest where I got stabbed. I tried to get off of the bed, but it hurt like crazy. My skin also felt very dry, I never got any water from last night. I managed to get up, but fell back down. Someone opened the door, and a servant walked in. The servant was female, she had dirty brown hair and red eyes.

In fact...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to remove the bandages until Dafili did the rest. Under the bandages, was nothing! We all gasped, there was no scar, no anything to tell if I was stabbed! The King spoke up, \"Raikou, we found out the information on our intruder last night. He was a mercenary sent by one of our rival kingdom. Usually they don't do anything, but this is a surprise even to me that they would attack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the Kingdom of Hzuio is one of their rivals too.

He tried again, but I did the same thing. The man never gave up, he swung like crazy. But, I was able to dodge all of them. It was getting old though. So I smacked the hand holding the sword, the reaction was him letting go. I swept his legs, quickly got up, and then caught the sword. I pointed it down to his neck, barely pressing against the surface. He glared at me full of anger, but I received applause from the others. The head knight congratulated me, and I performed the rest of the training for the day. It was simple exercise, something I could do forever. The others stopped after a while. I keep forgetting that I am not like most humans. Then again, I wasn't even sure if I was human...\"</span></div></div>",

I learned how to wield a sword, use the terrain around me to my advantage, proper shield use, and much more. Now today, was the day for us to leave. Me and Dafili would travel in a common carriage to not gain any suspicion. But I think the amount of knights in armor surrounding us would definitely cause attention. But I had no control over the matter. As for an even greater disguise, Dafili will be dressed in pheasant clothing. She seemed uncomfortable in them, but I told her she looked nice. This gained another kiss from her and my green scales flushed red. After about three hours, we were packed for the trip. It was going to be a week before we arrive at the kingdom and four days to the next village. The King was outside waiting for us, but to an even greater surprise, so were my patents! I knew my dad was able, but my mother has been sick for months! I instantly ran up to them and embraced them each in s hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! Dad! What are you doing here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We came to say goodbye...\" said my father. \"I knew you would find your love; but to think she was the princess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to my mother, \"Mom...how can you walk...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The King received word of my illness and asked his healers to help. He's such a kind man.\" My mother approached Dafili, \"So your the sweet girl that Raikou was talking about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDafili nodded and this kept going. After our final farewells, I left my parents crying. I never knew if I was ever going to see them again. My mother was not bedridden anymore and I was leaving! But, I was going for the woman I loved, and that was all the better reason for me.</span></div></div>",

As often parents want children to be safe for strangers, this went double for Aaron. Oddly, Anna and Will were not the only couple to have an anthro child. At the start of the year Aaron was born, other woman gave birth to anthros. Doctors and scientist could not find out why. Many school systems had start to prepare for having students that would not be completely human. The press started to go to family's houses who had anthro children. After while things started to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen strange people came up to the parents and offered them money for their children. Many called the police to get rid of them, but they got away before cops got there. Few who rejected the offer had their kids go missing. No trace was ever found. The description of the on who the parents saw was always different from couple to couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one time a man came up to Will and asked him if he would sell his son. Will told the man to leave before he called the cops. Walt was right behind the man and for a seventy two year old retired boxer, he smacked him a good one. The man was arrested by the police shortly after the brawl.  He didn't say anything during the interrogation, but authorities believe who ever he is working for is behind the kidnappings and possibly the anthros being born too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Aaron playing, he saw a white van pull up to the curb and two people came out of it.

Of course, they didn't expect the doctors to keep him or her away for so long. Monica sat on the bed, fearful of her child. She felt like weeping; maybe it was a miscarriage. The doctor and a nurse walked in holding a slightly large bundle of cloth. The bundle was at least larger then what most babies usually were. The doctor walked close to Monica's bed and the nurse followed close behind him. The doctor did not look happy for them. Instantly, the couple almost broke out into tears thinking their first child had died. David was trying to soothe his dear wife's sadness. The moment of sadness ended as the couple heard a slight cry coming from the bundle. The doctor sighed and then finally spoke, \"Well, the child is semi-healthy but, well...just look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor lightly took the bundle from the nurse and gave it to Monica. David removed a bit of the cloth and looked at the child. Both Monica and David were shocked to see what it looked like. The child had two small antennas sticking out of its' head. It had yellow and black striped fur all over it's face. While finding out their child was a girl, they saw she had a small bump on her lower back. The couple saw it was a small, slightly preformed stinger. They were confused and wondered what had happened to their child. She resembled what looked like a giant bee. Monica held their baby girl in her arms, feeling small tears forming in her eyes. David just sat there with a stunned expression on his face. After a while he finally spoke, \"Mom was right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica looked at David both worried and confused, \"She was right about what dear?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears streaked down David's face as he told her, \"On our wedding night, my mother told me she'd curse us both. She did it just for me marrying you. But I didn't think this would happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple cried about that their daughter was now a Anthro creature. Monica and David knew that their child would have a hard time growing up in life. Their daughter opened her eyes and looked at her parents. Before they both realized that she was awake, a buzzing noise filled the room. Their child was flapping the small wings on her back. Taking this as a sign of fear from her child, Monica held her close in a loving embrace. They had to think about what to do. In the end, they decided to keep their unique child and name her Beatrice.

Yeah, that's how I'm unique. I take the basic structure of a human though. My body is covered in short hairs that varies between the colors black and yellow. My hair is black since most of the fuzz on my head it yellow. Two black antennas poke out of my hair and stick out greatly. My eyes are large and all one color like most insects. They are red, but if you look closely I have something like a pupil. Now to get to my body. In human terms, I have a body most girls my age want and what most guys drool over. Yeah, I have an hourglass figure. Even if I'm part bee I still get those looks from other guys. Besides the fact that my body is covered with fuzz, there are some other things to notice. Some bee things. My back has two large clear wings. I can fly, very well actually. On where my butt should be is where I have a stinger. It's pretty long too. It's about a foot long and about four inches thick. My arms and legs are mostly black and my fingers resemble claws. They look like them, but they aren't. There's one last thing about me that definitely makes me look like a bee. You know how most insects have six limbs and humans have four? Well, I have six. I have four arms. But I don't care, they are at most very helpful. Heck, I'm different and I'm proud of it! Another thing to note, I've been homeschooled for the last sixteen years. Yeah, my parents don't want me to catch too much attention. But they're finally allowing me to go to high school! After sixteen long years, I can be with other humans!</span></div></div>",

She jumped out of bed and picked up the outfit she chose yesterday. She ran into the bathroom to take a shower and brush her teeth afterwards. She started to put the outfit on. It was a black long sleeved sweater altered to allow her wings and extra arms through. She had a skirt that reached her knees and had a hole for her stinger. She began to put it on but it was a tight squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me this thing is growing bigger\" she sighed. As she finally got it through, she then placed on white socks and ran out of the bathroom to get going. She grabbed her shoes but her mother stoped her, \"Hold it young lady, sit down and eat. You have time.\" Beatrice sat down on her chair causing her stinger to move up. Her father sitting next to her, \"Hello honey, ready for school?\" He gave his daughter a warming smile and Beatrice smiled back. Her father always seemed to understand her desire to be with others but her mother would probably lock the front door and never let her leave. But she had to let this happen or else her daughter may never grow up properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay dear here just eat some pancakes and you can go\" Monica said as she came back with a small plate of pancakes. Beatrice got up and walked to the fridge. She pulled out a jar of homemade honey; one of her many talents. She learned the bees way to make honey and used the old tool shed as comb storage.  Beatrice opened the jar and poured a little on her pancakes. As she started eating, David got up and grabbed a piece of paper. Beatrice had just finished the last pancake when he handed her the note. It said:\"If you need to leave the school, call me or your mom okay. Also remember, don't let the other kids get to you okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeatrice put the note in her pocket, hugged her father and mother and left. She opened her wings and flew off. The air was rushing around her as she flew. Beatrice decided to fly a few feet into the air to be high enough to avoid cars. She flew to the large building and was very excited. However, she found out that she left her backpack back home. Beatrice checked the clock and laughed; it was 4:30. She needed to be there at 6:00. Beatrice flew a quick dash back home. She found her father outside holding the black and yellow bag in his hands. He gave it to Beatrice and told her to hurry up before mom dragged her back inside. After returning to the school, she saw she was now only a minute early. 5:59 showed on her watch. The doors made a slight click sound as they unlocked. Beatrice's wings fluttered wildly with excitement. After sixteen years, she could become a normal teenager. Well, one with four arms, a stinger, wings and everything else but you get the picture.

Her hair was blonde and her eyes were blue. She was dressed as if she was going to a business meeting. I approached her calmly by slightly flying off the ground. Once she saw me, she freaked out. I had no idea what she was scared about but I continued to advance. She stepped back against the clear glass doors and curled up in a defensive position. She was saying something, but her voice was muffled. I backed up slowly, confused for what I did. Once I was far back enough, the girl finally looked up. Her eyes were filled with complete recognizable fear. I took a step, just trying to be friendly. She crouched again but looked towards the door. A woman was walking out of the front. Without a second to spare, the girl sprinted through the door and flew past the woman. The woman fell as a result. I flew over and stretched my arm out. The woman looked identical to the girl. But unlike the girl, the woman grabbed my hand as I helped her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be that new student, Beatrice correct?\" she said. I nodded and shook her hand. She continued, \"I am Mrs. Brown, your principal. I see you already met my daughter Linda...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was shocked but it made sense. But, her fear wasnt cleared up. \"Excuse me for asking Mrs. Brown, but why was she so scared of me?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry dear, but Linda has a bad experience with bees. For one thing, she's allergic to bee stings. Two, her father was killed by a swarm of bees.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not your fault Beatrice. But with her father's death she freaks out if she even sees a bee. I hope you don't take it personal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'm just worried that the whole school won't accept me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Brown smiled as she lead me inside. She explained that I was a secret. Everyone heard something about me but only heard rumors. I was supposed to make a speech once every kid got here. I was to remain backstage until they all showed up. I didn't mind, I was going to school!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Alright, how does the assembly go...?\"</span></div></div>",
