Like a tape being rewound or put in fast forward, a memory transferred into another without warning. The process lasted for hours. Marge eventually sees, to her confusion, distorted clocks operating in reverse. She also sees her children, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. She becomes more confused than ever when she noticed Bart and Lisa giving her demonic smirks at her level. To her \"children's\" delight, they start to grow bigger before her eyes. She turns to Maggie, who has become a giant compared to her. Maggie takes off her pacifier, forming a smile as demonic as possible with her toothless mouth. Marge tries to run away before Maggie captures her with her giant hands. Maggie brings Marge closer to her face. \"Maggie, no!\" Marge fears for the worst before the horrific images vanished.<br>\r\nMarge wakes up to her bed with Homer (her husband), happy to no longer experience the traumatic nightmare. Before her heart slows down to a normal rate, Marge feels more fear attack her. She sees that the bed she was sleeping on, as well as everything else around her, appears somewhat larger than before. Feeling too shaken up to go back to sleep, she moves out the bed to get some water. While walking out of the bedroom, she trips on something, falling to the ground. Marge looks around, finding out she tripped on her nightgown,which became larger just like the rest of her surroundings. Seeing a connection to her situation, she looks at herself.

In the room is a giant machine with two open chambers big enough for people to get inside. Marge would have been annoyed by the oil and metal debris piled all over the floor, but she is to awestruck by the giant machine to notice. In the back of her mind, she wonders how Lisa is going to bring the contraption to her school and, strangely, whether she has actually seen such a device before.Thinking about the latter, she recalls something about her son, Bart, and a fly. She dismisses the faint memory as a dream, turning to Lisa. \"So I walk into one of these,\" referring to the chambers, \"and come out of another?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes. I already tried out the device myself and came out fine. I just need to see whether it'll work on someone with a differing corporeal form,\" she explains with her advanced vocabulary.<br>\r\nMarge feels somewhat nervous but complies, trusting that she will be fine.

Instead, the machine was... was regressing her. She tried to yell out, but she couldn't control her body none of it. She kept regressing, and regressing, causing her regular attire to engulf her. She had no idea what age she was becoming and couldn't help fearing it. Once it seemed like her clothes were to big, she vanished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSe reappearing in the next teleporter and the lightning receded, but her clothes had changed. As a result, everything fit again. Her green dress was now a green baby shirt, Her neckless was now a red baby bracelet, her panties were a fluffy white diaper, and her high heels were red baby shoes. As for her body, the only recognizable feature was her blue hair. Her hair no longer went up so long, instead it was curly with a little covering her head. Her arms and legs were covered in baby fat and her chest completely flat. Before the door opened, she could see her silvery reflection and noticed what age she was. She cried loudly, hoping the door would open. \"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa didn't hear her until the door opened and was amazed. \"M-MOM! I-I ow my... I created an adult age regression machine!!!\" She ran to her once-mother, picking her up best she could and shaking her back and forth. \"Rock a bye baby in the tree top, if she cries the cradle will drop.\" Marge suddenly calmed down. Lisa relaxed, and said \"Maybe if we spin it in reverse, it'll turn you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Marge could react, Lisa put her back in, but the lightning couldn't reach baby Marge. With her old form, the lightning touched her almost instantly, now however it was nearly impossible. The door opened and Lisa was extremely worried and oddly excited. \"I can't believe it. I, Lisa Simpson, created a machine that turns adults permanently into babies! This is world changing! Good thing I got it all on tape\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarge then cried again and Lisa unexpressed said \"And.. I turned my mother into a baby. Great...\" She comforted Marge again and then went through Maggie's room, looking for an extra pacifier. Luckily, she found one and stuck it in Marge's mouth. Things calmed down and Lisa exhaustingly said \"now what?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kira and Kimi were out of town for a mother daughter trip. The trip would last about a week, give or take. At first the two got into an argument, which was very unusual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on mom, why can't I get my ears pieced? Its perfectly normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't care how normal it is. Your only a middle school, which is way too young. You'll have to wait until you're older.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira didn't want to talk after that point. She knew she wouldn't get the piercing by arguing. The two kept quiet for the remainder of the car ride; Kira put on some music though to lighten the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimi just looked out the window with a scowl on her face. Once the two got to their cabin house, Kimi quickly got her things and dropped them in a room. She went outside to get some peace and alone time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Augh, she's always being the buzzkill in my life. If only I could stop her from being this way.\" Then as Kimi tilted her head up, she spotted a well. \"Eh, what the heck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went up to the well and thought about a wish. 'I wish... I wish my mom would stop telling me what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Kimi know that the wish did work, just not the way she wanted it to. Kimi stayed outside for a bit, not actually believing the wish would work. Meanwhile, Kira was in the queen bed room, reading a book trying to get her mind off of Kimi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought to herself, \"This will end. She never stays mad for too long. Just check on her later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she said that, she started reading her book. Little did she know that regression was happening. It was gradual at first, moving at a regress speed of 1 age per minute. 7 ages down, Kira decided to get a drink of water. She felt a little odd. She was shorter than normal and she could of sworn her blouse was a couple sizes bigger. Her clothes were changing with her though, so it was hard to tell. While she was up the regression wildly sped up, moving to 3 ages in 30 seconds. After getting a drink of water she looked in her bathroom mirror and was flabbergasted. The 36 year old woman looked like she was 16. Not just that, after careful focus she could tell that she was still regressing. Fear started to climb over her, wondering when the regression would stop. She rushed out of the bathroom, only to be even more shocked. Her room had changed, giving the answer. She was regressing to a... to a.. baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer room now had a crib, and changing table. White comfy diapers were stacked of the changing table, along with wipes, powders, and lotions. In the dresser, the clothes she already put away were shrunk to baby size. Her purse was now a pink diaper bag with bottles, pacifiers, and baby lotions. Everything had changed so fast and by the time she was done looking she was age 7. She ran to get Kimi, but she tripped in the living room and started crying. She failed, and in about a minute she was only a 1 year old. Her cries turned into wails at that age. \"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for her clothing, she only wore two things. A lavender baby t-shirt and a big comfy diaper. Kimi was just getting inside when the regression finished. She heard the cries and rushed over to the sound. She was perplexed \"Huh, what are you doing here? Mom! Theres a baby in the house. Whose is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira could still understand her daughter and cried even louder, hearing the question. Kimi heard no response and assumed outloud \"Oh great, she's probably knee deep in some book.\" Then Kimi looked down at the baby, and warmly asked \"Whats the matter baby? Did you hurt yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira only nodded. \"Oh, well don't you worry about that.\" Kimi bent down and kissed the baby's leg. \"Its all better. Now come with me, my mom will know what to do.\" Kimi picked up her babified mom and cradled her on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira calmed down, putting a thumb in her mouth on the way. Kimi checked the only other room, the one her mom was staying in. It finally hit her. She turned to the baby, and asked \"M-mom is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira, with tears in her eyes, nodded 'yes.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimi was stunned. \"Ok, everythings cool. Just mom is a baby. Its cool, its cool. She still remembers who she is. I can fix this, I can fix this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she said those things, Kira couldn't control herself and pooped in her diaper. </span></div></div>",

You don't need that right now. You need a new diaper. Now where are they... Ah there they are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimi carried her mom to the changing table and softly said \"There, there It's alright mom, I'll be you're mommy this week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then unstrapped the diaper and was blasted with a terrible smell. She wanted to scream, but that would only make things worse. So, she quickly removed the diaper. Then, in a confused manner she wiped her mom's butt and applied baby powder. \"There, almost done.\" Lastly, she strapped a new diaper in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were a little sad, but then again Elizabeth wasn't interested in many feminine stuff to begin with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the three of them set up there things in the hotel, they went to a nearby fair. The three dressed warm and casual, wearing red, pink, and orange. They were having fun together with several rides for the first several hours. Then Kira spotted a magic show playing in the next 10 minutes. The three had to enter an auditorium for the show, and surprisingly each had to sign a waver, stating they are fine with any of the effects that will go from the show. Kira and Diane thought it would be fun, but Charlotte saw it as a 'stupid waste of time.' After signing the waver forms, Charlotte said \"That was probably to make it seem like real magic would happen. Its a tactic several magic shows employ nowadays.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira responded \"Even so, this does look like a lot of fun. You wanna go on stage for an act. I'm sure it will be worth the fee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, whatever fine. Its for fun anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat in their seats and the magician soon started casting typical magical moves. Some people, like Kira and Diane, were impressed, while others, like Charlotte, put on a clearly fake smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magician could see these outliers and soon became agitated. \"It would seem some in this crowd are unimpressed. Perhaps, I should show some more unseen magic. To do so though, I'll need two guests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira was quick to raise her hand. \"Oh! OH! Do me and my friend\" she said this while raising Charlotte's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magician could tell Charlotte was one of these outliers, so he agreed. This would be righteous he thought. The two mothers got on stage, one was obviously eager and the other was skeptical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.. I'm planning on making a transformation you see. What similarities might there be in between thee. Before I do, might I ask, what are your names ladies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira was ecstatic and responded for the both of them. \"You may. I'm Kira and this is my friend Charlotte.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, both of those names are pretty. So which one of you will it be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira raised her hand, if she was in school. The Magician gave a chuckle, \"Hmm.. I wonder who to pick\" Then Kira started making more motion to get attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagician laughed louder \"My, my you certainly are a happy one. This isn't school, but I'll allow this gesture. Now, what do you two have in common.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira pointed to herself, \"ahh, you mean me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome, well first I'd like to say thank you so much for picking us. Me and my friend are both mothers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.. Excellent. Well, you wouldn't mind getting in this here photo booth?\" A photo booth suddenly emerged from smoke. The two weren't impressed, though Kira acted impressed. Once they were in, the Magician said \"Who knows what shall happen to our lovely guests.\" For both their sakes, the box had tons of space in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then the inside felt odd. Kira knocked on the door, but it wouldn't open and she couldn't hear anyone. Just seconds ago she could, but all of sudden she couldn't. Meanwhile, the outside couldn't hear a peep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte was becoming annoyed \"Why couldn't you just watch instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry, didn't think this would happen. But, I'm sure, this is just part of the act.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe..\" Charlotte said exhaustively<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed by though, what seemed like 10 minutes in the booth was only 2 minutes outside. The two women started to notice the other shrinking and both said \"Do you feel strange?\" The other responded \"No, why?\" Kira spoke independently first \"Wait.. why are you asking?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte said \"Because you're shrinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira said \"Odd, I was going to say the same thing about you.\" Then the two were scared, but they noticed each others flatter chests. Charlotte said \"Um.. I don't think we're shrinking.. we're regressing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it hit them, both of them screamed. Charlotte was the first to get her composure \"Wha-what age do you think we'll hit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira started answering, \"I-I don't know\" then she cut herself off \"WAIT! The similarity I gave him was that we're both mothers. That's why we're regressing, because of irony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte suddenly got very angry and started hitting the door \"RRRRR... LET US OUT!!\" Crazily, no one on the opposite end heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them were in their late 20s when they entered and by this time Charlotte banged on the door, they were in their early teen years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira looked at her clothing and got even more concerned. She put her hand on Charlotte's shoulder. \"Um.. Charlotte..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte turned and angrily said \"Yes?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at our clothes, they still fit us..and they'r-they're changing with us. Also, we look like teenagers..\" Kira was getting more fearful as they regressed, while Charlotte couldn't contain her angry. Before either of them knew it, they were between ages 5-6. Kira was crying about now. \"W-w-we were tricked... theres no way out..\" Charlottes anger was essentially a temper tantrum at this point, similar to Angelica's. She stomped her feet up and down in a high pitched voice \"This is not fair. Not FAIR!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tantrums soon stopped though, because Charlotte lost her energy; she was becoming reluctant. At this point the regression was slowing down, and they each were about 3 years old. They not only were high pitched, but pronunciation was a challenge. The two of them could only sit on the bottom or crawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte sat on her but, with her legs stretched out as far as possible. In a resigned expression, she said \"Faaaa-ine, I gwuess we wost. Any mowent now, we'll be babies.\" Its at this point Charlotte finally paid attention to Kira and noticed her crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira was laying on her tummy, crying loudly \"Its dwoomed. We'll neva see our childwen again!!\" Charlotte's expression changed to one of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte held Kira's chubby little hands \"Ha-hey now. It-its not all bad. Dianwa is hea. Pwus, this means no wowk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira stopped crying to look up to Charlotte. She brushed the water from her eye lids and sat up best she could. \"Yowa wight.\" The two of them came in for a huge. and by this point the transformation was complete; both were 1 year olds. Kira was wearing a purple baby t-shirt, Charlotte was wearing a red baby t-shirt. Besides that the only thing both were wearing was fluffy comfy diapers. Instead of purses, they each had a baby bag in their respective color; Kira had purple and Charlotte had red. They're wallets remained, each with an extra signed check of course; these checks had the magician's signature, both signed for 1 million dollars. This would be needed to pay for their new lives. Other than their wallets, each baby bag had a plethora of baby necessities such as, pacifiers, extra diapers, baby bottles,  lotions, powder, and stuffed animals. One more item remained, a double seated pink stroller magically behind them when they hit babyhood. Both baby bags were hanging on the handles. Finally after being regressed, they could hear the outside;it was like they entered a different realm during regression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the regression process, the pretty magic assistant waved her hands while circling the door. The magician was touching the booth with his wand and shouting stuff to the crowd during this. \"So.. our two guests were quite pretty mothers weren't they. Well, what is the opposite of that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTons of people shouted out ideas, but the Magician kept his smurk until he heard someone questioningly say \"Babies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very right!\" the Magician exclaimed. \"The reason being mothers usually take care of babies. It was a tricky question ya see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Diane, who was in the crowds, a little nervous. \"You mean you transformed them into..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, I turned them both into babies! 1 year olds to be exact! And you there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed back at Diane. She confusingly said \"M-me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly. The park footage shows you very close with these two. Are you their friend by chance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiane said with a little hesitation \"Yes..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Magician smirked \"Well, not anymore!\" He opened the door, causing a burst of crowd reactions. He shouted over them \"NOW DIANE, YOU ARE THEIR MOTHER!!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was another one of those two week CIA mission-a-thons and as per usual Francine went on some sort of tirade with her husband gone. Stan had only been gone for less than an hour and she was already brooding over her husbands long-ish exit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't help but go browsing through old pictures taken during past mission-a-thons. \"I can't believe it. Again, another mission-a-thon! I wish he'd give me a heads up next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlaus then scooted in with his bowl. \"Still upset about Stan being gone Francine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine immediately got snippy \"What do you mean by \"still?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlaus sighed \"Augh, you don't seem to realize that this is a yearly occurrence do you? Stan leaves without saying anything and then you get all emotional.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Francine.. look through that picture book. How many times has this happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine started to count with a scowl on her face as the reality became increasingly sober. \"Oh my god..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlaus smiled \"Yes, now you see getting upset is a waste. So come downstairs and we can watch my-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine cut him off. \"Screw whatever you were going to tell me Klaus. You made me realize how much of my young years I've wasted!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlaus face-palmed with his fin. \"What are you going to do about it then?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine charged out. \"I don't know, but I'm sure the CIA has something for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she left, Klaus just said to himself \"Augh, no one wants to watch my audio drama...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine charged into the CIA science lab. \"Listen up boys, I want something to get my beauty years back. They've been wasted while my husband goes play mission-a-thon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one scientist chuckled to this statement. \"Francine.. what are you talking about? You look great. Why would you want to go back in years?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine became suddenly hostile, grabbing him by the shirt collar. \"Listen up, I know my husband probably told you not to give anything. But are you really in the mood to be beaten up by a housewife?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist gulped, realigning his glasses. \"Well.. then again, there is something I could give you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine released her hold on him. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's makeup designed to make someone younger. Some agents put a little of this on their wives for birthdays. Though.. we've never actually given it to their wives directly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine frowned noticeably \"So, what difference does it make?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist smirked \"Not much, just means you need to sign a waver is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine suddenly grew a smile. \"That's all?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but remember only to use a little of this stuff. It's strong and one puff on each cheek should be enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine ignored his warning, taking the pink makeup container and signing the waver. \"Thanks doc. You won't be hearing from me again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist sighed \"I wish that was true...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine drove as fast as she could home, driving past the speed limit to experience what could possibly be the best day of her life. Fortunately, she didn't run into any cops. Once home, she slammed her car door, locked up, and bolted into the house. She raced to her make up mirror and started dabbing the age make up on her face. Within seconds, she had already puffed cheek at least 10 times. She did it so fast, that the effects didn't really take affect until after she stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter those first puffs of the makeup, she got some nerve and put it down. She observed with glee as her face de-aged before her eyes. While the effects would be enormous, they did occur slow enough for her to observe changes. Within a minute, she had seen her fourty year old face turn to that of a thirty year old. She was ecstatic! With glee, she said \"I'm BEAUTIFUL AGAIN!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later her daughter, Hayley stormed into her room. \"Mom! Have you lost it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine gave only a cocky response. \"No Hayley, the opposite. I've gained it. I've gained my youthful appearance. I'm even prettier than you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley was extremely confused by this response and then she started to realize her mom was younger. Not only that, she realized her mom was getting even younger. \"Mom.. what did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing Hayley. I just went to the CIA and got makeup that would allow me to experience my youth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley started to notice the effects speed up for some reason as her Mom approached her early twenties. \"Mom! How much of that stuff did you use?!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Francine gave a reply, she slipped through to the age of 10 \"Like 10 puffs or so, why? Do I look even prettier?! Hehe!!\" Her attitude was becoming increasingly more childish with each word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley couldn't think but to yell at her mom, hoping to get her concern. \"MOM! WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?!! You're even younger than me now!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine hit the age of 1, before she could even respond \"Ha! Den me am pwettia den yowa!! Hehe! Now-wha ya gonna do?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley's face was extremely concerned and she could only think to do one thing; she picked up her mom by the waist and showed the new baby to a mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine was taken a-back by her daughter lifting her up so.. authoritatively. The difference in their height didn't really strike her until this, causing her to keep quiet with a somewhat concerned face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then saw her reflection. Her face turned to one of shock. She just stared at her reflection in disbelief. Her joy suddenly cut down to nothinglessness. After a second of paused disbelief, she touched the mirror with her chubby hands and felt the cold glass as if it were an alien object. Suddenly tears started to sprout and with them came wails thereafter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley internally criticized her for this. She wanted to get her attention, not cause a water show. To calm her mom, she tried to talk motherly \"It's okay Mom, don't worry. I got you. You're okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine paused briefly to look up at her daughter's now huge face and then continued to wail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley sighed and tried using heavier duty tactics. This time she cradled her mom, rocking her back and forth and sang in an angelic tone \"There there, there is no reason to worry. I have you, you have me. I will keep you all happy, please do not worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the cradles, Francine calmed down slightly and the song afterward prevented her from devolving into another wail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

We're ready to work and just need a signature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley was somewhat dumbfounded \"Room decoration? For what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mover guy looked at her confused. \"For your baby girl maim, the one your holding in your arms right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right\" Hayley tried to pass it off like she forgot, but then she couldn't help but ask \"Wait, what? I never ordered this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were called earlier today by Mr. Smith over at the CIA Laboratory that he needed us to come here stat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley scowled, thinking to herself \"That damn scientist is going to pay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maim?\" Hayley seemed to zone out for a second there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, well I am not signing this. My <i>husband</i> has lost his mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maim, your husband told us everything. You've had this baby for a week and refuse to give her a room. For the sake of all that is decent, please sign this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine jumped in after this \"Pweese mommy..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the guilt and the adorableness, Hayley couldn't help but sign it. Almost seconds after, the mover guys got straight to work, moving out furniture from her parents room and replacing it with baby attire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen everything was all said and done, the room looked nothing like before. Even the wall and floor were colored differently (thanks to a newfangled CIA included technology of course that allowed it to try almost instantly.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wall was now a light pink and the floors were a light colored blue. There was a completely pink crib leaned up horizontally to the wall where her parents bed once stood. Light colored pink sheets, blankets, and pillows littered it's insides. Above the crib was an ocean themed mobile. Most of the corners were littered with bright colored stuffed animals. One of their drawers, the drawers of her former husband were now a changing station. Her drawers were filled with assortments of baby attire. It goes without saying, both of these pieces of furniture were colored in a bright pink same as the crib. Several packs of diapers, roughly seven were placed near the new changing table. If matters weren't worse enough, they also put a new pink high chair in the kitchen along with some baby food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese guys couldn't be just movers, they had to be in on the truth somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin 2 hours of them starting, everything was done. Hayley watched in horror and Francine watched in joy as both of their lives were dramatically changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she saw the damage, Hayley was speechless. Something broke the silence though. Rodger came down from the basement with Klaus and Klaus shouted \"We are trying to watch my audio drama! Why are you so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlaus cut himself off. Rodger spoke up. \"Oh man! This is so priceless! I thought I was going to be stuck watching that crappy audio drama, but this, this is PRICELESS.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodger then pinched Francine's cheeks and in a comical manner said \"Hey Franny, don't you think you're missing something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine just asked innocently in a high pitched voice \"Wha Wodga?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodger cracked up \"A diaper!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine then looked up at Hayley \"Wew, mommy, chan-ga me den.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodger's laughter stopped after that. As Hayley took her to the changing table with dread, Rodger covered Francine's ears. \"What happened to the little one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley didn't move her eyes from Francine, as she unwrapped the little one and lifted her legs. As she stared deathly into the horror that was her mom's naked behind, she said \"She used makeup to be younger and it backfired. Heavily..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodger uncomfortably said \"Well... I'll leave you two love birds to it then. Come on Klaus, let's go finish that audio drama. It's better than this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis snapped him out of his shock and the two went upstairs to finish it, trying to ignore what they just learned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two left, Hayley started applying baby powder and lotion with the same glare. The process was somewhat delayed though due to an innocent question. Francine asked \"Mommy.. why are you angry at me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley took a deep breath and tried to change her facial expression. \"No baby mo- sweetie, I'm angry at someone else. I'm sorry I made you feel that way though.\" Something in her broke after that question. She couldn't keep up the idea that this baby, this bubbling 1 year old was her mother. Of course, she knew that was the case, but thinking about it didn't make her feel any better. The best she could do to stay sane was act as if this was a baby girl, not just any baby girl, <i>her </i>baby girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine responded rather innocently \"K.. yowa scaw-ed me mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis broke Hayley even more, causing the twenty-something to get tear-y eyed and smile \"I'm sorry sweetie. I didn't mean it. I'll try to act better for you, alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine gave an adorably innocent \"Kay\" in response to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that response, Hayley strapped a nice cushion-y diaper into place and fit a light pink shirt over Francine's chest. Francine at this point was unrecognizable to her past self. This wasn't a 40 something housewife. This was a 1 year old baby with a twenty-something stoner mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what?</span></div></div>",

We need revenue. Something that can allow you to stay like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine didn't quite understand. \"Bu we gots da makeup, wight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley formed a menacing smile. \"Good idea sweetie! So, mommy is going to be right back. You just play with your stuffed animals, kay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine giggled infectiously \"Hehe, kay mommy!\" She first pulled out a stuffed dolphin and started hugging it tightly. It was so comfy and warm. This was so much more relaxing of a life. Why didn't she do this years ago she thought to her baby self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later, Hayley came in with her laptop and started typing up a waver. \"Sweetie, how would you like to have playmates?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine bounced up and down with delight \"Yay! Pway!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in a spitting 10 seconds Hayley wrote up a waver, one that had so many words on page that it wasn't the easiest to read. \"This will make sure your playmates can't sue us sweetie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine pondered for a second \"Wha sa sue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Hayley picked up the baby girl and rocked her back and forth \"You'll find out when you're older sweetie.. If you become older...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Hayley printed out copies of another form she had written quickly, calling for all twenty-somethings with mother and daughter issues. Seconds later, she situated Francine in a pink stroller and put up the flyers. As she was putting up one of the flyers, a twenty something brunette stopped her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, what an adorable baby!! What's her name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley smiled \"This here is little Francine. She's a sweet ball of joy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say! Why are you and the little one out today? Going to the park I imagine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley chuckled a little bit \"Maybe if we have some time later today, we'll go. I just was putting up flyers though.\" Hayley then handed her a flyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked at it briefly, \"Wow, really? You're a mom-daughter counselor?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley lit up, \"Yes! I've read a whole lot of books on the topic before I had this little gem here. Would you be interested?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, YES! My mom has been killing me lately! She's going on and on about how shes paying for my college and I should be more respectful. Would you have an opening today by chance?\" She replied enthusiastically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, you're in luck, I have relatively free schedule today. What time works best for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you thank you thank you! Can I do anything in return?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley smirked :\"Yeah, can you help me put up the rest of these flyers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do! I'm Bridgette by the way and my mom is Sarah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a great help. Thank you. I'm Hayley by the way. Just call your mom and we can set it up instantly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, got it. One sec.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom, you got a sec?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! So, I just pumped into a mother-daughter counselor and she has an opening. Could we do it in about an hour or so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Augh, yes mom. We need to do this. You've been on my back for the past several months. We're doing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not! Take that back!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. I'll text you the location in a second. See you then.\" Bridgette then hung up to her mom and faced Hayley. \"You have no idea what I deal with. Anywho, text me the location so I can text her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Here it is.\" Hayley just showed her phone with the address. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic, that's right nearby! One sec, I'm texting the coordinates.\" A minute later, Bridgette got off her phone. \"Thank you again. You can actually go back home. I'll put out the rest of the flyers for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley was a little surprised. \"Thank you. I'll see you later then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hayley strolled away she noticed that little Francine was fast asleep. \"Awww, sweet dreams sweetie. When you wake up, you'll have a playmate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley quickly tucked Francine into her little crib and proceeded to get ready, setting up the living room to look nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

By the time this happened, Hayley was wearing a professional white blouse and black skirt with her hair tucked bad in a pony tail. She was trying to seem as professional as possible, to reel them in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath and opened the door. \"Hi Bridgette and Sarah! Come in! Let's get started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah immediately snipped at her daughter \"You told her my name? Why'd you do that Bridgette?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridgette just sighed \"Because it's the nice thing to do mom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you two seem a little at odds. Please come sit.\" Hayley's act was solid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit on the couch? What kind of counselling is this? This is just a regular home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, about that.. I'm sorry I can't have something more professional. I'm just starting out and so this is the best I can manage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An amateur are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! What's wrong with you?! Be nice for crying out loud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Dear.\" Sarah responded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley then started her pitch. \"So, before we begin, can both of you sign this waver? You see I've had some rather impolite clients in the past and they've sued me on several areas. This is simple procedure though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridgette was horrified by that. \"That's aweful! Absolutely, come on mom. Let's sign it.\" Bridgette signed it immediately, but her mom was not budging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not signing anything until I know what is on it. That's the <i>smart</i> thing to do dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis devolved into a shouting match between Bridgette and Sarah. \"Oh my gosh mom, just sign it. She already explained everything to us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she didn't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES SHE DID!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO SHE DIDN'T!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SIGN IT RIGHT NOW MOM! YOU PROMISED!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah felt caught now. \"FINE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe signed it and it was final.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley maintained her composure \"Thank you both. Now, the philosophy I adhere to involves empathy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridgette was intrigued, but Sarah was having none of it. \"Ooo..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that means the two of you will need to switch roles. One moment, I need to get you situated Sarah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get me situated? Situated with what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're costume. This makeup will make you seem younger for this exercise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley then started puffing Sarah's two cheeks about a dozen times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterward, Sarah coughed a little from the makeup. \"Ah, don't you think that's a little much?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, calm down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she said fine though, it started happening. Sarah starting regressing at an alarming rate, even more so than Francine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was quick to notice as she fell from her forties to her teens in the span of 30 seconds. \"What is happening to me?!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridgette was confused \"What no-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cut herself off. \"Wait.. what is happening to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's age started fading even faster, hitting the ripe age of 1 within 20 seconds. Her voice gradually shrank to a high pitched squeak in mid response. \"I'm getting YONGA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she said that last phrase, she had already hit babyhood. She then instinctively yelled at Hayley \"WHA YA DO TA-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley just plucked a light blue pacifier in her mouth to shut her up. \"There there, you're mommy will take care of you now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridgette was speechless, but couldn't help to ask \"A-a-am I her mommy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley chuckled \"Yea. This is part of the exercise remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so, you'll turn her back afterward?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. You actually are her mommy now. I'll give you a pack of diapers on the house and show you how to change diapers though. Oh, and, I need my pay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley then pulled Sarah's wallet out of her purse and said \"There, all better. Now, come with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As much as either of them regretted this decision, Shining Armor was needed for defense at a different part of the kingdom. Even the couples' trusty Sunburst was needed for magical assistance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile a guard fleet was stationed in the Crystal Empire, they weren't prepared for problems to spawn from <i>within</i> the city. The crazy turn of events happened a couple days after Shining Armor and the others left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a foggy morning and Cadence was waiting for the baby monitor to go off. She had been awake for about 30 minutes and already got some coffee to wake up. It kept her energy up a little, but it paled in comparison to her husband. Love was her motivator, the thing that got her up out of bed. She wasn't used to these mornings where she was <i>alone</i>. As she sat in her throne room, staring into nothinglessness while trying to maintain strength, the baby monitor finally went off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was music to hear ears. Even if her husband was gone, the little one gave her plenty of strength. She calmly went into Flurry Heart's room though, holding that energy in for playful enthusiasm. \"Morning Flurry Heart, how'd my little bundle of love sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlurry Heart gave a big joyous smile at seeing her mommy. She knew she would come. As always, Cadence quickly preceded to a diaper change. After all, little Flurry Heart had a tendency to leave surprises in the morning. The diaper change actually took a teensy bit longer than normal. It was weird too. Flurry Heart didn't even have a mess. Rather, Cadence was trying to savor the love she was receiving as much as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when it happened. Flurry Heart got annoyed and started charging her horn up. Cadence saw this and immediately concern hit her. Flurry Heart's magic was supposed to be under control. Perhaps.. with Sunburst away, the safety precautions were too weak. Cadence wasn't going to let what happened to her kingdom before happen again though. So, Cadence had touched her horn with Flurry Hearts and charged power of her own, trying to cancel Flurry's power out. However, Flurry only giggled in response and casted a confusing spell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spell unknown to either of them was sucking age away from Cadence and into Flurry Heart. The speed of age transfer.soon kicked up though and Cadence started realizing that something more than just a magic standoff was going on. She tried to pull her horn away, but she couldn't stop it. Meanwhile, Flurry Heart was looking more like a kid than a baby. Cadence took a glance at her baby look older and tried pulling back even harder, using her wings to flap away. This was futile. Flurry Heart merely copied in her mother's hoofsteps, flapping her own wings. As this transfer happened Flurry Heart started sucking her mother's knowledge. If this cycle were to continue to it's conclusion, Cadence would have all her memory, but understand very little to none of it's meaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds into the wing flapping contest, Cadence started flying up to get more distance, but Flurry Heart merely did the same. Cadence looked at her daughter grow to Twilight's age and further. Flurry's expression was weird though. It was nothing but a big happy smile. She knew what she was doing and found it just fun to do. Upon seeing this, Cadence quietly teared up. She was a failure of a mother. Her daughter was doing something massively inappropriate, but found it fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cadence's age depleted more, causing her to reach the tender age of childhood, her wing strength depleted and her tears increased ever more. She wanted to say something to Flurry Heart. She wanted to tell her daughter to stop this instant. But doing so meant, she'd have to stop everything else she was doing and thus give in. As her tears increased and toddlerhood approached her, she couldn't help but take the risk. She stopped her magic, she stopped her wings, and with that almost every shred of her age had depleted her; she was almost the same exact age as her daughter used to be. Any second longer and she'd lose her knowledge of every last word in her dictionary or the ability to speak said words. Fortunately for her, her one command pushed through \"STAHP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Flurry Heart stopped and her expression changed to one of confusion. Her mother was now a baby and wailing on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlurry Heart just gave a motherly smile and picked her up with a magical aura. \"It's okay mom. I gotcha.\" Flurry Heart's voice had a similar vibe to that of Pinkie's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence stopped for a second to see her now grown up daughter looking down on her. Then she simply switched back to wailing up a storm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlurry Heart had empathy, but her playful nature prevented her from truly cutting the jokes. She simply gave a motherly smile and said \"Oh, silly mom. There's no need to fear. Flurry Heart is here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence's wails only increased. Flurry Heart then looked a little frustrated. \"Ya know mom, you can quit it. This isn't fun anymore. You're being such a buzzkill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing changed, so Flurry Heart became even more frustrated. \"Augh, fine, I'll cradle you.. even though you don't deserve it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cradling calmed Cadence down a little bit, but she still looked sad. Flurry Heart felt something odd when looking at her mom this time though. Her mom looked <i>cute</i>. She had never seen her mother this way. Cuteness was something that others saw in her, but now it was the other way around. The cuteness of her mom was so strong, she couldn't help but giggle joyfully. \"Hehe, you are so cute mom! Such a cutey patotey, aren't ya?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlurry Heart almost on instinct then blew a raspberry into Cadence's tiny little tummy. This cheered up Cadence for a little bit, causing her to giggle from laughter. After a while, Flurry Heart then felt like hugging her mom, so she did that. While the now older daughter hugged her baby mom, Cadence finally spoke up in a high pitched baby voice with a bit of an attitude. \"Dis no fun missy!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlurry Heart was a little scared by this. Her mom never talked to her that way. Flurry Heart reflexively plopped Cadence on the changing table she was just on and covered her face with her wings. In a tear-y response, Flurry Heart said \"Why are you yelling at me mom?\" She may have been an adult, but she didn't know how to act like one. Here she was, a now grown adult, cowering to a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence was extremely confused by her daughters' response. In her she felt some sympathy, but she didn't want to give into it. Her baby instincts overcame her better judgement and exploded. She wanted to, she needed to, get out this frustration. \"WHY?! YOWA TUR ME INTA BABY DAT WHY?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlurry Heart continued to cower. \"I'm sorry.. I thought it was fun...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FU-NA?! WHA ABOWT ME?! YOWA HAF TA TINK ABOWT ODAS FEE-WINGS!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlurry Heart was going to continue to apologize, but something in her ticked. She knew how she was feeling. She felt bad, really bad. And who was causing it? Her mom of all ponies! The same pony who just said to think about others feelings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlurry Heart lashed back at her mother after a couple seconds of Cadence's last response. \"What about my feelings mom?! You just said I should think about others feelings and here you are yelling at me! Do you know how that makes me feel?! REALLY BAD. You hurt my feelings!! APOLOGIZE!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence was taken back. She never in her entire life imagined Flurry Heart lashing back at her. Not only that, Flurry was intimidating. She struck fear into Cadence that Cadence never knew she had. To be fair, she didn't have it. As an adult such fear didn't exist. But as a baby, Cadence was a little bundle of fear. As a result, miliseconds later she started getting tear-y eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlurry Heart could tell that she got the message and scooped up her baby mom. \"There there mom. It's alright I forgive you. Just do one thing for me. Say your sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence shyly spoke up \"Me sowwy Fwuwwy Hart...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlurry Heart giggled infectiously at that response. \"Awwww, it's okay. Well, let's get you in a diaper mom. You must be really cold. I remember what it was like being naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence blushed. This was so mortifying. \"G-gud i-dwea Fwuwwy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlurry Heart then proceeded into what was quite possibly the craziest diaper changing ever. She knew what to do, but she didn't know what amount to use. So, she wound up lifting her mom's bottom, and applying an enormous amount of baby powder, making Cadence's bum snowy white. Then she slid a diaper underneath and strapped it in super tight. Strangely enough, Cadence felt great after this. She always was one for sensations and diaper changes by Flurry Heart allowed her to feel super snuggily wuggily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo thoughts formed in the recesses of Cadences' mind as a result of this changing experience. \"Could I stay like this if I so wanted?\" and \"I wish Shining Armor was here to enjoy this too.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Flurry Heart could see her mom's satisfaction from the diaper change and couldn't help but ask about it. \"Sooooo... mom, how do you think I did for my first diaper change? Pretty good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence blushed bright red and tried to give a more calm response \"Ya-yes. Tank you Fwuwwy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh shucks, don't feel nervous mom. I was a baby too. I know what it's like when you get a good diaper change. It's <i>intoxicating</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing her daughter use such a sophisticated word, Cadence just sighed and covered her face. She didn't want to see this anymore. That was until Flurry got her attention with another baby tactic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlurry Heart acted like her mom was invisible. \"Oh wow.. Mom? Where'd you go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence peeked out of right hoof to see Flurry. Within seconds, Flurry responded \"There she is! How's my favorite mom ever doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis snapped Cadence out of her fear and she uncovered her face, giggling hysterically. \"Me am! Me am!\" This was yet again another baby instinct taking command over poor little Cadence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know what great moms deserve?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence tilted her head in adorable confusion \"Wha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An adorable blue ribbon to tie your mane silly! I saw pictures of your younger self with a blue ribbon when I was a baby.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... wewwy? Me no we-memba dat...\" The more accurate reason for this was that Cadence gave up that memory in the age transfer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later, the ribbon was on Cadence and Flurry Heart proceeded to cradle her mom again. This time she spoke to her in a bit of a belittling voice \"So, mom? Are you hungwy? Does my little snooker-muffin want some bwakefast?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence didn't really pay attention to the words, but rather the tone, and she loved the tone of Flurry's voice. So, she just replied \"Yes pwease! Yes pwease!\" with little understanding of what she was saying yes to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Flurry or Cadence, this line of bonding was being subtly reflected throughout the empire. After Shining Armor had left, the love spreading from the crystal heart had diminished considerably, by about a third of it's previous power. But with the new experiences happening to Cadence, the princess of love, the crystal heart surged with an outrageous abundance of love. The crystal heart was pumping out about six times more love than its normal amount with Shining Armor present. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though it was early, many crystal ponies gathered around the center of the city, baffled at the change of events. The love surging from the heart brought with it a considerable amount of warmth to the Crystal Empire and cleared away the fog that covered it less than an hour ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards were just as confused as everybody else and, while it wasn't standard procedure, some decided to consult the princess immediately to give an answer to all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoughly six guards raced down the crystal hallways as Flurry levitated her mom with her to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's my wittle mommy wommy? Is she good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe! Yes me am!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, ya know, you really are better this wa-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was cut off by the guards that finally saw them down the hall. \"HALT! WHO ARE YOU?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden pouncing scared Cadence, causing her to hide her face in Flurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlurry actually had a flash of motherly protection at the sight of this. \"I am Flurry Heart. How dare you speak to me that way?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards raced down as she was talking and stopped upon sight of her. She was about the same height as her mother, meeting their height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards were bewildered and only one had the nerve to speak up. \"Ple-please explain your highness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlurry brushed off her anger and gave a enthusiastic reply \"It's cool guys. It's me Flurry Heart. Don't you recognize me? Me and my mom had a little mishap in my room this morning and it caused us to swap ages. Now, my mom is an adorable wittle baby. Look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlurry then levitated Cadence in front of the guards now shocked faces. There was a round of both terror and shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence only teared up at this. It was one of the most embarrassing experiences ever. She was about to break out into wails, but Flurry anticipated and cradled her back in her hooves. \"Awww, there there mom. It's alright.\" It's weird. In some ways, she was better at sensing her mom's outbreaks than her mom was at sensing hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards quickly apologized upon realizing they made the princess upset and apologized deeply. One spoke up though \"Can you please announce this to the empire? Your subjects must know at once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah shucks guys, you can drop the authority act with me. After all, I'm only really a <i>baby girl</i>.\" While Flurry Heart didn't realize it, there was an unintended sexual connotation from that response. The guards nervously blushed, but tried to keep their composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, what scared you guys? Anywho, I'm going I'm going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

I mean I love being an adult and taking care of my mom. She seems to love it. Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne pony raised his voice \"Well, what about your father?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right. Well, I'm sure my dad will understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of Equestria, word was already getting sent about a change in the Crystal Empire, but the complete story was given to Shining Armor. No pony really had the nerve to tell the prince, who didn't have such a sense of humor, that his wife and daughter swapped ages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining Armor had just finished his meal and was off to the field where dragons were attacking their magic walls. Right as he was getting to the front lines, a guard stopped him. \"Shining Armor, can I please have your attention?\" For a private, this guy had quite the confidence in facing his superior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining was a little confused. \"Um, what seems to be the issue private?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you noticed the change to the skies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Shining Armor was just in a tent, and hadn't quite looked up. He then did as instructed and saw various shades of purple and pink cover the sky. \"What the?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not be concerned sir. This is from our allies, the Crystal Empire to be exact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat response spun Shining Armor in multiple thought directions, but he maintained composure, albeit in a thinking pose. \"Thank you Private. I'll think about what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need sir. I'm a messenger from Princess Celestia. She's ordering you return home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! What about the our defenses?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already taken care of sir. Sunburst has actually mastered that spell with some modifications, which means your free to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining Armor was stunned. He had never been relieved like this before. \"Can I see him before I go? I need to give him some advice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need. Just send him a letter and we'll have it over within the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I... Okay. I understand. My wife and daughter in danger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Private began to sweat a little bit. He had heard what happened, but he wasn't as good at keeping it a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining Armor caught this. \"You know something more? What is it? It's about my wife and daughter? What happened to them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I am not allowed to say, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining Armor aggressively headed out, racing to his tent. He didn't have time for that pony then! Fortunately, his things were already packed by another guard and he was led to the nearest train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the way north to his home, Shining Armor's mind raced with anxious thoughts. 'Cadence and Flurry had their ages swapped? What in sam hill is going on? How did this? Who did this? Why?' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then said to himself \"Augh, who ever did this is going to pay. You better hope it wasn't you Discord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a 5 hour trip, the train was passing into the Crystal Empire. Shining Armor was asleep and had to woken by a crystal guard. He fell asleep about an hour in and had a panic ridden slumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Shining Armor?\" The guard then nudged him a little bit and Shining woke up. (Not a very heavy sleeper perhaps.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? Am I home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir. Come with me at once. Your wife and daughter need to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're safe?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Um, there is no immediate concern. Please just come with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining took a deep breath. \"Ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was led to Flurry Heart's room. After which, the guard left him alone and he quietly cracked the door open. He saw the backside of his now grown up daughter and a little pink coated baby playing with blocks, whom he presumed was Cadence. He also overheard a little of their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence said in an adorably high pitched voice \"An dis es da wub cas-wle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlurry entertained Cadence's little imagination. \"Ooo, is there anything special about it?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, yes Fwuwwy. Et whe-wa aw da ponies faw en wub!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooo, is that where you and dad met?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence giggled \"May-be.. Me wis he wa hea-\" She then cut herself off upon seeing her husband. \"SHININ! YA BAK!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining's cheeks instantly turned bright red. \"Um.. hi, you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad!\" Flurry Heart instantly got up, levitating Cadence to her right side. \"You're back so soon. Why'd you come back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining immediately jumped on them with this peculiar question. \"Why? Because you two swapped ages, that's why!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence started to tear up a little bit at this, but Flurry again cradled her to comfort. She then in a quiet but assertive tone said \"Dad. What has gotten into you? That's not how you treat mom. She's sensitive you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining Armor became nervous \"I-I I didn't mean it that way. I'm just confused. Please explain.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I hadn't had an accident, but she kept up a oddly long changing. So, I powered my horn, she touched it, and then we swapped ages. That about wraps it up.\" Flurry Heart was insultingly casual in her tone of events. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining Armor was in shock by the end, paused and speechless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh dad, you ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Cadence spoke up \"Pwease no be mad Shy-nin. She nah mean it. Me ac-twy tinkin ta stay dis way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat snapped Shining Armor out of it. \"I-I don't know what to say. Cadence, you can't really propose something like that, can you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on dad. It's a <i>smart</i> decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she's happier this way and the empire has even more love magic spreading across Equestrian skies. It can even be used to fuel unicorn magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was heavy. His wife was going to stay like this. And for <i>good</i> reasons? Protecting Equestria was his job. He wasn't about to argue against that or take away his love's joy. But he wasn't happy about any of this. He just sat on the floor, looking at the ground. \"I don't know what to say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlurry was going to but in, but Cadence signal to be lowered to the floor to talk one on one. So, Flurry did as instructed. Cadence slowly walked up to her husband with a sad expression. \"Shy-nin...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining looked up at his wife in defeat \"yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me stiw wub you. Me no wanna woose you. M-me <b>sniff</b> wub you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I- what am I going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence then hugged him \"Sa-pa me de-ci-son...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlurry intervened. \"Mom, Dad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two nodded up to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith out any approval, Flurry then casted an age spell on Shining Armor, lifting him up with a bright yellow beam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining Armor nervously asked \"Wha what are you doing Flurry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be a lot happier at the same <i>age</i> as mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, NO?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too late. Milliseconds later a vortex spun around Shining, regressing him to babyhood at an astonishing rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence simply said \"Yay! Gud idea Fwuwwy!!\" She was too infantile to realize the ethics of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore a minute past, the yellow vortex faded leaving a baby white pony with a blue mane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining Armor blinked with disbelief at the huge room and followed up with wails \"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlurry just gave a motherly smile and levitated the two of them into her hooves. \"There there dad, look around, look at mom. Doesn't she look cuute, you and her are now the same age.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was approaching late evening and Twilight and Starlight were on a train to the Crystal Empire. When Twilight had heard that Cadence and Flurry Heart swapped ages, she was overwhelmed with both concern and curiosity. She had heard that Flurry Heart initiated the spell and was hoping she could reverse things. Normally, she'd go with her friends, but there was a scary prospect ahead of her; Flurry Heart might try turning them into babies too. She told Starlight though, because her magical skills were an asset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they approached the Crystal Empire, the two of them noticed something different. The Crystal Heart was generating far more love than they said it was. They could feel it, about 3 times more so than they expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Twilight, does something feel off to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight anxiously replied \"Yes. I have a bad feeling about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you suppose it could mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somehow the love has increased even further. I have a guess, but I hope it's not true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your guess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please can we not talk about it. It's making me anxious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay, sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they got off the train, everypony and thing was glowing. Once they stepped off the train, they too started glowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two looked at each other with concern and ran in the direction of the castle. As they approached the Crystal Heart, they could see it spinning rapidly. Two guards approached them and they were quick to guide them to the same room Shining Armor was led too. They didn't want to say that Shining Armor had entered though, for fear of what happened to him. It had been 10 minutes since he entered and he hadn't come out yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the guards left them, Starlight bluntly pointed out \"I understand the gravity of the situation, but this is a little ridiculous, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight only took offense, prodding her. \"Starlight, this is serious! Cadence could be gone forever. Please be more considerate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight sighed and said \"K.\" That little response made her once again self-doubt her abilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight opened the door normally, not bothering to hide the sound. She was too concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Flurry turned around with a now diapered Shining Armor and Cadence. \"Oh hey there Aunt Twilight and Starlight! Why are you hear? Seems like all the fun ponies are coming by?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight gulped. \"Flurry Heart, I'm here out of concern.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlurry sighed \"Augh, please don't tell me you came her just to say that what I did was wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did, didn't you. Why is it that no one trusts me with my parents? I know I really am a baby girl, but a little trust would go a long way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight could relate a little, showing nervousness to approach her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight on the other hoof, wasn't giving up. \"Look Flurry, I understand that they look very cute, but what do they have to say about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aunt Twilight! They love it! Why does everyone think being a baby is so bad?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Flurry Heart, Cadence spoke up \"It twu Twiwigh! Me wub dis! Me fee so much wub! Me wha ment ta do dis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining Armor followed up. \"Twi-wy, me unda-stan ya con-san, bu me wanna stay baby ef Cay-dence das.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence blushed, gently tapping Shining Armor's little shoulder \"Aww, tanks honwy! Um Mama Fwuwwy, ca yo-wa wet me an Shy-nin pway fa da time be-win?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlurry Heart giggled \"Of course mom!\" and levitated her parents near the blocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Flurry Heart smugly looked at Twilight \"See, they love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight butted in \"Somethings not right. I think their age may be affecting their thought patterns. Flurry, we have to turn them back now. Who knows how more they'll change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlurry was outraged \"Aunt Twilight!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight became incredibly nervous \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just said that they're opinion is what matters, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yees, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts! This is what they want. Why can't you accept that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too unrealistic is all Flurry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what it's like being a baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then you <i>should</i> know what I'm talking about!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't though for a reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.. I know the reason. You haven't been a baby for quite some time. How about we change that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight prepared her horn after seeing her charge, but something happened. Flurry Heart paused time itself so that only Twilight and her were moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight lost focus after seeing everything go still. \"Wha? What did you do? Did you.. stop time?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Aunt Twilight. With the magic I got from my mom, I've learned a lot of spells quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, why'd you stop time though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To distracted you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then and there, Flurry Heart blasted Twilight with the same age spell, causing her too to regress. Tears welled up from Twilight, \"Why are you doing this? We love you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Twilight was regressing from the vortex, Flurry answered her question \"I'm doing this to be on the different side of it all for a change. Being a mommy is a ton of fun. So many cute faces and picture worthy moments. It's <i>enchanting</i>. That's why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Flurry Heart finished her statement, Twilight was at the same age as Cadence and her brother. They were oddly the same age for the first time ever now and being taken of by her niece. How more crazy could things get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after the regression finished, Flurry unfroze time. Shining Armor and Cadence weren't paying enough attention to notice, even if Twilight were to wail (which is exactly what she did)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight was freaked. In just a millisecond, her mentor went from charging her horn to wailing as a foal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Starlight could ask anything, Flurry levitated Twilight up to her face \"It's okay Aunt Twily, being a baby is a ton of fun, you'll see.\" and cradled her, calming her down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight quivered in fear \"How-how'd you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the menacing vibe she gave off, Flurry Heart responded genuinely as she was cradling her aunt. Then again, Starlight hadn't done anything wrong yet. \"Oh nothing too fancy, just a time stop spell followed by my age spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight gulped in fear \"Wh-why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlurry Heart vented a little bit at this question. \"Well, she was just being such a buzzkill. My mom and dad are having a blast and she's gotta come in here and try to ruin it. It's just so.. so... <i>rude</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but did she deserve it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlurry rolled her eyes. \"Oh come on please, don't you that start too. You just saw me turn Aunt Twilight into a baby. I won't mind turning you into a baby either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight was frozen in fear. She didn\u2019t know what to do, defend Twilight and turn into a baby or don\u2019t defend Twilight and see what happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlurry Heart chuckled \u201cI see the cat\u2019s got your tongue. Well, while you ponder over it, I\u2019m gonna give my aunt a fresh new <i>diaper</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was startled by that response \"Da-diapa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not going to let you go around naked silly! You need something in case you have an <i>accident</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that statement, Twilight started wailing again, this time louder than before. \"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlurry resorted to her normal cradle technique, but it did nothing. Then she tried singing \"There there Twilight, it'll all be-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHH! It's not working! NOTHING I'M DOING IS WORKING! That's it Aunt Twilight! You just lost your memory!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she casted her spell, Starlight casted a stop spell on her. \"DON'T YOU DO THAT TO MY MENTOR!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how am I supposed to stop her crying!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight took a deep breath. \"I'll do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlurry Heart watched as Starlight levitated Aunt Twilight out of her frozen hooves and into hers. Twilight felt a change, but continued to wail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight remained on task and did a simple action. She hugged Twilight, keeping the hug hold with no sign of letting go. As if it were a magic trick, Twilight's wails quickly shrank to tears and then sniffles. \"Sh-she wa gonna <b>sniff</b> gonna <b>sniff</b>-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlurry was amazed at how easy Starlight had Twilight under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh shh, it's okay Twilight. I got you. I won't let her do anything to you that you don't want to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We-we-weawwy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight smiled down at her mentor \"That's what friends do, isn't it?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat intiated a chuckle from Twilight \"Haha, twu...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her laughing stopped, Twilight looked up at Starlight. \"Wha am me gonna do? Me can-ta be ah baby..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight just laughed to that, causing Twilight to get nervous. \"Why yowa wa-waughing...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're Twilight Sparkle. You've defeated so many evil foes, but you think you can't do this. It's just, I don't believe you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yowa no unda-stan. Me wost eba-wey wing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you still friends with some of the best ponies in Equestria?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what's there to worry about? You haven't lost anything. In fact, you've gained something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight tilted her head in confusion. \"Wha es dat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight giggled \"Cute-ness\" and followed it up with tickles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight laughed, falling for the tickles completely, but she also was happy. Her fears were slowly but surely stalled. In the mist of the laughter, she said \"Can ya <b>haha</b> gib me ah <b>haha</b> diapa chan.. <b>haha</b>, me no <b>haha</b> wanna hab ac-sid-ent.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight stopped tickling, but Twilight kept laughing. While Twilight continued to laugh, Starlight's stop spell ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

Starlight was zoned out a little, but quickly realized Twilight stopped moving. \"Twilight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlurry chuckled \"She's stopped silly. I stopped time for a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight delicately carried her mentor as she walked to Flurry. \"Please don't get rid of her memory.. I don't know what I'd do without her...\" Silent tears came from Starlight's eye sockets at this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you? Crazy?! I wouldn't do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But y-you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was, but that was before I saw how great your parenting skills were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight blushed, but kept listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as you take care of her, I'm not going to do a thing. I just didn't want her ruining our fun. But that's not exactly why I stopped time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-why did you?\" Starlight stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to ask you a question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Do you see my aunt as a <i>mother figure</i> to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight's cheeks turned bright red from embarrassment. \"What kind of question is that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlurry giggled \"No need to be so serious silly. I'm asking, because of how you cared for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's not much to it. I just think that children can be better parents to their parents than their parents. That make any sense? It's like. I think I'm a better mommy to my mom then my mom was to me, because I'm her daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think that's the case?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.. good question. My first diaper change of her was to her satisfaction, I always know when she's about to wail, and I'm able to keep her emotions down generally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about for your dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dad is.. well, he's different. He's probably satisifed with my diaper change style, but he likes to hide that. He also tends to call my name before wailing, signalling me to calm him down. Oh and his emotions are generally positive, but they change a lot. So, after my description though of my mom, can you come clean about Twilight as a mother figure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight took a deep breath. \"It's true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! I knew it! I'm so good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight continued. \"Twilight has played a much more active role in my life than my parents ever did and takes care of me, sorta like a parent. I don't really know because my parents were away so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, Starlight, she's totally your adopted mom and you are her adopted daughter. You know what that makes us?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.. cousins?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEP! And not just any cousins, we can also be best friend mommies and do all sorts of things playdates for our <i>parents</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight didn't know what to do. Was it right to mommy her mentor?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pondered, Flurry jumped in \"I won't ever judge you. I know what you did and I think you're tons of fun! Not to mention we can talk magic together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight was caught off guard \"What? How do you know all that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been paying attention Starlight.\" This was actually wrong. She simply stole the memory from her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.. you are, one of the nicest ponies I've met. But what will Sunburst and all of my other friends think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on mare, we got this! I can get you and Sunburst to <i>hook up</i> even!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight became even more red in the face. \"How do you know that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Starlight, Starlight.. He's been my royal crystallize for a while. He talks about you, like <i>a lot</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight became happy for a second there, but held back \"He does?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely! The only issue he says is that you don't live <i>nearby</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight's hormones started getting the best of her at this point, just as Flurry hoped. \"Wait, you don't suppose I could come live her do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo.. That's a great idea! That way our little young parents could see each other all the time. I'll hook you up with a great place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.. you'd do that for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! I want a mommy friend ya know. I don't want to be disturbing the little ones' fun all the time. That's no fun for either of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, come on Starlight, let's see you change Twilight's diaper now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight blushed and Flurry undid the time spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Twilight finished up her laughing, Starlight put her on the changing table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was a little nervous after feeling the soft changing table. \"Me no kno.. pahaps we shud way-ta.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight asked her a little \"Oh come on Twilight, can you give me one chance? You might <i>like</i> it even.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight giggled at that prospect \"Haha, okay, bu if me no wike it, no maw\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight started cautiously, raising Twilight's hind hooves gradually and then gently tapping the baby powder until a right amount was on Twilight's bum. Then she slid a diaper under and strapped the diaper in nice and tug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was smiling with glee by the end. \"Dat wa GWATE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight was taken a back by Twilight's extreme reaction. \"Really? I was so slow though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bu dat's da bes apwoch, et mean ya wan me ta be happy. An an it fee so gud becaus of dat.\" It was interesting. Twilight's focus seemed to be more on what the changing meant, with a little focus on soothingness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight giggled \"Thanks Twilight. That's a good analysis of the diaper changing. Wanna go play with Cadence and Shining Armor now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes peese!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight smiled motherly and levitated her over. Meanwhile, Flurry Heart was giving a huge smile, as if Starlight passed some mommy test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence and Shining Armor had built a small castle out of the blocks by the time Twilight came over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence smiled big and wide at seeing Twilight. \"Twi-wite! Yowa baby too? Dat aw-sum!\" The two babies then did their little greeting, which was super adorable as babies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sun-shyne Sun-shyne! Wady Bugs Awake! Cwap ya hoobs an do aw witta shake!\"<br>\r\n\"Sun-shyne Sun-shyne! Wady Bugs Awake! Cwap ya hoobs an do aw witta shake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two grown up ponies practically died of cuteness after the two shook their diapered bums. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwwwwww!\"<br>\r\n\"Awwwwwwww!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two babies giggled at their mommies reactions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining Armor didn't seem that happy though and after they finished he walked up to her and asked \"Why yowa baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me wanna no why yowa became baby\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe parents suddenly became a little tense at this, hoping things wouldn't go south. Twilight struggled to give an answer, but Cadence jumped in for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you bein so mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining obviously took offense to that. \"Me am not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea huh! Twi-wite an me wha enjoy-win aw sels an an den you gots make ha fee bad. Meanie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me am not meanie! Me *sniff* not.. Me jus...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jus wha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JEWOUS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence was gonna lash back, but Twilight tapped Shining's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shy-nin.. me sowwy... Come on Staw-wite. Wet's go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining Armor felt bad, really bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way-ta, me no me-nit. Me sowwy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight then hugged him back \"It kay!\" and Cadence hugged as well. It was a three way hug!</span></div></div>",

Change Equestria for the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight was getting nervous, but kept her cool. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, let's <i>fix</i> more relationships. All parents, or mothers at least, should be turned into babies and their children should look after them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight gulped. She didn't know what to do, so she just agreed. I mean, she loved taking care of Twilight, but this seemed a bit extreme. \"Okay. Let's do it.\"</span></div></div>",
