I just transferred here, on account of my parents moving because of their new jobs. When I first visited Hey High Sch-...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, did someone seriously name this school <i>Hey</i> High School? If you took away the \"High School\", it would just be <i>Hey</i>. As in someone from another school asking you, \"So what school do you attend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you'd be like, \"Hey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow much of an idiot would you sound like if you answered that type of question with a response similair to that of <i>hi</i>, <i>hello</i>, or <i>I notice you standing there in front of me</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ahem.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, I entered my homeroom and took my seat before any of the other students arrived. Way before, actually. Homeroom stated at 8:15....it's 8:30, and not even the teacher is here. Maybe I read something wrong. Oh crap, maybe this isn't my homeroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finally decided to...</span></div></div>",

You find out upon being there, that it is a high school loaded to the brim with  delinquents and troubled teenagers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe longer you're there, though, the more you realise how not-so-tough they really are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's intended to be goofy, keep it around the PG-13 area, and please just don't do any \"you're dead\" directions where the story suddenly stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, have fun!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHINT: Think of people you knew in high school.</td>",
