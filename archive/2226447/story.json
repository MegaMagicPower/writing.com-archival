I'll be fine out here.\" Tommy assured Chuckie. As Tommy wore a diaper, he could use it whenever he had to go potty. Chuckie ran into Tommy's house and made his way to the bathroom. He found his potty sitting next to the toilet, then he pulled down his pants and underwear. He sat on his potty, sighing with relief as he peed in it. He peed until his bladder was empty and his potty was full. When he was all done, he put his pants and underwear back on, then he washed his hands and went back outside. When he got back outside, Tommy noticed him looking unhappy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Chuckie?\" Tommy asked Chuckie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Tommy. You're real lucky.

I wish I didn't have to stop playing with you so I could use the potty.\" Chuckie told Tommy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Chuckie, if you don't want to stop playing and use the potty, you're always welcome to use one of my diapies. They're soft and comfy, they're easy to take off if you need a change, and bestest of all, if you have to go potty, you don't have to stop playing. You can just go in your diapie and keep playing.\" Tommy told Chuckie. Chuckie rather liked this idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Tommy. That does sound like fun. I think I'd like to try it, just for today.\" Chuckie told Tommy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! I'll be right back!\" said Tommy. He went into his house and made his way to his bedroom, where he found his clean diapers on his changing table. He picked one up, then he made his way back to Chuckie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Chuckie. I'm back. Let's get this diapie on!\" said Tommy. Chuckie pulled down his pants and underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Tommy.

The last time Dennis visited Margaret's house, he tied Margaret's doll to a rocket and sent it into space to get out of playing house with her, and the doll got damaged as a result. Fortunately for Dennis, his parents didn't find out about this.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Crossovers between fictional series featuring diaper humiliation. Every character can go around and meet someone from another series, but may be surprised when they find themselves humiliated by that character, humiliated with that character, or escaping humiliation from that character.... ONLY TO BE HUMILIATED BY SOMETHING ELSE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou will follow them and find ways to put them in such a situation. Heck maybe you don\u2019t even need it to be one character, but pairs of groups! Imagine! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLots of things can happen here! Imagine Naruto (Naruto) being humiliated by Luffy (one piece), or Usagi (Sailor Moon) and Sakura (Carr Capturer Sakura) being forced into diapers by Samuel Aran(Metroid)! The possibilities are endless! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever I must place my own personal rules here:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1: Fictional media only and no live action stuff, therefore nothing featuring  characters that are mostly from live action priorities. This also means no real world people.  I will excuse things like comic book movies seeing that they are remembered in comic books and animated series before live action, just try not to use the live action continuity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2: Some fetishes not allowed: Gore, excessive weight gain(belly may grow but not so big), Muscle growth(unless the series uses it already like dragon ball, but don\u2019t add on to it), TF, and excessive farting(scat is fine tho).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3: OCs were be fine in small to large enough roles. Such as store clerks or being the antagonist (like a bully for example). There will be no oc main character roles AT THIS MOMENT! Like no OC friend we didn\u2019t know about till now, no OC hero who stronger then everyone and is a nicer person anyway.  At this moment there will be no OC main characters unless there is enough demand. If you got ideas or questions please message me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4: Try to fill in enough to make it considered a chapter. I guess a decent starting point for now would be a 100 words unless this is a choice chapter.... That said...<br>\r\n4.5: Please be limited on choice chapters. As I don\u2019t want to see an endless line of choice chapters in the updates unless there is a story at the end. (With things starting you are fine to fill in a few more choice chapters if you wish.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5: Only other limit is to limit harassment of other creator and to have decent grammar. I have the right to delete chapters, but I likely will warn you unless I think you are trolling or something.<br>\r\nAnd I\u2019ll say this, with all characters being fictional, sexual themes is fine, all ages can ages above 5 can participant(if they aren\u2019t doing sexual stuff, all ages are fine then), and you all have fun!</td>",
