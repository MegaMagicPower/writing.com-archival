He stood in front of them all at a podium, like a college professor lecturing to a class. <i>And the lesson for today was... </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time-travel,\" he said, \"is a very difficult thing to comprehend. As is time itself. It's understandable that you will have a lot of questions, but believe me, somebody could spend an eternity asking those questions and never find a satisfying answer. But you are no philosophers. It's not your jobs to answer those questions. You are... social workers. You correct time, guide it, not understand it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilson glanced around the large room. <i>I'm rambling again... Oh, way to make a first impression, Wilson</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are all here, because according to the future field reports, you are the best and the brightest of all our new recruits, and of humanity. But remember, the future is always changing; just because we say you survive to see tomorrow, doesn't mean you will an hour later. Your actions have consequences that you cannot begin to comprehend - what you do effects your future, which effects your missions, which effects us. Follow protocol at all times, or you will be more trouble to us than you are worth.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCommander Wilson realised he was assuming a grave tone. He tried to lighten the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, all you people who ever wanted to meet Elvis - you've got your chance right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cringed as soon as he'd said. <i>Humour... not one of my strong points.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" he continued quickly, before the cadets had a chance to snicker at him. \"You will be divided into five squads. Each squad will be assigned to a different mission. These are training missions - they are important, but will most likely not involve any combat situations. At least... so long as everything goes as planned...\" a grim expression spread over Wilson's face \"... but remember - this is a field operation, not a simulation. The dangers are very real. If you screw up, there can and will be catastrophic effects. Please follow the directions of your squad leader at all times. It is now time to make your choice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilson flicked a switch, and a number of choices flashed up on each cadet's metal wristband - their link to the Keeper mainframe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see before you a list of five missions, each one identified by the destination and main objective. In descending order, they are assigned to the respective squads: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Epsil. Make your choice by simply tapping the screen. You will be Phaseshifted shortly.\"</span></div></div>",

He approached them with a roguish grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright guys, welcome to Alpha Squad. I'm Blake Remora, and I'll be your tour guide for the evening. Looks like we're on the prowl for some misplaced technology today. Don't fret - just keep your wits about you, don't do anything stupid, and before you know it, your first mission will be behind you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake flashed another sparkling white grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'd like to run through your equipment. First up is what I like to call the 'Keeper-Beeper'.\" He tapped the metal wristband on his arm. \"It's basically your best friend - other than me, of course. It allows you to communicate with the other members of your squad - as well as Alpha Controller, back at HQ - and receive mission updates if or when they arise. It also has a rudimentary map of the area built-in, complete with flashing dots showing your squad mates' positions. Handy stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...\" Blake pulled a gun out of his holster and held it for the group to see. \"Is a Phase pistol. It's not like conventional weaponry - it's more of a hand-held time machine: whatever you hit is sent to Keeper HQ to be evaluated, and 'erased'. Essentially, it gets rid of bad things that shouldn't be around. Like these schematics!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lastly...\" he holstered his phase pistol and struck a pose, showing off the silvery, skin-tight suit. \"Is our uniforms. They're called Chameleon Suits, and they're pretty damn impressive - we seem them as they are, but while active they actually project a holographic image of regular clothes worn in this particular dimension. In effect, they allow us to blend in. You can also activate an optic camouflage mode with that little blue button on your wristband, which bends the light around you and makes you all invisible.

He waited until they were all there before addressing them gruffly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in <i>my</i> squad, cadets. Beta Squad. I'm Jack Vyper, your leader for this mission. It seems we're looking to interrogate the vice president of Anarkasia - find out how he overthrew the American government so easily. If you want to survive this, you all better listen to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack took a cigarette from a pack in his boot and lit it up, trying not to think how much shit he'd be in if the higher-ups knew he'd managed to smuggle cigs through the Shifter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you all know what that metal thing attached to your arms are. It's what we use to communicate with each other. It's also got a map, in case one of you stupider cadets get lost. Once in a while Beta Controller will send you mission updates, so pay some bloody attention if it starts to blink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...\" Jack pulled a gun out of his holster and fired at the ground. A chunk of the floor instantly vaporised. \"This is a phase pistol. It's not like conventional weaponry, rather it phase-shifts things back to HQ so they can make sure you didn't fuck up. They evaluate it, then erase it if they see fit. Just make sure to aim at the bad guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we have the Chameleon Suits, which projects a holographic image of regular clothes worn in this particular dimension onto your body. You can also activate an optic camouflage mode with that little blue button on your wristband, which bends the light around you, blurring you out. Good for when you've got nowhere to hide, but it runs out of juice fast. Try not to use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack glared. \"Any questions?

Jack pulled a long face before looking down at the device on his wrist and pressing in a button, letting out a blinding beam of light. as you lowered your hands down from your face you noticed a tall long blonde haired cowgirl stood before you where jack had once stood. a cowboy hat sat upon the top of her head, her long blonde hair came over the front of her shoulders. the cowgirl only wore a small crop top that barley covered her breasts along with a pair of leather pants, and of course she had cowgirl boots, spurs and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this what you was wondering?\" she asked you raising her hands upwards. you quickly noticed the cigarette lit in her mouth, wait a second, that's jack? \"sarge?\" you asked. \"yeah what is it?\" the cowgirls snapped back at you in an enraged tone. yup it was jack alright. \"Hard light holographic projection, or at least that's what the boys back in the labs are calling it. it allows you to physically become anyone of your choosing, combine that with your nano machines and you can even make yourself believe that you are that person do i make myself clear?\" Jack yelled at you&gt; \"sir, yes sir\" you yelled back at him or well now her. \"now then, seeing as the rookie here has gone and gotten me all dolled up for the occasion all of you will too be joining me like this, am i clear?\" jack yelled at you and your squad. \"sir, yes sir\" you and the squad replied in union.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou all reached towards the devices on your wrists and hit the button. you concentrated deeply on who to disguise yourself as, thinking back too the times before you signed up. you remembered that one girl you made out with years ago at a rave your friend had dragged you too. when you re-opened your eyes you realised that the suit had worked. you hair was now a compilation of different colours crashing together, as was your top and jeans. your wrists were covered in different neon wristbands, and you where now weaing the googles that she had had on top off her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well gollie rookie, ain't you a pretty fucking princess\" Jack yelled out loud directing that comment towards you. Jack approached you still in disguise as the cowgirl, the thought of this woman as jack amused you slightly. \"tell you what son you ain't half bad, but i don't see any goddamn jewellery do you!?\" he yelled in his new feminine voice, amusing you slightly. you once again used the suit to attach a pair of neon lit earnings on yourself, the dark hangar making them glow a bright blue colour. \"now ain't that something\" Jack said impressed by how quickly you managed such a feat \"but mine are still better, son\" he boasted at you as he moved his long flowing hair revealing a pair of revolver shaped earnings he to had dressed himself with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack walked away as you turned your attention around the room, you noticed how the men of the squad had begun feeling up each others new feminine body's with one another. even a few of themn where getting a little carried away, Jack didn't step in, he just stood there admiring the view. you continued to look around the room noticing the one female member of the squad from earlier, she too had shifted but found the sight of all these girls suddenly coming on to each other a little odd.</span></div></div>",

EMMA noticed your enjoyment and found a little fun in catching you off guard. before long EMMA closed her eyes and within a few seconds she re-opened them, looking down towards you as you continued to fondle her enlarged breasts. \"oh darling why stop there? why not take your affection a little further and treat me like the princess i truly am?\" EMMA said to you in a soft moan. this time the voice carried a soft sultry emotion with it, catching you off guard a little. unbeknown to you EMMA was loving this, she hadn't come pre-installed with emotions so she took every chance she got to replicate them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou lowered your left hand down towards her soft ass and gripped into it firmly with EMMA letting out a little bite of her bottom lip. \"Come now, show me how much you truly care.\" she said egging you on to go further.</span></div></div>",

The second this happened, time as we know it was shattered into a million pieces. No, an infinite number of pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime is normally linear - every split second, trillions of dimensions are destroyed, and the correct dimension is chosen as the next step within the timeline. The future is always uncertain - up to chance - but past and present are solid. Unchanging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with the dawn of time travel, all that has been disrupted. Time is immaterial. As is space. The laws of physics have been turned on its head. The universe has descended into chaos. The past is now as uncertain as the future - ever-changing. Time is no longer linear, but a web - every dimension linked to every other by a technology that shouldn't be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is but one answer to this problem: find the man who first invented time travel, and kill him before he can. Then make certain the technology will never again wreak havoc within the space-time continuum. This is the role of the Time Keepers. The last hope for order within the universe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><b>Feel free to do what you like with this, but remember: this is a serious story.
