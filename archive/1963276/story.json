The only thing is to leave *around* your boss, Mrs. Laney, so she won't get on to you for leaving technically early. As you put on your coat and stand up, you realize, your clothes seem ever so slightly looser than they did in the morning, but you don't think anything of it; the important thing is to skirt the old taskmaster. Heh, old, she's only 30, but she got to be manager fairly early by that hard-driving, take no prisoners work ethic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaney is on the phone with a customer, great. Your account logged off, you grab your bag, leave your cubicle, and walk around the other side of the cube bank. \"See you Monday Ron\" the smoking hot receptionist Laura says on your way out. She's another Laney-type, dark hair, brown eyes, svelte body and the instincts of a killer, but she's just a receptionist since she's only 19. You'd talked with her a little about why she chose to go right into work instead of the more traditional route of dicking around a few years in college, maybe learning something, but, she seemed to know what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately not everyone in the office was a shark. On your way out you gave a wink or air five to Helen and Scott, both in their late thirties, whom you'd talked with about going to get drinks tomorrow night. Tonight, though, it was all about a hot date with Kate. You'd gotten reservations at a three star restaurant and were going to show her a very, very good time. It was kind of hard with the two of you working different hours most of the week, you'd just come home, eat, welcome her in late, and go to bed, but you both had Saturdays off so Friday was the traditional date night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate, whom you'd been going out with for almost a year and living with for a couple months, was 5'5\" and curvy, with a very light complexion, and dyed blonde hair. She worked evenings at a fashionable clothing store and so usually wore flats with whatever was current and within dress code.</span></div></div>",

Kate didn't tell you but she also saw a slight change meant in your height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had however to stop thinking of it and focus on the day coming. You parked you car and when you got out of it you faced the only person you wanted not to see , Lauren .<br>\r\n\"Good morning Ron \" she said with her too usual superior tone<br>\r\n\"Hi...\" you briefly answered with a fake smile on your face .<br>\r\nLauren was kind of the office jerk , she was competiting with you at work as your boss announced she will give a promotion to one of you. On the contrary of her you were not too much attracted by money , you just didn't want to offer this bitch a chance to boss you around as she will get higher responsibility in the enterprise .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe both of you walked along heading to the office and you noticed that she was clearly slightly taller than you . You were a bit surprised by this as she usually were you size with her heels on .<br>\r\nLauren was 5'6\" tall without any heels on . You looked at her shoes and saw that it wasn't new shoes , in fact you remembered she wore it ( you sometimes stared at her dangling her shoes while working )<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you were one of the first in here and you both go to work on your respective computer .<br>\r\nAfter several minutes you glance at her and seing her deep in her work made you lose willness and you yawned .<br>\r\nJust at this moment Laney came in and looked at you with a quizzical eye .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit\" you thought before launching you back on your computer<br>\r\n\"Good morning everyone \" \"Good Morning \" Laurene answered cheerfully , happy this whole scene happened .<br>\r\nYou also shyly welcomed her while focusing back on your work .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the break you stayed with Scott Helen and a few other colleagues, noticing they also seemed a bit taller than usual .<br>\r\nYou asked Helen to come with you and when you only were the two of you you asked her if you looked smaller than before , she just laughed at you at first then was a bit doubting when you told her your usual height<br>\r\n\"hmm are you sure you are that height ? My husband is this size but I'm kind of sure he his taller than you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she told you puzzled you for the whole day , were you shrinking ? It was impossible ! And what will happen to you if you shrink ?'</span></div></div>",

You continued to shrink during the week almost feeling like every victory Laurene got over you made you smaller. When you saw her this morning coming in at the same time that you do you hide around the corner so because when she noticed your size about three days ago she has been doing daily size comparisons as a confidence boost. You know you were 5'3\" last time she compared to you but, you avoided her yesterday so she probably had at least 4\" on you now. When you walk in you see that Laurene went straight into Laney's office. You feel a sinking feeling in your stomach and practically feel a shrinking confidence. You get started on you work but, soon get called into Mrs. Laney's office. Laurene holds the door for you and smiles as she sees that you now 5' now a head smaller then her in today's heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Laney starts, \"Well Ron as you know the promotion was up for grabs for both of you and you really dropped the ball.\" looking directly at you. \"Laurene on the other hand has just set the company record for sales in a week. So clearly you both know who I would choose for the promotion but, the higher ups have called and offered Laurene a job upstairs. The reason your in here Ron was going to be so I can fire you but then Laurene considers you a bit of a good luck charm so you will be moved with her as a personal assistant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meeting ends with both of you being told to box up your desks to move which you spend the rest of the day doing. Towards the end of the day Laurene comes up to you and pats the top of your head. \"You excited to start work as my assistant little boy,\" She asks. You try to shrug her off but then she says. \"Hey you were going to get fired today if it wasn't for me so you better come tomorrow knowing I'm why you still work here.</span></div></div>",

The bed was in a huge bedroom of the flat ,there also was a balcony , a bathroom a kitchen and a restroom, a really beautifull full equipeped design house rented 1100$ a mounth. Unfortunately too much to you now. It was a bit difficult to undergo because if you hadn't fail to get promoted and demoted instead, you wouldn't have been this embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were used to your girlfriend taking some distances lately , you understand her as she has a lot of work and do it at home sometimes . You disliked even if she didn't introduced you to him the guy she named \"Tom \".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt beginning a few weeks ago you remembered she received an invitation on facebook ,Tom\" something\" she asked you if you knew him you said no, you even joked by saying she should accept him. she apparently did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince then she began having friendly walks, then friendly dinners , then parties. She had offered you to come sleep with her at his place , this man seemed to have been in the same high school you did back in the days.Today he was the kind of rich guy you overheard. He lives with his sister and they are trully going well together she had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really wanted to ask more question about this Tom , but tonight you'll do it...Maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate came back drunk at 2 AM , you were relieved and happy of your girlfriend she didn't spend the night with the other weirdo.

I'm happy to see you ! \" lacking energy , exhausted to have waited for her so late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey , I'm going to bed I'm out \" she coughed while walking to the bedroom she then paused and added \" By the way I'm a bit ill right now so please sleep on the sofa tonight\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to piss her off before asking her to pay the rent you said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course honey , whatever suits you! \". then added \" You know I have something important to tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? \" she said too drunk to stand up correctly, you saw she had a mark on her neck , you blushed terribly chocked from seeing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye...Yeahs.. I ...I need your help to p..pay the rent\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"what happend ?\" she dumbly asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I have found a new job but I have to move stuffs there so it takes time and ....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't understand why she chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow !

She rose her hand and gestured you to kiss it , and you did it and submitedly said thank you , as her presence had overcrushed you tonight. She then went to bed and you heard her moan un her room later. She was probably having private fun session. It greatly drove you insane and you began jacking off , it seemed you'd not have sex for some time for now ....You heard as if she was speaking but could only hear mumble.You could at least have some satisfaction like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day , you shrunk again , you were 4'0, the quickest shrinking spurt you had since Lauren's promotion. You quickly stressed as you woke to late and had to rush in order to be in time.<br>\r\nYour girlfriend was on the phone with this Tom again. Her face seemed so bright , you hadn't seen her smile like that in a long time . At least she's happy to speak to him , he's probably just a friend. You forced your thoughts<br>\r\nshe had finished eating and forgot to say goodbye when she left.<br>\r\nYou almost left without taking your boss , Laurene's shoes back , she promised you there was no more chances.<br>\r\nYour fear of her increased 100 times when you saw your girlfriend had locked the door before leaving , letting you no other choice than confronting her.</span></div></div>",

She had placed his bed right at the end left side of hers. Next to her slippers. Ron felt tears forming in his eyes while he thought of his future if he stay here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so uncomfortable he couldn't find sleep. The poor man even missed sleeping on Kate's couch now. Since he was awake he evaluated his options. Staying with Laurene couldn't be good. His boss already had crushed all his will in a matter of seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis options were limited , and both would have critical consequences. First one was leaving. If he left his new place he could still live in his car until he gets too small. The problem was he didn't have any money anymore so he couldn't even pay fuel for his car, or even worst , to buy food.<br>\r\nThe second was unthinkable, Ron tried not to think too much about it. He could stay like a good dog here and try to please his former rival to be fed and housed by her. It was destroying him thinking being at her feet and so much dependant of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning the small man was woken up by Laurene's foot lightly kicking his weak body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey bitch, wake up !\" She ordered , still sitting on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon woke up , lost until he realised the huge foot resting on his back and pushing him around.<br>\r\nHe stood up to look at his boss. Laurene was still towering over his 3'7\" puny height, she smirked while passing her hands in her long brown hair.<br>\r\nShe was kind of hot Ron thought while seeing her only dressed with a panty and a bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slept well shrimp ?\" She said looking down on him, her vicious dominating smile felt heavily humiliating for the weak man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes..\" He answered frowning, she was truly despicable<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurene saw his frowning face , she immediatly switched her tone to a more patronishing one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey , quite that look of yours. You should be gratefull to have a boss like me. Else you'd be living in a dumpster. Do you want to live in a dumpster bitch ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicturing that , Ron felt shiver down his spine. He immediatly lowered his head and apologized to his boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Laurene.\" He said with a scared trembling voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"give me my slippers now.\" She just answered . Ron kneeled to put her slippers on her big feet. He saw she had black nail polish and kinda had a well curved foot with long toes. Her feet seemed to be pretty well being take care of. It had no calluses and her white sole was really soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna take a shower now. So you'll get breakfast ready before I'm finished .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon just had the time to shook his head in agreement that Laurene stood up, by stepping outside the bedroom she walked on his bed . She was trully not respecting him he thought. Maybe he should have been more kind with her when he was normal size. She surely wouldn't have been so mean to him if they didn't use to be rivals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a pretty decent flat for a single woman. About an hundred square meters for herself may be pretty costy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon prepared pancakes and poured orange juice for Laurene and himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat at the table waiting his boss to eat.<br>\r\nLaurene came back after ten minutes of wait. She was already dressed up for work , but kept her slippers for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurene stood still looking at the little man. \"Silly silly boy. That's not where you're expecting to eat. She then took Ron's plate away and poored the food in a small cup. She then turned back to him.<br>\r\n\"You're expected to eat down on the floor , and not with your hands. Just eat like the good puppy you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon felt totally humiliated. He was expected to eat just next to Laurene's filthy feet ?! In a dog cup ?! The dog collar she forced him to wear was hurting so much too. Everything was for the worst.<br>\r\nThe human pet thought about all those facts for a second and ...</span></div></div>",

Your forehead didn't even reach her breast now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could greet her Laurene snapped her fingers .\" Hey , wake up hurry up !

You are since that day evicted from conferences but still asks Laura how it was when she comes from reunion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ate with Helen a few days ago, and she confided to you Alison planned in offering your post to Laura and kick you out, you barely slept imagining revealing your girlfriend you had no job anymore and probably won't have another one with your current height.<br>\r\nHearing the news you couldn't help but act the best with Laura, offering her to fetch coffee or if there was anything you could help with but she appeared rather dismissive or doubting about the possibility you could help her, since any sales question she asked you had proved to have no correct answer on your part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there you were, day 37, arriving 30 minutes late at work at 4'5\" having barely slept. You sneaked in the worspace only the two of you were placed and knowing she was at reunion. However, Laura was still at her desk looking at you with a quizzical eye. \"Hi Laura, sorry being late, had a problem at home.\". <br>\r\n\"Hello, hm you might want to keep it for Laney as she just came here 5 minutes ago. She wants to talk to you.\"<br>\r\nKnowing how to well Laney wanted to kick you out you had to ask Laura for help one more time! <br>\r\n\"Can I help you with anything Laura?\" You asked bringing her her favorite Mocca cofee but she said no. You stayed at your desk only to see all your files had been moved to Laura and your session was locked so after around 30 minutes of trying you came back to Laura and asked if you could work on a file for her but once again she said she prefered getting the job well done by herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bit your lips and looked down knowing you hadn't proved to be very efficient these last days but were cut in your thoughts as she settled one of her nylon pumped leg on her desk. \"However, I think you can help me. I'll have a presentation in around an hour and have to be my feet rubbed to release the stress, would you be able to help me?\" <br>\r\nYou didn't hesitate and said sure. Feeling a bit belittled to be used in such a way. Once you were done massaging Laura thanked you and even once in a while, mostly by the end of the day asked you to give her a foot rub. You realised it was really effective to her not be pissed at you and decided to study on this field only to have your girlfriend finding you were interrested in foot massages, making two persons daily asking you for ones now.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It has been said that Mrs.Laney had been promoted and wanted to put someone else in charge here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come over here Laurene.\" She then said to your rival. For once everyone's attention wasn't made for making fun of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon had a glimpse, trying to have a vision between his gigantic colleagues, of Laurene, perfectly makeuped in her fancy dress. He saw this bitch of a woman walking proudly to the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She doesn't deserve this !\" Snorted the small man .<br>\r\nHe looked up to Laura, she seemed very interrested in the event. She probably was a shark like co-worker , totally focused on climbing the ladder of the corporation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurene took the micro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well , I wanted to thank you all for the hard work , Huu, I'm a bit confused, this is such an honor !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfff I should be the one here\" He jealously said, Ron then grabbed Laura's robe and pulled it to have her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What ? I'm listening Rony!\", Rony was the surname she recently gave him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura , I have to go away .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine , do whatever you want\" She said in a uncaring way before turning back to Laurene's speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so small he could easily make his way around people.Ron headed towards the buffet and began eating various plate on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurene was feeling strong, victorious, she had worked so hard to get there. She was truly relieved to see her rival slowly shrinking away when it was time to make prooves.<br>\r\nHer thoughts then turned towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really wanted to thank the duo Laura and her tutor, Ron !...Come over here don't be shy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stepped , surprised to have been mentioned, she made her way to Laurene.<br>\r\n\"Where's Ron ?\" She said checking the area .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ron ? You there ?\" Said your giant promoted rival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalling you like that made her think of a joke she couldn't resist to make<br>\r\n\"Can everyone look under its shoes ?\" The worst was everyone was laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA red haired girl that Ron didn't know grabbed his shoulder , maybe she was a bit tipsy but her grab hurted pretty bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's here !\" She said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurene then said in a babyishing way \"Aww there you are little man , I didn't see you, come over here !\"<br>\r\nThe reduced Ron timidly stepped looking at his colleagues that smirked at him, He saw Helene laughing when a random other person made what seemed to be a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Laura were standing face to Laurene and Mrs Laney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurene spoke. \"Laura, we already told about it so I'll make it quick, we've decided that you were to take Ron's office and replace him since he no longer suits the job. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god ! I'll Do my best thank you\" Laura was almost crying in tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ridiculous Ron looked up to his former rival, now boss with what was left of your courage. She was so gigantic now, her barely reached her navel .The saler saw her huge sluty face looking down at him and smirking.She even had to bent to have a proper sight of him. Just looking at her made the small man's stomach rumble weirdly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Ron, I wanted to congratulate you for your hard working in the company.\" She said slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon had heard rumors that they were planning to fire him since he did awful results, and it was getting even worst everyday. Ron looked at Laurene pleadingly. Doing so he felt a weird feeling he had preceding a shrinking spurt, the problem was it was like...Growing, bigger as he felt more humilitated. It was getting really hard to resist now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you had been someone hard worker in the past, and since I'm such a good boss, I'll annonce you we found you a new job !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused a second , the small Ron was terrified and devastated, he felt like he had to let it go and shrink as it was getting too overwhelming to resist the shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have decided to make you , Laura's official assistant, you can thank her because she really insisted for it!\" She said it and everyone turned their attention at the new assistant as he bent a little from a thing he couldn't hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly began to shrink unstopably. When Ron began able to go back to his feet he saw what was happening. \"N..No...\" He looked at everyone fixing him silently. Ron looked up, Laurene seemed marveled by that, she was bitting her lips from exitment probably. Laura also seemed deeply analyzing what was going on, even Laney was stepping closer to have a view. He saw their faces slowly going higher, as their whole body increased in size slowly .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts came back of the horrifying moments he was just living and he felt an enhancement even higher of the shrinking spurt.He slowly stopped at 3'6\" while Laurene had followed his shrinking making a \" pewwww\" sound for it. She pressed her finger on the small demoted man's head . \"Oh . It has stopped.... So what do you say Ron ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurene really didn't let him any time for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh..What do you want me to say ? \" He tried to say defiantly while standing now as tall as one of her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurene took a step to him and stopped so close that she had to look all the way down to see him. It was trully intimidating for the small man.<br>\r\n\"And how about , Thanks ?\" She sternly looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small man let go all his proud aside and accepted the truth, it was hard keeping a rival relation with her. It was so annoying to picture her as his boss now. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th...Thanks boss...\" He mumbled .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh , No , I'm not reaally your boss.... You know, Laura is your boss now, I'm more like the boss of your boss. Wow , that sounds a bit downgrading , sorry about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the last time you had Laurene's attention, she then went to party with her closest colleagues while Laura scolded you for being such an awkward person.<br>\r\nBoth Ron and her were at the buffet right now, eating. \"Hu... You're so awkward ! You've humiliated us !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B..But , Laura , you've been promoted and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah , and you demoted , so try to call me by my firstname again and I get you right out the street got it ?\" Laura looked really pissed of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact she was his direct superior now made Ron think straight . He couldn't risk to lose the job , what would Kate think if he does.<br>\r\n\"Sure boss ! Sorry!\" He tried to be fun and bent in order to show his appologises but his hand knoked The Giantess Laura's hand and made fall a food right on her heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck ! Look at what you've done twerp !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh!! Sorry boss !\" Ron rushed around but found nothing to clean her shoe of , he then went on his knees and rubbed with his cloth the creme off her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust in that time Helen , his former friend came in, he was not used to see her dressed up, but she was pretty in this suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"wow , you've really have fallen down Ron.\" She said when you raised up to say hi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha , yeah, I just poured something on Laur....my boss's shoes so I wanted to clean it.\" Ron tried to fake a smile and at least was satisfied to hear her laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, yeah that's normal Ron. Way to go !\" She said , before turning her attention to Laura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulation for your promotion , I'm sure we'll work well together !\" She continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon thought if Laura was his boss now, What would that make Helen to him ? He realised it was stupid thinking about that. The post was created just to keep him around. The small man still hopped that Laura could help him and eventually tell Laurene he has improved, that it would eventually make him promoted back ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at all the other persons, that were having fun while he followed his new boss around like a dog while she was congratulated by everyone.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a favor since she didn't have to be up herself another couple hours, but, she'd largely taken on your burdens in addition to your own, so while clearly unhappy to have gotten so little sleep, she was also kind of used to it. She poured two bowls of cereal for your breakfast, you getting the smaller bowl, and you sat around the table eating quietly. As she was done, without noticing you had a couple spoonfuls left, she said \"let's get your daily measurement\" and went to the ruler you'd pasted onto the wall. Standing next to each other you looked ahead at Kate's chin as she marked your new height off with a marker. \"You're just barely over 4'7\" today, honey, the shrinking may be slowing down yet\" she said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hoped so too. Anyway, you got into your work clothes (the manliest extra-small pantsuit Kate could buy with her employee discount), got in the car, and went to work. You were of course sitting on all your phonebooks; you hoped you really did stop shrinking soon so that you could at least keep driving if nothing else. You were a couple minutes late, but it was easy to slip in now you were getting smaller. You checked your email. One message, from Mrs. Laney. \"Be in my office at 9 sharp.\" Damnit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked over, this time waving to Laura, and gently opened the door to Laney's office. \"Yes Mrs. Laney?\" You asked, a little timidly. \"Come in, shut the door behind you,\" she said. You did so, then sat in a chair across the desk from her. Your feet barely touched the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were late again this morning, runt, and don't think just because you're shrinking I don't expect the same results out of you.\" What a bitch! You were late, and it wasn't the first time, but considering, -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you understand?\" \"Of course Mrs. Laney.\" \"Good. Stand up, come over to this side, I want to see something.\" You did as told; Laney pushed out from her desk and stood up next to you. With her heels she was over a foot taller than you, and her grin indicated that she loved it. \"That's all I needed,\" she said, but as she sat back down she knocked a pen off her desk. \"Will you pick that up for me?\" You quickly got on your hands and knees to look for it, since you didn't want to invite the comparison that she was almost taller now sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaney had always been aggressive but she'd taken a special liking to lording over you; last week she was talking about making you her personal assistant, since soon your stature would make meeting with clients impractical, and she still wanted you to be \"useful.\" When you spotted the pen under her desk, you leaned forward, grabbed it, and stopped when you felt a heeled pump shoe land deliberately on your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm just seeing if you'll make a good footrest. You have a little more shrinking to do little man.\" Laney almost cackled. Then there was silence; you were so embarassed that you didn't dare turn your head upward to see her domineering gaze. For about ten seconds you just felt her leg balance on your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock at the door saved you. \"Get up,\" she said, putting her foot down right under your head. You carefully crawled back out so as not to hit your head and handed her the pen. \"Quarterly is due next Friday,\" Laney reminded you, \"and you have a lot of work to do to catch up to your quota.\" Really!? You'd been at the doctors for nearly a week trying to figure this whole shrinking thing out! Not to mention more and more of your work time was sacrificed to head games under Laney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Mrs. Laney, I'll make it.\" What else could you say? She told the knocker, another manager from a different department, to come in, and the visitor looked down and smiled at you on your way out. It seemed everyone was looking down at you by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately the rest of the day went without much more human interaction; your confidence shaken, you chose to work through a pile of paperwork you'd been building up instead of making any of the calls that you needed. Helen noticed you were gloomy and tried to cheer you up with a cookie at lunch, but other than that, you avoided everyone until 5, and in fact stayed over a little longer to avoid having to say bye on your way out. This meant you walked out behind Laura. Your new height gave you a great view of her ass swaying; that actually made you pretty cheery up until you got to your car and saw the phonebooks again, a reminder of your unfortunate circumstance.</span></div></div>",

You only wished to be back home with Kate, at least she always felt supportive and is nice with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter Laney's room after shyly knocking on the door. \"Hello Mrs Laney, I wondered if you needed something before I go?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't move her eyes out of her laptop and waved at you to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, is there anything I can help you with m'am?\" You asked worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Ron, I've got a reunion call tonight and it might be really stressfull so I thought you could work for your paycheck and stay for a while?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't please you to stay after your due time, but it was your direct boss that has asked you so you might not have a choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok sure I'll stay for a while.\" You casually said sitting on a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha, No Ron that chair is for Julie, she's coming with us.

You choose to rub Laney's feet in a prayer not to be denounced.</span></div></div>",

Kate, and everyone at work, had pretended to be supportive during this mysterious shrinking illness, but you had begun to feel a little invisible to the world. Did short people feel like this all the time? You pondered for a bit when Dr. Marquez opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hola Ron, now I understand that you have this very unusual condition; please tell me everything you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I've been shrinking; I didn't notice until Sunday; so far I've lost about four inches. I haven't had much of an appetite - I've barely been able to keep anything down in fact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much have you eaten this week?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried to force myself Tuesday but I threw up after I had a hamburger. I've just had water and toast in the mornings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...when you called in and said that you were shrinking I honestly didn't believe you but your symptoms line up with a disease that we previously thought was just an old Mexican myth. You will forgive me for being almost excited about your case, but we may learn very much about the human body from your condition. I did make contact with a researcher at Capital Hospital. She'll be wanting to talk to you since you have definitely verifiably shrunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I going to be lab rat?\" You shuddered. What if it never ended? You might literally be a lab rat, in size anyway, in a matter of days. It felt that way. Calm down, you thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Marquez did her best to assuage your apprehension. \"No no, Ron, of course not. You'll certainly have informed consent at every stage of the process, even if you one day fit in my hand, hehe.\" You didn't laugh. She continued: \"But of course we expect to reverse this long before that point. Dr. Lisa believes you're suffering from an unknown interaction of digestive and hormonal disorders. It should be possible for us to fix and maybe even reverse your height loss, even if it means regular injections or diet restrictions. For a few weeks however we need to simply monitor your condition and make sure we have the problem figured out, before we start interfering in your body's process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's okay, Ron, you thought to yourself. Only a few weeks. Then it'll all get better. You may even become a star! However at the moment you didn't want to face anyone, much less the whole world. But this won't be so bad in the meantime. You'll be watched closely and probably only lose another couple inches. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see no reason for us to need to keep you under observation,\" Dr. Marquez went on, \"since you seem to be only gradually changing and not having any other difficulties. We would like you to stick to a strict water-only diet, record your height every eight hours, and come in every Monday and Thursday for blood work. Here's Dr. Lisa's card; she has graciously agreed to support you with a stipend for new clothes, but she wants you to continue going to work and change your routine as little as possible. Sometimes disorders are brought on by stress and any large changes may aggravate your condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if this could possibly be unstressful. But you couldn't complain too much. You stood up to thank Dr. Marquez and shake her hand, and discovered that now you had to look slightly up to her. On your way out you did manage to feel optimistic as you set up appointments for the blood tests and with Dr. Lisa. Maybe things were going to be okay after all. Kate, who had been in the waiting room, lit up when she saw a smile on your face for the first time in almost a week. You hugged and walked out to her car together.</span></div></div>",
