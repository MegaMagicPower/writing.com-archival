With his guardian \"Pulle-Upe\" and a replica of his ultimate goal, the Porcelain Throne, he seeks to reclaim the Underwear of Big Kids!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nighttime Struggle: With Accidentia seemingly defeated, Markus rests easy, until an Accident is discovered in Markus's home base of Crib. Moving to the safe haven of Bed, Markus contacts Pull-Upe to guard him until he finds out who the new leader of the Accidents are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Backslide Campaign: A year had passed since the Nighttime Struggle had finished. With Markus's new brother, Dean, all seemed bright. But then, out of nowhere, the Accidents struck again-and Dean seems responsible for it. Has Accidentia is been revived? Is Pull-Upe required again? And how does Markus's own mental state fit into things?</span></div></div>",
