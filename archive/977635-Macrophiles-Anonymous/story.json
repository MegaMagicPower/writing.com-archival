            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Okay despite that really weird intro this is your basic Shrink Story, with a few little additions here and there. First off this story is divided into three parts. The first part is kind of like the Virgin Tell Interactive here on Writing.com where you answer questions, like why are you into the macrophile thing? Is it a self-annihilation fantasy, or just something you're into for no reason you can identify? What kind of Macro do you like? Vore, crushing, or just looking at people at a significantly lower POV? How about the giant? Do you prefer guy, girl, animal? And finally how about your favorite place on the net for your fetish? What site do you go to? If it's here on Writing.com then what's your favorite story? And once you've answered as many of these questions as you want, maybe even thinking of a few of your own. After that leave a single link open for the next person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the real story, this is as usual divided up into two parts, both male and female. Both POVs start shortly after the character(Steve Marshall for the guys Andrea Watts for the girls) arrives home after signing up for the MA program. The first choice for each one is to identify what kind of companion they choose, a vore, a crushing, an animal(Those will come with a trainer to give you the shrink and explain the commands), or an anthromorph . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAddition: You may now chose to play the story from the view point of the MA person sent to help someone live out their fantasy. Choose first your Gender, then you type(Human, Anthro, Android, Animal, or other), and then the origin of your POV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk choice time, do you want to tell us about your fetish, and more importantly add a link that some of us might not have heard of, or do you want to go to the story?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Okay since this is my parade I guess I have to go first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy am I into Macrophile stuff?<br>\r\nQuite simple, it is my self annihilation fantasy. Everyone has an SA, because we all feel guilty about something. If you've ever watched the scifi show Star Trek: Deep Space Nine(On weekdays 10:00am-Noon[Central] on Spike TV) then you may have noticed that the Doctor of the station and the Chief Engineer regularly make trips to the holosuite(a high tech enviornment simulator) to live out hopeless battles like the Alamo from the losing side, where they have no chance of living through it. These kinds of fantasies are a normal reaction to living, as even the most heartless person feels guilty about something, even if they don't admit it, and these fantasies are actually a way of atonement. I'm probably also into it because I've always been a head taller than my age group, standing at around 6'8\" now at age twenty, and so I've never been small, and its always been an interest to wonder what it's like to be tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of macro am I into?<br>\r\nWell mostly vore, usually sandwich is preferred, and usually unknowing on the part of the giantess. I don't know why but having them know you're there just kind of takes some of the fun out of it, though certainly not all of it. I can get into the POV stomp photos, but I still prefer a good vore story or clip. As stated above I'm more into the giantess stuff, though I won't say no to an animal vore story. We have plenty of those here on Writing.com<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy favorite place on the net for this?<br>\r\nWell I like the Big Gulp even though it's just a web archive now. They still have great stories there, even if some of the links are broken.

Part of it, is the idea of exploring our own world.. but from a completely different perspective. A little need for adventure, I guess, plays into this. Ever since, I was about 7 or 8, I had taken a strong interest in the shrinking/growing genre. I remembered telling people around that time that I was going to invent a shrinking machine, because my interest for it was high. But no one else seemed to share my interest in it. Until I came to writing.com, and saw all of these wonderful stories, I've realized that I'm not alone. Basically the whole idea of being able to change size has interested me greatly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n           What kind of macro am I into??<br>\r\n  I am into the GTS genre mostly, a lot of things go with me, but I'm mostly into the Crush/FootWorship kind of GTS. I believe it simply stems from that it makes you feel really small and that you are insignificant to the giantess. I am into other kinds like Vore, Butt, etc. But the Foot one has to be #1. I usually like a mixture of Voyeur/Non-Voyeur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n           My favorite place on the net:<br>\r\n It'd have to be Asuka's website: www.giantessplanet.com, it is only Giantess, but it has all the kinds of sub-fetishes associated with the genre on the website's stories. You can post your own stories on the website, if wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA company like StarTech, I must say is a dream come true!!<br>\r\n            </span></div></div>",

I believe this is what got me into this fetish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of macro am I into?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVore and vore only. I read \"same size\" vore stories but I much prefer my vore stories to have a size changing element. My favourite size of the prey would have to be doll size (3\" to 6\") in relation to to the predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Sage, I actually like it when the predator knows that they are swallowing their prey. I can appreciate the appeal of the predator not knowing though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy favorite place on the net for this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere really isn't much of this stuff is there? I was thinking about starting up a web site called www.humanvore.com since 99% of vore pages out there seem to be about furry vore or giant lizards swallowing women. I never made the web site because I didn't have killer material to start it up. Any web master knows that it's web site suicide to build a site, sit back, cross your arms and then expect people to magically come up with contributions. It's really too bad since there is presently no web site that unites the community.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresently, the human vore community is spread out accross stories.com, Yahoo groups and other smaller forums accross the Internet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'll take ths opportunity to plug my Yahoo group:<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/anime_girls_feast/\" target=\"_blank\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/anime_girl...</a></span></div></div>",

If so you know that I like furry and demi-human gts.  I figure I may as well give a short synopsis of how I got into it.  Note, I like non-furry gts as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLove the videos games.  Love love love.  But when I was young there was only one storyline.  Save the dumb broad who got kidnapped.  Final Fight, Mario, Zelda, so on and so forth.  Then I found Breath of Fire 2, Darkstalkers, and latter on girls like Tifa Lockheart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI loved how cute girls could actually fend for themselves and were such likable characters at the same time.  Tough cute chicks became my weakness and I had a fascination with catgirls due to Katt and Felicia, and other demi-humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after many godzilla films and gts cameos in movies and series, I found the giantesses.  They had a reason to be tough, they could squash whole buildings if they wanted.  It was just too cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm no egotistical frontliner for the fetish, I knew I liked them and I didn't try to push it onto others.  I just watched what I enjoyed, super big girls playing with the tinies.  Of course as I was in puberty I also fell into the statuesque super woman thing too.  Big breasts, rock hard rump, sexy abs.  I began to love amazons as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amazons went back to Katt and Felicia and I tried to rekindle my love of angel cuties and catgirls on the new giant scale and really couldn't find them.  Instead I found anthro giants with super huge tits, ass, and muscles and after some time to understand my feelings I became a furry-macrophile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have prefferences.  Paw over foot, catgirls will always hold a special place in my heart, and I'm still a sucker for a giant Tifa.  But now I'm pretty much into everything size related.  I preffer furry guys and no real prefference to females.  If it has curves I like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that's it.  Now the peeps who wondered and even the ones who looked down on me (no pun intended) know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up, a person who needs no introduction...</span></div></div>",

Right now my opus magnum is my interactive The Shrunken Screen, though I do write self-contained stories that are here and there across the net.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy am I into Macrophile stuff? Well, reruns of The Land of The Giants probably put it into my subconscious, pretending I was an olive-skinned Valerie, but probably the kicker that brought it into my conscious mind and made me actively pursue it on the net was the graphic novel Gullivera, particularly when she's picked up and played with by the giant male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of macro am I into? Mostly SW (shrunken woman), although I can see the attraction to GTS (though SW is still my favorite genre) and always of the gentle sort (By gentle I mean no real violence, although an SW who was forcible undressed, for example, would fall into my definition of \"gentle\"). To be truthful, I don't see the attraction to vore, so my tases don't run there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy favorite place on the net for this?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vinnyloo here,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would have to say that my macrophile fantasy has grown a lot since I was a little boy. I was quite advanced, and VERY early on, perhaps in kindergarten fantasies of being shrunk were very present  - I distinctly remember imagining my kindergarten teacher 'bottling' me and the rest of the students, and then stashing the bottles away in a cabinet.  I also remember imagining that me, and this girl I was friends with, had both been shrunk along with many in the class, and the rest of the class was using us in an 'arts and crafts' project, wrapping us up in clay to take home and keep.  The girl who got us was a girl I thought was cute, but was kinda mean and spoiled, and she thoroughly enjoying teasing me and my friend as she wrapped us up in clay to take home. I realize that these fantasies sound a bit complex for a kid, but I assure you, they are what I thought about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I got older, I began to have more fantasies come into being - and being shrunk just naturally became part of them, along with the helplessness and humiliation.  The bigger the girl, the more helpless I would be, and the more 'playful cruelty' she could deliver without getting caught.  It has always been from the shrunken perspective with me, for various reasons:  The girl would be able to go about her day as usual, being normal sized, while I was already meek and helpless from the start, in danger simply from being in the giant world around me.  Also, it would be easy for the girl to keep a tiny boy (perhaps an inch tall or smaller) a secret from anyone who would want to help.  There could be prolonged episodes of 'torture', with little or no hope for escape.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenerally, my fantasies became more focused on one thing - being tiny, helpless, and mashed into a completely beaten and immobile state under the giant smelly sole of a pretty girl's foot.  Then, in that state, to see her causally moving her huge foot around, and to see her giant, pretty face, grinning down as if it was just a funny game.  Often my friends that were girls would become the subject of these fantasies - if they could shrink me and put me through a little hell, would they?  I liked to imagine them playfully putting me through 'a day in their shoes', but no matter what kind of condition their stomping foot put me in, it was always 'just part of the prank', and they would slowly start incorporating more and more cruelty, with the excuse that it was 'all in fun'.   Sometimes they would let me go, but usually my life became little more that a blur of giant, crushing smelly feet, with my friends' pretty faces occasionally laughing down at me.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, as you can see, I like GTS but only from the shrunken perspective, and I like imagining being under their feet.  I don't like the thought of being crushed to death, but rather mashed until I have no hope of moving again, and have to endure the feet and face of the pretty woman or girl until she's satisfied (which often never happens).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for sites, I like Crushfeet and E-feet, along with Feetsees.</span></div></div>",

I'm fairy-fan, teehee and so forth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm going to have to agree with LittleJessica and Atrus with the whole not-so-into-vore thing. It's kinda off putting, isn't it? Anyway, I respect vorephiles' choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm a girl and currently eating stir-fry and rice. I guess you can call me a macrophile but not in the sexual way- a little erotica is okay though. I'm into giant guys and faeries (sometimes just shrunken or tiny women) as you can tell by my username, and I love it when a giant interacts with a young lady, or a human interacts with a faerie, etc.<br>\r\nI just think it's sweet, espcially if the giant is kind and gentle (and a hottie, hehehe) with the tiny lady in his hands. Sometimes I fanatasize being held by a giant guy through my stories or just in my head *taps elbow*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess it started when I was a kid when some of the cartoons I watched some a of giant/faerie/growth/shrink episode and I saw a character(s) being held in someone's hand. As I matured, along with my interest in boys, I started imagining what an encounter would be like between a faerie and a human, or a human and a giant. Later on, I found websites with stories about SW or giants or GTS- yes, the sexual content somewhat frightened me- but it sparked ideas in my head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI asked myself, how big WOULD fingers be like to a smaller being? How big WOULD a giant's voice be to a little being? So many ideas! And I even calculated with how many times larger my/the ideal giant would be in comparison to a normal man his age -&gt; this I did because I was sure some of the heights I read just seemed either too short or too tall for what the author had in mind (in hindsight, I'm a nerd P: HA! And PROUD!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel so much better now that I can actually say this- I'd just get embarrassed if I told someone about this interest of mine... maybe some day, yah?</span></div></div>",

Part of it is due to the self annihilation fantasy explanation, but it feels like there is more to it than that.  It is just something I have always enjoyed.  My first experience with it that I can remember was \u201cChip \u2018n\u2019 Dale Rescue Rangers.\u201d  That was one of my favorite television shows as a child and seeing the world through the eyes of rodents seemed like a fun idea.  Another part is unexplainable really.  Everybody has their own interests that other people may consider strange or boring and this is one of mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of macro am I into?<br>\r\nVore and stomp tend to be my favorites.  I prefer a furry giant over a human one, but that does not mean I dislike humans.  If it is a human I prefer it to a giantess though.  I don\u2019t know why I prefer anthropomorphs over humans, but I have always been into anthropomorphic creatures.  When it comes to violent versus gentle encounters, I prefer violent ones as indicated by vore and stomp stories being by favorite.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hello.  Hopefully most of you should know who I am - if not, feel free to look at my portfolio and add to one of my interactives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the obligatory plug is out of the way, I'll thank whoever it was that gave me the gift of a paid account recently - I don't know who you are, but I am very grateful, and feel like I'm not yet using it to its full potential.  I fully intend to get down to writing some self-contained non-interactives for this site at some point, but inspiration is the only thing I lack now.  Again, all y'all that read this should feel free to e-mail me suggestions or recommendations to get the ol' wheel rolling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, to the matter in hand.  I can't say for certain where this macrophilia thing first came from for me.  I'm a child of the eighties, so there were a lot of weird cartoons out there, influencing my poor little mind.  Perhaps giant transforming robots contributed in some way?  We'll never truly know.  The only thing that may partially be responsible that I could think of was the fact that I saw 'Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger' at an early age.  You know the one; it starred Taryn Power's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, of course, is the fact that the Ted Danson version of Gulliver's Travels hit tv screens when I was at a very... delicate stage of my puberty.  That may have been the point where I realised that there was no turning back, that I was in on the giantess ride for the long haul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat particulars are there that I find really good?  Unlike most people, I find no aspect of crush or vore especially exciting; at the end of the day that's death, and I find it hard to get turned-on by that.  Perhaps it's the voyeurism aspect that appeals, but with the risk that should the woman you're observing discover you, she has the power to utterly end you if she should so wish.  It's the potential for destruction that a giantess holds, the comparison in strength between her and things around her, that does more for me than gratuitous scenes of devastation and sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, I still enjoy a good demonstration of unbridled giantess power as much as the next person, but my first preference would be for unaware shrinking.  Often I find myself looking at women in the street and imagining what it would be like to be tiny in their presence right at that moment, and many of them find their way into the entries I add to stories here on writing.com.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeet play a big part in my stories sometimes, but that's more through a logical approach than anything else; above all, I think that stories here should make sense, with logical progression of events.  A shrunken guy is gonna meet feet first, and when a woman discovers a tiny man her first instinct is not to eat him or make him worship her peds.  That level of absurdity breaks the illusion of reality that stories can conjure, and I don't like that one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, I like feet, I think I mentioned, but I would put my favourite part of the female body down as hands.  They just seem more intelligent and full of potential than feet, while still leaving plenty of room for size comparisons in shrinking stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't really recommend any sites that haven't been already, but I can advise you to go out and find the first few issues of volume 3 of Wonder Woman, as well as issue 19 of Blue Beetle - plenty of fun with Giganta in those issues.  And I can't recommend Irredeemable Ant Man highly enough - the man gets a shrinking suit and actually does the logical thing of going off to see women in the shower.  Never thought I'd see that in a Marvel comic book...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, I'm a bit of a geek, in case you hadn't already realised.  I'm just not sure over whether I should be more embarassed about that or this macrophilia thing...</span></div></div>",

And I am...a macrophile.  I'm also a budding writer who likes to use macro stories as a warm-up and diversion from writing more serious works, and in my spare time, a submission wrestler and a bit of a history buff.  The two hobbies fit together.  After all, Abraham Lincoln was a champion catch wrestler in his day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if you can tell, I also tend to ramble a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, how did I get into this odd, odd community/fetish/interest?  Well, it was lingering the back of my mind ever since I was a child.  I always liked the idea of a girl that could kick butt, but not be evil.  Most of the time, you look in fiction, and any female with strength is automatically a villain.  Then, with the internet and file sharing exploding, anime became easy to acquire.  Video games featuring tough, cute women came out.  It all got put to the side, ready to interact with the one idea that was still lingering in the back of my mind, mixing into a stew of oddity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen one day, on a whim, I ended up typing in \"giant women\" in a random search engine.  One thing led to another and led to another and all these pent up ideas took life.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not an annihilation fantasy for me.  I take no pleasure in being weak, being hurt, or in general being depowered, which is why shrink has next to no appeal for me outside of writing a plot.  I prefer the idea of the woman growing larger, more powerful and more free.  And because of that meandering mix in my brain, I have a decisive preference for anime and fictitious females over celebrities and the like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, I'm done.  I don't want to go too long.</span></div></div>",

I occasionally write stories, and have developed three different 'universes' for such stories, one set in present day England, one in the late future, and a third in an island world called Mungra. I also write short stories based on none of these universes, and these are usually the ones I included macro/micro content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy am I a Macrophile?<br>\r\nI don't know really... Since I can remember, I've always been into giant/giantess creatures. I even remember asking about why I go erect when I see giants in films and stuff in my year six sex education. xD<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of macro am I into?<br>\r\nOne thing I'm pretty sure I like is the exploration of the bodies of the macro. I love how detailed explinations get with any macro creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm into almost anything involving giants. Whether they be male, female, or not even human, I love the macro character in general and pretty much anything they do. The only thing I find iffy is any toilet stuff. That kinda disgusts me a little...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also doesn't matter to me if it's someone who's giant compared to everyone or someone who's tiny compared to everyone.

Somewhere along the line I found it more plausible if the people being eaten were shrunk. From there I went through phases of furry anthros, dragons, and finally giantess. I have found the sheer idea of a normal sized female eating a shrunken male most exhilarating. I highly prefer food item vore such as a female eating a shrunken guy in a sandwich, hamburger, hot dog, taco etc, rather than plain. Though I do draw the line at digestion. I also enjoy it when a female character who was nice and loving to the male while he was regular size then turns mean when he is shrunk. My age preference is from 15-37 for females and I prefer the shrunken person perspective.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well this is Derek Metaltron from ye old England and I too am of the Giantess loving type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst I'm gonna admit some home truths. I am not into the violent giantess which the large majority of stories and interactives go for. I don't particularly find getting killed by a rather OTT giantess in any means erotic. That's not to say that I wouldn't read a little of that stuff if it was well written, but that can often not be the case. I do of course respect any one who feels otherwise - it's your version of macrophilia, this is mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo as you can guess I am more of a gentle and playful giantess lover, my favourite areas being unaware giantesses, soft vore and that wonderful and sadly relatively unknown word called 'Endosomaphila', which basically means a person who enjoys the idea of being inside another living thing, though not always the digestive system - in short then, body exploration. When I was little and even before understanding sex I liked the idea of shrinking down and going inside people's bodies and exploring them, with or without their awareness - both ways suited me. I would of course point out that were I to have the opportunity to shrink down I would be careful to ensure two things - that I am able to regain my size whenever I want, and that it would be impossible for anything to harm me (a stray foot, stomach acids, nasty falls and a million other deaths). Call me boring if you want but I reckon it pays to be prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh and I'm not a foot person. Kind of ironic since my mum is a chiropodist, but feet just don't appeal to me, except the seems to climbing up a person body (which does appeal). And squishing is definitely out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy ideal giantess would be a girlfriend who is completely ok to the idea of me changing size and checking her out both in and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing which worries me as a Gentle Giantess fan is that there seems amongst the interactives and stories to be one way or another when it comes to the violent/gentle giantess divide. The violent type is more pronounced and is seen in many a situation which usually uninterests me, yet I find an appeal to the sexual and body related area these stories provide, if not the violent end the males often see. In contrast it's great to see a rising number of gentle interactives with gentle and playful giantesses and even a forum on the site, but virtually all of these see a lower age rating which prevents any juicy stuff from appearing on the interactive. It is my long-term intention then to try and put an end to this, and I am in the progress of devising a detailed interactive with a focus on gentle giantesses and body exploration, including for the first time a story which sees you as ruler of a land of giants and not having them rule over you. Entitled 'King of the Giantesses', the interactive should see an aim to allow gentle fans who still like the idea of doing the dirty stuff hopefully have the best of both worlds when I eventually release it in its skeletonal form. So to sum up if anyone finds my idea interesting give me a buzz and let me know if there would be anything you'd like to see - I am hoping to give the public a chance to put forward their suggestions within the boundaries set and allow for their desires to be seen, and there's a good chance of a forum if there's enough interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, as far as my favourite places, I'm going to add some fav stories of mine on Giantess World which fit into my interests nicely, as well as some interactives on this site itself which I find original or well done. Hope you might find something you like in these as well. :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiantess World Stories<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArousing Angie - One shot story with a playful giantess and some great body exploration stuff. - <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.giantessworld.net/viewstory.php?sid=50\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.giantessworld.net/viewstory.p...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack In Her Hands - I don't confess to be a huge Legend of Zelda fan but this long but amazing story blew me away. It's completely PG but it completely captures the idea of a gentle Giantess and her would-be boyfriend perfectly AND carries on the story of the N64 games too! I only regret it finishes so abruptly. - <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.giantessworld.net/viewstory.php?sid=824\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.giantessworld.net/viewstory.p...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChange for a 22 - Most have probably read this one but if not it's the start of a well-written series of stories where there is a good developed relationship between the giantess and our hero. Read this series, you won't regret it. - <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.giantessworld.net/viewstory.php?sid=18\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.giantessworld.net/viewstory.p...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlanar Shift - Another brilliantly written relationship fic, this time with a human scientist who contacts a hot woman from a parallel dimension and travels to see her - only to find she's four hundred feet tall.

And there's TWO sequels! WOOH! - <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.giantessworld.net/viewstory.php?sid=657\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.giantessworld.net/viewstory.p...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWriting.Com Stories<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Biggest Change - I'm not (as yet) a fully coverted lover of anthos but this interactive is seriously making me considering changing my mind as it is brilliant. Focusing on stories with mega-sized gentle antho giants and giantesses it does in many ways do what I hope 'King of the Giantesses' will do - have stories with gentle giants yet allow for body exploration and other things which would be more taboo in regular gentle works. -  <br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1329525\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/ite...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn's Fantastic Voyages - A immensely detailed anime/game giantess interactive by a talented gentle giantess lover.

But my fav is like makeup macro like being in makeup and then them using it with you in it or being in sunscreen and getting rubed onto someones body I like it when the giantess is between the age of about 6-13. Like a few days ago my little sister grace age 8 got bought a brand new makeup set and she decided that she wanted to use it but no-one knows I'm a macro so she sat on acrros te room from me and started applying it all over her face I like lip gore the most out of all the makeup and then she asked me to watch her apply her lipstick and tell me if she was doing it good so I did and without her knowing imagened being stuck to her huge lips as she was doing her makeup and she loves the stuff she's always got it on and I see her applying it heaps so it's a good house to live in. And then about 2 days ago it was like sunny as outside and grace wanted to go play outside so she went and got the sunscreen sqezed it onto her hand and began to rub it all over her bodie and as she was doing her legs she noticed a tiny bug on the ground and she has always hated bugs her whole life but loves to sqaush em in any way so she thought it would be cool if she grabed the ant and used it as abit of sunscreen and when she was done she showed me the ant on her hand ground up into a paste. And god I wished I had of been that ant because that's one of my macro fantisies to be in her sunscreen but not in a because she's hot way just because it's one of my fantisies and also iv writen two interactive macrophile storys on this account one is about the female simpsons characters and one is about the female people in my family mostly kids and it has 10 chapters but they were all added by me so can some of you plz add to them just try to add to the one about people in my family it's called shrunk around kids and females but you better read the rules first</span></div></div>",

When I was younger I didn't quite understand where it all came from and why I liked it, I just did at that age. When I turned 13 or 14, I started having fantasies about some girls at school, related to vore, feet, and I guess the usual macro/micro stuff. I knew it was a bit weird, but the thoughts felt good. Somewhere along the line, I got introduced to furry's.. I honestly don't know when and exactly where, but I guess when I saw it, I was like \"this looks pretty hot\". That was about 10 months ago (Today is 12-22-09). When I first started exploring the fandom, I was only interested in female. I guess at the time, male furry's didn't quite cut it for what I liked. Soon, however, I began to make my way to bisexual stories and drawings. I actually tried to solely stick with female (remember this is mostly macro/micro stuff). But as of now, I am completely bi when it comes to furry, macro or not. In the real world I am completely straight, I don't know why male furrys turn me on but not male humans etc... but I fine with it. I still have a lot of fantasies with human girls (no younger then 12 and no older then 20 or so). Those fantasies are mostly at school, because I am surrounded by \"ideas\" per say. But usually when I get home, or its a long break or weekend, I transition to furry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, and I guess its just personal preference, I only like actual furrys, not avions (bird like creatures) Scaleys (reptile related, though dragon is hit and miss) and and water creature (fish etc). There are some furries in general I don't quite care for, and that is anything rat, monkey/ape and certain hooved animals... theres probably more, just don't quite remember...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs it a self-annihilation fantasy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess so, if my definition of self-annihilation is correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of Macro do you like?<br>\r\nWell my favorite macro stuff at the moment (who knows.. it could keep changing) is most definitely: paws (male or female), human feet (female only), sex, masturbation, vore (nothing too lethal), pet or slave scenarios and stuff along the lines of that. I like the idea of crushing, but I were to die from it, ten I don't like it. Extreme pain is kinda a turn off. And overall, I guess I don't actually like macro, I just want to be a micro (SO its technically macro, but just at a different angle i guess). Because I believe it is more likely to happen with less complications. (cause if something did turn macro, there would always be problems).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow about the giant? Do you prefer guy, girl, animal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kinda answered this above, but I will write it out again. For human giants (or me being micro) I only prefer young girls (12yrs-20yrs). For furry giants, I like both sexes (age varies with looks more then anything), I also have been coming around to just plain giant animals, not necessarily plain macro (or regular size) anthro. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally how about your favorite place on the net for your fetish?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment it is Furaffinity- <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/j-fox/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.furaffinity.net/user/j-fox/</a>  (this is my account with an extensive \"favorites\" gallery, but I am only a watcher). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the first site that got me into the furry fandom is Rogue's site. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://rogue.macrophile.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://rogue.macrophile.com/</a> He is a writer and very well know in the furry fandom, if you look at the \"links\" section, he has a great list of macrofur sites (mostly other artists and writers). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne artist (which I found from Rogue's list) is Foxkin <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://us.vclart.net/vcl/Artists/David-Von-Foxkin/\" target=\"_blank\">http://us.vclart.net/vcl/Artists/David-V...</a>     He used to have a site with a better layout, but checking it now, it is down. Foxkin is really the person who opened me up to bi-macro furry with his comics. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother artist that Rogue's site has led me to found is Arlin. Her stories are fantastic. They are extremely well written (well I think so) and usually have a good mix with story and XXX (there are non explicit stories in there as well) If your into giant furrys, check her site out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://arilin.macrophile.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://arilin.macrophile.com/</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I guess Macrophile.com, but I honestly don't explore there much....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Writing.com, I have several favorite stories, some just a pleasant read, other for.. well... you all know....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story I am very particular about, because when it comes to family... well I just don;t like thinking about, it just grosses me out. So when ever I find a story, I will never read any parts to do with moms or aunts or any older family memeber. When ever its about sister or cousins, I imagine them not related to me whats so ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1418039-Shrunk-with-friends-family-and-more\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/ite...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story was more enjoyable for the read itself, it has pretty much exactly what I want, but on a 13+ rating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1319633-New-Student\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/ite...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is probably my all time favorite stories here on writing.com.

It isn't very indepth or even well though out, but at the same time, it is one of my all time favorites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1180113-Anthro-Paws\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/ite...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anyone has any questions or I don't know, just want to talk or something.

Wolf, I am 15 years old, and this is my first post on any macrophillia related anything, ever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Why am I a Macrophile?<br>\r\nI really don't know, I suppose there is some really long and deeply-rooted psychological explanation for my love of macros but I prefer to just say that I do. I guess I was born this way because at a very young age (6 or 7) I so an episode of \"Justice League\" called \"Attack of the 50 foot Woman\" and I felt a strange sensation in my pants (for lack of a better phrase). After this I had to run out of the room because I felt embarrassed watching it. For several years I thought this event and others like it were just strange occurrences until one day when I was 12 I was on Youtube and I happened to type Giantess into the search bar and BOOM I found out that other people liked this stuff. That's when I really started to get into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-What are my Macro preferences?<br>\r\nI have different preferences depending on human or anthromorph. For humans I like female giantesses around 16-35 years of age. <br>\r\nAs for furries which are my favorite macros I am bisexual. I'm not sure why this is, but I try not to think about it. I like gentle giants/giantesses more than the savage/violent ones that I see so often. I specifically prefer stories where the giant wants to keep the tiny person but the tiny person is resistant (but not to extreme levels).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Where do I go to fulfill my fantasies?<br>\r\nThese places:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1242119-Unstable-Future\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/ite...</a><br>\r\nUnstable future is a great macro story for everyone no matter their preference. It also has the potential to be more serious than a normal fetish story which in my opinion is always good. It also has a good variety of soon-to-be giants to choose from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1329525-The-Biggest-Change\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/ite...</a><br>\r\nThe Biggest Change is an gentle-oriented story about giant anthros. It was the 2nd thing on writing.com that I read and what got me to keep reading here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1319633-New-Student\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/ite...</a><br>\r\nNew Student is probably close to what you're expecting it to be with a macrofur twist. It is a story about the first human to ever attend a school for giant anthros.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://arilin.macrophile.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://arilin.macrophile.com/</a><br>\r\nArlin is an amazing writer and her stories are some of the best macrophile stories I have ever read.

I went on hiatus for school, and I probably won't be back for much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy am I a macrophile? If you want my honest opinion, I'm reasonably sure that you're born with what you have (sexually-speaking). If this is not the case, it's a simple matter of impression in early childhood. Same goes for homosexuality, bisexuality, and fetishes, like this one. I liked the thought since I was young, and I finally decided to go on the internet for it when I was about thirteen. I found what I was looking for. It never occured to me as a kid that this was perverse, but it is - I know that much now. That said, I couldn't be happier with life. Happiness and fetishes are largely unrelated anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA person I found along the way was a man who wrote something to this effect: \"Anyone who does not contribute is a thief.\" Since then, I decided to write. I've written a story for the video game Soul Calibur, and I wrote an amateur vore story (though I'm not into it) for Kingdom Hearts. These are my contributions if anything. I actually like feet and shrinking, though I can read and write most anything else. Imagine my surprise in life when I found a girl (the first girl I've dated and will ever date) who actually accepted this. I feel like I'm going all over the place with this, but I just want to write one other piece of information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter what you like, all you'll face on the internet outside of macro groups is hatred, misunderstanding, and plain disgust. I have to say, though I don't really want to be normal and just like women straight up, I wish I could be normal so I could avoid the hate. I guess fetishes are a double-edged sword in that sense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do I go? Ah, my girlfriend.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hey. I have quite a few macrophilia based stories out between my 3 names here on writing.com (ginbug, ginbug2, and donmon). Don't ask me how I come up with these names because honestly I have no clue. As far back as I can remember I have had a fascination with being tiny or encountering a gigantic creature, many of these fantasies centered around being inside of the mouth and deeper. I must admit sometimes I am a little weirded out as to why I have this strange fetish, but then I know that I was just born this way. My search for content that would fulfill my fascination began with just google searches for \"swallowed by whale\" \"inside giant mouth\" and things of that nature. Then one day (admittedly at a younger age than you should be viewing these sites) I stumbled upon a series of personal websites of artists who made photoshopped pictures of giant women. It wasn't long after that I found my first vore picture. I kept on searching thinking that I would eventually see it all and my fascination would be quenched. Over the years it became apparent that it was a little more than a fascination. I lurked the forums occasionally for a long time. Eventually I made my first account (donmon) on writing.com. I read the stories and eventually worked up the courage to add some of my own chapters. I tried endlessly to become a good artist but drawing never really stuck. As I wrote I taught myself more and more, learning from novels and other authors on these sites, how to write a good work of fiction. I feel that without these stories I would have never discovered my ability to write, and possibly would not have ended up majoring in what I did. I do not hold myself too high as a fiction writer, which is probably why my Rob the Voraphile stories seem to stand out from the rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a way these stories are my ultimate fantasy put down on paper. And they are written in the first person, unlike pretty much all of my work which is mostly 3rd person, so I can really get into the character that is pretty much based off myself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess I'll talk about what I am really into now. First and formost I am a giantess fan. I almost always picture myself in the shoes of the tiny, in fact it used to make me sick to think otherwise(and still does to some extent). Though as I explored the forums and learned of all of the other sub-fantasies contained within this thing we call macrophilia/ voraphilia, I grew more interest in other areas. I have always found the idea of being inside another creature to be exciting, regardless of its sex as long as it was not human. But I soon gained interest in these anthropomorphic creatures, for macro and vore situations only. Once again as long as its not human, and some specifications on what animal it is, I do not care what sex it is I am really only interested in the vore aspect. It was not until fairly recently, however, that I overcame my disgust of the human M/f scenario and actually became quite interested in it. Perhaps my dominant side had finally made its way into the fetish, I don't know. Sometimes I don't even mind reading the occasional M/m vore scenario...though take it much further then that or make it too erotic I will be turned away by it pretty quick. It's really strange how different the sexuality of this fetish and that of my normal sex like are so different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as the lethality of my macro and vore preferences go, I do not find death attractive in any means. I do not want the victim to die painfully in the stomach, though I am quite attracted to an unwilling prey. But as in my rob the voraphile stories my biggest interest is that of willing prey, even dominant prey at times. For me I want this to be something that I wouldn't mind happening to me, I know a lot of people with similar fantasies say its for the fantasy and that is it. But not me. If there was any way possible for me to go through safely with it I would not even second guess it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo yeah I guess thats me. </span></div></div>",

Just not bare feet. I get turned off from that.

Gotta say it's taken me a long time to get here and it's so twisted and frightening that I can't even think about it anymore without feeling waves of fear and at the same time excitement at the thought. It's surreal thinking that I have a desire like this but I figured at some point I've got to come clean about it. Spent tonight looking for a place to start and I really don't know what will happen but here's my story and the plot of my most far out fantasy right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA disclaimer - Stop reading if at anytime you feel uneasy. Trust me there are other things that could use your attention. I want you to know as you are reading this that I would never wish this on anyone. I'm writing this just so it's here and while it is my desire, I have no intention of trapping your attention on this one. To me though, it seems like the greatest adventure to take. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the spirit of honesty, but also keeping discreet I think it is possible to do this if you were in the right state of mind...and I want to say that there are ways to get there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to make it real. As much as I can, I've looked at macro as something more than just a psychological phenomenon. I actually try to see what the physicality of it might be like and after much thought and after looking at as much as I can, here I am. It's brutal. It's not at all like what the stories say it's like. In this world, if it happened to you, there's no deus ex machina to save your ass, it's just you. Because being tiny, especially if you were ant sized, which is what I fantasize about sometimes, is perfect aloneness. There is never a scenario where I'm alone alone, there's always a gigantic woman in front of me. She has been every type of woman I can think of, in every age and shape. Most of the time though, I'm attracted to the mother figure, sometimes an actual mother, never my own though there have been times where I've thought about it, but for the most part, just a beautiful woman who is a mother. Sometimes, she's unaware of me, other times and particularly when I'm feeling really deep into it, she is aware. What she does is generally the same in all situations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecently, I've been really attracted to the idea of a pregnant mother to be micro around. They seem like the most unlikely of people to do what I have in my mind. But when you think about it, pregnant women have cravings. And she would seek to nourish herself in whatever way if the situation called for it. I think about that a lot and wonder, if I was ant sized, would a hungry pregnant woman even notice me in her breakfast. I would literally be nothing to her except fuel for her day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's a pretty normal thought for most voreaphiles. But really think about what I just said. Think about how it would look, if you were in this woman's breakfast, small as an ant. And here's the reality of it. It happens all the time. They eat tiny creatures all the time without realising it. Heck even when they're sleeping they end up devouring tiny beings that wander too close to them. Somewhere out there, is a woman who has actually eaten a conscious living being unaware while she was pregnant. What does that mean? I leave you to think about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI want to go on about the fantasies though. Mine are not limited to just pregnant women. I like older women too. For some reason the nurturing aspect of life gets me. There is such an amazing contrast between the idea of a nurturing woman and the reality of a situation where that woman is eating. Imagine a woman having her lunch. She is literally taking chunks out of the world and placing it inside her mouth. Imagine that in all it's clarity. Food about to fall onto her tongue. What does that tongue do? It makes all that food wet and slippery, perfect for sliding into her. She takes life into her mouth, and that mouth is specifically designed not to let anything out once it is closed. Her throat? A thick and strong tube designed over eons just to pull anything in her closed mouth (sometime's open, particularly these  days with vore being so popular on the net) down further into her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does that mean? It means that once something is wet in her mouth it's as good as hers. Nothing can escape that pull. Add gravity. Her mouth may be small to a normal sized person, but anything that can fit inside is going to take a long trip down that throat of hers, down into her esophagus, into darkness that consumes you even more than you can imagine because inside that cavern of flesh that you call her stomach is everything you can imagine when you think of hell. Thats right. Everything you can think of when you think of hell is contained inside that woman's stomach. A place of permanent darkness. Where everything overwhelms your senses. Fire burning you alive, her digestive juices eating away at your body as her body uncaringly strips you of everything that makes you you and adds it to her own. The smell. No one can possibly describe what it would smell like. Why? Because what goes on in there is death. There is nothing there that will help you live. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet things do live through it. Even here life prevails. There are creatures that have adapted to that woman's insides. And she uses them all to make her just as she will use her food to fuel her. I had to put that in. Because hope. But thats life isnt it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will tell you something though. Woman are attracted to vore. It's in their nature to consume as much as it is in their nature to give. I think that's why I like them so much as the characters of my fantasies. The dichotomy of nurture and nature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I'm headed off topic a bit, I want to see it for myself. That's why I'm writing this. Maybe one day I will. Oh yeah, I have to say something else. I do not believe that it would be possible to enjoy the experience without a little help. You will have to alter your neurochemistry at least to maximise the experience. You know why. All that needs to survive to the end. But you would also want to know how to see. Perhaps, you'll find a way to do that in there. Would be interesting. Would be better if you could alter your physiology to survive the whole thing altogether but hey, that would take away the fun right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike I said, picture that woman. Yeah, something died in her. And it was conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It occurs to me that most of the writers here have been taking perhaps too specifically about aspects of macrophilia. I'm not gonna complain, but it's worth a mention that the last guy was fishing for a yes/no answer to \"is vore creepy\".<br>\r\nI'm not prepared to answer that question any more than I'm prepared to write my magnum opus. It's out of my league as a person to handle. <br>\r\nHere's the short version of what I'm about to say: macro/micro is probably among the most broad fetishes out there. The possibilities in this one fetish alone (not adding any other fetishes in) are greater than a large number of other kinks. We have tons of resources to get our fix, from freakin' movies to roleplay boards and everything in between.  Compare that to , say, an incest fetish and you'll immediately see that in terms of diversity and potential, we're among the best fetishes. It's such a diverse kink that GTS image boards have  a significantly higher ratio of fetish - specific tags to generic tags than almost any other image board. We've got all the bases covered. <br>\r\nAnd the reason I bring this up is just to say that I feel lucky that my interests have potential. I know I would hate writing the same thing over and over and over until I gave up. I mean, that's most of the reason I don't write more chapters; I feel like I have to branch out and try new things as a writer, and create a story without rewriting anything. <br>\r\nIt's a challenge. I got stuck with a <b>challenging, broad fetish. </b> Thank goodness for that. <br>\r\nBut I digress. I like to think I'm generous when it comes to the fetish, but I'll summarize my preferences here. <br>\r\nI prefer female normal size, so the tiny doesn't have to share, <br>\r\nI prefer male tinies,  because the shrunken party's physiology is less important, but males make more pathetic (and therefore better) tinies.<br>\r\nI prefer sizes below an inch,  because I figure since it's a fantasy it doesn't have to be realistic in order to have interaction between the micro and the macro. (Not to say I don't like unaware, I just like the option of aware to be on the table. )<br>\r\nI prefer human characters, which is probably surprising, considering all the additions I've made to this site. I just like my macros to have character, and so long as that qualifier is met, I'm not picky.<br>\r\nI prefer vaginal play the most.  It is sex, after all. <br>\r\nThis site is what first got me majorly invested in the fetish, though it's not where it started, so thanks for that, I guess. <br>\r\nOther than that, I've got nothin '.<br>\r\nI'm a nerdy writer. You shouldn't have expected much. </span></div></div>",

I was always interested in shrinking (I think Zelda: Minish Cap coming out in my younger years contributed to that). Eventually, as I grew up, the shrinking interest blossomed, I guess, into a GTS interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI prefer a small guy over a giant female, because destruction and violence are not turn-ons for me. In my main imagining, I am an inch-tall fairy, because mobility is something important to me, and I've always wanted to fly. I prefer an aware female friend over the unaware people who eventually become murderous psychopaths, as many stories are wont to include. Furries are alright if not ridiculously done (and Krystal is top-tier <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> ). Gardevoir (you know, the Pok\u00e9mon) is usually the larger party and is commonly paired with the small fairy. Specifically, her name is Ciel and she comes from an interactive story that has since been deleted from this site (although part of it is archived on DeviantArt if you search for \"A Giant Gardevoir and You\" ;P).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterests? No feet, no anal, no entering breasts, no crushing, yes vaginal spelunking, yes being atop breasts (just being on them at a small size is enough for me) or hiding in cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for websites?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://e621.net\" target=\"_blank\">http://e621.net</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://vggts.macrosonic.org/\" target=\"_blank\">http://vggts.macrosonic.org/</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://giantessworld.net\" target=\"_blank\">http://giantessworld.net</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis site :^)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, hello to Somedaynotsoon, you brilliant writer, you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, I've gone on long enough.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hey everyone, kibakid56 here! Semi-new to this site, but not to being a macrophile. lol <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow'd I get into Macrophile Stuff?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm gonna have to blame 'Honey I Shrunk the Kids' and the 'Magic School Bus' for getting me into it. lol Both are very much my favorite things to watch and got my into fantasizing about being shrunk around people and just exploring, kinda. (Kind of super excited for the new movie Shrunk coming out next year? I think) But my true fascination prolly came when I was playing a Star Fox game when he had to get eaten by a huge bug looking thing to get a crystal out of its belly. I remember not making it past that boss for a while as a teenager... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy am I into Macrophile stuff?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs to why I'm into it, I think it's because I find it fascinating! Being able to shrink down to smaller sizes (microscopic and macroscopic) and exploring the unknown would be mind-blowing! Especially if there are 'normal' sized people around that don't know you're there! You can see how they live their life and/or be a part of their life (quite literally if you accidentally get eaten!) without them knowing. And if you are able to shrink down to a microscopic size (say like a micron) you could see bacteria and other very small creatures that are invisible to the naked eye! So I guess, in my mind, I like it because of the potential scientific exploration (guess that's why I'm a biochemist. lol). I also enjoy it for all of the 'trouble' one could get into like getting lost in some guys pubes, lost in someones ear, or even in the vagina while she is having sex with a man. The possibilities are almost endless!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of macro am I into?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI like to be the person that shrinks in the scenario (I'm a guy so, being the shrunken guy for me). I like the idea of being small to the point where the giant can or cannot notice me. Unaware is my jam, to be quite honest. There's just something about having the giant not know I'm there that makes things much more thrilling! Not even in a dangerous sense, but a sense that you get to see how that giant acts and why they do the things they do. Kinda like a teeny-tiny spy or fly on the wall type of situation.The type of giant I'm into tend to be mainly men, age 18-35, and if they notice me I'd prefer them to a gentle giant. Let me curl up in their arms with my head on their bicep and my cheek on their pec! (Please and thank you! lol) Giantess, animals, and furries (some furries though are quite nice!) are cool and all and I've read and watched some videos, but it doesn't really do much except give me a thrill. But, reading about a guy walking around barefoot or in boots and you have to watch out and climb his clothing/body to get his attention is very exciting to me! I'm not much into violent stuff though, so no being stomped, squished, or chewed to death. But the feet thing is kinda fun, having a giant play with you with their feet or you even playing in their toes and they are wondering whats causing that itch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy favorite, FAVORITE, thing would be being swallowed unaware by the giant. May it be in the food they are eating or drink they are drinking or I just crawled into their mouth while they were sleeping or I got pulled into their mouth by them breathing cause I got to close. Pretty much any and all the things that can get me into their mouth and on their tongue! lol I think tongues are very sexy! (is that odd? lol oh well.) Quite literally, if I could shrink down and be able to play on a mans tongue I'd be in heaven, may it be them playing with me before they swallow or are just playing with their tongues cause its a fun thing to do when someone is bored. The only thing I don't want to happen is get digested (yes, I know that would happen if swallowed). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a realistic world (if shrinking would be possible) I would probably put on some rubber suit (maybe one made out of polyisobutylene, the part of chewing gum that can't be digested in the stomach) that has an air tank or some kind of breathing apparatus that can purify the air of my surroundings so that I would be able to breath (and may go explore deeper into someone, intestine? bloodstream? [have to watch out for the white blood cells though...]). Then I would shrink down and find the giant I would want to explore inside and out. My ideal giant would probably be someone in their teens (puberty age). The reason being is there is a heck of a lot going on in their bodies (aka hormones) that I don't think we quite have a grasp on. By being ingested unaware, the teen giant would act as normally as he would so that, while inside, I could see what is happening in his body (ergo, hormone-hormone interactions and hormone-cell interactions.) It would be the best, and most fun, study ever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy favorite place on the net for this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI love writing.com the most I think. I love the stories people come up with and I've helped add on to a few. Besides this site, I've just Googled and found some Youtube videos and some stuff on DeviantArt.</span></div></div>",

The paper add for this MA thing had sounded too good to be true, especially with the low price tag. You couldn't have filled your gas tank up with the amount this cost you. Admittedly gas is getting more expensive, but still this is cheap compared to what you would have expected. Looking at the thing in your hand you can only guess that it cost twice what you're paying for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tachyon Tag, as the lady at the desk had called it, looked like a kind of high tech injector you'd expect to see on a scifi show. Star Trek or Wars or something like that. Its basic shape was that of a gun, with a needle at one end, and all over it was blinking lights and readouts, which you couldn't even begin to make sense of, and you wondered if the maker had just put them on for show. It was entirely possible that the device was simpler than the thing in your hand seemed, and that flashing lights and stuff were just bells and whistles added on for the viewing pleasure of the customer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still couldn't believe someone had a service like this. It was just so weird. Yet you had to admit the moment your eyes found that article in the paper you were hooked. You wanted to see what it was like at antsize, and now, a few hours later, you were sitting in your home, waiting for the companion to show up and make those pictures in the catalog a reality in your home. Picking up the catalog you flipped through it to the girl you picked. The catalog had a picture of each companion doing something associated with their particular field, with an insert on the side that was supposedly what they were saying as they did it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can choose either<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany, a good looking blonde in a shirt that barely covered her nipples let alone her breasts. Skinny, but not stick figure, just the kind of skinny that solicits wolf whistles on the streets. Her picture had her eating what looked like a sandwich, what kind you couldn't tell, while looking at the camera. Her insert read:<br>\r\n\"I need a little variety in my diet. You might do nicely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha, an odd looking girl, but mostly because you really couldn't she her because the POV of the camera was pointing up off the floor, with the sole of her shoe taking up most of the picture. Her mode of dress was black, and her eyes were screaming in delight as she brought her foot closer, supposedly crushing the poor cameraman. Her insert read:<br>\r\n\"I like bugs. The way their bodies sort of turn to liquid under my heel. I wonder what you'd turn into?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha, an interesting looking woman, though the picture was actually not about her. Instead it was about the various animals around her. From cats, to dogs, to small mammals and reptiles, all the way up to a komodo dragon. According to the info on the page she was the animal trainer, and thus if you picked an animal as your companion you met her too. Her insert read:<br>\r\n\"My babies are just dying to make your acquaintance. Starving for your attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides the female section of the catalog, which according to the front cover is the men's MA list of companions, is two section of other kinds of companions. The first is a collection of male companions, most of which are probably comparable to the females in attractiveness, and from the photos they are probably just as skilled at their art.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other section is a surprise to you, and it makes you think that this is all some kind of hoax, as the people listed in it are not human. Well, really they look human, but certain features seem to have been cut and pasted from animals. The cover art for the section, and apparently their top companion is named Molly, and she looks like a perfectly normal wolf, if you discount the fact that she's standing up and her fore paws look like human hands, though you can still see claws on the end. It appears they offer male companions in that section as well, and according to the title the companions within are called Anthromorpic Humanoids, or Anthros for short.</span></div></div>",

You know how to set it, you just don't bother cause the thing doesn't record right. Looking above that you stare at your real clock and see that you've been home for over an hour. According to the ad she would arrive anywhere from now to tomorrow at around the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minutes tick away on the clock, and slowly you find that despite the adrenalin still pumping in your body you can't stay awake. After a time the darkness overtakes you, and you wonder just before you fall into deep sleep if this is all just a dream and you'll wake up tomorrow laughing at yourself for your own foolishness before going to work. The images that you experience while your asleep can't really be called a dream, but most involve you falling into the photo of Tiffany, landing inside her sandwich, and holding on for the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sharp slam awakens you from the dream, if you could call it that, and you jump up, looking for whatever had made the sound. After a few seconds you realize it was a car door, and stepping up to the window you see a woman outlined in your porchlight, and not just any woman either. It's the girl from the photo, Tiffany. She's even wearing that strip of cloth for a shirt/bra, despite the fact that its just a little past midnight now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the clock in a double take you start. You'd been asleep for almost two hours, yet you felt like you'd been sleeping for hours, unfortunately it felt like that because of the pain in your back, which at first you were willing to caulk up to the sofa which you'd bought second hand, but looking back at where you'd been laying you see something that makes your heart drop. It's that Tag thing they gave you at the MA office, you must have rolled onto it in your sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou panic for a moment and sprint to the sofa with a speed you wouldn't have thought yourself capable of considering the fact that you'd just woken up, but then you really didn't want to have to pay the money to replace the device. Looking over it you also realize that you'd never used it on yourself, which you were supposed to do when you got home. Looking at the smashed dials and lights you wonder if its still works, and so with a sigh you test it. The injector bites into your neck and you pull the trigger.</span></div></div>",

I believe you\u2019re expecting me,\u201d says the lady at the door.

Oh yeah, call me Steve because it\u2019s weird when people call me Mr Marshall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSteve, can we sit down somewhere?\u201d Tiffany asks while standing tall and grasping her expensive looking leather briefcase with two hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both sit down on the very couch that you were sleeping on moments ago. Tiffany opens her briefcase and takes out a small palm top computer. You keep eyeing her cleavage formed by her tight fitting T-shirt under her jacket. You try to do this inconspicuously but knowing women, she has probably already discovered what a pervert you are. Suddenly, her brilliant blue eyes make eye contact with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSteve, can you describe your ultimate fantasy for me?\u201d she asks in a professional manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel your pupils dilating and beads of sweat rolling down the side of your face. You weren\u2019t ready to be confronted with a question like this. Tiffany can tell you that you feel uncomfortable but she seems to enjoy seeing you sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny fantasy you have, I will do my best to fulfil it for you. In my car, I have many costumes and props,\u201d she continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have so many fantasies that it\u2019s difficult to give an answer. All the vore stories you\u2019ve ever read flood your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I don\u2019t know what to say. I have so many fantasies and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the first one that comes to you?\u201d she cuts you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your mind, you narrow your choice to two fantasies. Which fantasy do you describe to Tiffany?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Would you now be taken back to this point in time when you died? The answers to these questions are really playing at your mind when you suddenly jump back, tossing the Tag onto a chair as the bell rings. Tiffany has arrived at your home, and that means its time to see if any of this is real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're still not completely sure that this isn't one of those damned able hidden camera programs where the person is fooled into thinking all this stuff is going to happen to them, and then at the last instant you find out that you've been completely humiliated on national if not international Television, yet are unable to sue for the emotional duress due to some little bit of the show's contract that allows it to do this to people because they signed another contract on the show, like the one you signed at the MA office. You'd read it throughly, but lawyers are sneaky, and the thing, while only a page long, might have had some fine print you missed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head to clear your thoughts you run to the door and open it slowly. The girl behind it is the exact same one you saw walking up the drive, and you're relived that you can't see any obvious cameras or vans. The woman, for the most part, looks to be enjoying herself. As you look her up and down she does the same to you, and after a moment nods in satisfaction. Whatever she had been visually testing you for you had obviously passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Mr. Marshall. I think you know that my name is Tiffany, and I'm one of the companions at Macrophiles Anonymous. I hear you signed up for our service,\" she says, and you stand stark still staring at her for a moment before opening the door wide and motioning your hand for her to come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I did Tiffany. And you can call me Steve if I can call you Tiffany,\" you say as you lead her into your living room. The two of you take a seat side by side on your sofa and you stare at her some more as she pulls off a hip pack you had failed to notice before that contains several objects, including what looks like clothes to fit a very small person, and some black dots that might be clothes too, but are so small you can't really tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Steve, here's how this works. I have with me a bottle of the miniaturization agent and the antidote. When you're ready I'll give you the agent, which has been marked with a yellow stripe. If you want to be about half an inch tall, drink it only to the yellow stripe,  and if you want to be about a 16th of an inch, then just chug the whole thing. Now let's see here,\" she mumbles to herself as she continues to rummage through he bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go,\" she says triumphantly as she brings out what looks like an old fashioned walkie talkie, handing it to you a moment later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" you ask, poking the thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is the communicator. I use it to stay in touch with you. See it has two littler walkie talkies on the side, one for the half inch high, the other for the 16th of an inch. You'll carry one with you so that you can tell me of any problems that occur,\" she told you, continuing to go through the pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have any problems ever occurred for you doing this?\" you ask her a little uneasily as you put the communications device on the coffee table with the rest of the stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of thirty eight times I've done this, only once have I had a problem,\" she told you, pulling out a beaker of some brownish liquid and handing it to you. You don't have to be told that this is the shrinking agent, it has a yellow stripe about halfway down the beaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" you ask as you stare at the shrinking potion. It doesn't look particularly appetizing, but then again you're not sure what you expected it to look like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sort of digested him. He was my first you know,\" she said in an offhand kind of way. So off hand in fact that you find yourself nodding and saying, \"Isn't that always the way?\" before your mind registered what she said. When it does hit you, it comes like a ton of bricks, maybe two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" you shout in both disgust and alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he didn't take his Tag,, which meant that he was the only one I can remember, so even though he was like the tenth time I'd been called to do it, he's the only one I remember. That's kind of how they came up with the name. If everything goes right then only the receptionist at the office knows who you are, and she sees so many people a day she probably wouldn't remember if you were black, white, or purple after an hour,\" she tells you, in a serious tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, are you going to drink the potion or do you want me to leave?\" she asks, and you both stare at the beaker in your hand. Looking at it, your doubts thanks to that little revelation about her one accident with this fade into the background. This is a once in a life time chance, and so you grasp it. Opening the beaker you find the agent smells like terpentine and looks like Indian ink, still you hold your nose and close your eyes, and take a drink, but how big a drink.</span></div></div>",

With that thought firmly in hand you decide to chug it all, just to get the maximum experience you can out of this. After a long pull on the beaker you slam it down in front of you and smile like you'd just won a drinking contest, and Tiffany nods in approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was very good Mr. Mars- I mean Steve. Not many people like to chug it all down at once like that,\" she tells you. You look at her and wonder if this really is all some kind of joke, as you don't feel anything happening to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how long until it...Oh boy,\" you say as you stand up, and then notice that Tiffany, even sitting, is now a foot taller than you are standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an immediate process. I suggest you get onto the table and take off your clothes. I put some ones your size on it, though I admit some of the customers tell me later that they didn't wear them, and I didn't notice,\" she tells you, turning away to avoid embarrassing you. You wonder why considering you should probably be embarrassed for doing this at all, but shrug it off and begin to take off your clothes, which are beginning to feel like circus tents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more minutes pass, and when you're down to a size you think it can take you climb onto the table, which is actually quite difficult because it keeps getting larger, but you manage it, and now stand atop your coffee table, looking around your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were a kid your father once took you to an aircraft hanger in an airforce base, where they kept the huge transport jets that carried supplies. Your house, which had always felt kind of small to you, is now even bigger than those, and you gaze around in awe before your eyes fall on Tiffany. You can't believe how big she is. It's like looking at mountain and watching it as it breathes. At this size she could do just about anything to you and you wouldn't be able to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to stare as things continue to get bigger, and then you begin to feel a slight breeze, and realize that you're still nude, though at this size you doubt anyone could tell without a microscope. Looking around you see the little dots from earlier, and you find that you were right, they were clothes. Now you have another choice, put on the clothes she provided, or do this without.</span></div></div>",

Slipping them on you find they fit quite good, well all except the collar, which was apparently made with someone with a head the size of a watermelon in mind, but other than that these could be the most comfortable clothes you've ever worn. Suddenly an odd scene from The Simpsons pops into your mind where the neighbor Flanders shakes his butt saying \u2018Feels like I'm wearing nothing at all.' After a moment's hesitation you do the same, and start laughing before a shadow passes over you, drawing your attention back to the present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above you Tiffany is looking down at the minuscule speck on the coffee table that is her current client. She only sees one dot so she assumes that he put on the clothes, and is about to continue her duty as a companion. Pulling the walkie talkie thing closer she pushes a button on the side, and suddenly a very small grey block pops off the side. This is the other end of the communicator, and according to the pamphlet that came with it, it has a two hundred foot radius. Slowly, carefully she tips her hand so that the small block falls as close as she can make it to the speck that is you, and then looking down she places her ear near her larger receiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IS EVERYTHING TO YOUR LIKING STEVE?\" she asks in a voice that is overpowering despite the fact that she is speaking softly. You cover your ears for a moment, and after the ringing subsides you run over to the thing she dropped onto the table and inspect it. It appears for the most part to be your usual walkie talkie, with a small antenna sticking out of the top, and a button on the side that you press to talk. Oddly enough the walkie receives as well as transmits, which considering what their being used for seems unnecessary, after all you could hear her just fine at this size. You push the button and hold it down and then speak into the walkie talkie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. My compliments to the tailor by the way. Except for the oversized head hole these clothes fit great,\" you tell her, and watch as her face beams down at you. She giggles a bit, a sound which sets your ears on fire, both with pain and longing, and you look up at her in wonder. Mountain was too small a word to describe Tiffany. Titan was probably more accurate. Still your not sure what to do next and voice that question as you push the button again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now Tiffany?\" you ask her, and the titaness looks down at you with a questioning gaze before leaning back and holding her head in her hand, and expression of deep thought on her face. After few seconds she sits up again and looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL THAT'S ENTIRELY UP TO YOU. I COULD OF COURSE JUST SWALLOW YOU WHOLE HERE AND BE DONE WITH IT, BUT YOU MIGHT WANT A BIT MORE BANG FOR YOUR BUCK,\" she says, her voice, despite the bass overtone, still ringing through in a distinct soprano. This time it is you who leans back and considers his options. She's right you can probably do better than just having her swallow you whole right here and now. Well the first thing to get out of the way is the location. You can stay in your own home to do this, or go somewhere else, be it public or private. Pressing the button again you tell Tiffany...</span></div></div>",

She reaches into the hip pack of hers and brings out another odd looking thing. This time it resembles a needle, and after a cursory inspection you discover that it is a needle, kind of like the one from Fantastic Voyage by Issac Asimov, or Inner Space with Martin Short, either one works as an analogy. Tiffany does her own inspection of the needle, and after a few taps on it with her finger turns towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLD ON TO YOUR SHORTS,\" she says, and then presses a button on the back of the needle. Instantly a suction force begins to draw you up into the needle and soon you are literally floating inside its depths, looking out at the world through the glass which twists the images. You try to reach out to touch the wall but find yourself held firmly in the center of the tube through some unknown force. Looking around you jump back in surprise as you see Tiffany's humongous eye looking at you through the glass. The walkie talkie in your hand clicks and you hear her through voice through it, yet not through the glass, surprising considering you are so close to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay in there little man?\" she asks, sounding slightly concerned, pressing the button on your own walkie talkie you respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah. But what is this? And why can't I hear you anymore?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't actually know what it is, it's just what the office gave me to carry you around in safely. I guess it's soundproof too,\" she tells you through the radio, staring at you through the glass tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where to now. I mean there are plenty of locations outside your home, a whole world full of them, so how about we narrow down the choices, huh?\" she asks you, and you think for a moment on where you could go. The most obvious classification of locations is public or private at this point. So which one?</span></div></div>",

You look at her through the needle, trying to gauge her reaction, but you find nothing before the needle you are in is moved with a speed that you find nauseating, and suddenly you're in darkness. You quickly realize that Tiffany has pocketed the needle, with you inside, and that your adventure is truly about to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride is boring to say the least you can see the occasional flashes of light through her pocket, but for the most part the whole scene before you is dark. You can't even feel the bumps and jostles as she moves about because the needle keeps you ever in its center, away from harm. You still have no idea how it does that, but considering the force that those bumps and jostles consist of your glad for it, after all without it you would be little more than a stain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take long for the lights outside to stop whizzing by, and you think that you're there. The burger joint at the end of your block. As you told Tiffany its is a step up from the usual fast food, though not really by that much. Really the place is just a grill with a building around it, though you've always found the food at least of halfway decent quality. Normally a local place like this would close down sometime well before midnight, but with the latest craze of late night restaurants the manager decided he should join in, and now the place was open twenty-four hours, six days a week, excluding only Mondays, which the manager says are bad luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any real warning at all you are blinded as Tiffany withdraws the needle from her pocket and holds it before her looking at you. You hold your walkie talkie close by expecting another talk, but instead you find a suction force begin to pull at you body, and you watch as the needle's exit rushes towards you. Tiffany is ejecting you from the needle! With a scream you fall through the silver slide into the open air, and see nothing but a long drop below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat drop suddenly becomes shorter as Tiffany's hand seems to appear out of nowhere, catching you softly, at least when compared to the floor. You slowly rise from your fall, feeling aches in your shoulder and leg, but not big ones, and with an amazing speed you find yourself feeling better than you would have thought possible after such a drop. Apparently there are some advantages to being a sixteenth of an inch tall. Looking up you pull your walkie talkie closer but before you can say anything Tiffany's voice booms at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARE YOU OKAY?\" she asks, and you feel an intense desire to say no, but instead push the button and tell her...</span></div></div>",

You realize that it would probably look weird to carry one inside and so make no comment to her about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well since we're here let's go in and have a peek at what's on the menu,\" you tell her instead, in as sly a voice as you can manage. She smiles down at you, and then forms her hand into a fist, keeping you safely inside it. It isn't quite as bad as you imagined, but your pretty sure Disney would never want to put in a ride called, in the giant's hand. Six Flags might though. You'll have to remember that and suggest it to someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering the burger joint you are assaulted by the tingling of the bells hung on the door, as well as a bit of music playing from an old fashioned jukebox in the back. The air smells heavily of burned meat and broken dreams, as most of the patrons are sipping away at their drinks. Tiffany, you in hand walks up to the register and she sets her fist so that you can look around. The place is actually pretty busy considering the hour, and not one of them appears to be a trucker. Most appear to be local cheerleaders, probably out for a night on the town after the big game that was sometime tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CAN I PLEASE ASK YOU TO TAKE A SEAT MISS? THE GRILL IS ON THE FRITZ RIGHT NOW, BUT BILL ASSURES ME HE CAN HAVE IT UP AND RUNNING IN A MINUTE OR TWO, SO IF YOU'LL JUST WAIT,\" says a new voice, one that is much younger than you would expect. Looking at where the voice came from you are shocked to see that it belongs to a girl about the same age as the cheerleaders, and at least twice as hot. You wonder for a moment what she's doing in a dump like this, and then remember that this place is family owned and operated, she's probably the owner's daughter. Tiffany seems to droop a little at this news, but then smiles at the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SURE, I DON'T MIND,\" she tells her, and then walks to one of the empty tables to wait. In her fist you find that the clothes that fit perfectly a moment before are beginning to feel a little tight in the pants, and looking around its not hard to imagine why. After a moment you realize that you find it really tempting to ask Tiffany to try and put you on the counter, so that you can crawl inside a burger at random, that way the person eating it wouldn't even know you're there, which for some odd reason increases the pressure in your pants.

I have something I want to ask you. Can we go to the bathroom so we can talk?\" you say, and then look up at her through the gaps between her fingers. Tiffany takes a nervous look around before nodding and rising from her chair. You find the bathroom disturbingly close to the kitchen, but enter anyway to find that it is immaculate. Not a single speck of dirt anywhere. Obviously these people take pride in their place of business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OKAY STEVE, WHAT IS IT YOU WANT TO ASK ME?\" she says, opening her fist so that she stares at you on her flat palm. Taking in the sight you full begin to comprehend just how small you are, as her palm is a pink plain stretching in all directions. Shaking off that thought you look up at her face as you push the button on your walkie talkie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if this is gonna make this sound kinkier than it already is, but can I ask you to put me on the counter of the kitchen window?\" you ask.</span></div></div>",

I don't suppose you can understand that?\" you say to her through the walkie talkie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL NOT REALLY STEVE, BUT YOU ARE THE CUSTOMER. I MAY HAVE A BETTER IDEA THOUGH. THAT COUNTER HAS A LOW OVERHANG ABOVE IT. HOW ABOUT I PUT YOU THERE AND THEN YOU CAN SLIDE OFF INTO A BURGER AS IT PASSES UNDER THAT?\" she says, and you could kick yourself for not thinking of that yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiffany, that sounds perfect. You know I'm going to have to recommend you to my friends. Well that is if I ever tell anyone about this,\" you say the last line with the button up, meaning she can't her you. The part about recommending her to your friends seems to have her bursting at the seams though, and she smiles more broadly then you though possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOT A PROBLEM STEVE,\" she tells you, and then forms her hand into a fist again. As the two of you step out of the bathroom you are surprised to find the girl from the counter going between the five tables of cheerleaders, apparently taking orders. Obviously The grill is working again. Tiffany casually strolls by the window to the kitchen where the plates will pass, and with an equally casual mannerism she waves her fist over the overhang atop it, and opens it in the same motion, so that you drop onto the gray metal surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe landing is much rougher than you expected, and as you tumble head over heels on the overhang you feel your own hands open up, and your grip on your walkie talkie loosens. Suddenly it breaks completely and you watch the device slide over the smooth metal, towards the precipice. Do you lose the only communication between you and Tiffany?</span></div></div>",

What devices did they give you anyway? All you can remember was that catalog with the companions. Then there was the potion that made you small, the needle Tiffany carried you in, the antidote to the shrinking formula, which Tiffany should still have on her, and last but now least, the walkie talkie. There was something else though. Something to do with a kids game. Tag?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hits you like a freight train. The Tachyon Tag which was your only real hope at living through this experience. When you'd used it after sort of rolling over on top of it, it had smoked something fierce, and you never did ask Tiffany if that was what it was supposed to do. The one guy she remembered having been a companion for had forgotten to inject himself, or so she says, but what if he had just done something to it. Like drop it, or crush it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment your breathe stops in your throat as you realize that it is very likely you broke the Tag, and now you had to live through this and get the antidote.  Of course considering your smaller than a bug, that's not going to be easy. After a second you realize that your breathe is now coming in deep ragged gasps. Your beginning to hyperventilate. You have to calm down. After all Tiffany should have the antidote, all you have to do is get her attention, which should still be possible even though the walkie talkie is broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping yourself out of you panic you look over at Tiffany and find she's staring at you, or at least at the overhang. For a second your hope swells as you begin to think she saw the walkie talkie fall, but then she just smiles in your direction as the young girl walks up to her, that pad in hand, ready to take her order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT'LL YA HAVE?\" she asks Tiffany, in an odd southern accent, obviously fake. Tiffany looks over at you again for an instant and then turns to the board where they list the kinds of burgers they serve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UM I DON'T KNOW. WHAT ARE THE GIRL SCOUTS HAVING?\" she asks the girl, gesturing over at the cheerleaders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ALL OF THEM JUST GOT CLASSIC BURGERS. IF YOU WANT TO BE DIFFERENT I SUGGEST A CHEESEBURGER. THAT'LL ALSO GET BILL TO MAKE YOUR'S A BIT SOONER TOO,\" she tells Tiffany, who looks over at you again. She stares at you, and you realize she's offering you her stomach.. Turning back to the girl she says, \"THAT'LL BE JUST FINE\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK I'LL TELL BILL AND YOU SHOULD HAVE YOUR FOOD IN A FEW MINUTES,\" she tells Tiffany, and then writes on her little pad before walking off into the kitchen. You sigh in relief, and  for the first time in minutes your breathing is at least halfway normal. You don't have to worry now about getting served to someone else. All you have to do is jump on to the cheeseburger, and then you'll end up in front of Tiffany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that she can give you the antidote and you two can go to the MA office and get another Tag. You spend the next few minutes looking around and feel that same tightness in your pants return as you watch some of the cheerleaders snack on fries that must have been given to tide them over until their burgers are ready. Staring at them you remember why you wanted to do this in the first place, and curse your bad luck for forcing you to delay the moment by causing you to break that Tag thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you find yourself truly beginning to contemplate forgetting about the Tag and diving for one of their burgers anyway, you hear several dings of a bell that force you to cover your ears in pain. Below you, you can hear the grinding sound as some plates are pushed through the window, into exactly the position you can jump on them. Running to the edge you frantically begin to search for a burger with cheese, a search made easier because the top buns are laid to the side of each burger, along with lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, and packets of mayo, ketchup, and mustard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down you find something that makes your heart drop again. There are two cheeseburgers among the mess of plates, neither looking any different from the others. One of them is going to Tiffany, the other to someone else, and you're gonna have to pick one fast, as the lady who took the orders is walking up quickly. Do you jump for the one at the front of the line of burgers, closer to the edge of the counter, or the one right under the overhang?</span></div></div>",

Stepping back a ways you decide it best to take a running leap, as you don't think it'll be easy to reach the cheeseburger because it's so far out. Steeling yourself, and doing a little prayer, you run at the edge, putting all your strength behind the momentous leap, that carries you far. In front of you passes the waitress' shirt as you plummet to the ground, and you think for a moment that she might see you, but then with a wet plop you land in the gooey cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made it to the cheeseburger now all you have to do is hope it is served to Tiffany. Swimming around in the mess of cheese you try and stand up, finding that you are just tall enough to touch the burger while your head is above the cheese. A stray thought has you wondering if anyone's ever drowned in melted cheese before, but the heat of the cheese, and the pain it causes your skin pulls you away from inward thoughts, forcing you to stay within the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a time you find that the cheese doesn't hurt as much as you thought it did, that it was really like water, you just had to get used to it. With a suddenness that blinds you the world falls dark, and looking up you see the waitress high above looking right at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, down here! Help!\" you shout up at her, waving your arms, or at least trying to. The cheese, though melted to the point of almost liquid, is still very sticky, and you find it pulls you arm back into it every time you try to raise it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, who's name happens to be Andrea, didn't see you anyway, and was looking down only because she was supposed to have met a man from a strange ad in a magazine here tonight. He hadn't come yet though, and she was beginning to doubt he would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH WELL. IT WAS PROBABLY SOME KIND OF JOKE ANYWAY,\" she says under her breath, picking up the plate your on and lifting it into the air. The jolt of the rise sends you face first into the cheese, and you have to fight to get back to the surface, holding you breath as well as you could to avoid getting cheese in your lungs. At last you break the surface again and stare at the waitress. Looking at her now from close up you see she's actually closer to your age than the cheerleaders, not that, that changes anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's not, I'm really down here!\" you shout at her, realizing as you do that she was lost in her own thoughts, and that comment was not meant for you. Still you find your situation is worsened now as the cheese is all around you. Like some kind of yellow gooey cloak. To those high above you are just going to be a small bump on a yellow plain. You just have to hope for the best as you try to pull yourself out of the gunk as it sways gently with her stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a monestrous struggle you at last get your left arm free, just in time to fall face first into the cheese again as the plate is dropped onto the table with the force of a bulldozer. To be fair it was probably quite a gently drop, but to someone your size it feels like a thousand foot plummet off a mountain, and you are submerged once again within the yellow goo. Once again you are forced to hold your breath as you swim through the ever cooling, and thus hardening cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouching the bottom, which happens to the burger itself, you push up, and again find yourself mired in the ooze. Still things aren't all terrible. After you pull your neck free you can turn your gaze skyward, and you find that you did indeed guess right. You are right in front of Tiffany, who is gazing longingly in another direction. Probably at the cheerleaders, to whom she thinks you have just been served. Panic and adrenalin fuel you muscles as you try and rip free of the cheese on her burger. With a ripping sound you right arm comes free and you begin waving it like a maniac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiffany! Down here! Look down here!\" you shout up at her, you throat beginning to feel raw from the effort. You really wish you hadn't dropped that communicator thing. Even if you get out of this now you're not gonna be able to talk for weeks. You continue to wave your arm and shout as Tiffany sighs and turns away as the sound of tearing meat and grinding teeth can be heard from far away. The cheerleaders had started eating, so she turned back to her own meal. She was now looking right at the cheeseburger, but you're so small, does she notice you?</span></div></div>",

Looking up at her face you see her eyebrow raise in wonder, as she looks around, and then, understanding dawning in her eyes, she looks straight down at you, and her frown, which had only deepened as the cheerleaders started eating, now becomes that same bright smile you'd seen on her face several times already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Tiff. I'm down here, now pull me out so we can-Wait! Don't!\" you feel your hope deflate like a popped balloon. You hadn't really thought this out too well. Tiffany has no idea about your problems, and so still expects to hear you through the walkie talkie if anything goes wrong. She doesn't think you're on her burger so she can rescue you, she thinks your there so she can eat you, and proves it by picking up a lettuce leaf and dropping it gently on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of the new green tarp settling atop you is overwhelming, and you also know that it is a death shroud for you. With it over you, there is no way Tiffany can see you, or know that anything is wrong. Soon you hear a plop sound, and you realize she's putting ketchup over top the lettuce, and then suddenly everything around you goes dark as night as the pressure from above increases to heights you hadn't believed possible and then slacks off a bit, letting you breath again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feelings, though new to you, are still identifiable, and you know without a doubt that Tiffany had just put on the top bun and then squeezed down. With a sickening, wrenching motion you feel the ground tilt and sway as it moves up, and then you hear a sound you've been hearing for a while, but from much closer. The sound of bread ripping, lettuce tearing, and meat rending as someone bites into a burger. Tiffany has begun her meal, and unfortunately you are her special treat inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider screaming your lungs out again, but decide quickly that it would do no good, after all if she couldn't hear you through open air he defiantly won't hear you through all the stuff she put on top of you, even if you are a lot closer to her ears. You soon give up on pulling yourself out of the cheese as well, as it seems to have hardened around you, creating a kind of mold of your body in it, and making it so you can't escape under your own power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of these thoughts and plans flit through your mind, only to be dismissed a moment later, not out of panic, or fear of death, after all you're way beyond panic, and fear of death isn't really an issue. Instead you just can't see the use of any of them. You can't run, screaming won't do any good, and Tiffany, the one person who knows your shrunk, is intent on forcing you down her gullet. With no real hope you aren't going to try and fool yourself with false ones, instead you're just going to lay back and hang on for the ride, and hope it's everything you thought it would be. Something worth dying to experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a start you are thrown back into reality by the sound of a gulp, a loud one. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that it was Tiffany sending her first bite down into her stomach, where you will soon be joining it. The sound of crashing, and the pressure are right on top of you as she bites into her burger again, and for a second you are sure you're going to be bitten in half, but then the pressure disappears, and not a meter away is a white shiny wall in which you can she your reflection, Tiffany's incisor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, almost delicately, she pulls the burger away, and you watch in awe as the tendrils of spit get longer, and then without warning break and glisten as they pull back onto her lush lips, with look like they were stolen from the Mona Lisa. Staring at those lips you watch as she opens her mouth, and around the still complete bite of burger you can she her mouth, the luscious, juicy mouth, that you just want to jump into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of you brain that's not totally engrossed in the sight of Tiffany's open mouth and the undulating throat wall at the back, or the tonsils which seem to glisten like silver, or the lips, gums and tongue which all beckon you inside. Where was I? Oh yes, the part of you brain no totally blown away by these images is telling you that it is time to start screaming and waving again, but it is a truly tiny part, and the rest of you is screaming at it to shut up. Do you listen to that tiny piece of sanity, or ignore it.</span></div></div>",

You stare at her as she slowly, tenderly wipes the cheese and ketchup off the end of the burger you can see, and then, with a skill that the most talented sword swallower couldn't match she flicks her tongue upward, and with her mouth still open so you can watch, she lets the burger slide toward her esophagus and once it hits that lightly quivering back wall it vanishes into the depths. She swallows everything in her mouth with a single, condemning gulp and you stare as her throat expands to accept the huge morsel, and you can swear you hear a splash as it disappears into her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder for a moment if that show was for anyone else as well, but your view consists solely of Tiffany, and you don't even spare a glance at the others. Tonight, and probably every night after this one, you are her's. She smiles a bit, and stares into the burger, not really seeing you, but knowing that you were either in her stomach now, or staring at her from the very edge of the burger, the same edge she was about to send to join the other pieces she'd eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking her lips lustfully, getting off any stray pieces of cheese or ketchup she looked down at where you sat, and you found that though harder, the cheese was still bending in certain areas. Staring up at her you are tempted to ask her to hurry up, but decide that she is a professional, and knows her business. She'll take as long as she thinks she needs to, and only then give you the ultimate water flume ride into her nice tight belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting you up with a slow, and seeming delicate grace, she brings you to her lips, and you can she the bits of meat, bread, and cheese still stuck inside her mouth. The whole place is like one huge glistening cavern, and looking into its depths you find that you really wish you'd found some larger pants, as these seem to be way to small. As if in a frame by frame you enter her mouth, the area around you going dark as you fly deeper into the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a jerk the burger stops, and you find that it gives you just enough force to pull yourself out of the cheese, and then fall onto the waiting tongue below. Tiffany starts as she feels a small morsel fall on to her tongue, the taste a strange mixture of meat, hair, and clothes. She knows it's you without a second thought, and sees an opportunity for a bit of fun before she ends her session with you, and then goes back to her apartment for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, inside her mouth, you are thrown into what should be utter darkness, as the teeth come together around both you and burger, yet you find yourself still able to make out the glistening cavern in front of you, and the huge white boulders that mark the entrance to the living cavern. Beneath you the tongue feels like a plush living carpet, dimpling under your small weight, and you find that when you press in on it, the thing seems to vibrate with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh,\" moans Tiffany softly, and the sound seems to come from all around you. Without any warning at all, her tongue cups, and you find yourself sliding over its slick, soft surface, towards the center of it, all the while the little red dots, well the normally little red dots that are her taste buds grab at you, taking in every bit of your flavor.<br>\r\n\"UHHH,\" she moans again, this time much louder, and you find your own pleasure at the sensations running through your body to be at least the equal of her's. Everything around you is like a soft, gently swaying chamber of warmth. Tenderly you stroke the ground under you, and she giggles at the tiny tickle on her tongue, sending vibrations through her mouth that are better than anything you had ever felt before in your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stay in the center of her tongue for only a moment as she tips her it again, and you find that you are sliding over it again. With an abrupt crash you slam into one of her lower molars, and feel her tongue raise up, as if to place you on top of it. You find that even that seems like it would be thrill, even if a short one, but then she tilts her tongue again, and you slide all the way across it towards the other side of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, and again she tips her tongue, with you enjoying every minute of it, but she seems to grow bored with the waiting, and after only a few times you come to rest once again in the center line that runs down her tongue. Behind you the burger still sits, and you wonder what exactly she's going to do next. You don't wonder long though as the tongue beneath your feet becomes something akin to a tidal wave, washing you back towards the pink cavern's rear exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as the scene sort of slows down, as if Tiffany is somehow controlling time inside her mouth. Thinking about the Tag you realize that she might just be doing that, but you brush off the thought as you pass between the two huge red boulders that are her tonsils, and then right under the shiny pink drop of flesh that is her uvula. It bobs over you for a moment, like it's waving bye, and then you drop over the precipice at the back of her mouth, and into her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dreams, imaginings, a lunatic ravings don't come close to the sensation of her throat. Every spot on you body is held by Tiffany's flesh, which loving, tenderly, and gently strokes it, and you find yourself lost in pleasures you can't possibly describe. All around you is a beautiful girl, and she is giving you the best experience of your life, and showing you parts of herself few men would ever see, or really want to see truth be told. Still you aren't most men, and for you the time spent in her throat is one long tube ride of pleasure, one you wish would never end as Tiffany's body creases you, and numbs you to sleep through the steady bass beating of her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill nothing is forever, and without any kind of precursor you find yourself once again in a large open chamber, falling from a hole in the ceiling to the floor below. Inside her stomach you still find the smell pleasing for some reason, and as you enter the miasma you can't help but wonder if anyone could make a good perfume from this, though they probably wouldn't considering it wouldn't smell as good to most people because they would only smell it after it came up, not while it was still part of a sweet woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a splash you find the bottom of her stomach, and the acid therein. You don't try to swim, but instead let the current push you back to the surface. Once there you find the gentle rocking motion soothing. You could stay here for the rest of your life, which you very well might. Looking around you can still see, but the only thing to see is the smooth stomach walls dripping acid and slowly moving in and out. You find your consciousness fading from the fumes, and that annoying voice is back telling you to try and live, but you ignore it for the second time, and let the slow, but deliberate orchestra of Tiffany's body, her breathing, her heart beat, and even the chewing sounds, take you into itself, and away from the concerns of the mundane. </span></div></div>",

The Tag worked, and you got a really fun time out of it. You plan on trying for a second dive into Tiffany's gut as soon as you can. Maybe even tonight. You are so ecstatic about being alive that you are completely oblivious to the fact that things seem just a little too big around you, at least until a pounding can be heard washing over the scene like the banging on the gates of hell by some mammoth demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you a moment to recover from the thunderous blasts, but when you finally do you look in horror at the gargantuan clock over your TV. It is a little past midnight, right when Tiffany showed up at your doorstep. The slams you heard were her fists on your door, and looking around it finally begins to dawn on you, that though this is your apartment, it is not right. Everything is much too large, and your perspective can't be more than a few millimeters off the tile floor of your living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour glance around does tell you that you are better off than you were before though, as it seems that even though the Tag didn't return you to normal size, you are at least a bit bigger than you were before. The titan status has been revoked from the couch your sitting on, though mountain still applies. At least your safe for the moment, but you need the MA office and the antidote the possess, and right now Tiffany is your best link to that place. Getting up you hear the doorknob begin to rattle and you realize that you are faced with yet another life and death choice. Wait on the couch and hope Tiffany comes in on her own, or run to the door and try to get out somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With that image firmly in mind you decide that staying where you are is the best idea, as Tiffany might well come into your home. After all your door is unlocked, and in a way she was invited, so it wouldn't be to much of a stretch for her to at least stick her head in the door to call for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting back down you look towards the door, hoping that you haven't misjudged Tiffany. You really hadn't spoken to her about herself. All you'd cared about was her job, and that was it. You never really took the time to ask her about herself. Maybe you should have thought more about her and less about yourself, but considering what she was supposed to do to you hadn't really wanted to get to know her. Well not unless you called on her services again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minutes tick by slowly, and looking up at the clock you can't help but think that maybe you were wrong about Tiffany as she had not stuck her head in, yet she also hadn't left, as you hadn't heard the roar of the engine of her car, which should be loud to your tiny ears. Getting more desperate with each movement of the clock's hands you are just about to run to the edge of the couch and jump down when a rattling sound is heard from your door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if she knew you were there and trying to build suspense Tiffany opens the door and peaks inside through a crack. Seeing her for the first time outlined by the light you realize that though you aren't normal size by any stretch of the imagination you are bigger than you were before. You're not sure by how much, but you'd guess that you're at least a quarter inch tall now, if not twice that, which might come in handy now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiffany! In here!\" you shout, jumping around waving your arms. It's obvious she doesn't see you, as her eyes continue to dart around the room passing over you, but from the look in her eyes you'd have to say she heard you, if only barely. Striding purposefully Tiffany crosses the threshold into you home and looks around some more, as you continue to jump up and down waving your arms and screaming and waving your arms like a maniac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MR. MARSHALL?\" she says into the house. The voice is booming to your ears, but you are more used to the noise this time, and cover them to prevent them from ringing, just as the last echo of her voice fades from the house you start waving your hands again instead of being doubled over in pain at the simple sound of her voice. Walking farther in she steps up to the couch, and for just a second you think she's seen you, but then she tosses her purse beside you and walks deeper into your home, trying to find you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking after the titaness you can't help but feel powerless. You had been forced to scramble for cover when the great mass of her purse fell from the sky, almost right on top of you, and now she passes right next to you without finding you. Staring around you have to consider that she might not be able to find you before she decides to leave, but she has unknowingly provided a way to follow her by throwing the purse where she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at it you can see a piece of string sticking out of one end like a rope, pulling on it you think it might be able to support your weight. The choice before you is simple. Climb into her purse and try to get her attention later, or someone else's at wherever she goes to from your house, or stay outside and try to get her attention here and now.

You think to yourself that in proportion you can probably do a lot of things better than you were before, like running, jumping, or lifting. Still it is only in proportion, which means that it is still many times less than what you really could do at your normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final grunt of effort you reach the top of Tiffany's purse. For a second you consider staying atop the item and trying once again to get her attention, but a stray jolt the translates from her footstep, through the floor, and finally up the couch causes a vibration that pulls you feet out from under you, and you fall face first into the depths of the darkened interior of Tiffany's purse. A hard pull in one direction sends you sliding across the cave like space, and you know Tiffany has picked up her purse, and a slamming sound indicates she has left your house, you are now in the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all the ride outside is quite pleasant, as the swaying motion of the purse reminds you of the pull and ebb that had been the motion of Tiffany's stomach. Looking up at her through the still unzipped purse you can't help but feel another tightness in your pants. She is just as radiant as ever, and now you can see her silhouetted by the lights outside, something you hadn't seen your first time traveling with her while in the needle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment you reach her car you find that your preferences shift to the needle again as Tiffany, not knowing you are inside, throws the purse roughly into the passenger's seat, causing a tumultuous racket as things shift about, and forcing you to loop you arms so that you have firm grip on the wall. At least twice you are afraid a stray lipstick or makeup pad will crush your tiny body, but after a moment everything settles down and you breathe easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour breath is let out in a scream however when you are shown the second reason you liked the needle better, the fact that it blocked the noise of the engine, which sends you sprawling to the floor of the purse gripping your ears in pain. The pain slowly fades, or at least you learn to get used to it as the motion of the bag resumes. Tiffany, though a seemingly careful driver, was still not careful enough to keep things from sliding around in her purse as she drove, and you are forced to run around frantically avoiding mundane things like makeup and loose change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure how long this actually goes on, but you are surprised to notice that you haven't heard the radio at all. Tiffany is driving in complete silence. You can hear only the roar of the engine, the shriek of passing cars, and in the quieter moments you can hear the steady in and out of her breathing, and you think you can just barely make out the bass drum beating of her heart, which you remember from your time inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about your voraephile experience with Tiffany you can't help but wish to do it again, but you know that it really would be the end of you this time, or at least you suspect so. According to the paper that had come with the Tachyon Tag it was originally called the Second Chance Tag, because it gave you a second chance at life, and that title seems to indicate that it would work only once, if that, and so you are quick to choose life this time rather than death, as the first time you had at least a fifty-fifty shot at survival, though you wouldn't have really cared what side the coin landed on in that scenario. This time however, your chances are probably less than one in ten, so getting help is paramount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last the car ride comes to a stop, and you are once again sent screaming and running as the cacophonous junk in Tiffany's purse acts like Steve seeking missiles, finding a way to fly at you from everywhere at once, forcing you to dodge it all. With another jerking motion the purse is pulled skyward and Tiffany's things stop trying to kill you. At last you are able to look outside and you find that Tiffany has returned to...</span></div></div>",

You had hoped that she would go to her office and advise them that you weren't home, but instead she must have chosen to call it and night and returned to her own place. Not really that surprising considering that it was now well past midnight, or at least you thought it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a rattling noise you hear Tiffany examine her keys, and try at least two different ones before she at last finds the one that goes to her front door. A sliding click issues from the lock and she smiles in triumph. You are smiling with her for a second, until quite suddenly the lights above dim, and you see the keys poised right over you. With a start you hide behind a compact as the metal blades fall from the sky, leaving a scratch in the plastic shield you chose, and showing that it could have easily cut you in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing a sigh of relief you climb out from behind your protection just in time to be thrown into pure darkness. Outside a porch light had been on so she could see her way to the door, but Tiffany had already shutdown all the inside house lights, and with no bulbs shining overhead the purse was blacker than coal. In way you find the darkness comforting, as you are no longer able to see all those everyday items that are no potentially deadly to you. Still your comfort is rattled a bit when you are suddenly, and quite roughly, thrown through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMN IT,\" you hear Tiffany swear as the purse clunks onto the table, you trying desperately to regain your feet inside. Not knowing about your struggles Tiffany listens to the dead silence around her, and then lets out breathe as she hears nothing other than her own heart. Thinking it was nice to be home after such a wasted night Tiffany then proceeds to walk away, and with the purse still tipped on its side you are able to watch as she walks down a small hallway, and out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking after her you can't really tell which is stronger, your fear at being alone completely now at this small size, or your relief that she was no longer around so that she wouldn't unknowingly kill, maim, or in some way do you harm. Cautiously you begin to climb over the ruin that was the inside of Tiffany's purse before the rough landing. With a great effort you are able to make your way over the junk and at last emerge into open air once more, and you get your first glance at Tiffany's apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place seems awfully large, or so you think. Some of it might be attributed to your lower point of view, but even so you are forced to assume that Tiffany does not live alone. Looking around you drink in your surroundings. You assume from the twin towers across the vast brown plain that you are on the dining table, as you can see white and black rocks held within them through there clear surfaces, which glint in the light shining in from the window behind the table in the closest wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than the window there is nothing on the walls worth noting, as they are the simple whitewashed, clean cut affairs you find in most apartments and homes these days. Finding nothing more interesting on the walls you begin to look towards the exits of the room which you assume is the dining room for Tiffany's apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hallway which Tiffany walked down is set at an angle to the table, so you can't see down it at all, but the sounds of running water, and gurgling, followed by a spit makes you conclude that the bathroom is located somewhere beyond its depths. A quick series of footsteps can be heard after the bathroom, and her light tread makes you think that you were indeed right, Tiffany does not live alone, and is trying not to awaken the people that live with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe exit to the dining room on the opposite side is at a good angle to you, and you are able to stare directly into it, and you curse the architects. Looking into the room beyond you are instantly sure that it is the kitchen, and more than that it reminds you that you yourself haven't eaten since three that afternoon. You had intended on talking a little with Tiffany before doing what you two did, and maybe grabbing a bite to eat with her before she grabbed a bite of you. Sadly Tiffany had been all business tonight, and so you hadn't gotten a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying you best to ignore the rumbling within your stomach you look to the third and final exit to the dining room, and though the angle is not so great, you think you can just make out the arm of a sofa in the other room. You assume that it is the living room of the apartment, as you are about ninety percent certain that it was the same room Tiffany had passed through before sending you hurtling onto the hardwood surface on which you now stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith you inspection of the immediate area complete you are again faced with a choice, though this one much less cut and dry than the others you'd been faced with recently. You energy had been sapped by the events of tonight, and you had gotten almost no sleep the night before, which added together to make you very tired. Though adrenalin was coursing through your veins at breakneck speeds making you feel as though you could go all night without a wink, you are forced to concede that you might collapse on your feet after too much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe choice, simple as it seems, was whether or not to try and sleep here on the table, where you were at least relatively safe, or try to keep going, and get off the table and get yourself either some food or attention, either one being a good thing in your situation. Gazing at a clock in the kitchen, a glowing digital one rather than your own analog set over your TV, a fact you are thankful for, you can see the time is just a shade under one A.M.

Tomorrow is going to be a big day for you, and hopefully by the end of it you'll be able to measure up to your usual standards, but for tonight you decide that you adventures at this size are over. Your visual search of the premises give you little to be happy about, but after a time you discover an unused napkin near the salt and pepper shakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the shakers takes a while, and makes you begin to appreciate just how small you are. Gazing at a loose grain of salt you pick it up. To your current perspective the little white dot is now a large cube like rock. Not too large, just like something you'd find in a drive way, but considering that you are normally able to hold hundreds, if not thousands of these little pebbles in your hand you begin to feel worried. Picking up as many as you can you find that only about twenty of them fill up one hand at your current size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTossing a few of the pebbles as far as you can you pop one into your mouth. It's not really food, and in fact is dehydrating you even as you suck on it, but your stomach at least stops its complaints about its empty state for the moment, and you continue your stroll over to the napkins. Stepping up to one of the huge white sheets is like stepping up to a circus tent stomped flat, an image that burns itself into you mind, despite your attempts to banish it back from whence it came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling at the corner of the cloth you find that its weight if far to great for you to pull anywhere, and trying to rip it is like trying to rip through a phone book. After a few minutes you give up, and the plan you had absently been forming about spelling out a message with the napkins is abandoned. Instead you push at the top, and find that, though heavy, the napkin is still soft enough on both top and bottom to serve as a bed and sheet for you tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you are climbing into the napkins to fall asleep you feel a sudden building of pressure in you abdomen, and search around desperately for a bathroom, before the details of your situation intrude again and you realize that they don't make toilets in you size. Faced with another decision you are quick to run for the edge of the table. After all, crapping on the place where Tiffany eats might seem more than a little rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning as fast as you can you make a much better time getting to the edge of the table, and within a minute you are standing at it, looking down at the tiles floor far below. Now at the edge you are dumbfounded about how to proceed. You now how to pee safely, but the crapping is beyond you for a moment until you decide to just take down your pants and lean over the edge. Doing just that you do your best to keep the steady stream of yellow pointed backwards, while still forcing out the brownies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later you are happily relieved, and pretty sure that Tiffany will not see the little puddle or mound far below. Thinking about that you are pleased at first, but it slowly dawns on you that she's not likely to see you either. What little joy you still had evaporating quickly you take almost four times as long to get back to the napkin which you still plan on using for a bed. Climbing up its surface you pul yourself in between its folds, and then, with a final drooping you eyelids close like lead shutters and you are sent off to the land of dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dreams are filled with almost the exact same images as your last one, the one you had waiting for Tiffany to arrive at your home. This time though instead of happily waiting in her sandwich for her to eat you, you are screaming your lungs out at her not to do it, and she, unhearing, just keeps munching away. As her teeth suddenly find you, your whole world becomes light. Jolting up you realize that you were awakened by someone turning on the lights, and then you hear the sound of...</span></div></div>",

The dog is a magnificent specimen. If he'd been on a show circuit you're sure he would have at least a dozen blue ribbons by now, though the apartment doesn't really look big enough to house a monster like him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a German Shepard, probably at least part wolf by the size of him, though in truth the size is probably a little out of perspective for someone like you. Other than his size he seems to be pure Shepard as far as you can tell. His gray and black coat shines softly in the artificial lights over head, and his brown eyes seems like limped pools ready to spill out of his oversized head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only really odd physical feature are the eyebrows, which is the only real word you can think of for the tufts of bushy white hair over his eyes. The things look awfully out of place on the dog, but you've never been that big a fan of dog breds or their peculiarities. It might be a normal feature for certain dogs of his bred, and you like the expressiveness they give his face. Almost as if he were human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COME ON RONALD. I HAVE TO GO TO WORK EARLY TODAY. BRYAN PROBABLY  WANTS A REPORT ABOUT THAT MAN LAST NIGHT WHO WASN'T IN HIS HOME. I'M SURE AARON WILL WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT TOO, AFTER ALL IF HIS TAG MALFUNCTIONED AGAIN THEN THE FOUNDER WILL HAVE HIS ASS, WON'T HE?\" she asks the dog, who barks in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are a bit worried that you were right about the dog's gender without ever really knowing how you guessed it, but you assumed the dog was male simply because of its size, a bad assumption considering your current stature isn't much taller than a flat napkin now, but you seem to have gotten lucky this time in your guessing, and you don't see any problem with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiffany, down here!\" you shout as you wave your arms at her. You really don't expect her to hear you, and you are right she walks by the table without sparing a second glance. Ronald too doesn't care to investigate the sound, though his ears perk a bit at hearing something that he couldn't identify. He doesn't stop moving to investigate farther, and continues after Tiffany as she enters the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now what genius?\" you ask yourself, hoping in some, already mad part of your brain that some omnipotent creature might hear the question and answer. That mad part even imagines the voice answering in a booming voice, but the rest of your mind tells that part to go stand in a corner as you try and think of another plan, as the jumping and screaming is not working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo absorbed are you in your thoughts that you don't hear the clatter as food is poured into a dish, or Tiffany complain that the current jug is empty. Looking around she finds the next jug of dried food, but then finds herself unable to open the dog proof cap, a necessity since Ronald had proven himself quite capable of getting into the regular bags of dry food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSearching for something like a rag or a towel to give her more friction she spots the one item that you really wish she had ignored. The napkin you had climbed back into to consider your thoughts. The first you know about her discovery is the upward motion, and your sudden near fall down a few hundred feet until you grab the edge of the napkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiffany, wait!\" you scream with all your might, but find your voice is overpowered by Tiffany humming some song, and the loud panting of Ronald as he watches her walk over to the food jug to finish filling his dish. As a respecting diner Ronald will not begin eating until the dish is full, a habit that Tiffany had taught him by not filling it all the way if he started eating before it was full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the napkin over the lid of the jug she turned with all her might, forcing the lid to bend to her mighty will, which had won her two Star Tech, Battle Champion trophies, which were proudly displayed on her entertainment unit in her living room. The jug, no match for her like most opponents, at last gave under her grip, and began to turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, luckily, were not crushed under her grip, though you came very close as one of her fingers sat right next to you as she turned the lid. Satisfied at her victory Tiffany unscrewed the lid the rest of the way, and then lightly set it aside, dragging the napkin right over the open mouth of the jug. You unfortunately, feel as your feet catch on the lip of the jug's mouth, and then feel the napkin slip through your grip before you go tumbling in among the brown, red, and amber boulders that smell awful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing you are in a perilous situation by the sight of the dog through the clear plastic wall, you begin to run for the edge, over the bits of dry food which are only slightly larger than yourself. You are almost at the wall when suddenly the whole world erupts in chaos as Tiffany lifts the jug, and you are buried instantly in a swaying avalanche of dog food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can even react to the motion, however, it all reverses direction, and instead of the dull thunk of the dog food bits hitting each other, you hear the clink as the bits hit the metal bowl. Screaming an incomprehensible babble you begin to try an old cartoon trick, jumping from boulder to boulder, trying to keep your upward momentum high enough to cancel out gravity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, you find this little trick works, and for a moment you are convinced you might be safe, but then out of nowhere a stray chunk hits you in the chest, sending you and it tumbling downward into the pile below. Falling in among the bits you try and force your way up, but are soon buried under the food, not even light reaching you because you are so far down in the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs suddenly as everything began, all noise ends, and you are reminded of the T-Rex scene from Jurassic Park, where everything is still and quiet as the booming of its footsteps slowly come closer, making water ripple. You find that the booming footsteps of the humongous Ronald are not nearly that slow, and you hear the distant, yet all too close sound of crunching dog food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around you are thrown about as the food shifts, and sometimes allowing in shafts of light, and of course the sound of the dog munching at his breakfast. Your mind comes up once again with two paths for you at this point. The first seems the sanest, and it is to try and climb out of the bowl of food before the dog ends up with a live meal. The other is to try and scream for help from Tiffany, or failing that, tell the dog to stop, and hope it obeys commands in English, even if they're coming from inside his food dish.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Considering the fact that the little pebbles of dog food are bigger than you, though not by much, and are constantly shifting as Ronald takes huge bites from the mound of dry kibble, and then either crunches it for a while or just swallows and goes back for more, you decide to scream. The climbing probably wouldn't work, and who knows, maybe the dog won't eat all his food and climbing will just get you eaten when you wouldn't have been otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiffany! Help! Ronald's going to eat me!!!\" you shout as loud as you can manage, stumbling slightly at the dog's name as you mind finally begins to link the name with the animal. Ronald seems an odd name for a dog to you, though you haven't owned one for years so it might be in the vouge right now to give dogs human sounding names, but you doubt it. Maybe Tiffany just likes to give her pets more humanistic names, you think, and then are surprised to realize that the munching sound has stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove you Ronald heard an odd noise emanating from his usually quiet breakfast. What's more that noise sounded like a human voice trying to tell Tiff that it's about to be eaten by her dog, him. Ronald, his face expressing wonder almost as well as any humans thanks to the what tufts over his gray face, begins to dig through the food with his snout, at last uncovering a small creature sitting atop one of the pieces of kibble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UH, TIFF? I THINK WE HAVE A PROBLEM,\" says Ronald in perfect English, with a slight southern accent. You, happy at being uncovered without being forced down the dog's gullet take a moment to register who spoke, and when it at last hits your stressed out, and most likely insane mind that the dog just spoke, you are surprised your chin doesn't hit the floor considering that you're not that far off it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT IS IT RONALD?\" asks Tiffany as she walks into your view. You're still focused on the dog though, and barely register her entrance into your world, which consists of an upward view out of a dog food bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL THERE SEEMS TO BE A MAN IN MY FOOD THIS MORNING, AND HE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU BEFORE I EAT HIM,\" responds Ronald, point his snout down at you. Tiffany blinks away the last bit of sleep out f her eyes and then reaches out of your view for a moment, her hand returning with a pair of glasses which she slips on with a graceful ease. By this point you have realized that a talking dog is probably not that unusual considering that you are staring at him from an angle inside his food dish standing only slightly shorter than the food around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL SO THERE IS!\" comments Tiffany as she gazes down at you, quite loudly to your tiny ears, forcing you to again cover them with your hands as the ringing slowly subsides. By the time you are able to look up again Tiffany is already carefully reaching into the pile of dog food, and grips the piece you are sitting on between her finger and thumb. Waiting as you reposition yourself she gently pulls the piece out of the bowl, and you pass right in front of Ronald's mouth, seeing in a panoramic view the moist cavern you are almost shoved into. Before either you are Tiffany can say anything Ronald puts his forepaws on the counter where she places your little kibble and then stares at you hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN MY FOOD?\" he asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as far as I know,\" you respond after a moment of thought. After all, just because you didn't see anyone doesn't mean they weren't there. Ronald, hearing this quickly goes back to his food dish and stares into it, moving pieces about with his snout, and then pulling back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IF THERE IS ANYONE ELSE IN THERE PLEASE SPEAK UP NOW OR GET A ONE WAY PASS TO MY STOMACH,\" Ronald says into the dish, and then puts his ear right up against it. You and Tiffany wait for a moment staring at the big dog, who in truth probably weighs more than you do when your normal sized. The waiting is ended when Ronald nods his head pulling it away, and then attacks the dry food like a wolf attacking a deer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the occasional crunch sound punctuating the air, a sound you are very happy you are not a part of, you turn back to Tiffany, who is still wearing those glasses. Now that you are closer to them you see that they have in odd knob just below the left eye, and that as Tiffany fiddles with it her eyes seem to get bigger or smaller depending on the direction. After playing with them for a while she must find the setting she wanted, as she nods at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL HELLO THERE MR. MARSHALL. I'D SAY YOU HAD AN INTERESTING NIGHT,\" she says down at you, and there are so many things you want to shout back at her, some of them good, some of them bad, and some of them just plain mean, but you control yourself. After all just because she can't hear you, doesn't mean Ronald can't. Despite the fact that he's still chowing down you can see at least one ear turned your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying nothing, you just stare up at her for a while before she suddenly jumps, finally realizing that she never gave you the communicator last night, or at least not the last night that she remembers. Getting up she moves out of the kitchen, leaving you alone with the huge dog who licks his chops. Looking towards him you can see he's cleaned out his bowl, and is in fact looking towards the kibble piece you are sitting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing quickly that he wants to eat your current place of residence, you climb off onto the counter. Ronald, seeing this, gets up on the counter again and then lolls his tongue out in a very doglike way, panting a bit he moves his tongue over the counter towards the kibble bit, and you. Do you stay near the bit and hope he can control his tongue well enough not to lap you up with the kibble piece, or move away quickly?</span></div></div>",

He zig-zags his tongue along the way, perhaps stalling to give you one last time to get away but you stand your ground. He wouldn't eat you now, after all, Tiffany had already seen you and(sort of) communicated with you. Apparently all this means nothing to his conscience as he scoops up the piece of food and yourself with his tongue. Your vision turns upside-down and blurs before going dark as you enter his mouth. It doesn't take much time after you enter his hot, moist mouth before he lurches his tongue up against the roof of his mouth and pushes you back toward his gullet. His throat grabs a hold of you and pulls you in with powerful muscles down into the squishy, wet tube of his throat. You are pushed and pulled down from his mouth, through his neck and into his main body within a minute before you are plopped into the pile of food he just ate shortly before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scramble to the top of the pile and huddle up, knees to face while you contemplate what you've gotten yourself into. Everything seemed to be going so nicely when you got Tiffany's attention, she was surely going to help you! But then you had to go get yourself eaten by her pet dog...thing.

Licking his chops again he looks down at you with the those all too human eyes, a hungry glint in the back of them. For a moment you're positive that he's going to gulp you down too, but then with a wuff he pushes off the counter and walks out of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing a sigh of relief you sit down and wait for Tiffany to return. It isn't more than a few seconds before you hear the booming impacts of her feet, and then see her titanic form enter the kitchen, holding two items. The first you recognize as the communicator you used last night, but the second you can't place at first. It is a vial that contains a liquid you can't identify, and after a moment of study you come to realize that it must be the antidote to the shrinking formula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to the counter Tiffany looks down at you, still wearing those glasses from before. With a small gesture she brushes her hand against the side of the lenses and her eyes suddenly grow even bigger as the lenses seem to contract. Looking straight down at you she pushes a button on the communicator and two pieces fall off, one is the smaller walkie talkie you dropped and smashed the night before, while the other is a much larger earpiece which Tiffany sticks in her own ear before putting the walkie talkie down next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL MR. MARSHALL, WOULD YOU LIKE TO TELL ME HOW YOU ENDED UP IN RONALD'S FOOD NOW, OR DO YOU WANT TO GROW BACK FIRST?\" she asks you, holding the vial of antidote in her hand. Looking up at her you know she's just trying to mess with you, and so you hold down the side button and speak into your end of the communicator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiffany, I most defiantly want to have this conversation on an eye to eye level, so if you wouldn't mind could you please pass that vial down to me?,\" you tell, her and she smiles wickedly down at you, and then stares in an offhand way at the vial in her hand. She starts to do some odd tricks with t, including spinning it on the tip of her finger so that it's standing up, and then tossing it into the air and catching it just before it hits the ground with what you think would have been enough force to shatter it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing your agitation at that trick seems to be enough for Tiffany and she places the vial on the counter next to you. Grinning in relief you run over to the towering vial, which is probably only an inch or two tall but is many times your height, you then begin to search for a way to access the contents, and quickly find a small valve on the side of the vial, situated just above a faucet like spigot. Looking forward you see another valve and spigot, and another is behind you, all set at different sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently thanking whoever designed the vial you walk up to the valve set at about your size and begin to turn it. Inside you hear a grinding sound as the panel inside the vial slides out of place, allowing the black syrupy liquid within to begin flowing out. Sticking your head under the spigot you get a big mouthful of the foul tasting stuff and gulp it down despite your natural urge to spit it out. Closing the valve again you step back and wait. The shrinking formula worked immediately, so the antidote should word just as fast, if it works at all, you think darkly.</span></div></div>",

USUALLY ANTIDOTES FROM STAR TECH WORK. IT'S STUFF LIKE THE SHRINKING POTION THAT DOES BAD THINGS TO YOU,\" she says picking up the vial and gazing into it, as f trying to will it into working. Then, with a dismissing gesture she shoves the vial back into the hip pack and pulls out the needle that she used to transport you last night to the burger joint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL SINCE THE ANTIDOTE DIDN'T WORK WE'LL HAVE TO SEE BRYAN BOUT GETTING YOU FIXED,\" she says, placing the needle beside you. Staring up at her you know what she says is right, but you can't help but feel that know might be the only time to ask her some questions that have been bugging you for a while, like the fact that her dog talks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we'll be going back to the MA office downtown?\" you ask, just trying to start a conversation with the titaness before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES. YOU'RE LUCKY THAT HIS OFFICE IS IN THAT BUILDING RATHER THAN STAR TECH HEADQUARTERS, CAUSE I'M NOT SURE HOW I'D GET YOU IN THERE SAFELY,\" she says offhandedly as she reaches high over your head and pulls out a bowl. Obviously finding a miniaturized man in her talking dog's food hasn't killed her appetite as she reaches for a box of what looks like cornflakes to you as they fall into the bowl, but with a Star Tech logo on the side of the box you're not completely sure they're not some kind of Soylent product.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SO TELL ME, HOW DID YOU END UP IN RONALD'S FOOD DISH?\" she asks as she pours milk over her bowl and then grabs a spoon and walks over to the table. Obviously she doesn't want to risk injuring you in any way as she leaves you in the kitchen, far from her and her food,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well after a very interesting experience with you at a local diner, I appeared back at my house, but something must have been wrong with the Tag cause I was still small when I reappeared still very small, though not quite as small as I was before. I should have known something was wrong when it smoked after I used it,\" you comment into the communicator. Looking over at Tiffany you can see her shovel a spoonful of cereal into her mouth and then swallow it whole before she turns back towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT DID THE SMOKE SMELL LIKE?\" she asks you from her seat, her voice still booming despite the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't really take the time to sniff it cause you came to my door a moment later, but if I remember right I think it smelled kinda like, well like Ozone I guess,\" you tell her, not really sure what else to say as you aren't really sure what it smelled like, but you've heard descriptions of Ozone and they seemed to fit. Looking into the dining room of her apartment you can she her lift the spoon up to her mouth and play with it a moment before turning back towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO. THAT'S WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO SMELL LIKE. THE ELECTRICAL CHARGE IONIZES THE AIR AND CAUSES THE OZONE SMELL. SO THE TAG WORKED RIGHT. I WONDER WHAT ELSE IT COULD HAVE BEEN. OH WELL, KEEP GOING WITH YOUR STORY. HOW DID YOU GET FROM YOUR APARTMENT TO RONALD'S BREAKFAST,\" she says lifting another spoonful of cereal into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where was I?\" you say to your self, tapping the antenna of the communicator on you chin as you think, and then you remember and bring the speaker to you lips as you press down the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After I appeared on my sofa I didn't have to wait long before some booming noises indicated that you were once again at my door. I didn't have any real way of making contact so I just waited on my couch, hoping you would come in on your own when you found the door was unlocked,\" you tell her, and she seems to cringe back a little bit from the table as you tell her that. Obviously she thinks she should feel bad about entering an unoccupied house, but you decide to alleviate some of her guilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was lucky for me or I might never have been found. After you threw your purse almost right next to me I climbed in. A very bumpy, and nearly deadly car ride later we arrived here at your place, where I climbed out to find myself on your table. I decided to get some sleep myself after that drive. You and Ronald woke me up coming in, and when you used the napkin I was sleeping in to open a jug of dry food I fell. Then instead of climbing out myself I decided to try and cry out for some help. Which your talking dog supplied. By the way, why do have a talking dog?\" you ask her as nonchalantly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I AM NOT A DOG AND TIFFANY DOES NOT OWN ME, BUG BOY,\" comes a voice from the floor that causes you to jump in surprise. Looking over the counter's edge you find that Ronald came back into the kitchen and is now sitting right below you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you aren't a dog then what are you?\" you shout down at Ronald. Tiffany, even though she can't hear what you ask, obviously knew you were going to ask it as she responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RONALD IS ONE OF MANY BEINGS UNDER MY CARE MISTER MARSHALL. BESIDES MY ROLE AS A COMPANION FOR THE MA OFFICE I ALSO DO OTHER THINGS FOR MY FATHER. INCLUDING TAKING CARE OF SOME OF THOSE UNFORTUNATE ONES THAT COME OUT OF HIS LABS,\" she tells you, her eyes going from the counter where you are, to Ronald on the floor, and then back to her breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So somebody screwed up with you too, huh?\" you ask Ronald.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO ONE \u2018SCREWED UP' WITH ME, BUG BOY.

In it the reader was given a device that could alter humans, either changing them into animals or changing their sizes.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An incident?\" you say to him questioningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I WAS A TESTER FOR SOME EQUIPMENT THAT A MAN NAMED AARON MADE BEFORE HE BECAME AN EMPLOYEE OF STAR TECH. HE'S THE SAME GUY WHO INVENTED THE TACHYON TAG YOU USED LAST NIGHT FOR YOUR WEIRD LITTLE FANTASY,\" he spits at you with venom in his voice. You're a little hurt and embarrassed but Ronald doesn't seem to care and continues on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ANYWAY THE EQUIPMENT WORKED AT FIRST, BUT THANKS TO A POWER SURGE IT BLEW AND I GOT STUCK LIKE THIS. THAT INCIDENT GOT AARON TO GO TO STAR TECH WHERE THEY GAVE ME THE ABILITY TO SPEAK ENGLISH, BUT THEY'RE STILL WORKING ON A WAY TO MAKE ME HUMAN AGAIN, OR AT LEAST THEY SAY THEY A....OW!\" his cry of pain attracts you interest, and you notice for the first time that Tiffany has gotten up from the table and is standing on his tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW RONALD, YOU KNOW NOT TO INSULT OUR GUESTS LIKE THAT, OR DADDY AND HIS COMPANY, RIGHT?\" the last part she says sweetly, lifting Ronald's face to stare up at her own as she steps off his tail. The look in her eyes would probably make you shiver if you were normal size, at less than an inch tall though it makes you want to find another napkin to hide in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH COME OFF IT TIFF. THAT MAN ISN'T ANY MORE YOU FATHER THAN THE FACTORY IS THE FATHER OF A CAR. TO HIM YOU'RE JUST AN ARTIFACT. NOTHING MORE NOTHING LESS,\" Ronald tells her, and then before she can do anything to him the dog, which claims to be a transformed human takes off. Tiffany seems ready to dart off after him before she stops, remembering for the first time that you're on the counter behind her. Turning she faces you and you decide to ask her point blank about what Ronald just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is what the dog said true? Are you some kind of artifact?\" you ask her through the communicator. You remember a scientific conference a few years back determined that creating a fully artificial human was impossible, but then so was shrinking someone to less than an inch tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I PREFER THAT YOU CALL ME AN AP OR ARTIFICIAL PERSON. AND YES IT'S TRUE. DADDY DABBLED IN GENETIC RESEARCH A FEW YEARS BACK AND...WELL I AM THE END RESULT. I HAVE MY OWN LIFE THOUGH, AND A BIRTH CERTIFICATE AND EVERYTHING. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ME AND MOST PEOPLE IS THE FACT THAT MY BIRTHPLACE IS SOMEWHERE IN A LAB, AND THAT MY GENETIC STRUCTURE IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE OPTIMUM FOR A HUMAN,\" she tells you, and you can't help but hear a note of pride in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean optimum?\" you ask her after wrapping you brain around the fact that the woman you're talking to isn't a normal person. Then again the talking dog and the shrinking should have warned you to the fact that Tiffany probably isn't normal herself. Instead of answering your latest inquiry outright Tiffany walks over to a nearby cabinet and begins to rummage through it. You hear various clanking sounds, and at least one noise that sounds like a knife biting into wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes a triumphant \u2018YES!' can be heard from the cabinet and Tiffany emerges with what looks like a mallet in her left hand. The large hammer resembles similar hammers that you've seen in the old cartoons with a long handle attached to a head almost as big as your's. Well your normal head. Before you can even begin to guess how many yous would fit inside the head of the mallet currently Tiffany places her hand next to you on the counter and then brings the mallet down with tremendous force, enough to send you flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally skid to a stop about a foot, or several yards depending on how you look at it, from where you had been sitting, you look over to she Tiffany smiling down at you as she plays with the mallet in one hand and moves her other hand in various ways to show it still works correctly. Nodding your head you look over and your jaw drops. The place where she'd smacked her hand now has a depression on it in the shape of her palm in the inch think wood, yet you can see her hand is completely unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch,\" is all you can say as you push the button to speak with Tiffany again, and she starts laughing immediately, relieving at least some of the tension in the kitchen. Ronald chooses this moment to saunter back into the kitchen and takes several gulps of water before walking off again, apparently, throughly unimpressed by Tiffany's antics. The woman herself takes this moment to fuss with her hair a bit looking after the dog before turning back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SO SHALL WE BE ON OUR WAY THEN?\" she asks, and before you can reply she picks up the needle and pulls back on the plunger. Somehow the needle knows you are it's intended passenger, and expands just enough to allow you entrance before you are again suspended in the center of its glassy confines. Tiffany doesn't even ask if you are ok before shoving the needle into her purse and setting off for the MA office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are not completely sure how much time you spend in her purse during this latest outing, though you believe to be somewhere between the first time to the burger joint which took only a few minutes, and the second trip to her house which seemed to take hours, but was probably only about half an hour, if that. Whatever the case, Tiffany at last withdraws the needle from her purse and you are blinded by the light that floods into you glass encased world. When at last the spots clear from your eyes you look around and quickly find you are in Tiffany's palm at an office building. The logo on the side of the wall is...</span></div></div>",

It'll be for those through the door to get worked up about your situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the needle your head is sent reeling at the sharp contrast between the inner workings of the MA office and its public image. Outside the formally hidden door the MA office looks like just that, an office building, though for a decidedly odd form of business. Inside the hidden door things are quite different as you can see rooms that can't be real and must be some form of hologram, and antromorphic creatures, including a wolf woman who stands on humanlike legs, but whose hands look like claws, and her face is more animal than human with a long snout and jaws that could probably bite through metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice the wolf woman specifically because Tiffany stops for a moment to chat with her, and you are again put on display as the titaness points you out to her friend, who then proceeds to sniff at the needle, though if she can smell you or not you don't know. As she pulls up you are treated to a view of her mouth, and are once again finding reason to thank you tailors at making a form fitting outfit for you as you're sure normal pants would rip apart at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing your \u2018little friend' under control you look up and she Tiffany is smiling at everyone that you two pass in the halls, waving with her free hand. She doesn't seem to be as friendly with the others as she does with the wolf woman as she doesn't stop to show you off to anyone else, instead entering the office at the end of the hallway that appears o be the central thoroughfare for all employees at the MA building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe office is not what one would call lavishly furnished, though it is certainly not bare. The walls, which outside look like something off Star Trek, are made to appear to be wooden inside the office. The floor underfoot is as immaculate as the floor in the hallway, probably more so, and is done in a tile motif that really sets off the wooden walls. Everywhere on the walls you can see various monitors, though instead of showing security cameras inside the building they are tuned into various TV stations and movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the sudden change in scenery once again Tiffany strolls up to the desk in the center of the room, and before you can react you once again find yourself falling towards the needle's point, which has again expand to allow you egress from the glass tube. You landings have yet to be soft at this size, though falling atop the letterhead is probably the best landing you've had yet, as you only feel like you've broken one rib as you get back on your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MR. SMITH I REALLY NEED TO TALK TO YOU,\" you hear Tiffany say, which is a comforting counter point to the silence that permeated the inside of the needle. The next sound you hear reminds you of a door whoosh off the old Star Trek series with Kirk and Spock. The whooshing sound was apparently the result of a man turning his chair to face you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was middle aged, and his face was lined with concern. In his left hand he holds a load of papers he had apparently been going over when you and Tiffany entered his office. With his right hand he reaches up and pulls off his glasses before tossing the papers on to his desk dismissing them for the moment and rubbing his nose with his now free left hand. You are nearly blown away as the papers slam onto the desk almost right next to you but manage to keep you seat as the man speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES TIFFANY, HOW MAY I HELP YOU TODAY?\" he asks her. Instead of answering Tiffany points at you, and the man, Mr. Bryan Smith by the placard on his desk, looks confused for a moment before catching her drift. Looking down at you he slips back on his glasses and plays with an almost invisible wheel under the left lens that makes his eyes grow. Bryan, at last catching good sight of you leans back in his chair and sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LET ME GUESS. THIS IS THE RED LIGHT THAT MRS. GREEN FLASHED BACK A FEW MINUTES AGO?\" he asks her while staring down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES. SOMETHING HAPPENED LAST NIGHT AND HE GOT INTO MY PURSE AND FOLLOWED ME HOME. AFTER NEARLY GETTING EATEN BY RONALD HE GOT NOTICED AND I GAVE HIM THE ANTIDOTE, WHICH, AS YOU CAN SEE DID NOT WORK,\" she tells him, gesturing at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT'S ODD. THE ANTIDOTE WORKED ON EVERYONE ELSE,\" he says quizzically while pointing at you. His glasses emit a low beeping sound, and in the right lens you see an outline of you body flash on the lens before a small line moves from your head to your feet and then back again. Another series of beeps later have Mr. Smith gripping his chin in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I SEE THE PROBLEM, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT MY DEAR,\" he tells Tiffany, talking like you weren't even in the room. You fight the urge to shout at him as Tiffany asks the question you would very much like the answer to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT IS WRONG WITH HIM THEN?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"QUITE SIMPLY THAT THE ANTIDOTE WILL NOT AFFECT SOMEONE WHO IT DOESN'T RECOGNIZE AS BEING SHRUNKEN, AND I CAN'T FIND A DROP OF MY FORMULA INSIDE THE LITTLE MAN. I'M GUESSING AARON'S TAG IS ONCE AGAIN TO BLAME FOR A HEADACHE,\" he tells her, and you remember Ronald's comment about someone named Aaron having invented the Tachyon Tags. Right then you really wish you'd asked where you could find this man, as you'd really like to sock him in the chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I GUESS YOU CAN'T HELP US THEN, CAN YOU?\" she asks Mr. Smith, and he shakes his head glumly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL THEN WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?\" she asks him, a note of desperation in her voice. You wonder why she's so concerned about you, but then she probably feels at least somewhat responsible for your current circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AS I SEE IT YOU HAVE TO CHOICES. GO TO AARON AND ASK HIM TO SORT ALL THIS OUT, A RISKY PROPOSITION AT BEST AS MY DEAR COUSIN SEEMS TO LOSE MOST OF HIS PATIENTS LATELY, OR YOU CAN GO TO THE FOUNDER AND GET HIS HELP, AN EVEN RISKIER PROPOSITION, THOUGH USUALLY NOT A DEADLY RISK SINCE YOUR FATHER DOESN'T GET PEOPLE KILLED, HE JUST ENDS UP LOSING THEM IN TIME OR SOMETHING SIMILAR,\" Bryan tells her, before picking up the papers he tossed down before and swivelling his chair so that the back again faces you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at you with concern written all over her face you can tell that Tiffany wants to know who you wish to go to. Obviously you want to go to Aaron to give the jerk a piece of your mind, but you also would like to get better to, and if Aaron's solution to you problem works half as well as his Tag then you're libel to wind up dead or worse. The Founder of Star Technologies, and Tiffany's \u2018Father' might be the way to go, though you're not sure you really want to meet the man responsible for some of the horrors they've shown on the late news that come out of Star Tech labs all over the world.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a sigh you at last come to a decision, though not one you like, or can really agree with. If you had any other choice you'd probably take that instead, but of the two guys you can go to for help with your \u2018little' problem, you think Tiffany's father, the Founder of Star Technologies, might be able to help. According to the news he is the smartest man alive, and the designer of some cutting edge stuff. If anyone has something to induce growth, it would probably be him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go see you dad Tiff, at least then I can lodge my complaints to someone who has the authority to kick Aaron's ass,\" you tell her, and she nods in agreement. You expect her to pull out the needle again, which she does. Pressing the button on the side causes the needle to expand again, and within moments you are safely locked away inside a glass prison which doesn't let even sound in. The ride this time is not as boring, as Tiffany carries the needle in her hand as she strolls through the building and back outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs before you are amazed at the various people and rooms along the corridors of the hidden portion of the MA office. Anthros, both lizard and furry, human, and even some that look like androids are walking the halls, some stopping to chat, or so you believe from the way they look. Being unable hear anything in side the tube it is entirely possible that these people are discussing serious business matters, but the way some of them break out in laughter seems to indicate otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany is again all smiles as she walks through this secret world, and most of the people are glad to return the smile, as Tiffany really is one of them, a product of Star Tech and its founder. You've heard the reports and crackpots on late night talk shows discussing some of the things that come out of the Star Tech labs, and you really wonder how big those same crackpots would flip if they could see that even their insane ravings don't cover half of all of the strangeness that goes on inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this is just a subsidiary, a small branch office. Not even a lab. It makes you think that if this is what they present to the public, well the public that signs non-disclosure agreements anyway, then what do they have at their main labs. Gateways to Hell, hand held planet busters, and probably at least one unfilmed Mel Brooks script. All of these could be there, and probably some things you just can't even imagine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head is again sent spinning as you step out of the inner MA office to the same place where this madness began. Despite the perspective things in the office are still recognizable to you, and you are looking through the distortion of the needle at a seat you had thought was too small last night, and is now several times larger than you. One phrase goes through your mind at this point, though it seems highly melodramatic. \u2018Oh how the mighty have fallen.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe view is great, at least compared to the inside of Tiffany's purse, and this time as you walk outside you are greeted by the light of the sun, the first direct sunlight you've seen since you got shrunk, and despite the fact that you can see a fly that is slightly bigger than you are, it is still a great sight. All around you are the sights of city life, without any of the noise, and high above you is a beautiful woman, who is really not a woman, but you don't really care either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where are we going anyway, Tiff?\" you ask her through the communicator. Looking down at you she tries to say something, but then obviously remembers that the needle is soundproof. Sighing she walks over to her car and gets inside. Setting the needle down in her lap she leans over the seat and pulls her end of the communicator out of the hip pack again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to the Star Tech Headquarters, of course. You're lucky that Aaron wanted to keep MA close to home so that HQ could keep tabs on it, as we only have about a three hour drive between here and there,\" she responds. You don't really agree that 3 hours is close, but it's still closer than you would have expected. Still an unexpected problem has arisen that you decide to inform Tiffany about now that your able to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Tiff we do have a slight problem,\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's that?\" she asks, starting her car and backing out of the space where she was parked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I haven't eaten since about 10:00 PM last night, and I think I might starve to death in three hours. Any chance of getting some food?\" you ask her, trying to talk over the noise of your own stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, I guess we could stop somewhere on the way over, but you might want to wait. They have a great food court at the HQ. We can grab a bite to eat before we go see daddy,\" she suggests, though how she does it is a mystery to you. The communicator is set to her side, yet she can hear you and speak to you through it, something a normal walkie talkie would not allow, though considering Star Tech built it, you're pretty sure it isn't a normal walkie talkie. Still can you control your gut for three hours, or do you want to stop for food now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decide after only a few seconds of deliberation that going to Tiffany is probably the best idea, as she didn't seem to be the most forceful girl last night, and she might not enter your home unless someone let's her in. Mustering up your courage you run to the edge of the couch and thank the fates you bought on with a tasseled cover. It might look a little girly, but the tassels act like ropes to your small form, allowing you to get down with a speed you would not have though possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment your feet hit the floor you begin running, and just for an instant you wonder why your clothes still fit, as you are obviously bigger than a sixteenth of an inch now, though still less than an inch. The threads in the little suit MA provided must stretch somehow to fit your new expanded form. Star Tech must think of everything when they make things like this, though you really wish they'd though to include sneakers as your feet begin to hurt from the hardwood floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith panic fueling you it only takes you a few moments to cover the distance between the couch and the door. Unfortunately those moments are spent by Tiffany in deliberation as to whether she should open the door or not. It is unlocked, and the lights inside are on. She'd never had to walk in on a client yet, as they usually met her at the door because it was their second time meeting her. Some she'd obviously talked to, as they knew some things about her that she'd told only a handful of people, some had been repeat customers, others had even sent her gifts, though most she never saw again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a single thought firmly in hand Tiffany decides to risk opening the door and stepping inside. Maybe this was the seconded time she'd be meeting this Mister Marshall, and he'd somehow been detained inside. She'd played with the doorknob already, and so simply pushed the door open and stepped inside the small waiting area just inside the door. You at that same instant make it right to the door and are forced to duck as it passes over you head, and then are surprised when another shadow passes over you, looking up you see Tiffany stepping inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Stop Tiffany!!!\" you scream as the high heel, which you hadn't noticed she was wearing. As you would expect your pathetic squeak still isn't enough to reach her, and just like at the restaurant she ignores you, and the heel's sole continues to fall. You consider running, but by the time that thought finishes flitting through your horror stricken mind it is already too late. You feel the awful weight of her body as it presses down on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold up your arms in a feeble attempt to protect yourself, but before you can even register the pressure on them you find the femurs cracking, and you fall to your knees. The ribcage is the next bone to go, and your head falls to the ground in a side looking position, forcing you to feel it as the impossible weight of the goddess Tiffany crashes down atop you. You scream out in pain as each rib seems to shatter in turn, and your organs are torn to bits by the shards of your bones. With a last, sickening crunch, you skull collapses, and you are forced to endure the pain no longer, your last though hoping that the Tag works a second time. High above Tiffany looks around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Marshall? Are you home? My name is Tiffany, I'm from the Macrophiles Anonymous and I hear you wanted my services?\" she says into you empty home, turning on a point under her shoe that seems to be slick, probably from the driveway, she thinks. Looking around she hears nothing, and having not felt the breaking of your body beneath her heel she turns and leaves for her car, not even noticing the small spot of blood on the shoe of her heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDays later the police notice the spot of blood on your floor, but assume it was from a cut or wound. Not being very big they have high hopes that you are still alive and simply fought back against your captors. The months pass, and eventually people stop looking for you. Your family grieves for your loss, never finding out where you were or what happened to you kills them a little inside, but they move on. Too bad they never thought to look on the high heel sole of a woman named Tiffany who works at Star Tech.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your passing is marked a moment after your body liquefies in her stomach by a slight belch from Tiffany, who is quick to figure out that something went wrong. Being an employee of Star Tech, she does not panic, and instead calmly gets up from her seat, leaving almost three times the amount she needed to, to pay for a burger she only took three bites from, and then with a nonchalant air she walks out the door and gets in her car. The instant she's sure no one is watching she starts to desperately search through her car, quickly finding the discarded communicator. As expected the red light on the side was blinking indicating that the smaller device she had given you was destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You idiot, why didn't you try and tell me something was wrong,\" she yells at her stomach, and with her foot already jammed on the gas she starts her car. In the rush to get back to the MA office she sets a new land speed record for travel in a small motor vehicle through a major downtown area. Luckily she is still calm enough to avoid getting into any accidents and skids to a stop right in front of the MA office with almost perfect grace. Still mostly in a panic she shoves open the door to the office and looks at Mary, the clerk for the rather odd companionship service.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hello dear. Another exciting night I see,\" says the middle aged white haired woman, quickly pushing buttons on her keyboard. From somewhere behind her a small clicking sound issues, like a lock sliding out of place, and a section of the smooth and unmarred back wall of the office gracefully, and silently slides forward, revealing an immaculate, if somewhat gaudy, silver lined hallway behind it. Striding purposefully forward Tiffany enters the hall and nearly runs into a man in a white lab coat wearing goggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor, I did it again, hurry up, I think we can still save him,\" she tells him, falling into his arms. Obviously the two are quite familiar, though from the similar appearance of the two it might be a family rather than an emotional connection. Nodding his understanding the doctor rushes Tiffany to a back room, which is like the first, hidden in a wall that doesn't appear to have any doors, but seems to break away as the doctor approaches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout missing a beat Tiffany jumps onto the examination table that is the center piece of the empty room she enters, and the instant she is laying down on its gleaming silver surface a device that looks like something off Star Trek seems to pass through the ceiling, and gaze down at her. With Tiffany laying down the doctor steps up beside the table on which she lay, and a control panel comes out of the floor in the same way the scanner like device popped out of the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick push of a button causes the device to scream and blink into animate life, and several shafts of multi colored light wash over Tiffany, and through her skin one can actually see her vital organs laid out like something akin to a science class model. Looking at her and searching desperately for any sign of you continued life the doctor shakes his head before turning to his control panel, hoping he missed something the computer caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately it all turns up negative, and Tiffany misses work the next day to go to a grief councilor who helps her deal with the fact that she killed a man. Unintentionally to be sure, but still it was as a result of her actions that you're dead, and she feels terrible about it. Luckily, like the last time that she did this, a hypnotist is on hand to help her deal with her grief, and she is ready to resume her duties at Star Tech the next day, though management gives her a week off for her own health.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime the Star Tech company begins to invoke paragraph five section thirty two point seven of the contract you signed. In an oddly worded point the contract allows them to take possession of your life, and within a day not one shred of your existence remains. Your apartment is suddenly the property of someone else who could swear they'd lived their for years thanks to a memory reconstruct by the skilled neurotechs at Star Tech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but surely your family and friends are filtered into a similar facility, where their memories are likewise altered so that they know nothing of your life or that you were once known to them. By that same time next week as Tiffany returns to the Star Tech home office only one piece of evidence to your life remains, and no one, not even Tiffany, knows it's there. It consists of a tiny skeleton, lodged in a particular place in her small intestine, right next to a similar skeleton. Oddly enough the two seem to be smiling.</span></div></div>",

Her delicate pink fingers latch onto the sandwich beside you, her bright eyes locked onto you with more a tint of hunger than of lust.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n     The faint smell of baloney and mayonnaise filled your nose. Looking up at her thin nostrils, feeling warm distant breaths, you imagine she smells the same aroma. Her moist tender lips shimmer as brightly as her wavy golden hair. You notice she has stopped chewing her previous morsel. You can only assume your time is coming, and yet the survival trigger deep in your brain curses vehemently towards you. You don't want to be eaten! <br>\r\n <br>\r\n      \"Tiffany,\" you said with the highest capacity of your lungs, \"hold on, I want to talk a little more about this.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n      Her expression didn't change. You realize she didn't hear any of it-- and most likely never would. A quick glance around and you also fathom that there was no escape, nothing but cliffs from the sandwich edge and monstrous fingers that could crush you in an instant. Your gaze returns the beautiful predator. As you watched you drew closer to her red lips, the shadow of her forehead and nose casting over you. Those succulent lips parted and her bottom teeth quickly overlapped with her textured tongue, pieces of the bread still stuck around lumpy taste buds. Looking up you see the bottom of her nose, her eyes blocked from your vision. You jump and scream. Still, she couldn't even see you anymore. You were nothing but food to be eaten, an insignificant and powerless compilation of organic matter en route to digestion in the belly of another creature.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n     Light vanished around, and you heard the crunching of bread, lettuce, and the movement of saliva. Your head hits the roof of her mouth and you are forced off of your footing right onto her warm, moist tongue. It was rough, to be sure, moving you around in chaotic fashion as it moved the sandwich pieces above you to get broken down from her teeth. You gasp for air, smelling the sandwich bits and her heated breath. You clawed the bumpy surface of the tongue in an attempt to drag yourself away from being chewed into oblivion.  As she chewed her tongue cleaved you against the top of her pallet, trapping you in a crushing cycle.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n       The Tachyon Tag wouldn\u2019t save you now. No, if you were eaten he would be nothing but protein, never to be a man again. What to do\u2026?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His sex -slid half out of its furry sheath already- is mostly hard and, once freed from its cloth enclosure, springs up past his belly button.  He has to be at least ten inches \u2026 and he isn\u2019t even hard yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit...

I \u2026 I could...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExplode?\u201d the rabbit says.

Already tight and bigger than any man you\u2019ve ever taken before, your shrinking body was starting to feel truly abused and punished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!  You...you can\u2019t mean that!

The air is thick and feels like putty all around you as you strain to conceive of your new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, shit,\u201d you gasp, \u201cWh...what\u2019ve I done to myself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant looms over you and you can barely make out his features, miles and miles overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it isn\u2019t \u201cmiles\u201d, is it?

Each crack, rough and like the surface of some alien world, descends twice your height and is at least that far across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove you, over thirty miles in the distance, the giant rabbit presses a small button on the side of his posh glasses.

You couldn't help but feel dizzy as you look down and see the ground countless miles beneath you, and when you look back up you're greeted with a wall of solid purple that stretches out in all directions. You were being held right in front of Dirks glasses, the huge pupil behind them stares at you, far bigger than any building you had ever seen in your life. The glasses glow a little as they focus onto your speck like body, and moments later the loud echo of almost deafening thunder that was Dirks voice rumbles through the air, \u201cNot so big and confident now are ya? If I didn't know better I could have sworn you were nothing but a speck of dust... heck, I think you may even be less than that now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything starts to shake and shift around you as Dirk begins to move, taking you with him. From your perspective you were moving faster than any vehicle could hope to, but you didn't feel any signs of G forces or even the huge rush of air you would have expected from moving so fast, it must have been another feature of the gloves to keep you safe.<br>\r\nAfter a few more seconds you found yourself rushing quickly towards the ground, slowing before you eventually land on an almost endless wooden landscape, you can barely make out where you are but soon recognize it as your coffee table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bunny looms impossibly over you, stretching far into the sky, \u201cWell. I was called over here to do a job, so I guess I had better get to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirk makes his way over to the far end of the short table, at such a close position you could barely make out anything of his huge form, but now with some distance between the two of you, you could see him more clearly far off in the distance.<br>\r\nHe faces you and places his hands on his soft furred chest, then slowly strokes them down his slender body, running them across the slight bumps of his toned abs before grasping at the lower end of his fishnet vest. He pulls the fabric up over his body, removing it completely before tossing it onto the couch.<br>\r\nHe then turns away from you, giving you a perfect view of his plump backside, his short fuzzy tail twitches about above the two mountainous buttocks, \u201cShame\u201d he says, \u201cYou thought you'd be playing with a bunny, but now the bunny will be the one playing with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he says that you hear a loud pop as Dirk opens the button that fastens his pants, his thumbs hook under the waistband and slide the fabric down, revealing that cute bunny butt to you. He kicks the pants away and turns back around to face you, a hand on his overstuffed violet thong, rubbing it tenderly.<br>\r\nYour eyes go wide at the sight, even if you were at your normal size that bulge would have seemed huge, but now at your sub millimeter size it was almost too much to take in, bigger than any mountain, heck perhaps bigger than a small country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirk begins walking back around the table again, coming closer to you. He keeps his eyes fixed on you the whole time thanks to his special glasses, and once he gets close to you he stops and leans over, his face all but filling the sky. He licks his lips and grins down at you once again, \u201cWant to see what a real man looks like?\u201d he says, starting to pull down his tight thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words shake the world around you and the wind created by his breathing knocks you back a little before the huge bunny face raises up out of view. When you look back at Dirks body you almost couldn't believe what you were seeing. His thong had fallen to the floor, leaving the bunny completely nude before you besides the invisible gloves and special glasses. His thick dick hung low half way to his knees, still soft and swaying a little with his gentle movements, it must have been at least a good seven or eight inches long with plump orbs as big as large apples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a few steps back, trembling a little at the sight, you try calling up to him, \u201cWait. Please, change me back!\u201d<br>\r\nYour words fall on deaf ears however as Dirk either doesn't hear you or pretends not to, instead you see him reach a hand down to that large sausage between his legs and give it a few strokes, \u201cWhat did you think this evening would be like? Thought you'd be sucking on this?\u201d<br>\r\nDirk hefts his huge dick up and holds it above you, the hot pink flesh fills the sky, then you see it come rushing down, slamming into the table not too far from you with enough force to knock you off your feet.<br>\r\nA seemingly endless pink wall now stretches in all directions in front of you, you can feel the heat emanating from it even where you are, but then you notice something else, the flesh was stretching out bigger and bigger as Dirk started to become hard, \u201cThink you can handle this monster now?\u201d</span></div></div>",

His toned and lean chest is covered with acres of what was, to your un-shrunken form, downy soft bunny fur. At your current scale each of those hairs looks like an alien, softly bobbing tree. Each is a foot thick and at least a thousand feet tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that toned, muscled body is miles and miles away from you as you are pulled through the air until you stop with a drifting up-and-down bob in front of that monstrously gigantic muzzle, sneering with its smile at your tiny form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cplease! i \u2026 i didn\u2019t mean it,\u201d you squeak.

YOU WANT MORE HUMILIATION SO BADLY, DON\u2019T YOU?\u201d A massive, tongue -many times bigger than any whale- slips out between his mouth and slides erotically -slowly- across his lips. \u201cYOU WANT TO BE NOTHING; YOU WANT TO LIVE AS AN INSIGNIFICANT SPECK IN MY FUR, BENEATH MY TOES, WITHIN MY BODY \u2026 DON\u2019T YOU?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body shifts and rumbles and, soon, you realize he\u2019s walking. You drift in front of him, his chest looming closer and then falling away, as he strides purposefully back to your couch, miles and miles below. Looking down, you see his mammoth bulge has stiffened considerably since you last saw it. You knew he was packing at least a good fifteen inches but at this scale...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s hard to conceive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirk turns around and, in a dizzying flop in which your floating world is blown upside down and all around, he falls back onto the sofa. He licks his muzzle and you see him slip off his giant shorts revealing a hardening cock that reaches almost up to his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cn...n...no, please! i don\u2019t want to be this small! i...i\u2019m not even human at this size!\u201d you squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis laughter booms out, again, his ears tilting forward. \u201cYOU NEVER WERE,\u201d he rumbles. \u201cIT JUST TOOK A LITTLE SERUM TO SHOW YOU THE TRUTH...\u201d As he trails off, he picks up another vial of liquid. Your eyes grow wide and your cock throbs against your belly. He twists off the cap and replaces it with a spray-nozzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cno! please! i...i\u2019m begging you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirk doesn\u2019t seem to care. He aims the spray bottle at you and spritzes once \u2026 twice \u2026 three times.  Your surrounded in a fine fog of the formula; gallons of it, at your scale. He chuckles, low, like thunder, and -then- spritzes you a half dozen more times before lowering your tiny body down, down, down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gaze follows your direction and you see his mammoth cock-tip looming closer, like a vast plain beneath you. He\u2019s stroking himself and spreading his slit wide as he maneuvers you towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cnooooo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the shrinking start again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYES,\u201d your bunnygod declares.

But I guess this will have to do for now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirk takes a couple of steps closer to you and it's then that you notice that he is already starting to look bigger. He was already slightly taller than you to start with, but now you were only level with the bottom of his neck and could see his body steadily rising higher as the seconds ticked away.<br>\r\nYou look up at Dirk's face, seeing a wicked grin spreading over it, \u201cMmm, I love seeing my clients waste away like this. Getting smaller and weaker as they realize who's really in control.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart starts beating faster, both from excitement and fear, your clothes were becoming comically over-sized on you.

You're supposed to do what I want.\u201d You speak up, still trying to sound confident and commanding, but your words seem to fall on deaf ears as Dirk shakes his head slightly once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wanted to be smaller, you wanted to be toyed with by a big bunny. I've filled that first request, and don't worry, I'll get to the second soon enough. But I'll play with you how I see fit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to back up, you didn't think he would be this dominant, it was worrying but in the back of your mind you were secretly enjoying it.

Within moments his sizeable package comes into view, now level with your own head. That's when you feel Dirk's hand stroke softly through your hair, reaching behind your head, he then pulls it forcefully forward. You find your face stuffed tightly against his enormous bulge, at your size it was already bigger than your head and only seemed to get bigger as you dwindle away. What's more is that you can feel the contents of those tight pants shifting, pressing back against you. He was getting hard from his power trip and he wanted you to know it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirk lets out a relaxed sigh as he holds your head between his legs, loving the feeling of your tiny shrinking form wriggling in protest, \u201cMmmm, I hope you like it down there little man, you'll be getting much better acquainted with that monster later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrinking wasn't stopping any time soon, your face slowly slid down his immense package until even that was above your head. You wanted to run but at the same time wanted to stay and watch this cute commanding bunny become a true titan to you.<br>\r\nBy the time you were level with his thighs your shirt slips off your body, you were now so small you could easily fit through the neck hole. When you step over the cloth in all your naked glory you find yourself only level with Dirks knees. You look up, and up, and up, watching his looming form tower over you more and more by the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirk squats down and chuckles as he reaches out a hand towards you, extending a finger which you soon find prodding and rubbing at your painfully hard malehood, \u201cHuh, I guess you really were a big guy. The keyword here being 'were'\u201d He taunts you some more with his words before standing back up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you could do was accept what was happening, who was really in control of the situation as your body shrank smaller below the level of his ankles. The shrinking process actually seemed to feel quite good, and part of you almost didn't want it to end, but soon enough it all came to a stop as you stand at a single solitary inch in height, right in front of a mountainous bunnies feet. Even his toes were bigger than you were tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the shrinking process was finally over, Dirk looks down at you, tilting his head slightly, \u201cHmm, what could I even do with such a small bug?\u201d</span></div></div>",

All of a sudden your fantasy to be devoured seems very dangerous and not-at-all something you\u2019d really want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW..w...wait!\u201d you squeak.  \u201cPlease!  I...I\u2019ve changed my mind!  Don\u2019t eat me!\u201d  You realize he can\u2019t possibly hear you, so you get down on your knees, hoping that his eyesight is good enough to see your millimeter-high actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirk laughs again.  \u201cHah!  Praying to me already?  That was fast!\u201d  He licks his lips again.  \u201cI bet you want me to make you the most insignificant thing in creation, don\u2019t you speck?\u201d  His grin is cruel and demanding.  \u201cI\u2019d have you fuck me but you\u2019d get lost and I wouldn\u2019t feel a thing!\u201d  His expression changes slowly and he smirks.  \u201cThen again...\u201d he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasually, he tosses you aside onto the end table next to the couch.  His hips swishing -his white, bunny tail sticking out through a hole in his black, leather pants- he saunters over to your landline phone and picks it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!  Wh...what are you doing?\u201d you cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?  Roger?  I\u2019ve got a real small one, here,\u201d the rabbit rumbles.  \u201cYou free for a little oral?\u201d  Idly, the giant stroked his left nipple through his see-through mesh shirt.  His smile widened at the response from the other side of the call.  \u201cExcellent; here\u2019s the address...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a chill run through you.  He\u2019s inviting over someone else?  No!  He wouldn\u2019t!  No one should see you like this:  so humiliatingly small!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump and wave your hands, trying to get him to stop but its all over far too quickly.  The giant rabbit comes back to you and looks down at your speck body on the table.  \u201cWell, the eager fox, cock-sucker should be over in just a few minutes.  Let\u2019s get ready, speck.\u201d  With that, he slowly undressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw the size of his bulge, before, but even you had no idea the scale of the thing you\u2019d be looking up at, now.  To you, Dirk stands over two miles tall in your vast, canyon-like living room.  His cock -so close to you, once he lets it fall free and dangle half-way to his knees- seems to take up the whole sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s get you into position...\u201d he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, he starts to stroke his mammoth penis.  You stumble back, staring, and feeling your own cock throb stiffly.  No-no-no-no...  This isn\u2019t what you had in mind...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Is it...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut soon wondering leaves your mind as you see your God arise to a full eighteen inches -many, many city blocks to you- with his tip bobbing at nipple height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime to have some fun,\u201d the rabbit says with a cruel grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn and try to flee but two giant fingers, over fifty or sixty feet thick, pincer around you, delicately picking you up like the mote that you\u2019ve become.  You feel yourself compress and nearly break, but its clear the rabbit has done this before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime to open up, I guess,\u201d Dirk says.  With that, he puts his other paw on his cocktip and splays it wide, opening up the slit.  To you, it looks like a vast pit, the depth of which can\u2019t even be guessed at!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!  Wait!  Plllllleeeeease!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant rabbit God ignores your protestations as the unheard motions they are, and slowly places you in position.  You drop from his fingers, sliding down against the inside of the rabbit\u2019s urethra and -then- falling ...sliding... deeper and deeper into his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself hitting bottom far, far below in a dank, warm, salty tunnel.  You can\u2019t see a thing but realize you\u2019re at the base of his cock and his hands are still stroking himself to stay hard.  You pound at the sides of the sheer rise up above you but to no avail.  He just moans, feeling your most excessive actions being a tiny, little tickle within his shaft\u2019s base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes pass -perhaps half an hour- but you nearly have worn yourself out when you hear your doorbell ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world is thrown upside down as Dirk gets up and crosses to let in his guest.  You don\u2019t see the massive fox enter but you can hear Dirk giving him orders and telling him to get undressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, fox.  No rabbit hunting for you, today.  Today the menu only has one thing on it:  my cock...\u201d</span></div></div>",

You watch as he booms closer and closer, coming from the distance like an on-coming storm, his cocky, domineering smile firmly on his short, white muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re knocked off your feet and fall backwards into a tiny crack, barely bigger than your body.  It\u2019s a cleft between joists in the hardwood floor!  You struggle to get up, watching as the massive, fishnet-shirt-wearing bunny\u2019s feet cross over you in your hole and land nearly a quarter mile away in a single stride!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wood warps with each step -you can see the floor rising and falling beneath the footfalls- and the edges of your confining space squeeze and push inwards on you, making you think that this is not the safest place to be.  With the booming soon stopping, though, you are able to pull yourself up out of the two-millimeter cleft between boards and stand up, staring across the landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, in the distance, rising like a sun -rising like a God- stands Dirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019s turned and looked back at you over the rims of his purple sunglasses.  His twink-ish build, still clothed in the fishnet shirt, is nonetheless massive -monstrous- from your new, completely powerless perspective.  The giant licks his lips, slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d he declares, \u201clet\u2019s have some real fun, you worthless speck...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he starts to undress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulls off his shirt and tosses it towards you.  The relative miles that it travels -a mere ten feet across the living room floor- is crossed faster than you could have imagined.  The thin fibers that make up the shirt descend in seconds as you turn and try to flee.  Its shadow, alone, covers a quarter mile in each direction.  With a rushing rumble of cloth, the fishnet lands over you, your tiny body blown into the air -up between openings in the fabric\u2019s broad weave- by the wind of its landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch the rough floor drop away from you some twenty feet before your arc brings you falling back down into the sea of shirt.  You hit, bounce, and roll down part of one of the shirt\u2019s threads and, then, drop another five feet back onto the rough, wood floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh...  Taking a little ride, are we?\u201d Dirk rumbles from afar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a second!  This...this isn\u2019t what I signed up for!\u201d you squeak!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour voice, though, is created by vocal cords so tiny and so short that its too high-pitched for even the rabbit\u2019s large ears to detect.  Probably only months -maybe years- of experience have taught the giant escort how to keep his eye on your minuscule body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as your tiny denial squeaks past your lips you notice that he\u2019s started removing his belt and tight, leather pants.  He pulls them down, revealing red, thong underwear.  They cling like a second skin with a bulge that you know, even if you were at your regular size, would not only be impressive but downright frightening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirk tosses his pants to one side, having them land over the arm of the love-seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe runs his acreage of paws over his groin.  It must be nearly a foot long with balls the size of baseballs!  At your size you\u2019d be like a mosquito on such a monstrous appendage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can smell the sweat and desire rising from Dirk, even at this distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s play,\u201d he rumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to you, trapped beneath the threads of his discarded shirt, he peers -again- over the rims of his purple sunglasses.  His lean, wiry body looms like a mountain over you.  He grins and slips his fingers down beneath the waistband of his thong.  The cloth rolls down and you\u2019re soon left staring up at the largest, soft penis you\u2019ve ever seen.  It hangs halfway to his knees and its opening, moist and dangling hundreds of feet over your head, is big enough to be a cave entrance to you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit grins and starts stroking his huge cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp, realizing what he\u2019s about to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBigger and bigger the shaft gets.  You can hear the sliding of his paw over his flesh as he brings his mammoth, eighteen-incher to full tumescence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he gets closer.  He kneels.  As he lowers his mountainous body towards you, you try to run but the acres of shirt over and around you make getting away nearly impossible.  Still, your millimeter-tall body obeys your fearful commands to try and climb up and over or slip under and beyond the various threads blocking your retreat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirk is watching you and stifles a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRun all you like, tiny.  But as God said to Noah, get ready for the flood...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he aims his huge penis at you and begins stroking.</span></div></div>",

He pumps away at the enormous sausage between his legs, a droplet of his pre falls and splashes on the hardwood floor, making you jump as from your perspective it crashes down like some sort of watery meteor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you know how to swim little man\u201d the big bunny boy chuckles.<br>\r\nEven after a good couple of minutes of you trying to escape, you barely made it an inch across your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit leans over some more and carefully pulls the shirt away, you tumble through the threads as they rush past you until you eventually fall and slam back onto the floor. The giant tosses the shirt across the room before trying to focus his attention back on the speck almost right between his legs. <br>\r\nHis enormous shaft is now hovering directly above you, his hand pumping away faster now. A few more droplets of pre fall around you, one coming dangerously close. To you those drops were like giant lakes, if you were to swim at the surface of one your feet wouldn\u2019t even come close to touching the ground. Your heart races in both fear and wonder as you continue your plight to get away, but then you stop as you hear a loud deep moan which echoes like thunder all around you. You turn your head back and up only to see your god now rubbing himself furiously, those lakes of pre on the floor were now starting to look more like oceans to you, you couldn\u2019t even begin to imagine what will happen when that monster finally erupts, but if you don\u2019t hurry you\u2019ll find out soon enough.<br>\r\nYou start to run again with all your strength, hearing the rabbits deep breaths and groans above you, then suddenly an enormous wall of white fur crashes down in front of you, knocking you off your feet and onto your rear. One of the giants fingers presses into the floor.<br>\r\n\u201cWHERE DO YOU THINK YOU\u2019RE GOING?\u201d The rabbit booms, \u201cI\u2019M NOT DONE WITH YOU YET.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe finger starts sliding towards you, you panic and start to run away again but it\u2019s just too fast for you, you get scooped up onto one of his perfectly manicured claws and are lifted up what seems like miles upon miles into the air, stopping right in front of the rabbits face. You look at him, his cute yet terrifying head fills your view in every direction, those city sized eyes stare right at you and you see him lick his lips once again, before teasingly blowing a kiss towards you. <br>\r\nSeconds later you find the finger descending downwards, you had no idea what he was planning but it all became frighteningly clear when he hovers you right next to his mountainous cock, the slit alone looks like it could swallow whole buildings with room to spare.<br>\r\n\u201cSAY HELLO TO MY SPERM YOU LITTLE BUG \u2026HECK IF YOU PLAY YOUR CARDS RIGHT EVEN THOSE MAY BE BIGGER THAN YOU BEFORE THE DAY IS OUT\u201d the rabbit laughed once again.<br>\r\n It was then that you felt the finger start to tilt, you began sliding downwards towards that musky cave, struggling to stop yourself, but eventually you fell right into the sticky shaft. You flail and try to cling to the hot walls as you fall deeper \u2026deeper \u2026deeper, until you eventually splash into an ocean of his seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit however just moans with pleasure, loving the feeling of having a freshly shrunken man fighting for survival inside his malehood. He stands up and walks over to the couch, the large shaft wobbles with each step, causing the occupant inside it to get sloshed around all the more. He makes himself comfortable on the couch and looks down hungrily at his own cock, so big that he easily lowers his head down and starts suckling on the tip, his hand once again begins working along the base, pumping away at the throbbing organ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your prison heat up and start to pulse all around you, the muffled moans and slurping from the titan cause everything around you to rumble heavily, and before long you feel the semen around you begin to rise, higher and higher until you\u2019re finally forced upwards at a terrifying speed, you scream but no one other than yourself could possibly hear it at your size.<br>\r\nA second later you\u2019re shot out of the tip of the cock and expect to be sent flying through the air back into your room, but what actually greeted you was the inside of the rabbits huge maw, you get thrown around by tidal waves of his cum as the cock just keeps shooting out more and more, quickly filling the mouth\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At your size, the tongue looks as if a dozen of the giant beasts could fit, snugly, across its surface. Small mushroom-like knobs, each the size of a pill bottle, covered its surface and you wash across them helplessly. Taste buds, you realize:  you\u2019re washing across Dirk\u2019s taste buds. But more disturbingly, the dim light enables you to see what you were feeling, before:  tiny, three-inch-long squirming sperm, covering your body, trying to penetrate you and get inside. You feel several trying to force their way into your ass as you are tossed about and try to keep your bearings. But more than that, you hear the gurgling of the titan\u2019s fleshy body around you as he spits you out into his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light spikes in brightness as you gasp for air.

The text hinted at some sort of 'macro bondage' but it's just vague enough to be intriguing.</span></div></div>",

You waited for 30 minutes before your door bell rings. You were kind of excited by the prospects of what you wanted and what could happen and got up walking straight over to the door and opening it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't much to stop you from gasping a bit at the surprise you felt when you first saw him, true he was a bit slender and toned but he was still eight feet tall. You smile up at him and he smiles back, giving a soft chuckle as he rubs his muzzle a bit. You back up off the door to let him duck down in and step about your house for a moment. He was also holding a large case with some items in it being jostled around by his movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, you must be the guy who asked for me. It's nice to meet ya!\" He said holding his large hand paw out towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah. I am, it's nice to meet you too, Carl. Forgive me, I'm not used to seeing someone so tall\" You say, shaking his hand back. His large paw easily enfolding your smaller hand, using your other hand to rub the back of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seems to notice your nervousness and chuckles while walking over to the nearby couch and setting the items upon the table beside it.

You grab it and look down at it, the strange blue liquid inside of it seems to look alright, despite its advertised purpose. He looks down at you, seeming intent that you drink the stuff and you sigh a bit before bringing the bottle up to your lips and taking a nice healthy sip of it.

A cool breeze runs over your naked form as all the text in the brochures starts to seem so much more real and exciting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLiking it, I see,\u201d Carl says.  The great German Shepherd is gazing down at you with a sly look in his eyes as you glance back up at him.  \u201cNever understood it, myself -I like being the big man- but I definitely get turned on by watching it happen to my toys...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToys\u201d.

He turns to his right and rummages around in his bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre...are you going to eat me?\u201d you ask.  The sound of your own, shrunken voice makes you put your palm to your throat.  \u201cOh, my god...\u201d you gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEat you?\u201d he echoes, turning back with a leather strap in his hands.  \u201cWhen you\u2019re no longer toy-worthy, maybe.  But right now, I think I want to go out and dance!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he reaches for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis massive, furry paw darts out faster than you would have believed for such a large man and -soon- you\u2019re in his palm, brought up to his face.

You paid for one hell of a night and that\u2019s just what you\u2019re going to get, my little toy...\u201d  He holds you over the leather strap and you see that it\u2019s a burnished, brown jock strap \u2026 if jock straps were made for clydesdales, that is...  In the center of it were tiny, leather strips.  He lowers you down to it and gently-but-firmly, ties your wrists and ankles to the inside of its mammoth bulge.  Facing up, you struggle but both the tiny threads of clothing binding you as well as the soft leather of the thong-like strap are much stronger than your inch-high body can effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH..h..hey!  What\u2019re you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTaking my little toy dancing,\u201d Carl said with a grin.  With that, he shucked off his pants revealing that he wore no underwear.  His cock was huge!  Even for an eight-foot-tall man, his penis hung nearly to his knees and his balls were the size of over-sized grapefruit!  \u201cAnd remember,\u201d he added, swinging his legs wide so he could start sliding the thong up, \u201cif you displease me, I\u2019ll be very, VERY angry with my teensy-tiny, oh-so-fragile toy...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he pulled up the thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d you squeak, but it\u2019s too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as the cleft between his balls and sheath comes closer and closer.  The scent of male musk fills your nostrils as you are firmly strapped on beneath the giant man\u2019s cock.  You squirm as best as you can but, soon, the world goes tipsy as he stands.  You find yourself ground into his shaft, firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now,\u201d you hear his voice rumble, \u201cdon\u2019t make me disappointed in you, yet.  There are many ways I can discipline my little toy...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you feel him start to walk, rubbing you over and over and over -with each stride- against his sex.</span></div></div>",

The heavy smell of male musk, wafting over you with each moment he moves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk seems to take forever, each movement of his leg, sends the huge mound of his endowment, rubbing over your tiny body, in fact you are surprised that he didn't even seem to get hard from all the movements that rub his penis all around and over your tiny body. Barely anything than a small, bulge from the outside of his huge jock part of his thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the momentous movements around you stop, giving you a tiny glimmer of hope that you might at least get a little breather, a few more movements happen before a couple of god like voices sound out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Carl, I haven't seen you in a little while, hanging huge as usual, eh?\" The voice rumbles out, noticeably deeper than your captors, with a large hint of bemusement  in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know me all to well, Matt, not that I can hide it, but I'm here to give my little partner here a time he won't forget\" All the familiar voice of the massive German Shepherd rung back out, with movements as the dog grips the other side of the thong you were attached to, lifting it up and also having the effect of rubbing you even deeper against his girth before dropping it down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know where I'll be Matt, come and see me when your done out here, I think my little friend would do well with another dance partner.\" Carl says, much to your horror/excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl steps into the club, the music and pulse of the club playing around you, dulled by the walls of fur, flesh, and jockstrap around you. The titan dog bounces to the beat a little bit, causing you to be bounced up and down against your prison. It stops as he walks deeper into the room, stopping again where the music wasn't so loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself looking up, and gasping for air when the top of the jock strap is pulled back, revealing some of the light of the outside world to you. Carl's huge muzzled face, smirking down at you as you look back up at him, over the hill of dog flesh that you were trapped down by a few moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, my little toy is awake, I wouldn't want you passing out in the middle of the fun, now remember what I said about making sure you make this enjoyable for me. Do that and I might keep you for good.\" He grins and then moves his hips a little, forcing you to rub up against his sheath again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit there, looking up at him while looking around, the straps holding tight against you as you try them again, which only seems to please him to no end, the grin on his muzzle growing a little wider than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, don't have much to say toy? Well then, I might have company here in a few minutes, and he would probably like to play with you so I want you to be on your best behavior, my tiny little man and I'll probably go a little easier on you.\" He chuckles before readjusting his strap, leaving your world little more than his crotch again as he steps back out. This time getting into his dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bounce around, and his junk bounces around, pushing into you and smashing you up against the restrictive bounds of the jock, your night couldn't probably get any worse. </span></div></div>",

Occasionally, you feel something crash into your back as Matt\u2019s semi-hard cock -with its tiny passenger- slams into you as the two giant gay men bump and grind their packages together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dancing continues and you feel yourself squeezed and pressed slowly inwards against the hardening shaft.  It gets bigger and harder, pushing on you more and more and more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure is getting unbearable and you feel your little limbs start to crush and break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, suddenly, with a thrust of their hips, the two giants slam their cocks together and you are burst into a tiny, wet smear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness fades to light, sound, and a raging hard-on.  You blink, looking around, and see giant feet booming up and down across a vast landscape amidst strobe- and spot-lights for miles in all directions.  In the back of your mind you hear a computer-generated voice chime, \u201cQuantum chip restored; full functionality at reduced size, re-enacted.\u201d  You gulp and realize that when you got crushed the chip re-wound your body to its last good state -a shrunken state- at Carl\u2019s feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove you, he is dancing with a dark-furred, giant doberman:  both their feet dangerously close to crushing your mouse-sized body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scream up at them to stop -that you\u2019re down beneath them- but they don\u2019t seem to hear you.

The quaking and shaking of a giant slipping into the booth, catches both you and Sam off guard, a couple of great paws land down to the either side of you and him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looks up and then his eyes widen, huge black paws settling down behind you and then one large padded hand comes down, and manages to swipe you up.

He's just finishing off a whiskey-sour from a giant tumbler, looking down through the glass at the two of you, mockingly.

The wolf shrugs a bit and chuckles deeply while looking down at you and Sam. Sam looks slightly regretful at what he has to do, but in the end, it doesn't really matter as he grips you from behind and you could feel that fat sausage being pressed up between your butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a little worried, but it only got worse when it seemed Sam simply complied with little hesitation on his part, perhaps he was held for far longer than you could imagine. Those thoughts vanish from your mind when you feel his massive overly proportioned member push right into you, it felt more akin to someone stuffing a beer bottle and then some up your butt than any sort of  male parts. Sam grunted a bit, his member growing harder in you, obviously, you were tight to him, but in reality who wouldn't be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf looking on at the both of you, growls a little louder than before, obviously starting to get aroused a little from the peep show, each pull and thrust feels like Sam was going to pull your bowels right out of you before shoving them all the way back in, roughly. You could feel his hot pre surging up into you, in what should have been impossible amounts of it, simply leaking out. It doesn't take long before Sam cries out behind you and then you could feel the sheer potency of his load, one thick spurt comes out and causes your belly to distend followed by several others which each simply cause your stomach to bloat out, inch by inch. Sam tensed up behind you while his eyes were clenched tight as burst after burst of the hot cream entered your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf was panting even more deeply at this, the edges of his muzzle were raised up into a smile as he glanced down at the both of you, the glass was fogging up on the outside and you could even tell that the wolf was some how getting himself off while you were filled to the brim with cum. He leaned back in his seat, his hand beating down against what must have been a rather copious amount of male hood while panting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was laying against you, breathing deep, and you were trying to make sure any little move you took didn't make you burst, though you seemed to be able to take a bit more punishment than you would have thought. It certainly wasn't a pleasant feeling to be sure, even if it was incredibly warm.</span></div></div>",

His muzzle ends in the same dark grey color.  He's more slender than the other of the muscle furs, but is still very well defined and has a very cute gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zeke: Lion<br>\r\nOver seven feet of very kinky kitty.  Zeke finds pleasure in many different ways and loves to play on varying fetishes and fantasies of his customers.  He attracts many of the bizarre, but has his share of regular customers.<br>\r\n- 'Kinky is my middle name, Bub!'\"<br>\r\nA long, smooth, and well kept brown-red mane flows around Zeke's head.  His fur is a bright and healthy yellow, stretched out by his big muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barry: Bear<br>\r\nChubby, muscular, and covered in thick, brown fur, Barry is ten feet and 600 pounds of ursine.  He's very flexable and will be as gentle or as cruel as his customer wishes.  However, Barry's expertise is in vore.<br>\r\n- 'Want to realize a fantasy?

A deep, smooth voice suddenly speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darin Minotaur of Star Technologies, how may I...\" he's cut short by a sudden belch.  You blink-blink in confusion and curiosity. \"Ahem, excuse me... How may I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... Hi?\" You respond. \"My name's Steve Marshall and I just signed up for this.  I was looking through the catalogue and decided to give you a shot for my first time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarin chuckles on the other end. \"Mmm, you sound like a cute guy.  Just finished with another a moment ago.  One moment, I'll check my PDA for your information... ... hmm, I can be there within 10 minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything I should get ready for?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel free to clear up a spot for us to have our fun.  Some choose the bedroom before drinking the shrink juice... mmm, and we have LOTS of fun there... Otherwise, it's usually the livingroom and most of the time they get right down to business there.  I prefer having some fun before you need to use your Tachyon tag, though.  I always please my customers.  I shall see you soon.  Be sure to get things ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone goes silent and you realize he's hung up.  His voice was amazingly sexy!  You take a moment to consider if you ought to see what kind of \"fun\" he can provide.  Will you prepare the bedroom or the livingroom?</span></div></div>",

Using a marker a piece of paper nearby you quickly write bedroom and an arrow indicating which room the bedroom is in. You unlock the door so Darin can get in. Making a second note you tape to the front of the door. 'Come in Darin, follow the sign to find the bedroom.' Then you go into your bedroom straighten it up as best you can. Lastly you remove all clothes but your boxers just as you hear Darin come in. Sitting on the edge of your bed you can hear Darin reading the sign. \"Bedroom this way, huh. Well better make sure I'm prepared.\" After a bit of scuffling the door swings open to reveal the hulking mass of the Minotaur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw drops to the floor. Darin has a well toned torso with brown fur. His biceps and six pack are enough to put any body builder to shame. His leg muscles and black hoofed feet also look impressive. But this isn't what made your jaw drop, no that was the blue speedo that he was wearing. It didn't even looked like it could contain the massive bulge in there. As if just the slightest twitch from Darin's cock could rip it apart. The Minotaur turned around as he set a briefcase on the ground. Giving you the sight of his massive ass and powerful swaying tail. 'How did he fit all that in there' you thought. Darin found what he was looking for and stood up to his full height. His horns nearly scratching the ceiling. You looked at his face. Pure white teeth smiled at you and his crimson eyes seem to burn into your soul. Lastly he had a golden nose ring in both of his nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well someone's eager\", the anthro spoke noticing the bulge in your boxers. \"Here you go. One shrinking potion.\" He handed you a glass vile filled with a strange pink liquid. You examined it in your hands. Could this really shrink you? How much would you need to drink? How small could you become? All these thoughts flooded your head but you quickly snapped back into reality when you heard the anthro's voice. \"So listen I'm going to explain how this works. Drinking a forth of the bottle makes you have your height and last for three hours. Half makes you a foot in height and last for six hours. Three thirds makes you six inches and last for nine hours. And drinking all of it makes you two inches and last for twelve hours. The company doesn't want our clients smaller then that because any smaller makes it hard to keep track of them. So how small do you want to shrink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation you down the entire bottle and set it down on the bed. The effects were instantaneous. The moment you set the bottle down a wiped your lips you were already two inches. When you looked up you saw Darin smiling down at you. Looking around you were amazed at how big everything was. It was unbelievable. Furniture was building sized. Darin himself was colossal. You could hardly believe how quick it was. You did however still have your boxers on. Guess clothes shrink with you. Then you heard the Minotaur's voice and turned to Darin. \"I'm gonna pick you up okay.\" Nodding, Darin gently grasped you between two fingers and brought you to his face. It was weird. Despite the anthro being what seemed like hundreds of feet tall, you've never felt safer. Darin began to tug at your boxers with his free hand and you stopped him \"Wait a sec big guy...</span></div></div>",

You're too nervous to dare getting your bedroom ready for eight feet of furred beef and decide it's best to take things slowly.  You quickly clean up your livingroom a bit, getting the couch ready for this big guy, and preparing things for your fantasy.  Time passes quickly and you don't realize how much time has passed as you setup a couple more things.  A knock on the door makes you jump and you make your way over.  You look through the peephole and see Darin on the other side.  You open the door up slowly and smile nervously.  He's bigger than you thought and wears nothing more than some tight fitting and rather revealing gym shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, err... Welcome, Darin!\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big bull bends himself down and squeezes through the doorway.  He chuckles as he looks up at your ceiling. \"I almost never can stand straight up, heheh!  And how are you, Steve?  Thanks for choosing me.  Where did you choose to have our fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush some, amazed at this creature, enthralled by him.  Maybe you should have chosen the bedroom?  No, too late now, time to have some fun to old fashioned way.  \"I'm a bit nervous, to be honest.  My livingroom's all ready, Darin... and you're welcome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarin smiles and suddenly wraps his arms around you in a big, warm hug.  You're pressed gently against his chest.  \"Don't be, Steve.  I won't do anything to hurt you... unless, of course, you want that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow hard as he releases you.

His lips smack together and he makes an audiable and noticeable gulp, swallowing down his excess saliva.  He looks down to his shorts and pulls out the formula from a pocket and places the vials of it on your coffee table.  He smiles sweetly up at you and pats his lap, wanting you to sit there.  You comply, his smile rather reassuring, and his eyes seem so bright and gentle.  You comply with a smile, your much smaller form sitting down on his lap.  His arms wrap around you once more, cuddling you against his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to this... You can still hear my last customer being digested...\" he says, gently putting your ear against his stomach.  Indeed, you can hear it grumble and gurgle away, and you begin to find your pants a bit confining.  Your erotic fantasy will soon be coming true.  Darin reaches out to grab your Tachyon Tag and hands it to you.  You take it and activate it.  You feel strange for a second, but then the feeling passes.  You gently wrap your arms around ths big minotaur and hug him, his warm, soft fur feeling so wonderful against you.  \"Are you ready, Steve?\" Darin says, licking his lips again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod slowly and smile, turning around and grabbing at the vials. \"So, what do I do with them?  Just drink them down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depending on how much you drink will affect how much you shrink.  Based on your size... I imagine half of one would leave you at just under a foot tall, just enough that you'd fill my mouth completely.  Drink it entirely and you'll be at most an inch tall.  If you work down the second afterwards, even ants will start to seem big.  I personally find that size to not be filling at all, so I have... other ways to enjoy you at that size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment he says \"other ways\" you feel something shifting in his tight shorts.  What could he possibly do to get arroused by it with you so small?  You consider things and look up at him curiously.  His hands gently hold you as you feel his arrousal growing, making you a bit nervous again.  \"What would you do then if you wouldn't eat me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarin chuckles warmly and leans in to gives your head and face a good, long couple of licks.  You shudder in pleasure, finding your pants very confining now. \"I like leaving it all a surprise... Only ever get praise for it, too.\"</span></div></div>",

You stroke him with your whole body, bending at the knees and hefting with your arms.  It\u2019s such hard work and you\u2019re SO small, you start to pant and lose your wind.

Finally, you feel yourself slipping to the back of his throat, his mouth tight around you and only your head visible outside of him.

You suddenly feel very weighted down.  You look around and realize everything is getting bigger!  The formula's working... and fast!  Before long you throw the vials onto the table as you continue to shrink.  You begin to slip inside of your clothing, but as you reach one foot tall, Darin's hands slip down and keep you from being lost in a sea of nylon and cotton.  You then roll out onto his palm, which grows bigger and bigger, and then... It's stopped!  Darin's hand looks like it's a good 50 feet across, easy!  His humungous, smiling head looks like it's a mile above you.  You look down at yourself and you're definately naked.  Clothing doesn't shrink with you.  Makes sense, you suppose, as your clothes didn't drink the formula.  You did.  Darin's voice booms, sounding so much deeper now to your tiny ears.

There's one <i>huge</i> pull, and a moan reverberates throughout your body, shaking you to your core. And then the real fun begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, an irresistible force pummels you from below, and you're enveloped in a thick cream.

Finally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wipe the cum from your eyes, but it's still dark. And incredibly humid. But almost immediately, another spurt of cum shoots you in the chest, knocking you into whatever squishy surface you've landed on. It's bumpy, and kind of wet.

But you're in for another treat. Or rather, Darin is.

You reach the back of his throat and then, a sickening GULP seals your fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, Darian licks his lips, humming at your flavor.

You punched in the dial of the company and went through all the questions given by the computer reciever at the end. When it came time to dial the number for that chubby gator, you punched in the number with vigor. A couple of beeps later you were met with a burly and eager: \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stammer a bit but get out your order. \"I-is this stipples, from.. from the MA magazine?\" He chuckled a bit \"Yeah, the one and only! So, ordering for a one night pass to fun town?\" You yourself chuckle a little, \"Yeah, yeah i guess..\" \"You guess? Naw man you gotta be sure about it. What d'ya say! You excited or what!\" \"Yes, im ready for a hell of night.\" You shake your fist, initially you were hesitant about this but now you're quite sure it's gona be a good night. \"Well good, it's my first time and i can gaurantee that your gonna have one hell of a night too.\" After giving him your address and specifying what program you were ordring, the gators excited confirmed your order. \"Oh, so the special package eh? Well, can't wait to give you the night of your life. Be there in ten!\" The phone clicked and you were left shocked by the time span you were going to have to prepare for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExactly ten minutes later, your small, one story house is met with a bell ring. You open the door to see the colossal gator in front of you. Surely he had been at least a bit smaller than nine feet, but nope, you knew he'd have trouble getting through the door. The rain was falling down hard but Stipples was still in beach like clothes. \"Hey, yah gonna let me in? It's kinda wet out here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what? OH right, yeah sorry, come right in. Bending down to get through the door, you can feel a sort of heat radiate of off him, like he had just come from the beach or something and on closer inspection, he did seem to track in some sand. Though you were baffled, it confused you more that he was carrying some sort of box with him with bolded letters that read \"M.A. TOOLS.\" You began to shut the door, but quickly took notice of the long tail that kept inching through the door. You close the door shutting out the wet outside and keeping in the warm interior of your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to the large reptile in front of you, eyes glued to the nice plump ass of your gator clientee. The floor was wet from his scales sliding off the cold rain, almost like an illusion though as they seemed to be flesh like. His trunks were still on... you wanted them off. \"Uhhh... sorry 'bout the mess.\" He remarked a bit reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh.. no problem. So... mmm.. whats in the box.\" You stare at the box, diverging your eyes from his butt. You were intrigued to get started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held the box up. \"Ahhh this: this is a box of fantasies, some of your wildests dreams... i don't remember the others line they told me to tell you, but they did tell me to let you sign this.\" Stipples took out a slip of paper, looked like a medical release form. Something about quantum displacement and not being responsible for it. You sign it out of confusion though. You look back to see the gator walking around your living room. \"So.\" Stipples begins to slip off his shirt and revealing his soft scaled front. \"You wanna go straight into this or...\" He slowly slips off his trunks and keeps in a bent over postion, tail seductively swishing back and forth \"do a little foreplay first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't contain your on growing reptile in your pants</span></div></div>",

The answer in your pants is more then enough to tell me what your after.\" You look at Stipples unsure of how to respond. He then tells you to strip and to hand him the shrink device. You eagerly take off your clothes and watch as the gator calibrates the device. You look at the box and wonder what will be inside. Before you forget you take the vial containing the liquid that will keep you safe. You down it as fast as you can, eager to see what this Gator will do. The liquid taste like tar, but you didn't care. Stipples is finished calibrating and looks at you one more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Steve\", he begins. \"Before we get started I have to ask you a couple of questions. First question, do you want me to give you what I think you'll enjoy, or do you want to tell me what you want?<br>\r\n\"Surprise me\", you answer.<br>\r\n\"Good, because you answered the first question the way you did, I don't need to ask anymore. Now stand still and be prepared to go deep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure by what Stipples meant by that you curiously await what the gator has in store for you. A bright green light hits you and your size dwindles. When the light fades you look at your surroundings. Your once small single story house becomes the size of a city to you. Furniture towers above like skyscrapers. The carpet strands resemble thick ropes and you can make out small pieces of trash. The single light above the living room, now looks like a sun. As you take in how big every thing is you hear the booming voice of Stipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it, you like your new perspective Steve. I figure one inch would be a fun size to start with. Don't worry I promise this will be enjoyable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at Stipples and fall back on your behind. The towering gator now looked like a titan, no a god compared to you. His gut made him appear all the more massive. He looked down at you with yellow slit pupils. A two fierce lines of sharp silver teeth the size of cars greeted you. His gargantuan pink tongue dripped with slimy slightly green saliva. His tail lashed the floor creating large tremors making difficult to stay on your feet. The gator's massive black dick stands fully erect towards you and balls the size of dump trucks dangled underneath it. Stipples turned around and revealed his amazingly large \"beach bum\" and you licked your lips lustfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any warning the huge gator ran towards you. His massive feet covering what looked like hundreds of feet in seconds. Not to mention the powerful earthquakes they caused. In a split second, you gator god had reached you and his massive tongue darted out of his maw and flung you up in the air. Your ears popped and your whole world rushed by you at nearly two hundred miles a minute. The world blurred and your tiny body was centimeters away from hitting the ceiling. Then as fast as lightening Stipples smashed his fangs together catching you in his mouth. When his fangs mashed together they were a hair's width away from your small body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hit the gator's tongue with enough force to shatter your bones. You bounced once before the tongue came alive and the tip of it pushed your body towards the roof of the mouth and dragged you along the surface. Then it released and before you hit the floor the tongue grabbed you by your dick and flung you back towards the roof. It twirled your body round and round at the same time adding pressure and massaging your little dick. Then it stopped twirling you and tossed you again. The tongue then penetrated your tiny ass while your body was plastered against the roof of your god's mouth. Then mere seconds before cumming you were thrust out the mouth and back into the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything seemed to move in slow motion as Stipples got down on all fours and pointed his ass towards you. He then shot off his hands and that big beautiful butt raced towards you. You hit dead center and the saliva coating your body made you speed right through the anal pucker and into the warm ass of your gator god. You dived through his rear, like a meteor coming to earth. Then Stipples clamped his cheeks shut did a flip and landed with a loud thud on your floor. He clamped his ass together and just before you reached the point of no return the muscles grabbed you and stopped your body dead in it's tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it wasn't for that potion you were sure you would have died twenty times by now. You feel Stipples plop down on your couch and his soft but firm butt muscles slosh you around. The air in Stipples butt was humid and hot like the beach and the scent of musk overwhelmed your nostrils. It took a full minute for you to realize during that immense pleasure rush you had already cum. You couldn't remember when it had happened but warm pre dripped into the abyss that was your god's ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was...\", you were at a loss for words. You could hear Stipples laughing. \"Yeah that's what I thought your reaction would be.\" He says boastfully. You tried forming a sentence but all that came out was \"I was in the... and then in your... and then....wow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So little guy I have a question for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\", you say breathlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would you feel about...</span></div></div>",

Just as you take a breath of fresh air you are dumped onto the base of Stipples now semi-erect cock. \"Your job will be a bit easier now I'm already getting hard just thinking about it haha.\" Stipples says as he laughs and shakes you around. After regaining your balance you turn around and look up to see Stipples staring at you. After he sees you looking at him he puts a smile on his face, which makes you blush and you turn around very quickly. \"Hey you know your kind of a cute one aren't ya.\" Stipples tells you as you feel a huge finger pet you on your head. Know that you realize how much you like Stipples it suddenly got harder for you to talk to him, so instead of replying you decide to start pleasuring him to distract him from teasing you for a bit.

Stipples had decided to sit down and in doing so caused you to tumble off his black manhod. For a brief moment you believed that this was it, but you soon remember that vial of stuf you drank. With a puffy bounce, your small body slams into the great gators massive sac, a wave of strong musk enters your nostrils as you sink deeper. \"Oh shit little dude, woops!\" Stippels stares down to his baren cock, devoid of his little helper. Fishing a finger into his large bulbous sac, the great macro only managed to dig you further into his musky balls, squishing and kneading you all around, rubbing the musk and scent into you face and body. Wiggling, you can feel the immense warmth increase as your sloshed around, all the while the wrinkly skin seemed to wrap and form around you. You felt so close to orgasming, so close to release when finally the large digit of stipples touches you and proceeds to spread his sac apart, aiming his finger for you. \"Heh, there you are little buddy, was afraid I lost ya!\" Feeling your legs grabbed by the behemoth, you slide out of the scrotums embrace, the soft flesh dragging against you, your dick filed with a great, new sensation. Pulling you up, your now face to face with stipples and his sly grin. Suddenly your hair is blown forward as the great gator takes a couple of sniffs on your body. Jerking back, the gator scrunches his nose up and chuckles. \"Woo wee little buddy, you stink... like my musk.\" He leans in and nuzzles your tiny body, carefully caressing you and gently licking you. \"I like that, do you?\" You nod eagerly, and being to blush. \"Hey, whats say we go take a little bath together, a little soap might help get you into some nice places, or you could continue pleasuring me my little friend.\" A long lavish tongue slurped your face, then the gator sets you back down on his flacid cock, the heat radiating and warming your body. \"Well, what'll it be Steven my lovely?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well stipples...\"</span></div></div>",

You dial up Zeke and someone with a deep seductive voice answers.  \u201cHello, Zeke speaking.  What can I do you for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm, hi.  My name is Steve Marshall.  I have this catalogue and-,\u201d you start to say, but Zeke interrupts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sound like a first timer.  Don\u2019t worry.  I can make this very enjoyable for both of us.  Just tell me where you live and I can be there within an hour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell Zeke were you live and he says, \u201cThat\u2019s not far from where I am now.  I should be there in no less than 15 minutes.  Just sit tight and get ready for the experience of a lifetime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome thoughts cross your mind as you wait.  The first thing is that this must be some type of prank.  There is no way they can do what they propose in this magazine.  The other thing that crosses your mind is how great this will be if this is true.  Then there is knocking on your door.  You get up to answer the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you open the door you are amazed.  It is one thing to read that something is over seven feet tall; it is another thing to be standing in the presence of a muscular seven foot tall lion.  He is not wearing anything whatsoever and you have a good view of his rather large sheath.  \u201cLike what you see Steve?  I do normally wear clothes, but I just got through with another customer and I didn\u2019t see the need to put them back on.\u201d  Zeke then takes you by surprise and advances on you until you are backed against a wall.  He places his hands on the wall to either side of you and moves his snout so close to your face that his whiskers are tickling your nose.  \u201cSo, what do you want from me this fine day,\u201d he says in a half playful, half seductive voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I am interested in just vore for my first experience,\u201d you respond to Zeke.  His eyes narrow into slits as he stares at you.  You can tell that he does not believe what you just told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course you called me for \u2018just vore\u2019 and that is just what I\u2019ll do,\u201d sarcasm dripped from Zeke\u2019s tone of voice, \u201cI suppose we should get started then.\u201d  Zeke presents three bottles to you that had been in a previously unnoticed case sitting next to the door.  \u201cIf you drink one you will shrink to about two feet in height.  Drink two and you will be about two or three inches tall.  Drink the final one and a large ant might be larger than you.\u201d  You look at the bottles and consider the possibilities of each size.  If you are two feet tall that would pretty much rule out vore.  So you are left with the choice of drinking two or three bottles.  Just as you are reaching for your first bottle Zeke says, \u201cOh, remember the safety word if banana.  You will want to remember it if things get a little to intense for you.\u201d  That is pretty much an admission that Zeke is not going to just swallow you.  You think you should be a little frightened about his willingness to disobey your request, then you think back and realize he is just really good at reading his customers.</span></div></div>",

Your decision made, you pick up one bottle and raise it tentatively to your mouth.  The liquid inside smells kind of sweet and you sip at the drink at first.  It tastes much better than you thought it would.  You had thought it would taste as bad as most medicines, but it is actually pretty good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince it tastes alright you finish off the bottle pretty quickly.  Then you move on to the second bottle and finish it just as quickly.  Nothing seems to happen at first.  \u201cHow long is this suppo-,\u201d you start to ask.  A sudden wave of dizziness hits you and your vision goes blurry.  Then the world around you starts to expand.  Your clothes are not shrinking with you.  The once attractive Zeke starts to look more and more divine as you get smaller and smaller.  Soon you are only about the size your index finger used to be and you are standing in the middle of a pile of your clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, now lets test things out before we begin,\u201d Zeke thunders.  No, he is talking in the same tone he was before.  He just sounds like he is thundering to you because of your reduced size.  Zeke catches you by surprise when he raises his padded foot above your head and brings it back down with terrifying speed.  There is a brief sensation of pain before you are crushed like a bug.  Then you are standing right were you were before Zeke stepped on you and you are completely unharmed.  \u201cAlright, looks like we can begin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell Zeke.  I didn\u2019t ask for that,\u201d you yell up at the feline giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke crouches down.  \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t matter what you asked for does it insect,\u201d Zeke replied as he poked you hard enough with a finger to knock you over, \u201cYou are stuck at that size until I give you the antidote.  Until then, you belong to me and I can do whatever I want with you.  If you do as I say without complaint I just might do that.  If you don\u2019t I might just decided to keep you as a pet.  You would not be the first customer I decided to keep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cannot tell whether Zeke is being serious or if he is just acting.  If he is just acting he has read you pretty well.  The way he is treating you is already starting to turn you on.  In fact, a small part of you does wish he would keep you as pet.  Zeke\u2019s hand shoots out and grabs you roughly.  \u201cLet\u2019s see what I should do with you first.  My paws could do with a little cleaning.  Then again, you look like you could do a pretty good job of pleasuring me as well.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I think I\u2019ll have you make up for that,\u201d Zeke says while looking up and tapping his jaw with one finger as if he is deep in thought.  He then moves the hand that you are in towards his sheath.  Zeke starts to stuff you into his tight sheath legs first and you start kicking in an attempt at escape.  You can feel the tip of an extremely large cock beneath your bare feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke starts to murr in pleasure.  \u201cOh yeah, if you want to get out you are going to have to keep that up,\u201d Zeke purrs.  He uses one finger to finish stuffing you down his sheath.  You are surrounded by darkness.  Zeke\u2019s musk is thick in the air around you and it is starting to smell stronger with every second you struggle within the sheath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never asked for this but you are kind of enjoying it.  Your own cock is hardening as you feel Zeke\u2019s doing the same.  The air in here is starting to run out and you do need to escape.  Your need for survival gives you the encouragement you need in order to continue trying to pull yourself out of Zeke\u2019s sheath.  You can see light enter your prison as Zeke\u2019s cock finally starts to emerge from his sheath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab onto his cock as it emerges and you once again find yourself in the cool air of your house.  Zeke is not through with you yet though.  He clasps his hand around you and his cock and he starts rubbing you up and down the rapidly growing shaft.  Semen is starting to leak down his cock and down your face.  You have to swallow some of it to keep from suffocating.  Zeke\u2019s rubbing becomes more vigorous as he comes closer to climaxing.  You can feel your skin chaffing against his cock and you know you must be red as an apple.  Suddenly you feel his cock tense and you hear your bones make a sickening crunch as you are crushed against Zeke\u2019s massive boner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou once again come to with no harm done to your body and you are sitting on top of Zeke\u2019s still erect cock.  When you look up you can see that Zeke is smiling down at you.  \u201cThat was much better than my last customer.  Why don\u2019t I grab a bite to eat while we wait for me to reload,\u201d Zeke asked.  He really did not bother to wait for you to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke grabbed you once again and started rubbing you against his cock and scrotum as he went to find the refrigerator.  He is whistling to himself, just as happy as can be while he uses you as his personal sex toy.  Zeke eventually finds himself in your kitchen and he finally sets your slightly battered body on the counter.  He starts pulling things out of your refrigerator and sets them on the counter next to you.  The lion has assembled a variety of meats and cheeses and he also finds a couple slices of bread.  \u201cYou don\u2019t mind if I make myself a sandwich do you,\u201d Zeke asks as if he cares about your response and continues making the sandwich without waiting to see what you will say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sandwich is almost done when Zeke looks like he forgot something.  He turns around quickly and this tail accidentally knocks you into his partially assembled sandwich.  When Zeke turns around he notices you are not where you had been standing.</span></div></div>",

After the stars stopped dancing in front of your eyes it became clear that you were in the middle of the sandwich Zeke was making.  Just as you look up you see a massive slice of bread descending on you.  The weight of the bread is enough to knock you off your feet and press you into the meat of the sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did you get off to,\u201d Zeke calls out, \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to hide it will only make things more difficult latter.\u201d  His voice sounded a little odd while being muffled by the bread.  The sandwich you are in suddenly lurches and it feels like your stomach is left a few feet below you.  Then Zeke starts to systematically dismantle the sandwich you are in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought you heard him taking bits out of the sandwich at fairly rapid intervals.  Either he is a fast eater or he is barely bothering to chew his food.  You are scared half to death when a set of monstrously large teeth bits down a couple of inches from your face.  It is one thing to say you want to be swallowed by something, but you cannot help but feel a little fear now that you know it is about to happen.  But you do have to admit that you are feeling much more excitement than fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it happens.  Zeke takes one big bite out of the sandwich and you are inside his humid maw.  You are surrounded by glistening fangs and Zeke\u2019s warm breath permeates the air.  There is enough time to notice that Zeke\u2019s breath smells remarkably nice for a carnivore before he swallows the contents of his mouth without even bothering to chew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels like the muscles in Zeke\u2019s throat are trying to crush you as you descend his throat.  You cannot help but struggle on your way to his belly.  Your efforts do not go unnoticed by Zeke.  \u201cOh, that\u2019s were you got off to.  Well at least you are going to have your request fulfilled.  See you when you get out,\u201d Zeke says as he gives his stomach a satisfied pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land in his belly at nearly the same moment as Zeke is patting it.  The sound of the patting seemed amplified inside Zeke\u2019s body.  Acids are already at work digesting what has arrived in the belly before you.  The air has a horrible acrid scent to it and this is what you expected a stomach to smell like.  Since this is what you wanted to begin with you do not bother to use some of the bread that is floating like a raft.  You are already waist deep in the acids and you can feel your body being dissolved.  Part of you wonders what you were thinking about when you asked for this, the other part feels ecstatic to finally be doing something like this and you know you want to do this again someday.  But your thoughts soon come to an end.  The acids have already risen above your head and you are being quickly dissolved.  You are not certain how long it took for you to die after you lost consciousness, but when you opened your eyes you were standing on the kitchen counter with no harm done to your body once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese Tags really are amazing.  You had just better remember to keep this thing on you.  Zeke is no longer standing at the counter.  You wonder where he has gotten off to when you see him strolling up to the counter a few minutes later.  \u201cDid you enjoy that,\u201d Alex purred with a mischievous smile on his face.  \u201cNow I suppose its time I take you to your knew home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are a little surprised by what he is saying.  He had said he might do this earlier.  You had assumed it was just part of the act.  Now, you are not so sure.  Is he just acting or does he intend to keep you as his own personal little toy?</span></div></div>",

And do not think shouting for help would work either.  People would not be able to hear your voice through my fist.  But since you seem to think you are such a big man and that you could thwart my plans, how about I make you a little smaller?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do realize there is still one more bottle of the shrinking formula left.  But he should not be able to force you to drink the bottle at your size without snapping your neck and activating the tag.  \u201cOh, if you think you are not going to drink the formula, remember that your arms and legs can be broken without killing you,\u201d Zeke comments to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou curse the fact that Zeke has already managed to outthink you.  Being a toy does sound a little better than having all your limbs broken.  Zeke presents his open hand to you and sitting in the middle of his palm is a bottle of the formula that is your size.  You offer no complaints, you just climb into his palm and drink the formula.  It once again takes the formula a few seconds to go into effect, but that wave of dizziness hits you once again.  The once large Zeke soon becomes titanic in proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, now were should I hide you,\u201d Zeke thunders, \u201cI could still hold you in my closed fist.  But that is no fun.  At your size there are just so many better possibilities.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Then his ears perk up and he says, \u201cAh, I know where to put you.\u201d  He lowers you down to his midsection where you can see he has grown erect once again.  Zeke lets you hover above his cock\u2019s head, which is oozing cum at the moment.  \u201cI wish I could stuff you in there, but alas, you would probably shoot right back out in my current state.  But there is plenty of room in my sheath right now.  The bonus there is that you can, and will, play with my cock when it does descend back into its sheath.  So, in you go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke ignores your protest as he carefully stuffs you in his musky sheath.  And he was right, there is plenty of room in your warm and moist prison at the moment.  That is not the case for long though.  Soon the weight of his giant round orbs and long shaft descends on you.  You do not want to give Zeke any pleasure due to what he is doing to you, but the weight is incredibly uncomfortable and you have to move around to get comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe contents of your prison start to shift and you are sure Zeke is moving around.  You have to keep moving around to stay comfortable and it starts to heat up in the sheath as a response.  That makes it obvious that Zeke can feel you inside his sheath despite your miniscule size.  You are not sure how long this went on before something else finally broke up the monotonous routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressure was being applied to the sheath.  It felt like Zeke was pleasuring himself to you.  Zeke\u2019s cock started to poke through its sheath once more and you held onto it to catch a ride out of the sheath.  It is nice to be out of there, even though you have to admit that deep down inside you did enjoy the ride.  \u201cYou had best use that tag of yours now unless you want to repeat that entire trip,\u201d Zeke says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do as you are told almost immediately.  At least he is giving you a warning that he is about to do something that would result in your death sometime soon.  That is when he grabs you as gently as he can and raises you above his still emerging cock.  This time he does let you fall into his slit.  You go sliding down the dark interior, screaming all the way.  It is to dark to see anything inside Zeke\u2019s cock.  You do not even know where in Zeke\u2019s cock you are when your slide finally stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell here is not as bad as you thought it would be.  Still, there is a very strong scent that you only faintly recognize.  You can here Zeke pleasuring himself outside of the cock and his efforts are causing the chamber you are in to fill with a thick liquid.  It is so thick and sticky that you cannot even swim through the stuff.  Of course, you realize you are walking around in Zeke\u2019s semen.  Then his seed starts to move upwards.  You wonder if this is sort of how a volcano works as you are dragged upwards as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the pressure forcing you upward increases drastically.  You go shooting from Zeke\u2019s cock like a little human bullet.  There is just enough time for you to see Zeke\u2019s smiling face before you go smashing into the ground.  Things go dark for a little while and then you are standing on the ground as if nothing had happened to you while Zeke smiles down at you.</span></div></div>",

It clatters on the floor. You retrieve it and examine it. For the most part, you're relieved, the Tachyon Tag looks undamaged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou use the device and inject yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you only need to choose either Tom or Kevin and dial a special number the personnel at MA gave you.

Some company promises they can deliver real giants for such a low cost you could empty your couch and be able to pay for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fall on your aging sofa and finish ravaging the package wrapping and pull out a DVD and what looks like a phase gun.  Setting the toy-looking gun to the side you put in the DVD and wait to see if this is really true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Mrs. Watts.  This is your personalized instructional DVD.  Star technologies is a company that specializes in unique fantasies and is 100% safe and will deliver the unthinkable.

We have attractive men and women who are more than eager to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA parade of supermodel level men and women in their underwear flash on the screen.

We specialize in safe and effective forms of vore, crushings, animals, and all with both sexes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that's not all.

A chamber in the room begins to fill with various liquids and after a moment the door opens.  Stepping out was a 6ft tall man, but to your surprise he wasn't human!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way it could be faked, his muscles were seamless and its muzzle was a real tiger's!  Standing like a well endowed man was an actual tiger man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our sessions are private, but as you can see, we do indeed have the technology.  You can have a simple fantasy in the comfort of your own home or drop by for a completely personalized macrophilic experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust remeber, your Tachyon Tag, that shiny needle gun that came with this DVD is the only thing you are required to supply yourself at home.

The women you saw there were amazing...perfect female forms in all ways.  Your heart told you that you should choose the female option...as males probably had fun more often as giants.  You quickly dialed up the number of the offices, smiling as you looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Star Technologies.\" a female voice began.  \"This is Elisa speaking, how may I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my name's Andrea Watts, I just recieved my DVD today and I'd like to schedule someone to come over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Miss Watts.\" Elisa said over the phone, sounding happy about this.  \"May I ask which you'd like to visit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd like to have a human woman come over, but I'm not sure on the options.  Could you explain how the women act??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, no problem.  We have various options for almost any type of fantasy you could have.  Some of our more popular options are crushing, vore, and body exploration.  There are others, but each girl is trained for any type of fantasy you have in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose notes made your heart beat faster.  You were sweating already with a smile on your face as you thought about what a giant woman could do to you.  \"Um, who are some of your top girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have four that are our most popular.  First, there's Jessie.  She's a shapely blond who likes to treat her subjects like pets most of the time.  She enjoys body explorations, loving having people climb all over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next is Shayla.  She's an African American woman who enjoys playing the part of a goddess.  Enjoying that role, she especially likes having little people be crushed under her as sacrifices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We then have Aiko, an import from Japan.  She's a smart girl, having a very high IQ, and thus likes to do experiments on tinies.  She really enjoys vore...so she may be your best option for that role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, we have Maxine, a firey red-head.  She's our animal trainer, and likes seeing how shrunken people react to her pets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's your choice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose descriptions all sounded interesting to you.  It would be hard for you to choose just one.  But, not wanting to over-do yourself the first time, you decided to pick.</span></div></div>",

You do have your tag ready, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked a bit, and reached over to the device that came with the DVD.  \"Yes, I have it.  I'm injecting it right now.\" you said, doing just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Miss Watts.  Just give your address, and then we'll send Shayla right over.  Hope you enjoy your experience with her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving you address and hanging up, you grinned widely.  You still had some lingering doubts, but at the moment they were being blocked out by the desires that you had going for you.  Eager to impress your soon to be goddess, you quickly did some minor touch-ups on your place...making sure it was neat and tidy.  'After all, what's the point of having a goddess before you if she isn't in a pristine world.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 20 minutes after you finished the call order, there was a ringing of the doorbell.  You ran over, opening the door, and smiled widely at seeng who was standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, my name's Shayla.  You're Andrea Watts, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to hide how aroused you were at seeing the gorgeous black woman before you.  She had amazing measurements...off hand, you'd have to guess 38 D breasts, 28 inch waist, and 36 inch hips.  The outfit that she wore, a tight black pants-suit, only served to accentuate her body.  Her hair, long and black, looked so smooth and silky at first sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...yes, yes I am.  Wow...you're gorgeous!\" you blurted out.  You thought that you would have offended her, but Shayla only smiled at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad that I don't dissapoint.  Hope you still feel that way about me when you're a little, LITTLE girl at my feet.\" she said with a chuckle in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...I'm sure I will!\" you assured.  \"Um, so how do we begin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShayla reached into a pocket of her suit, pulling out a small vial.  \"First, you have to drink this.  Then we'll decide on where we should have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...what do you mean by where?\" you questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we could either have fun here, or we could go to one of my places to have fun.\" Shayla told her.  \"It's entirely up to you.  But first, let's get you tiny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, and took the vial that Shayla handed you, chugging it down.  Shayla had to lick her lips a bit, an action that sent a shudder up and down your spine...or was it the fact that Shayla now seemed to be growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...it's...it's working!\" you said, really happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it is!\" Shayla said, her voice getting louder as your body continued to dwindle down, forcing you to crane your neck up to look at her.  \"Now, since you're going to be tiny, I'll make this easy for you to choose where to go.  If you want to stay here, come over and kiss my foot.  If you want to go to one of my places, climb into my hand.\" she told you as she squatted down.  Once you were down to your inch height, seeing the sight of her squatting made your heart beat faster.

Just go down the hall to room 3-A for your transformation, and when you're done everything will be set up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" you politely say, before going down the hall.

You easily fall asleep, unaware.<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\nA while later, you wake up.  Your head was a little breezy feeling, but you were greeted by an amazing sight as you awoke...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...before you was a city.  A big, beautiful city.  ...well, big for the bug-like population down below.  To you, it was merely a toy to play with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the thought came to your mind...what did you transform into.

They were all very meek and cooperative, which you guessed was why they were the ones who were shrunk. You supposed that they were all volunteers who wanted to be shrunk around a giant cat lady. You certainly aren't complaining. <br>\r\nThe little one inch citizenry began to get to work, climbing up and getting to work. You felt tiny hands and weight all over. Little men and women were doing their best to massage in between your large toes and on your mighty heel. There were humans wrapped around your ankles, people lining themselves on your lower legs. There were people putting themselves under your palms, pressing their little bodies into your arms. They shoveled themselves into your shoulders and neck, a tiny congregation dedicating what surely was all their tiny muscles to lifting your head up off the floor. You felt little arms and legs clamber on top of you. You felt their bodies on your stomach, massaging away, against your hips, against your waist, up into your armpits, everywhere. Little shrunken fingers worked eagerly at your knees, at your fuzzy thighs, against the sides of your butt. Tiny  boys groped at the sides around your breasts, tinies standing on or walking up the hill of your boobs to the nipple, where even more anxious hands worked to service their master. They handled and massaged your breasts, thoroughly erecting your strawberries with the tiny stimulating motions. This massage felt unreal. Hundreds of bodies were all over you. They were on your toes and toenails; on, around, and under both of your heels all the way up to your buttcheeks; a good number of bolder ones were under your waist, even! They were in between the rounds of subtle, sexy rump you sat upon, palms were pressing against your taint, feet pushing themselves as gentle as seemed sensible against the rounded skin on your labia majora. These eager tinies worked at your clitoris, and it was great. <br>\r\nThere were a good number which were incompetent, but you didn't mind, because they felt good. There were tinies tumbling down your breasts, being thrown from the playful wiggling of your toes, one stuck in your lips...oh. Oh my. <br>\r\nYou completely and totally enjoyed your massage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later, in a significantly hotter and wetter block, you stand up and stretch, looming over your new pet people. <br>\r\n\"That was grrreat, little workerrrrs. You rrreaaaally pleased me with that one. You did <i>not</i> disappoint.\" <br>\r\nA mixture of relieved sighs, cheers of joy, and worshiping praises rises up to your ears from the floor below. <br>\r\n\"You all deserrrrve a rrrewarrrrd forrrr such a wonderful job you did.

They pile around you,  several squirming around your feet, both under and over, and a particularly determined cluster piles upon each other to reach your eclipsing rear, your sky - blocking taint, and your monumental vagina from behind. You deliberately and lustfully lower your cheeks over as many tinies as possible, holding the impatient weaklings in place. You feel some particularly eager inch high rebels squirm into your anus, sending shivers up your spine. <br>\r\n\"Now, now, my valuable little shrrrrrunken toys. My rrrounded rrrrump can wait.

Slowly, you roll over onto your back and sit up, brushing off all the little people. Sitting with your legs in an open loop, you guide the itty bitty crowd into the little circle. They're all rather disciplined, politely sitting there obediently, and not crawling rabidly around you or trying to wrestle their way into your pussy. You purr happily at them, picking a couple between your fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrrrrrow~ Good morrrrning, toys. Did you sleep well? We'rrre going to be playing <b>all day</b> today!\" You promise, tossing the tiny people you had plucked between your huge fingers up into the air. You catch them in your mouth, toying with their little bodies on your tongue and tasting them. The flavor wasn't much, but the texture of their little bodies was absolutely savory. You loll them out, letting them fall with a drip of saliva back down to the ground. They look up at you expectantly, as if disappointed you didn't swallow them. Then, slowly, they walk back to the crowd, sticking close to your thighs and rubbing as they walked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You arrrre all such good little bugs, it drrrrives me crazy!\" You squeal, closing your legs around them. \"You all deserrrve a -Rrrreward-. Separate into two groups, little people!\" Your legs part, opening your slit. Reminded of all the tinies still stuck inside your pretty sex, you finger the outside. You feel the clump of micros, pushing them in deeper with two fingers and curling your fingers around them. While you play, you continue issuing plans. \"Go to the left if you want to be smished and smushed underneath my huge kitty paws!\" Already, several of the city's people starting walking into a cluster to service your feet. \"And if you want to get all embarrassed, go to the right! I'll make all you tinies blush, I prrrro-o-mise!\" You roll the r and hum the o with particular enthusiasm. And quickly, you have two piles of punies. You finish up the group in your pussy, shoving them deep enough that a couple get stuck in the entrance to your cervix. This only gets you even more hot and bothered, ready for playtime. You scrunch your labia together, savoring the tight, snapping roll of tiny bodies as their little bodies interlock and get caught on each other while they spread out as your walls squish them inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spin on your rear to the group of foot toys. You lean forward, plucking each tiny and sticking each one in between a toe. After you run through that group, you pluck some tinies and lay them on top of your huge paw, each one getting their own toe to massage. Your toes have cute little claws at the end, not sharp enough to do any more damage than a regular toenail, but definitely different. Finally, you lay the two leftover groups under a heel each. Then... you <b>squeeeeeze.</b> You see all the barely inch high people between your toes squirm and massage at each of their little prisons. So little. So cute. You slam your heels down, rubbing down on all the puny people like they agreed. They cheer happily, servicing at your feet obsessively. It felt like a five-star massage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You lean back, head turning on the ground so one of your eyes is barely level with the second group. <br>\r\n\"Look at all you tiny people. Soooo tiny. Soooo pathetic. I can't imagine what it's like to be you, looking up at such an enormous goddess, and just wanting to be embarrassed by her. Look at all you!\" You had temporarily dropped the cartoonish rolled r's. You were going for impact at the moment. You reach a huge paw over to them, putting your ring finger over one, pinning him to the ground.You slipped a thumb under him, pinching his tiny body with just two fingers. \"So frail. I could smush you into pieces with just two fingers, you know? It wouldn't be hard. But you're just so little, I could eat you up! So tiny and tasty.\" You held him high above your face, looking up at him. You lowered him to your mouth, licking him between your fingers. You dropped him and let him sit on top of your tongue for a while. Eventually, you giggled and a huge blush spread across his face. You retracted the pink platform, and he tumbled down in your mouth. You rolled him against your cheek, finally feeling him. You licked your finger. He was stuck to your finger with just a touch of the liquid. You laughed at his tiny body, the clothes dissolving off him. He blushed like a mad man, and finally, you reached down. The tiny was rubbed against your clit for a long while, Each moment seeming to last forever, each rub seeming to last years, until he was stuck to that, by an entirely different fluid. \"You can't escape, can you?\" You purred down at him. He shook his head, and you pushed him against your love button. Hard. Harder than you ever thought you would. \"Kiss it, little one.\" You murmur, then lift your finger and turn back to the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who wants to go next? I still need some little volunteers!\" You offer, and a few raise their hands. You push them down to the ground with one finger, too. You pull them up in a little bundle, all their bodies pressed against each other between all your fingers. Inch-high punies. You bat your tail out from under you, dropping them on the tip.  You dangle it over your pussy, whispering to them \"Don't fall down, my little sweets~ I'll be <b>right back to you after I push some tinies up my butt.</b>\" And so it was. You pinched some of the crowd, briefly lifting your abdomen off the ground and placing them under your rear. You held one buttock apart from the other, then dropped your ass upon them. You repeated this process when you didn't feel all of the naughty little toys fit inside. Eventually, after several more tries, you let that particular tiny be caught underneath your butt cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's next ~\" You click, already pushing down and squishing what remains of the group underneath huge fingers. You pinch them, you drop a couple into your navel and savor their little tickles as they try to crawl out but can't. You wrap a couple up around your nipples, licking them while they work. The soaked tinies blush. Then, you are left with just one last tiny in the group. You pick him up on your pinkie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at you, bug. Smallest little bug in the group. Oh, what am I going to do with you?\" You tease, tossing the tiny boy between your fingers. You peer at his sheer smallness up close to your eye. \"Oh, what's a kitty gotta do to you, little one? Must I <b>push you into my pussy, never to again see the light of day outside of a vagina?</b> Ahhh, that would feel nice. But it's not unique, is it? You look down at your tail. The embarrassments you had told to hang on had long since dropped down into your slit. You felt an increasing pool of sexual fluid pool up to the top of the organ. You might masturbate again soon. \"You need a special little fate, tiny. Something where I can tease you forever. Oh, but I'm just out of ideas. If only you were smaller.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, as if on cue, the tiny wormed around a bit. He poked some device that they had given all the people who you were in charge of. Quickly, you found out that that it was a size regulator. The little boy in your grip slowly dwindled to half his size. \"Ooooh.\" You gasp, half amazed and half teasing. \"You got even tinier and more fragile! What a little dummy, where am I gonna put a dummy like you?\" You said, squeezing his sides. The tinier human felt somehow slightly more dense, but over all lighter. You squeezed the air out of his even tinier lungs, then continued. \"ha ha. That's it, isn't it? Shrink for me, little one. Shrink even smaller for your goddess. <br>\r\nHe obliged, and in a few more seconds, you had an ant of a person in your grip. You fingered your nipples with his even tinier body, feeling just how much bigger they were to him. He could fit inside the tiny openings, and lick up your milk if you forced him to. But instead, you peeled him off the nipple. \"Shrink more. Shrink until you are a speck, then shrink even more for me.\" And soon, you had and even tinier boy sitting on top of your finger. He was barely visible, and you thought that he was probably the tiniest thing you had ever seen. She flicked him up in the air, watching him fall before catching him off to her side. She rolled on top of him now, squishing her tiniest prize in a kiss. Stuck to her lips, to be pressed each time his goddess spoke, while she knew he was there. He let himself shrink smaller, to feel and be more dominated. This was now where he was stuck, and it was...<br>\r\n<b>so embarrassing.</b> A microscopic, insignificant dot stuck between succulent and flirtatious lips, never to escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat and pushed your toes down into the ground, squishing your toe tinies harder and harder each moment. You just had an idea. </span></div></div>",

You are encased in an inky darkness and, with a blink the world changes to a shade of green.  A... very familiar green color... with a large... familiar texture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this grass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking way up you see dozens of gigantic blades of grass, the size of trees, piercing the sky!  Moving around the edge of on blade you even see a giant slab.  A piece of cobblestone walkway!  And it all seems so real!  The birds chirping, the heavy breeze, the mountain sized female and male coming right toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BOOM*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female sandal clad foot strikes the ground, tossing you onto your butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH, TOM!  YOU'RE SO BAD!  LET'S HEAD INSIDE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch awestruck as the two normal sized humans thunder into their normal sized suburbia home leaving the bug sized you unnoticed in their wake.  As the door slams shut, you cannot move for awe at how powerful that woman's foot fall was.  The force of her step and how everything is just so... Real!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit.  I gotta get one of these things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay,\" calls a deep voice from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParting the tree like blades of grass was a pair of giant white paws.  Peeking over the grass and down at you was a \"giant\" anthromorphic mouse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Whoa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, bug-girl?

In fact, with her blushing expression, she almost looked like an old friend of yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there was little time to think about something like that, as the mouse-girl set her hand down, motioning for you to climb aboard.  Eager to get close to her, you run towards her hand and climb aboard.  The mouse girl slowly lifted you to her face, where you could feel her warm breath wash over you.  God, this was an amazing experience, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're the tiniest human I've ever seen!\" the mouse almost squeeled, smiling.  \"What's your name, bug girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andrea Watts.\" you say, completely awe-struck right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you.

So, where would you like to go then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to pause at that.  There was the entire garden to explore, knowing that there would be dangers despite feeling safe in Tina's embrace.  However, you also remembered about those mountainous humans that passed by you earlier, and thusly that made you curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to...\"</span></div></div>",

This naked furry behemoth was sent from the gods!  ...Correction, he WAS a god!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring you in the face was this god's true masculinity.

And it looked a little limp!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the creaking of his giant muscled arm as his free hand drifts down to his bare loins and cups his oh-so-immense sac of tiger seed.  Kneading his soft furry sac, a purr rumbled though his body and his giant member began to rise even higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope this isn't too scary.  I went a little overboard when getting my cock bigger.  It'll look about 40ft tall,\" he said with a deserved pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can handle it,\" you say with a giggle.  \"So, Rich, what do you like to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a broad smile, the giant...</span></div></div>",

After all, this James guy might faint if you show up in a tux. You smile at how cute the guy would look gawking at you. You scratch your six-pack and pull on a nearly skin-tight  T-shirt that displayed your massive chest, shoulders and abs very well. Next you tugged on a loose pair of basketball shorts that fell a little below your knee.  Put some plain white socks on your huge, duck feet as well, before your put your size eleven sneakers on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have about 15 minutes left you note. Checking the time on your work phone before you tuck it into your pocket. Smiling as you imagine tucking a miniaturized man in there along with it.  You open your night stand and grab a pair of small vials containing a pinkish liquid that you use to make your little clients, well. Little. Just one of them could reduce a grown man to just a fraction of his normal height. A thought that made your big, hungry dick stir a bit. You remember to grab your packet of XL condoms as well. You know. Just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your door and head down to room 23, where your client awaited. You get there about ten minutes early, but you don't mind and you're certain the little man won't mind either. You smile to yourself and knock unceremoniously on the door. You hear a man stumble and curse loudly shortly after. Then a rather tall brown haired man opens the door. You can tell that he's in his early to mid- thirties. He looks confused when he looks down at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm looking for a James?\" You smile evilly as it dons on the tall man. \"I'm Daniel.\" The man visibly gulps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm James.

Give or take.\" He's opens the vial and is about to gulp the pink fluid down.\"Wait.

He makes a face of utter disgust. \"Ugh, that stuff tastes awful. Whoah!\" You smile as 6'2\" James starts to finally shrink. Its starts out slowly. He loses an inch here and an inch or two there. His collared shirt starts to slip over his shoulder. He's actually quite skinny you realize with a chuckle. His shrinking accelerates, and he starts losing almost half a foot in height every second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel your hungry member start to harden in your shorts. Making a tent out of the loose fabric. James turn bright red again when he sees it. You smile. He's barely up to your abs now. And he's shrinking fast. With a grin you pick him up effortlessly, squeezing him gently against your mountainous pecs. You feel his weight steadily decreasing as he continues to get smaller. Your picking him up caused his hopelessly over sized slacks to slide off of his cute, tiny ass. He's squirming helplessly out of arousal; as his constant decrease in stature is dragging his little member against the ridges of your abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you can feel his shrinking stop. You sigh contentedly and nuzzle him against your pecs for a little longer. \"Mmmm...You're so little now.\" You smile at him and sit down, cross legged and set him down in your lap. He just gazes up at you, rendered speechless by the rapid change. You can see that his little dick is already drooling precum from its earlier date with your abs. You give it a playful stroke at watch him shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

Dragging his tiny cock across the ridges. You slowly pick up speed, and James' breathing gets faster, and faster as he reaches his climax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daniel...\" he croaks out in between gasps. Shortly after he blows.

Clean that up.\" James is just barely on his feet when you poke his little behind to get him moving. He just grins like an idiot and licks his cum up off your abs.

Might as well oblige the lil' guy he's endured more than enough teasing so he's earned it.

Back to business though. \"Ready to get crushed now tiny man?\" You offer, the little man just gives a meek nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeeding no other provocation, you prod James over with your foot before lifting it high above your shrunken client. You slowly lower your size 11s down, down,down. You start getting horny again as you feel Jamie's skinny, little fragile body under your wide sole. Just a little pressure and his puny bones will snap like twigs. Thepower is the rush you love most, the thought of being able to end a tiny man like that gives you wood. You slowly increase the pressure, gringing the helpless little James into the carpet as he kicks and groans out of fear and arousal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-s-s-so...B-b-b-big.\" Your doll-sized James gasps out.

The little blotch of semen on your sole tells you that the doll-man gasping next to your foot is another satisfied customer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou check your watch. Its only been half and hour and little Jamie paid for the standard two hour session. You sit down indian style to get comfortable. \"Well little Jamie, we have plenty more time together, what do you wanna do now?\"You flash a playful smile as James finlly manages to get back to his feet.

Job opportunities were few and quite far between, but then an ad had shown up for this company, Macrophiles Annonymous. Apparently they specialized in making size related fantasies come true. A handful of these required their employees to be a bit ore unique and so far not many were willing to make that change. New people were needed and you, Billy, took the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the MA labs, you signed some papers and were quickly taken back to a lab. Tests were run, run and re-run until at last they determined their procedure would work. So far, you weren't too certain of this procedure except that you would come out totally different than you went in. It wasn't all too bright a thing, but you needed cash and a life, badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one of the many labs, they had you pretty much ditch your clothes and sit on a lab table. To undergo the end procedure, they needed you to take a pill and shrink like the clients do. For the compatability to be maximized, you had to pick out an animal at a tiny size. It apparently was one part your under-lying psycology and one part the actual animal. The lack of clothes was so that they could do the procedure immediately and because they were being cheap and not giving you enough pill to take the clothes with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lab doctor leaves and you stand on the floor with pill in hand and clothes in a heap next to you. The instant the pill gets down your throat, the world, everything starts to double and triple in size. Pretty quickly your not even 4 feet tall, which put your 10 year old brother at a giant. Soon your looking up at your stack of clothes as a small mountain and at last are a speck on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you figure that an inch is 2000 feet, which means its at least a half mile, and more likely a mile climb just to get on the toe of your shoes sitting right next to you. You could remember your little bro wanting to borrow your shoes and telling him they were too big for him, now his little flip-flops would be measured in miles and your socks could hold a mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's suddenly a loud bang to your right. Quickly you turn to see an enormous cat walking in, its a Lynx, the smallest of the wild felines but you see the titan toes to stretch well over a mile skyward. As it comes in front of you, miles of shadow take away the light, though the view of its padded feet is still enough to fill you with fear. They may be soft to their handlers, clients and little five year olds, but you were just a speck of dirt to be crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next creature was a wolf, warm in the lab's summer-set climent he was panting and nearly drowned you in slobber dripping out of his mouth. He could fill pools with that starting at Olympic size and moving straight up from there. Your tiny feet carried you back as far from the beast as they could to take cover in your socks. The giant noticed and came over to drop a paw on them, and rattle around the steel-strong structure. It came down around you, but luckily you fit between the weave, though now you were cut off from the outside. Try as you might, you couldn't move the girder of clothe. A second later, the world is opened again as the wolf lifts off its paw just slightly lifting the dark clothe with its claws to let you out as it walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to enter, was of all things, a mouse. It just walked from one side of the lab to the other, every step sounding like a bomb going off. You remained under cover, avoiding the powerful creature. A child's pet, it was more like a walking sky scraper on your present scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whole parade of other animals comes through, from birds to chimps to special creatures you cannot even name. After they're all through, you sprout back to normal size and feel like a giant until the doctor returns and takes you through their processes' procedures. It ended with you being in a tube-like encasing on a lab table, the top was open for now and fluids were coming in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor places an oxygen mask over your face and soon your knocked out from a mix of o2 and anesthetic. Your dreams are weird, but then, they always are under this sort of stuff. You feel like a titan, then a piece of dust. One minute your covered in fur, the next your fine. One second your looking up at toes which are the sky and the next your looking down at something in front of your own. Weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last you wake up, you feel entirely different. The chamber thing is gone and your one a normal lab table. You roll off to stand and....</span></div></div>",

You gut is white coming up to just about your neck and your a mix of spots, solid orange/tan and some stripes with a long tail, some sort of lynx mashup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a step, tripped and landed on all fours, your hands turning into feline paws on the way down. As you fell, your body seemed to shrink and it was the perfect size for a Lynx, which was small to start. Your clothes next to the table would never fit now, not remotely. Lynx's had huge feet and yours would never fit the shoes or socks, your jeans would be incredibly tight, if they could be put on at all and the shirt was a bare maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExperimentally, you walk around and find its both easier and more comfortable to go about on all fours, you'll have to work on the digit-centered upright walking later.

This guy's sole advantage over your titan form was that you held back and his little tag thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery once in a while, he sneaks over to the vile of shrinking stuff, which is supposed to be taken in proportion. The last you see of the guy is after his last trip to the shrink stuff. After that he had jumped to the floor and you pounced.

That was the square cubed law or something, the bigger they are the harder they fall, so the opposite should hold true as well, should you tell yourself. You could try climbing down the sheets and to the bottom of the bed but that might take you days to climb down, and you were going to need food and water eventually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully, your employer would send someone when they realize you were missing. Though as you were now you'd be nothing more than the tiniest speck imaginable. You could climb and sit on top of a speck of dust now at your current size. They were like boulders to you. The shrinking seemed to be slowing though, maybe that was a sign you'd at least stop shrinking. Well, if they sent someone, and they saw your empty bed and discarded clothing they could figure out they're looking for someone small, right? You could always hope you didn't get any smaller and wait for rescue, or you could try to get down and move on yourself. Of course, even if you got down from the bed once you got to the floor you'd be a sea of carpet strands that would stretch on high above you like skyscrapers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time to make a decision, you couldn't fret around about this forever.</span></div></div>",

You pace a few feet as you wake up, though you realize that's probably isn't quite the right measurement anymore. What? Maybe a millimeter, if you were lucky. Either way you were preparing for the day, when you heard it, loud deafening footsteps! Though they probably weren't so much loud as you were just rather small when the sound waves hit you. Since shrinking this tiny you had thankfully never strayed to far from the edge of the bed so it didn't take you long to run there on all fours. As you reached the edge you looked out over the edge that was almost an endless abyss, there was a person in your room wearing an MA uniform, though they were unimaginably gargantuan in comparison to you. Up to now you had only interacted with inanimate objects and the tiniest of creatures, it had made you aware of how small you were, but seeing someone normal sized really drove the point home. It was like meeting someone tall enough to have their heads reach up beyond the clouds, large and powerful enough to move entire continents. A single finger taller than the tallest tree in comparison to you. It was almost intimidating to face something so daunting, they were clearly here looking for you, after all you were technically their employee and it made sense they'd be concerned when you didn't show up after your transformation. This person finding you was probably your only chance of ever getting back to your normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at the same time once they found you then you'd be completely at their mercy, you can't exactly outrun them, and they could easily pin you down with no effort using nothing more than their pinky.

I would certainly be a little more rough than your current life, but it was doable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you could just be paranoid, they're professionals, and surely they'd be able to help you get big again but without some help they might not even see you.</span></div></div>",

You run around on the edge of the bed screaming, yowling, waving your arms and jumping up and down trying to get the man's attention. It seems hopeless, like a flea hoping to attract attention from halfway across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the man seems to be looking for you, and being rather meticulous about it. Either by luck or through his diligence he eventually finds you, peering down at you he blinks a few times as if unsure if the tiny speck on the bed is you. You shout and try to grab hid attention but he doesn't seem to hear you your voice just won't carry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he produces a pair of tweezers, you back up a bit nervous at this but not before he expertly snags you up lifting you into the air by your tail. He then opens a small jar and drops you inside screwing the lid shut. The jar wasn't much bigger than a jar of peanutbutter but there was plenty of room for you. You watched through the glass as he left your house and placed your jar in the passenger seat of his car as he drove you back to MA Labs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the labs you were eventually placed in in a small Petri dish, the edge of it being a wall impossible for you to ever climb. The techs in the lab spent some time hooking up a strange machine next to the dish and then finally spoke to you. They explained the device was a microphone designed to pick up your voice so you could have a conversation. Apparently, when you never showed up to work they had been worried and sent someone looking for you. It seemed like your body had a reaction to the transformation causing the shrinking. They could work on looking for a way to reverse it if you didn't mind them running test on you, but there was always the risk of another reaction. An alternative, if you didn't want to risk shrinking further they mentioned having a new Jon your small stature would suit you for.</span></div></div>",

The next several days that follow after this seem to last a lifetime as numerous test are done on you by the techs at MA Labs trying to find what caused you to shrink so small in the first place and how to fix it. Some of them are basic things such as measuring your height and weight, some were more tricky like trying to get a sample of your blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor that they had to actually shrink down one of their own agents to be no bigger than an insect just so they could get a decent look at you. it was unnerving to have this man who was no bigger than an insect pick you up and hold you in the palm of his hand as if you weighed nothing at all, and truthfully you weren't far off from weighing nothing. He used a very fine needle to poke one of your paws and drew a drop of blood that had to be examined under a microscope in studies. The same tech worked with you over several days. At first it was awkward working with the tiny giant. Like you he was completely naked after being shrunk, the technology they had currently only shrinking organic lifeforms. Unlike you though he had no fur to cover his body and it was just strange to look at the giant pink man that would come and scoop you up each day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several tests, and being poked, prodded, and at least at one point juggled, purely in the interest of scientific pursuit, they had a treatment plan. A serum specifically tailored to your body that should reverse the shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey placed you in a petri dish again and administered one drop of the serum next to you. It was just a single drop from an eye dropper but the tiny droplet was like an Olympic swimming pool to you. Relieved things were finally about to be over you waded into the liquid and waited for the results.</span></div></div>",

For now you decide to ask about this other job opportunity that they have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a bit of time for them to explain the entire thing, but it's pretty basic. Lots of people who have come to MA to act out their various fantasies have been shrunk to all sorts of sizes, many who even as nothing more than a barely visible speck you would tower over. This was something you were aware of, after all before this whole shrinking thing had happened you were originally supposed to play the part of one of the 'giant' animals the shrunken people could play with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat it comes down too is as customers get exceptionally tiny it becomes very hard to keep track of them and actually retrieve them after the session is over. That would be where you come in. At your tiny size you'd be dropped into the fur of whatever animals the client was currently lost in to search for them. You'd be dropped around the genera area they were lost in, and it'd be your job to retrieve the other shrunken people and safely deliver them back into the care of the lab technicians. This of course meant that you wouldn't be returning to normal size ever if you accepted, at least not while still employed. In order to accurately search through the forest of fur that was going to be the larger animals you'd need to be as small as the clients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was also lucky you had also been transformed most of the way into an animal. Some clients were ornery and would have to be dragged back by force, since there was never any guarantee on if they were going to be bigger or smaller than you having a bit of extra feline muscle on you was a plus for the job. Plus, you were probably going to be doing a lot of climbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter listening to the details of the job it seemed like the best deal, it was something that needed to be done, and at your current size that was probably going to be about the only career option you actually had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs part of your new job you were given a terrarium to use as your own personal residence. The thing was far larger than any house would have ever seened for a small glass box. They had given you small scraps of fabric to use for furniture and beds, but for entertainment purposes they didn't exactly have a TV or computer they could plug in and you actually use. Instead, most of the terrarium was covered in plants and vegetation, though you were the only animal in there. This was probably for the best since a single leaf was large enough for you to play a football game on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill on your time off it gave you something to do, things to explore and climb and it was a lot better than boredom. Food and water was provided for you as well, though they were just teeny pellets and droplets of water placed into your home with an eyedropper. Occasionally, small organisms such as dust ites would get in despite the lab's best efforts to keep your home quarantine, and you could amuse yourself hunting down and stalking the creatures. You weren't fond of the taste but it was something to let out your animal instincts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was... a very strange life.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>No, you won't be going back. That's the decision you come too. Being this small, it's not exactly an easy life, but you've proven you can survive over the weekend. Dust mites might not be the tastiest of meal, but it's something you can learn to live on, you don't trust the people from MA, you weren't supposed to shrink again, and who knows maybe this was something that was done on purpose, or maybe it was an accident, Rather it be spite or incompetence, you couldn't risk working with them again, who knows what would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you had come to the conclusion to stay right where you were. You ran for one of the pillows on your bed, planning to climb into the actual pillow case. It took awhile to climb the side of it and swing yourself in but you were certain you wouldn't be found. Eventually, the man in the uniform walked over to your bed, examining the strands of fur, and then peering very closely at your bed and you guessed he had fund the much smaller strands of fur you had shed since shrinking, must have been good eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifted up the pillow with you inside as you desperately tried to cling to the inside of it with your claws. He was looking under the pillow, and without even looking inside dropped it on the floor while he searched your bed. You were thrown around and felt your head spinning as you climbed back to your feet after the pillow hit the ground. Dizzily, you looked around while trying to keep your body low to the ground and stay hidden. Eventually the man shook his head and you heard him say something like<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must have shrunken right out of existence, shoulda tested that formula more.\" He muttered this to himself as he turned and left your roo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you were certain he was gone you climbed out of the pillow case, stepping out between strands of carpet that were as tall as trees in comparison to you. You were alone now, and you'd be alone for the rest of your life, but somehow you knew you were going to be alright. Hidden down here amongst the carpet in a world others would never even know existed you would make a new home. These tree sized carpet strands were your jungle, and it was here you'd hunt, you'd survive, and you'd live out your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears passed and you became an expert, there were more dust mites in a room than you could ever hope to count, prey was never short and most days you found yourself lazing around with a full belly just looking around seeing what you would find. On occasion, you found a rare treat, a crumb of food, which years ago you would have found the idea of tasting a treat but after years of dining on only dust mites, finding an old crumb of a stale cookie was like finding a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, it was glorious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, your home was sold, and other people moved in. The giants never became aware of your presence and you never paid them much heed. At this size you could hide between strands of carpets and never even had to worry about being stepped on. On occasion you'd climb to the top of a strand of carpet to look around and see what you could see. The giants looked so alien, having been a lynx for so long and no contact it felt weird to see humans again, and seeing them so large really made them look like some kind of monster or titans, but ones you had come to love. With the coming of these giants had come new sources of food, fresh crumbs small enough they never even noticed represented a feast to you. This made it where you had to spend less time hunting as you found food, and even gave you something to do, searching the forest of carpet for crumbs because like a treasure hunt, never knowing what you could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a simple life of simple pleasures, you took pride knowing you were able to survive while being so tiny, most people you imagined wouldn't have lasted, but for you, this was now your world, this was your jungle, and you were its king.</span></div></div>",

Turn off the phone, watch a movie or two, drink some wine, fix a nice dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ruminations were interrupted by Natasha - a fellow co-worker - stopping by her cube. Unlike herself, employed in sales and booking, Natasha worked the floor as an Agent - whatever that was. First day on the job, she had backed straight into Natasha's car - a lovingly restored 1957 Chevy. The Chevy took no damage whatsoever while Lex's back bumper fell clean off. It was a start, as they say, of a beautiful friendship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, how did your first week go? She asked, leaning against the filing cabinet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLex spun in her chair. \"Aside from Monday's little encounter, everything's been pretty smooth. The people are friendly, the money is good. The only thing is that I'm still getting used to things around here though.\" She reached over and picked up her coffee cup, taking a long draw before continuing. \"Heck, I'm still not clear on what exactly we do here. It\u2019s some kind of a travel agency, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTasha looked shocked. \"What - you have no idea? You didn\u2019t take the orientation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLex waved dismissively. \"The manager said that he was going to, but got caught up in a meeting or something. He never did get back around to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how have you been selling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that\u2019s easy - I just follow the script and plug the names and numbers into the database. They said they wanted discretion when they hired me, so I cant get much more discrete that this right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha shook her head. \"No, this wont do at all. Come with me,\" she said, grabbing her hand and yanking Lex from the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Where are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have plans this weekend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not really.

So sit back, relax, and realize that we at Star Tech have only the customer's best interests at heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n::Rules::<br>\r\nFor those of you wondering, no you don't have to add to the Macrophile Tell section if you don't want to, you can just add to the story, that's all right too or vise versa.<br>\r\nThere are no restrictions or limits on what you can add in the story or Tell sections. I make no minimum length or type restrictions, as this is supposed to be a story for Macrophilia in general so there is nothing that you are not allowed to do. Please add wherever you like. Don't be afraid, and remember, if you add to me, I'll add to you.</td>",
