            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jim groaned as he woke, his head felt like it was filled with cotton. As he sat up, the 20-year-old rubbed his head and tried to remember what happened. He\u2019d been hired to baby sit for Mrs. Martens, watching her 16-year-old daughter Jess, her 6-year-old daughter Milly, and 3-year-old son Nile for the weekend while their mother was away at a business conference in the city.<br>\r\nJim had baby sat for them a fairly often in the past, since he himself was 16. He was mostly called in now for the younger kids, but this time he was also supposed to make sure that Jess stayed home and studied since she was failing one of her classes in school and her mother wanted her ready for the finals next week. He especially needed to keep an eye out for her boyfriend incase those two tried sneaking around together while Mrs. Martens was gone.<br>\r\nAs for the other kids, Milly was already off on summer vacation. She was recovering from a minor summer cold, so she hadn\u2019t been allowed to go to a sleepover with her friends this weekend; plus, her mom didn\u2019t want her at someone else\u2019s house while she wasn\u2019t nearby. The girl was a bit of a tom boy sometimes, but she still liked playing with dolls and things. Jim had always found her to be a bit weird.<br>\r\nThe final child under his care this weekend was little Nile. He was the only one Jim actually liked. He was fairly quiet for a baby and he slept well when put down for a nap. He did still have to wear diapers, especially at night since he had little control of his bladder or bowels. The worst part was that he had a tendency to put his favorite toys and small bugs in his diaper for safe keeping, and then forgetting about them. It was always a surprise when changing him.<br>\r\nStarting to think about the last thing he remembered, Jim recalled sitting on the couch and quietly watching tv after arriving this morning. The girls were still asleep, and Nile seemed to be content to doze a bit longer in his crib. So, Jim had some free time to relax and eat other people\u2019s food while he watched tv and texted one of his girlfriends. <br>\r\nAt one point, Jim had started to feel a bit strange. He\u2019d signed off with his girlfriend wondering if he should go to the bathroom, when the feeling suddenly got worse. Running to the bathroom, Jim lifted the toilet seat and hunched over, wondering if he was going to be sick. As he stared into the clear water below, the feeling just kept getting worse and worse, making his vision blurry, until he finally blacked out. <br>\r\nJim looked around as the memories came back to him. he seemed to be sitting on some kind of purple rubber plain. There was a curved edge on one side and a big pit on the other. Crawling towards the pit, Jim saw a huge pool of water down below that was help within white walls. Getting a sinking feeling of recognition, Jim glanced around at the rest of his surroundings. <br>\r\nTowering walls covered in blue wallpaper with green outlines of fish. A white ceiling that was as high as the sky with a simple light fixture that shown like the sun. behind where Jim lay on what he was starting to realize was Milly\u2019s training toilet seat on the adult toilet, he saw the shower curtain that matched the walls with its blue base, it\u2019s fishes much more colorful. The sink soared above his view as a porcelain monument. He was still in the bathroom! And he couldn\u2019t have been more than 3in tall!!!<br>\r\nJust then, Jim heard footsteps out in the hall, someone was coming, someone BIG!!! Jim cowered on the rubber training seat, still laid out on his belly with his head overlooking the bowl. He wasn\u2019t sure what the right move here was. Did he want to be found and maybe get help but also risk being tortured by the girls that honestly didn\u2019t like him very much. Or should he hide and wait for their mother to get back, even if that was a few days from now since it was still Saturday, and she wasn\u2019t due back till Monday night. <br>\r\nJim heard the steps stop right outside the bathroom door, and he swore he could see the knob starting to turn. He had to react!!!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The door song open and Jess walked in. she wore nothing but a night shirt that barely reached her mid-hips. Jim knew that she was a beautiful young woman, but having baby sat her since she was 12 and known her for even longer, he couldn\u2019t really see her in a sexual light; really it was more like looking at his little sister and just grossed him out to think of her that way. And seeing her black thong peeking out of the bottom of her butt cheeks as the edge of her nightshirt flared in her movements far up above, Jim really didn\u2019t need to see that.<br>\r\nThen she reached up while facing away from Jim and pushed her night shirt up so that she could hook her thumbs into the thin waist of her thong. Jim watched as that little peak of black fabric from the bottom of the bubbly cheeks started to grow as more and more was pulled from between the round globes. Finally, it was all free and she bent to slide the tight garment down past her knees.<br>\r\nIt was at that moment that Jim snapped back to attention and realized he needed to stop gawking and start yelling! He didn\u2019t know how she would react to seeing him like this, but he needed help. But just as Jim was about to stand and call out to the giantess, he felt a familiar wave of nausea wash over him, keeping him from moving as he watched Jess hike up her night shirt and start to ben over.<br>\r\nThe twin moons of flesh got bigger and bigger as Jess bent to sit down. Whether that was simply because they were getting closer or because Jim felt himself shrinking smaller again, he didn\u2019t know. The nausea stopped just before her cheeks slammed down onto the rubber raining seat, Jim firmly squashed between her right cheek and the purple surface with only his head free to watch the events taking place within the bowl.<br>\r\nPain. That was Jim\u2019s first thought. Absolute pain of having a 3-ton giantess sit on his now tiny body. His body was spread out under her colossal cheek, every bone and muscle feeling the strain of having her weight come to rest right on top of him. Jim would have screamed in agony had his lungs not had all the air forced out of them when they were practically flattened, all he could do now was cry out in silence, his face screwed up in horrific torture.<br>\r\nThe only thing that was able to distract Jim from the pain, was what Jess did next. There was a distant grumble up above that seemed to quickly grow closer. Then there was a slight hissing sound that Jim couldn\u2019t quite pinpoint. And finally, a deafening blast echoed throughout the white bowl, making Jim\u2019s ears ring, just before the smell hit him. <br>\r\nIt was rancid! How could a pretty teenage girl have such fowl farts? It reeked of beans and rice and meat; maybe she had Mexican last night. Just as Jim was done hacking at the last one, another came shooting out of the girl, and another, each one more horrible than the last. He heard her grunt a few times, and then she pressed down harder on the toilet seat as if she were preparing for something. <br>\r\nThen Jim heard something new, instead of a blast like a cannon, this sounded like a wet crackle and it was much more prolonged. Squinting through the darkness of the sealed bowl, Jim saw something dark starting to peak its way out from between Jess\u2019s cheeks. Little by little, it steadily grew longer. Jim caught a whiff of the thing and gaged, if the farts had been bad, this thing was a horror show just waiting t happen. Jim tried to wriggle away, but he was completely immobile under the cheek, all he could do was shack his head in useless denial.<br>\r\nAnd then the log broke away and fell to the clear waters below, splashing a few droplets upwards, a couple making it up to hit across Jim\u2019s face. After a second to let things die down, Jess started to grunt again, and soon another dark form slid its way out of her cheeks before splashing down in the now tainted waters. <br>\r\nLog after log was sent tumbling down into the waters below, the pile quickly growing. Jim was witness to it all, being splashed each time by worse and worse liquid as he struggled to breath, his nose feeling as though it was starting to curl up and die in the face of all this stink. But eventually, the dumping cam to an end, a few farts to punctuate the last of it. All was silent, for a bout three seconds before a stream of high-powered yellow began to gush out of the giantess, hitting the filthy waters and sending a constant misty spray back up to Jim. He wasn\u2019t even surprised at this point.<br>\r\nThe pee finally died down, and it seemed that Jess was FINALLY done. Jim felt her shift up above him, the muscles clenching and preparing for the giantess\u2019s next move.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You are a guy named Jim who has been shrunk down to less than 3in tall through a curse that was placed on you by a shrink witch how has her own sense of justice and doesn\u2019t like guys like Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As the name of the story suggests, no body knows what\u2019s happened to you. If someone does find you they will think that you are a bug, toy, or some other object that they have a need for and that your current size fits (I don\u2019t want to see the tiny being mistaken for things that he couldn\u2019t possible be like clothing or something, he\u2019s 3in tall or less. And he doesn\u2019t stretch). But you do size shift. You always stay less than 3in, but you will shrink and grow at random, or at the convenience of the curse, within that size range. You can become as small as a dust mite (though I would rather that doesn\u2019t last too long, but I\u2019m still ok with it)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only one who will recognize you is the one who cast the curse and the one person who you have wronged the most, though who that may be may not be clear to you at first of the person you would think. (and no, it\u2019s not the witch, she hasn\u2019t even met you. she only knows you by your reputation as a player)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The rules: </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) This story is set in the real world so there can be both guys and girls, but don\u2019t linger on one gender or the other unless Jim is trapped in a girls-locker room or in a guy\u2019s frat house or something. (but I prefer guys, so I do encourage that)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2)The tiny DOES NOT DIE!!! I always hate it when writers kill off the tiny, it cuts off the story and ends any future fun that could be had. So, keep him alive. Jim, while he can be hurt -a lot- can\u2019t be seriously injured. He can get some bad bruising, maybe some ear damage, a little burning from hot shower, but nothing more. And any injuries he does get are healed up pretty quickly; the worse the injury, the faster it heals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) And always, ALWAYS, leave a second choice for the story line. I don\u2019t want any one option continuations. Even is you can\u2019t think of anything, just add a \u201cread\u2019s choice\u201d or something. Make sure the reader always has an option of what they want to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) Also, don\u2019t do anything crazy with the story. No suddenly throwing in aliens or making giants smash through buildings. This is a story about a guy who shrank, and nobody recognizes him or notices him. he stays under 3in tall, he can\u2019t be killed, and the world he lives in is just like ours (nobody knows that magic\u2019s possible except the witch and her grandmother)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) Also, Vore is fully allowed. The tiny can even go through the digestion prosses if you want. But please keep it somewhat realistic. I don\u2019t want the tiny being able to pick and choose where he ends up, no exploring the giant\u2019s innards. He is a solid piece of food that didn\u2019t get digested properly, so he will most likely wind up leaving out the backdoor, but, if you really want to, you can have him go to the bladder instead and get peed out. Just remembered, vore is indorsed 100%, and since the tiny is indestructible, don\u2019t be afraid to chew on him a little. Maybe even mistake him as a piece of gum and play with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6) And bear in mind, throughout all of this, Jim is NOT enjoying himself. This is meant to be a curse to torture and punish him for being a player and dating multiple women at once without their knowledge and pretending to be a good guy. While there may be times when the situation isn\u2019t so bad compared to the other things Jim has been put through, he will not like a single second of it. Even when he\u2019s stuck to a girl\u2019s body, he will not enjoy it as he thought he would thanks to his size turning everything into a monstrous landscape of pain and disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7) Oh, and one last thing, any child in the story, under the age of 14, will not be involved in any sex or similar acts. They can partake in innocent fun or be unaware of what\u2019s going on, but NO SEX. And that\u2019s final.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, enjoy the story and when you add, be creative and don\u2019t be afraid to use unusual giant body parts like armpits and belly buttons and fingers, heck even the inside of a person\u2019s elbow. And remember, have fun torturing little Jim; he deserves it, mostly.<br>\r\n</td>",
