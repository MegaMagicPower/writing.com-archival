It was tough being a homeless orphan, why didn't she go somewhere? Because no where felt safe. Orphanages were run down and she wasn't really sure where else to try. Thus she turned to begging. It worked decently she often got enough change to get at least a little something to eat. She had long brown hair and green eyes, short at 4'6 and wear tattered blue jeans and a black turtle neck long sleeve shirt. She also had a light jacket which didn't help much. Thankfully her luck was about to change. The snow fell like a flurry, when just moments ago it was hardly even noticable. A woman in a white robe stood before her. Her face was pale and her eyes had a dark blue glow to them, oddly enough blue butterflies flew around her, how? Especially in the middle of winter. \"I do not have money to gave you...\" The woman's voice was motherly, like she was about to embrace Karen. \"However...I require a vassal.\" Karen was silent, the butterflies were hypontic, she couldn't speak for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like to take over?\" Karen asked now afraid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" The woman paused. \"To...\" Her pause was longer this time and she seemed lost in thought. \"Hmmm how to put this. I require a body, that of a female to fuse with, I will not be taking over your body nor will I be a voice in your head, I need your body to rest in, to recover my energy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By taking mine?\" Karen asked feeling oddly at peace with this woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, think of it as curling up in a bed and falling asleep. I will gain energy through your emotions, the stronger they are the more I will recover and at a faster pace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happens when you recover?\" Karen asked tilting her head still oddly at peace, normally she'd be freaking out or calling this woman crazy and even the snow wasn't bothering her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall gain my true form and you my dear...will evolve to something better than human. For now though I request you take my hand. She offered her hand. \"You'll never be cold again, nor will you be hungry or thirsty.\" That was enough for Karen, even if she wasn't under this woman's spell she'd have taken it, also being as young as she was, she didn't think twice. Taking her hand the woman vanished. Karen thought she had just dreamed it until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n((Note: Due to her age Karen's clothing <b>WILL</b> grow with her.)) </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Annabel had it rough, really rough, as a child she was abandon on the streets of London, even the homeless population seemed to detest her, or maybe that was just her 13 year old mindset, school wasn't easy when she struggled to even look like a decent student. She did have a saving grace however. Another girl, Mei. Mei was  older, in high school actually, likely around 17 or 18 she and her parents came from Japan. Their meeting was...interesting to say the least. It was a dark stormy night, and the rain was coming down hard, Annabel had no where to get out of the rain. Suddenly as if she were an angel Mei was just standing there in a nearby streetlight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark haired, tall, long legged, brown eyed Asian seemed so regal, almost as if she were some kind of Empress in her walk. Annabel was awestruck as Mei approached. \"Here you go.\" Mei held an umbrella using it to cover Annabel. \"It rains a lot here doesn't it?\" She said as she took Annabel's hand. \"Listen, you must be hungry and cold. Each day come to this address and you'll be fed and clothed, ok?\" With that Mei just left walking into the darkness humming softly. Annabel could have sworn that the rain just seemed to part for her, but she was tired that night so she dismissed it as her imagination. That night she actually slept under the umbrella, and oddly, no one took it from her. She was up against a brick wall, the rain pelted her only cover, as if attracted only to it. The wind too, never changing direction. It was like a shield. Others would have taken it from her. Yet, no one did. She didn't understand why but she was thankful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince then Mei had just been giving and giving. The address was her house which almost put Buckingham Palace to shame. Meal after meal Annabel was given, three a day, dry clothing, and anything else she needed. Oddly though it was as if Mei knew everything about her, what she needed when she was coming, where she would be. Mei was often dressed in black leather pants and a pink top that left her arms and shoulders bare. Her hair was tied in a ponytail as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day however Mei came to Annabel after school. Despite the two going to different schools Mei even seemed to know EXACTLY when Annabel would leave. \"Anna?\" Mei asked in her gentle angelic tone. \"Would you mind doing me a favor?\" It was a rather sunny day and once again Annabel felt like she was looking at an angel, the sun seemed to make Mei look radiant, maybe even with some kind of aura, Annabel rubbed her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Annabel realized she'd been staring. \"I don't know what I could do given my situation however.\"<br>\r\nMei shook her head and took Annabel's hand pulling her. It felt like walking with a big sister in a way as Mei took Annabel to a rather dark alleyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been having...problems.\" Mei said with a grin. Annabel wasn't sure why she was grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, it's complicated but my family is...odd, to put it lightly. They're sadistic, and Personally I hate it.\" Mei took a step forward. \"As a friend-\" Mei reached into a bag and pulled out a can of soda which Annabel downed quickly loving every second of it. \"I need you to come with me, support me in this time of need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would I- I mean I will gladly do so after all you've done Mei I just don't quite get it.\" Annabel did want to help Mei but she wasn't sure how. Suddenly she doubled over in pain. Mei smiled at this. \"Just let it flow through you Annabel.\" Mei whispered into her ear. \"All that pain, all who made fun of you, all the times you were beaten, you feel it...don't you, now, crush them all Mei, let that pain be your strength.\" Annabel screamed then, the pain was gone, however something had changed. She was taller, much taller, at least 5 meters. (About 16ft) Mei had vanished yet her voice seemed to echo in Annabel's mind. \"The more they try to harm you, the more you shall grow. Become the embodiment of pain my dear Annabel, and don't worry we shall meet again.\" Annabel felt an intense amount of strength rush through her. She slammed her fist into a nearby building shattering it. It hurt her but this only gave her another meter (Almost 20ft now.) Annabel was an amazon, maybe a bit more. Yet she wasn't hurt. She smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to...\" She looked herself over. The 13 year old girl hadn't even noticed that her tattered clothing had changed and that wasn't all. She ran to a nearby park her footfalls making soft 'boom' sounds as she did. The park had a large lake which Annabel used as a mirror. She was now even with the street lamps. Looked like she really kept in shape, not muscular but fit for sure. She Her usually messy and unkempt brown hair had become purple, short and straight with bangs that ended midway to her forehead. A pink hoodie, and long brown pants that reached her ankles with cute pink sandals that added 3cm (An inch) to her height. \"Wow...\" She whispered. For a moment Annabel couldn't help but admire herself. How this happened, why, she had guesses but at the moment she didn't care. She felt...angry, angry at the world and she wanted it to pay for hurting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would hurt me before makes me grow huh?\" She chuckled. \"Well then I could always go to Mei's house. Or maybe I should be bigger first, then again...What did Mei want? Did she go home, Maybe I can help her now?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The only thing that's kept her going these years was her wooden flute she's had as a memento of her parents. Every time she'd play it, something magical would happen. Lucetta would feel more energy surging through her being, her long blonde hair gaining a bit of vibrance and her skin becoming just a tad healthier. It also brought her just enough fortune to buy her food in desperate times. She kept her flute with her everywhere she went, trusting it more than anything else. It was as if it knew exactly what her desires were and became her one and only family member. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a regular day out in the streets and Lucetta was about to play her flute in hopes that a passerby might give her something or food might turn up. Feeling hopeful, Lucetta began her tune of light notes and cheerful melodies. At first, nothing happened but a few passers by admiring the sound of her song, maybe a few dollars here and there. She played on in hopes of enough to buy herself a meal, a few more dollars came. When Lucetta came to the end of her song, she looked down at the change. It was usually enough to buy her a piece of bread and water, but today, it wasn't. Lucetta took the change and began to walk off, but in the middle of doing so, she was dazed. When she regained consciousness, Lucetta realized she wasn't on the street anymore. Well, she was, but vastly different. Flute in hand, Lucetta was hundreds of feet tall, towering over the place she called 'home'. She noticed the skyscrapers in the distance and looked down to see tiny houses at her bare, ragged feet. The holes in her clothes and her messy hair had remained, she was just bigger. A whole lot bigger. Taking her first step, Lucetta smashed a house under her sole 'Whoops! Sorry! I didn't mean to!' She cried. Then she realized. She was at the top now. No more poor, homeless Lucetta. She was at the top. She could do whatever she wanted...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in light of this, Lucetta decided to...</span></div></div>",

This is mostly because she's Several times the size of an average one, at 95  feet tall with C Cup breasts, . A freak growth spell not long after her fourteenth birthday had her gaining 60  feet in height, in just a matter of hours. Clothes were torn, news got out, reporters swarmed, and poor Nicole was left splattered across every tabloid in the country, completely naked and utterly humiliated. So it's no question as to why she has no confidence, and avoids people, is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince her 14th birthday Nicole has been still growing at an accelerated rate far greater than most living things putting on an extra 32 Feet in  just over a year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, being this size means that things have to be specially made for her. Which requires specialist workers to visit her, measure her to extraneous detail,  and install whatever they built for her at a later date. Thankfully, they let her dress herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, all of these things come at a cost, and while her living expenses are mostly funded by the government, poor Nicole is practically treated like a zoo animal, with press, researchers, tradesmen, tourists and even politicians stopping by for 'visits'.

For the first time in their life the five men, members of a rival tribe of the east of the kingdom will see the mysterious, mighty ruler of the behated country. Nothing could have prepared them for what was about to happen to them. Nearly completed their adjustment of the sudden light they saw the colorful curtain and expected it to move but not this kind of movement. As it lifted they prepared to see the royal cabin of the duchess but instead it revealed a mighty foot attached to a leg that went up in the shadow of the dress. the other foot appeared at the edge of the fabrik of the royal dress and dipped up and down. Her feet where clad in shoes of blackened leather. It seems that more than a dozen cows had to give their skin just for one shoe. The rather thick sole have been made of wood by the most skilled carpenters in the kingdom just as the manhigh heel. Silver and diamonds raised the value of this footwork into regions the barbaric convicts in front of it could not even measure. They just stared in awe at it because they knew that even one of them would wage the worth of a whole village of theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mischievous laugh released them from their awe and made them look further up the fabrik as they now knew that the dutchess was right in front of them.

With no visible effort she lifted up the whole collonne of men tied together. The men screamed in agony as each of their shoulders and legs where sharing the weight of the men next to him.

She squeezed until he was not able to breath anymore and his body was on the limit of its durability. \"Do you can imagine how many bones I can break? How easily I could rip you appart?\" With that her other hand grabbed the ankle of the man in her grasp and with a lazy motion she turned the whole leg around, braking his knee and hipbone as much as tearing appart dozens of muscles. The man could barely breath and only hissed from pain but this was just the beginning as she bend the lower leg upwards until it broke at the knee. She didn't stop there until his toes touched his twisted hip.

Slowly. Part by part. Limb by limb.\" One of the other man groaned in pain. \"Shut up while i am talking\", yelled at him. With aggressive motion she grabbed the man and pulled him from the collone, leaving his leg and arm dangle at the chain while his heart poured hot blood over her hands. She was carefull not to spoil her dress as her hands wrapped around him.

His bones shifted before they shattered and punctured multiple organs as he became more flat by every passing second. She took her time and saviored the horrified looks of the men next to him as she knew what kind of sight this must be to him. Snap after Snap, Crack after crack her foot made her way to the ground. He died before her sole touched the sand but even then he was still screaming. With one sudden, loud crack it was over and his skull burst just shortly after his ribcage. An explosion of blood erupted from beneath her and colored his neighbor crimson red with warm gore. The dutchess kept a smile on her face the whole time, even as she noticed that some of her folks turned away from the gruesome display of power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still have a chance to talk.

She again waited a few seconds as her sole hovered above her next victim. Blood dropping on his already soaked body. \"Are you wiser? will you talk or do I have to exterminate ALL of you to get peace for my people? Believe me that the King won't mind getting rid of you.\" Slowly her shoe lowered again. </span></div></div>",

Well, sadly this is what Chihiro or as many call her, Chihirozilla had to do. Chihiro is 10 years old, and has brown hair and rosy cheeks. She has a childlish appearance, and a quite pudgy face. She also has tan skin like Chihiro from the movie Spirited Away, and she has brown eyes as well. Sadly, for her circumstances, she always wears a orange bikini (two-piece), which always exposes most of her body. She also has D-Cup breast surpisngly, and for the reason you are about to see explains all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, her father was a researcher in kaiju DNA, and it was originally meant to be used as weapons for war, where they can make giant monsters controlled by the government. He had a wife, who gave birth to the girl Chihiro, however she was diagonised with a rare disease that would have killed Chihiro as a baby. The father had to take drastic measures in order to save his newborn daughter, so he injected kaiju DNA inside of her. Surprisingly to them, Chihiro survived, however though, she changes in a colossal way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst of all. Chihiro grew to extraordinary heights just as she got older, to eventually standing at a massive 180ft tall, the size of an average showa monster from the Godzilla series. However, that's not all it did to her. She also had instant body regernation, so her wounds restore instantly if she suffers. Her vocal cords were enhanced, letting her roar like an actual giant monster. She can also breathe underwater, has high invulernability to many weapons, and can even shoot laser beams out of her eyes from her eyes. Explaining her breast expansion, well the DNA did do some strange things to her,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegarding her life though, well, it was another story, The government over the years made her clothes that would fit with her, but often times Chihiro is seen wearing an orange bikini. She currently lives in the fictional Diamond City (a mixture of Tokyo, and New York City, with soem Miami in it.) She lived their her whole life. She lives on a private island nearby, with has everything she needs to live there. She is also a great person in Diamond City. She plays with the kids alot, she helps out the city like with demoltion works, and she does plenty of other things. She is a blessing to have there. Chihiro is homeschooled, but still, she is a nice and caring girl. She would also use her powers to defend the city when a threat comes along. There is more to her character... but one thing for sure... She is a kaiju.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote: The people like her so much, that they name her Chihirozilla, and she likes that name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1050792?tags=ogino_chihiro\" target=\"_blank\">http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1050792?...</a> (an example on how I based the character Chihiro's appearances from)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWant to use her?</span></div></div>",

You have had to heard them everything in our houses is toppling over.........\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once again absolute nonsense have any of you seen this supposed monster?\" He bellowed <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no not really....\" Said one eyewitness <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then there's really nothing to worry about.........Oh My Goodness what-what's that?\" He screamed dropping his mike as the others on the platform scattered in fear as the new set of tremors started up and people turned and screamed sone even tried running for their lives as the huge shadow appeared over the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the giant young ten year old with the pink swimsuit looking completely bizarre even for that time period and utterly terrifying height this was both the craziest and yet most fasincating thing she had ever done <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee I'm so nervous!\" She thought all giddy and nerves shot \"I never shown myself in front of a group of people before......not since the accident I wonder what they'll think of me will they be afraid or accept me for who I really am......\" But the words had barely got out of her mouth when she heard multiple screams coming from below and looked down <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhhhhhhh Runnnnnnnnnnn! It....it's a monster!\" The people screamed and ran for it at once Chi panicked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wait please I mean no harm...Oops......\" She cried as she tried carefully running after them she tripped over one of those really old fashioned parked cars and fell over luckily nobody was seriously injured as she got back up trying to explain her actions \"No really don't run I mean you no harm! My name's Chihirozilla but you can call me Chi for short....hey please stop running!\" She pleaded as she tried reaching down and picking up a few of the fleeing crowd but they slipped through her big enough fingers \"Oh shoot they're far too afraid of me now what do I do?\" She grumbled miserably to herself.............</span></div></div>",

As I walk across the sand I see the water rising up due to the Moon's gravity, then coming back down to meet the ocean. As I walk further the tides grow larger, I'm guessing because the Moon's gravity is stronger there. Anyway, I'm thinking I should introduce myself. My name is Kari Sirius Aquila, I know, it's a funny name. Unlike to dominant species of this planet, I am not fully human. 1/4 of my DNA belongs to humans, while the rest belongs to the PODs who live 320,000,000,000 miles away from here, at the Iridius galaxy, which is made of the Red Hypergiant. Perhaps I should go deeper into my history, I know you're confused. I was born at the planet Acex, in the Iridius galaxy with my 32,000 brothers and sisters. As a POD, my job was to venture off to a planet, and unify it with Acex. It might sound a bit parasitic, but it's just how we live. I was sent here to do that exact thing, and I've been living in secrecy, all the while blending into this planet's strange culture. I even got a job, writing  I had gotten good at many thing. Basketball, Volleyball, Saxophone, Cheer, and a special thing they called video game, which was where most of my talent enlisted. I was born with special abilities that were put into a pill, I would need them when trying to unify Earth because of our history of failing at unifying planets, although it hardly happens. But today I was especially happy, because today I was only 12 years into my eternal life, but tomorrow, I would be...13! Old enough to finally receive that special pill to unify this planet with Acex, and I was even more excited because then Earth would get to see our home and our culture. But in that special pill, were some very strange powers, and that was why I had waited for this very moment, which was tomorrow! I happily walked over to my gyrosphere, which was a rounder, better, and less expensive version of what you humans would call a...car. I drove over to my apartment in Irvine, which was a beautiful city. I got out and walked in, I opened the door to my apartment and seeing that there were so many things I had to do to prepare for this special outcome, I quickly rushed while drinking an energy drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStep #1: I had to take a bath. I'm not going to tell you how that went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStep #2: I had to research Earth's form of defenses. I found very interesting things and devised a strategy using my ability knowledge and these sites I was looking at. When I was finished, if things went too dirty. It might not look so well for Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStep #3: Adjust my presentation to the planet: I used my variety of dresses and beauty abilities that were not taken from me to develop a presentation. I thought about once I had reached the form I would use, I should use my ability to shine in front of others. Or I could to that, and light fire works for a better display. Oh, well. I'd figure it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStep #4: Explain their current situation: I'd have to explain the situation to them without alarming them. This was the hard part. In our history every planet unified has had it's species running away. With the unifier trying to calm everybody down. I've talked to my baby brothers and soothed them so many times whenever I visited my home planet, but this was 7.3 billion older people. But I assured myself I had an ability that could help me...I might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStep #5: Get ready to use force: I quickly got myself ready for any bad situation. Ready to use my abilities to thwart any of their attempts to stop me. Although I almost broke a window. But  didn't, so I'm okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStep #6: Get myself to have a little fun: I could do that by myself. I'm really good at having fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStep #7: Get ready for any other galactic visitors: Who knows who other invaders could be coming, so it's my job to get ready for any other invaders just in case they try to do anything stupid. And in the meantime have fun, and get the humans on my side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStep #8: Keep myself energized: I have to learn how to use any abilities I have to keep myself energized. Such as using the sun's energy, which could power this planet for a year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStep #9: Rest: You know what that means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting myself ready for the big day. I check the clock: It's 5:39 p.m. I take my shoes off and get in my bed to sleep. I exhausted myself so much, not even the energy drink could stop me from passing out. I sleep for 2 hours until I see a bright green light. I think I'm dreaming, but I realise I'm not! It's my brother Kai, coming to send a message.He's wearing a light suit, and he's shrunken himself to the size of a chess piece. \"Hey, sis!\" He says. \"I'm just coming to remind you that tomorrow's the day when you're supposed to unify this...weird planet. I even shrunk myself so I wouldn't get noticed.\" \"Yeah, like that would help.\" I say, giggling. \"And, why are you sleeping? You should be getting ready.\" He replies. \"I have. And you chose the right time to come.\" I reply. \"Really?\" He asks. \"No.\" I reply. \"Something in your room stinks. Should I look for it?\" He asks. \"No, It's just my feet in my socks, which have been running around all day.\" I reply. \"Well, do you want me to fix them?\" He asks getting my attention for a second. </span></div></div>",

Who knows what weapons these guys have with them? If I'm just focusing on the air? Who know what could happen to me on the ground? Surely I could have some help with that, considering my feet do stink, bad impression. And even if there weren't any ground troops (which there probably will be), I'd just be teasing and having fun with my tiny bro. \"Okay sure, go for it.\" I say, looking at him and smiling. \"Um...okay.\" He says, nervous, he caught on quickly. He walks to the top of my covers and goes through. He comes back up and says, \"Are you playing a trick on me?\" He asks. \"Maybe, or maybe not.\" I reply. \"Okay, whatever trick you have planned for me, I'm ready for it.\" He says, ducking back down. \"I hope he means that.\" I whisper to myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai's POV(First Person):<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI duck back down through my sister's covers and crawl down, looking for her feet. I know she's going to play a trick on me, but I'm ready for it. Most Likely she's going to take the sock off with me in it and trap me there, or something else. But  have a few strategies and I can hope for the best. I crawl over and hit a soft surface. Maybe a blanket. I try and throw it across, but it won't budge. \"Hey, Stop!\" Kari says. I turn a light on my suit on and see her foot, but it's encased in a giant cloth. \"Um, sis, you foot's covered in something.\" I say. \"What? It's a sock. You've seen me wearing them.\" She replies. \"No I haven't\" I reply. I make my was up to this thing's mouth, and crawl through it. \"Okay, where this thing making your feet stink?\" I ask. \"At the sole.\" She replies. \"Okay.\" I say as I crawl to the sole. Suddenly I feel her foot moving, then I feel my body push into the ground and further into her foot, which does smell. She's trying to crush me. \"How does that feel?\" She asks. \"Moist, soft, and a bit painful.\" I reply. \"Okay.\" She says, taking her sock off. I knew it. She turns it over and I fall into the deep pit of her shoe. Dang It! I didn't know it. She then puts her foot through it, and begins to crush me again, only a lot more painful. \"OKAY STOP STOP STOP STOP STOP!\" I yell. \"Okay, fine.\" She says giggling as she takes her foot off of me. \"How did that feel?\" She asks holding me in her hand. \"Very painful.\" I reply. \"Good! And a bit bad. Sorry. But now I'm actually ready!\" She says. \"Anyway, I've got to get some sleep. Bye...\" She says as she falls asleep. \"Okay, bye, bye, bye.\" I says trying to get free from her grasp. I can't so I just stay with her. Her sleeping face is as beautiful as always.</span></div></div>",

While I'm asleep, I notice I'm holding onto something. It feels like rubber, and skin. Oh well, It's probably one of those things I feel in a dream, and I drift back off to sleep. I have a dream though. I'm right where I am, but when I look out side, it's...my home planet! It looks as beautiful as it did the last time I visited it. The color-changing sky, the trees and plants everywhere, even in midair and upside down, the buildings, floating, and in all directions, and what surprised me even more, was that Earth and it's inhabitants were there! I had finished the job! I was so happy I rushed out of my apartment room, then the main door, then...stepped on a few hundred. I was big or they were small. Even still, our atmosphere regenerates anything that was deconstructed. I was so happy I danced around, stepping on more, they reconstructed a few miles over from me. I jumped, then fell on my apartment floor. I had been sleepwalking. \"Are you a lunambulist?\" Kai asks, pointing at the door, which the moonlight was shining through. \"Oh, no. Just thinking about the day ahead that's all.\" I reply. I look at the clock, which was ringing. 12:00a.m. \"WOOHOO!\" I exclaim. \"Well, happy b-day Kari!\" Kai says, realizing I rushed out the door. He follows me. I run outside, Kai looks on a GPS and says. \"Over there!\" He points to a large green comet flying towards, Japan. Kai takes my hand, presses a button, and his suit transforms into a rocket, with me in it! \"Hold on!\" My brother says as we ride over to she location of the comet. We land in Kyoto, not Tokyo. We walk over to the comet, which is actually a case. I press on it, it reads my fingerprint, and opens. I see a pill, a note, a tube like generator, and a bunch of syringes. I read the note, it says, \"Sorry, we mistook Kyoto for Tokyo. Meh, from what we've seen it will be less ordinary. Anyway, take the syringes in the order below, use the generator, then take the pill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanx, Anonymous People. :D<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe note says: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed: Clothes<br>\r\nYellow: Belly <br>\r\nGreen: Both Feet(and don't smell them after)<br>\r\nBlue: Near Eyes<br>\r\nGenerator: Belly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy, those elders sure are good at making notes.\" Kai says. I use the syringes, then the generator, and finally, the moment of truth, when I was finally able to take the pill. \"Oh jeez.\" Kai says, backing away. \"Let's go into that cave before you do.\" Kai says. \"Okay.\" I say, I run into the cave. And take the pill, then a really good feeling blindsides me. A red glow radiates around me, as yellow orange energy generates around me, then, I begin to grow. My clothes stretch out to fit me (thanks red syringe)it would be real embarrassing if I didn't use it, I walk outside the cave, growing steadily, and towering above the other buildings, I dive into the ocean to avoid being seen. It creates a mini-tsunami, that (thankfully) doesn't hit land. \"Okay, I'm going back now...\" Kai says as he transforms into a rocket again and goes back home. \"SEE YOU SOON! BUT NOT THAT SOON!\" He yells. He can only imagine what's going to happen at noontime. </span></div></div>",

The citizens of Kyoto, Japan are happily moving around, minding their own business, as of the rest of the world. In fact, any of their departments of security are slow, as is news. Little do they know that their days were all about to get a lot stranger, wackier, zanier, and much more hectic. Meanwhile, at Kotobikihama Beach (Harp-Playing Beach in English) more resident of Kyoto were happily minding their own business, wandering around, surfing, doing other water things, when all of a sudden, when things didn't look like they could get any better, or worse, somebody sees gigantic bubbles coming out of the water and popping. \"\u4f55\uff1f \u305d\u308c\u3089\u306f\u4f55\u3067\u3059\u304b\uff1f\uff01\" He asks. \"\u79c1\u306f\u77e5\u3089\u306a\u3044\u3088\u3002\u591a\u5206\u3061\u3087\u3046\u3069\u9be8\u3084\u5927\u304d\u306a\u9b5a\u3002\" Another one replies. Then, the unexpected happens. Water shoots out of the oean up to 52,800 feet high. The Japanese can do nothing but stare in awe. People dared to take their gadgets out and take pictures, but when the water leaves, they see a girl, except she's 52,800 yards tall, and they had no idea she could grow larger, her clothes fit her, which is surprising, they would have just snapped apart at 15 feet, and she's shining. Suddenly, every single eye on the world that's looking at a TV or streaming sevice was tuned to Japan, on this mysterious girl. \"HELLO!\" She booms at what seems to her is anormal voice, but it produces a shockwave, pushing everything away a bit, and breaking every single piece of glass. She then takes a deep breath, and says. \"THIS MIGHT BE A BIT OF A SUPRISE TO EVERYBODY DOWN THERE! BUT, I ASSURE YOU I CAN EXPLAIN THE SITUATION!\" She says giggling. \"Every person of pilotics around the world are either sitting at a table, or on an e-conference. Then, President Putin says. \"Okay, America, what have you done now?\" \"Nothing.\" President Maroon Obama says. \"Was It Merkel?\" \"Okay let's stop playing the blame game. Right now there is a girl, 52,800 yards high, we don't know what she can do, and she's at a beach in my country.\" Japanese Prime Minister, Shinz\u014d Abe says. \"Okay, but we need a military strategy.\" Putin says. \"How surprising. You're the first guy to say that.\" President Obama says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKari's POV(First Person):<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rize from my slumber, energized and ready to do some unifying. I look down, my clothes are looking a lot more red, yellow orangre, electrical, one pieced and shiny.<br>\r\n\"HELLO!\" I say.  \"THIS MIGHT BE A BIT OF A SUPRISE TO EVERYBODY DOWN THERE! BUT, I ASSURE YOU I CAN EXPLAIN THE SITUATION!\" I say giggling.<br>\r\n\"ALRIGHT! SO, WHAT GOING ON IS THAT I'M NOT REALLY FROM THIS PLANET. AND WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO IS NOT DESTROY, BUT UNIFY THIS PLANET WITH MINE!\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorld Leaders POV(Third Person):<br>\r\n\"Wait, did she just say...\" President Obama says. \"Okay, deploying all military forces.\" Putin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Kari(First Person):<br>\r\n\"ALRIGHT, NOW LET ME JUST...OH.\" I say. The Japanese people look down and she another tsunami, heading straight for them. <br>\r\n\"\u3042\u3042\u795e\uff01\" One says as the others run away, it's no use, they get washed up by the gigantic wave, and are pulled in toward me. I try to save them by picking them up from the ocean, I kneel down and...yes! I've got them! I slowly put them back, and proceed to...fight the militaries. Oh Boy. I look up, bomber planes, and down ground troops, that'll be easy. I duck and catch a bomb from one of the planes, and drop it down on the soldiers, part of them are obliterated. I do that another time, but they keep coming. I lift my foot, encased in a small heel. The soldiers shoot at it. But I can still bring it down with ease on them. I quickly lift it up, they're still alive, but paralyzed. Yes! There's more shooting, but once their bullets hit my skin, I easily absorb them, and for some reason it makes me a bit more powerful, I slowly grab the soldiers and drop them into my endless pockets fueled by black holes. A bunch of tanks come forward, I take the top off of one, but that seems less fun to me. I mean I have to have fun or I'll get bored. I raise my foot, and put it down on the tanks. The people are still paralyzed, not dead. I walk forward to deal with the bombers, there's one particularly fast one, but I'll deal with it later, then big bombs repeadetly drop on me and I decide to...</span></div></div>",

Once they fall, I catch them in my hands, I can feel them explode in my hands, but its more of a vibrating sense. I open them and see rather than scrap metal, a giant, blue, static ball. And a blue spot signals on my suit, in the center, I put it in the slot, and I feel an energizing sense in me. A then feel like in about to burp as the fast and powerful bomber cones toward me, perfect. I let it out, and rather than a burp, it's a burst of yellow energy, it hits the bomber, releasing all of it's bombs, which look like super-charged pills, I grab them and shove them in my mouth. I then feel another energizing feeling. I begin to run, stepping over panicking people along the way, and grabbing ones on building, stuffing them in my pocket, energizing me, stepping on ground troops and tanks, energizing me, and that's when I feel it. I make my foot glow a yellow orange, twist it upward so the bottom toe part faces me a little, then stomp on the ground, causing an extremely powerful shockwave on the ground, creating an earthquake, and another tsunami. Yes! Perfect chance! I head over to the tallest building I can find as it probably hold it's leader...I assume. I walk over to it, look through the window, wave the people inside hello, then I give the building a big...hug. I accidentally shake the building a little though. I look back through, the people looked a bit spooked. \"Sorry.\" I say. I realize if I'm going to get any luck with this, I shouldn't just be staying in Japan and beating them into submission,  should go look for the world's leaders and try to find them. \"Hm.\" I think to myself. \"Where would those little guys by hiding?\" I use a GPS embedded in my mind by the suit to look for every possible place they'd be. I find to really good places, but I can't decide. After a few seconds of walking around and accidentally stepping on stuff (sorry) I decide upon...</span></div></div>",

I figure it's a smart choice since I announced I'm an Alien, and that's where they take care of all their alien stuff. I look down at Japan, some buildings are in ruins, some still standing, water everywhere, people running, others on the ground, paralyzed. I decide to take one last big step. I raise my foot, then I saw a little man, staring at my boot. I move my foot over to him and nudge his head a little with my toe, encased in the shoe, then I put my foot down, paralyzing millions, destroying  some cars and buildings (sorry), and creating another shock wave. \"WELL, THANKS FOR NOT FREAKING OUT TOO MUCH, BUT I'VE GOT TO GO FIND SOMEONE. BYE! I'LL SEE YOU ONCE MY WORK IS DONE!\" I say in a regular voice (from my perspective). I make an Anti-Gravity signal from my head, and suddenly begin to float off the ground, as everyone else does, Then rockets in my boot accelerate syncing with my Anti-Gravity, and I fly off to the U.S. everybody else falls onto the ground. As I fly above the clouds, I can see outer space, Its stars, sun and...a few missles flying toward me. They launched some missles at me! I try and dodge them, but they're tracking me, I keep dodging them until I eventually give up and let them hit me. Nothing bad happens, and I become more energized again. I look below the clouds and see a city with a familiar looking tall one. The Empire State Building, Bingo, New York City! I slowly landed on the beach, my feet landing in the water. They hardly take up any space. \"You know, I could do with a lot larger than this.\" I say. I begin to grow larger. Once I'm done, I'm 128,000 feet tall, my foot size is a 5,280. Some more bombers, I ignore them and let them drop bombs on me. I grow more powerful with every one. I tiptoe onto the city, trying not to destroy any buildings. I step on some people, but they're still only paralyzed. I have a little fun with all the ground troops trying to stop me. Now they're using bioweapons. I playfully lift my foot and rip the top off of a tank, then step on dozens of others, and hundereds of other soldiers. It seems really fun to me, but maybe not for the soldiers. I look up any news feeds on the computer in my suit on Area 51, and see this guy named Putin giving a speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorld Leader's POV(Third Person): \"In order to stop these large scale invasions from destroying Earth, we have to go deeper, we must kill the weed at it's root. Destroy the invader's home planet, any the planets of any other invaders!\" Putin says. \"Mister Putin, I'm sure this girl has a logical reason...\" Obama says. \"No, the Japanese Prime Minister says. \"She attacked a city and threatened to enslave us all! We must stop her!\" He says. \"Okay,\" Putin says. \"Are you ready?\" He asks. \"Yes, let's press it.\" The Japanses Prime Minister says. All of them press a button saying, \"EXTREME MILITARY FORCE.\" Upon being pressed the button switches off all lights, and blocks Kari's feed. Little did they know that they had just sealed part of humanity's fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKari's POV(First Person): Earth wants to destroy me and my home planet. Impossible. How can they kill me right now? Clearly none of their attacks are working. And how are they supposed to get to the Iridius galaxy, they'd all die at the Andromeda Galaxy! Oh well, I guess it's time to give humanity a piece of my mind. If anybody read my strategy, let's just say I warned them. My emotions become a mix of Joy, and Anger. My hair begin to light fire a bit. \"SO, YOU GUYS DOWN HERE ARE THINKING ABOUT DESTROYING ME AND MY HOME PLANET? WELL, YOU CLEARLY SEE HOW YOUR LITTLE PLAN IS WORKING NOW.\" I say, smiling and maintaining my cool. I look at all the planes circling around me like flies and grab them. I shove them into the bottomless pocket in my suit, they all fall into a large vortex of who know what. I look around to check and see there's no more planes, which, there are, but the ground surprises me the most. It's overflowing with tanks and soldiers. \"HEE HEE HEE, HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!\" I begin to laugh at the sight, I raise my foot in my boot and press a button, rockets engage as I wave them bye bye, The boot rockets off my large foot, and crashes into the ground, as vaccums in my boot suck up the paralyzed survivors, ready to be crushed when I put it back on. More troops came. \"YOU ALL JUST KEEP COMING AND COMING AND COMING. OH WELL MORE OR ME.\" I taunt as I step onto land and put my foot down as a huge barrier, the troops were forced to do nothing but fire at a gigantic foor encased in a bright red sock. I then lower my sole down, trapping the retreating soldiers below my gigantic foot. I move it around to gride them into it. They pass through the fabric, and into my big bare foot, I use an ability I have, absorbtion, the soldiers end up being encsed by my man skin cells, and pulled into my foot. Speaking f which, with the sun beaming on me, me absorbing it's energy into my body, powering up and energizing it, I realize I've got all the time in the Multi-Verse and decide to have some fun...</span></div></div>",

I walk across the street, ignoring the bombs being dropped on me that were doing nothing but powering me up and energizing me, obliviously using my ability to create a huge shockwave when I stepped, as I walked I trapped thousands of soldiers in my foot, only for them to be pulled in by the trillions of skin cells on it. \"THIS IS GOING TO BE AS EFFORTLESS AS ANYTHING ELSE I'VE DONE ON THIS PLANET.\" I say to the microns below. I feel the bombs I swallowed earlier in my belly, and I decide to mix that with some of the energy I'm using. Genius. As soon as I do that, blue energy begins to generate around my bell button, and a huge wormhole appears in place of it. I giggle as I suck in tens of thousands of troops, bombers, and other things with it, in the process only making me more energized and stronger. I use my Anti-Gravity ability to lift everything that's not attached to the ground off of it, leaving only me to grab the tiny specks, and absorb them into my body. As I raise my foot over another group of soldiers they begin to smell the odor, but then, they pass out. I realize, the syringe made my foot odor poison gas. \"OKAY, THAT'S A LITTLE WIERD FOR A POWER, BUT I'LL MOVE ON. I'VE GOT A LOT MORE THINGS TO DO.\" I say. I lift my right foot up, and my shoe comes back to the suit, I do the same with my left foot. I get ready to grow even bigger, and I do. I become 250,000 feet tall, my shoe size becoming a terrifying 128,000 yards tall! I'm about to playfully step on a city when I realize...there are people down there. I use my Anti-Gravity to pick them all up, then I step down and absorb all of the soldiers, I lower the, back down, minimum damage thankfully. I repeat this a few times until I finally make it to Area 51 in Nevada. And the world's army is ready for me when I arrive. I see black, would-be gigantic tanks, high class drones and bombers circling around me, and tens of millions of ground troops. I then decide to \"burp\" I hold my mouth, then when the aircrafts get close I unleash a gigantic streak on electricity on them, bringing every single one in my path down. The tanks begin firing at me, but I'm able to use a big force field, reflecting their shots at them and still energizing me. Then, I take my turn and stomp on the ground, creating a shockwave and destroying all their weapons. Then, a garage opens, I see 6 people in big suits come out. They've been grown too, but not even close to where I'm at. They begin firing at me with a series of weapons, one making me a bit tired , I let out a yawn, but tears come out of my eyes when I yawn, and instead of a few tears, a big waterfall comes our of my eyes, washing the troops down, once I look down, I realize, all of my foes have been defeated, I see flags from all countries, that means...I've won. There's nothing stopping me from unifying this tiny planet now! \"WOOHOO!\" I exclaim in triumph, as I begin to dance. I begin to realize that they don't really deserve to die, so I revive them, but with no weapons (DUH). I decide I should go ahead and celebrate. But how? One thing I enjoyed was using foot toys, but where would I get one of those at this size? Or maybe I should use a human. I don't know, but it was beginning to be confusing...could humans, if under the right circumstances, be foot toys? A little science experiment for me...</span></div></div>",

I think of it as a little trophy to celebrate my victory over the humans, and I'll be able to have a little fun, with someone other than my brothers and sisters for instance. And If they prove to be fun, maybe I'll be able to create some on my home planet, and share them with my relatives. I look down and walk around, looking for a human, that I'd be able to put my foot on without killing at this size. No luck, /I'm about to decide upon shrinking down a little, when I see one of the elite soldiers made bigger to fight me on their own. I smile and wave a friendly wave. \"Hey there, mind taking a trip with me for a bit?\" I ask. \"Oh dear god NO!\" I can hear him say as he tries to run away. I'm effortlessly able to walk to him and pick his tiny self up. He's a dark brown skinned man, with a cute face, and a very tall body. \"Oh come on, it won't be so bad. And you look cute by the way.\" I say, trying to comfort him. \"I'm just performing a little experiment that's all...and being a little mischievous.\" I say, pressing the button realizing my shoe from my foot. I put it down and slowly lower him into the boot. I press a button causing the sole to heat up. \"The sole is made of memory foam, you'll be comfy in there, I promise.\" I tell him, I'm not sure if it'll be comfy to him or not, I don't know how human nerves work. I put my foot in and begin walking over to the spot where I'd need to use the tool unifying this planet with mine. I can instantly feel him squirming and moving. He feels good to me and is instantly fun already! I guess my experiment worked. I walk over until a light beeps on my chest, I reached the spot. I feel the human getting up above my toes. I have a little more fun and wiggle my toes around, playfully hitting and rubbing him with them. I decide I should let him out, I've done enough. I take him out of my shoe and put him back down on the ground. I should have. I've got some more work to do...</span></div></div>",

At first, the people and students were afraid of her, but then they quickly warm up to her, and she became a close friend to everyone as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer height cause. Well, let's just say that Kari Nemia had a strange disorder when she was born. She was diagonised with a strange disorder in herself, and as she grew older, so did she, and in a massive way. Eventually the city around her adjusted to her, and even the school was expanded to let her learn with the kids as the massive student. At her current age, she stands at a massive 150ft tall. They are kids that call her Karizilla, but she doesn't mind it. She is a kind heart, and loves to be with her friends and learn. She is always careful, smart, cheerful, but can be pretty shy at times, mostly do to her height. She wishes she can be normal size like others, but for now, this is what she has to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20111231010055/digimon/images/1/11/Kari_Kamiya_t.gif\" target=\"_blank\">http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20111...</a> (I just like this child imagine alot)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWant to use her?</span></div></div>",

What's the twist you ask? Hopefully a different character set using characters seldom used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1&gt; Giantesses ONLY NO MALE GIANTS<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2&gt; NO Scat, toilet stuff or the like<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3&gt; NO Forced or Forced Sudden Endings<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4&gt; Leave AS MANY STORY-LINE Options Open AS POSSIBLE<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 &gt; Girl X Girl Or Girl X Guy is fine! NO Guy X Guy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6 &gt; I Reserve the right to add to/edit/modify the above rules or ANY Additions to the story<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7&gt; Continuous or Endless growth is allowable! If chosen KEEP THE STORY GOING AND DO NOT END IT! If the giantess outgrows solar system/universe she will simply grow into another ( Think Multi-Verse type scenario )<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7B&gt; In Endless growth Scenario Giantess can ONLY Be hurt/Killed by bigger giantess and the growth MUST Somehow transfer to another Giantess or Female thus continuing/beginning the story line again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n** Edit 10/4/13 **<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'll be editing and removing some chapters here and there! I hadn't realized I'd forgotten to be descriptive enough for what I was looking for in this story so..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEXTRA Guidelines:<br>\r\nPlease keep the story Preferably Gentle or Gentle and mischievous day to day life with a giantess type deal with the Giantess having either <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1&gt; Been born that way in some mysterious way ( Disease, experiment etc. Use your imagination )<br>\r\n2&gt; Becomes a giantess thru unusual or rarely used means ( Unique experimentation ideas, Aliens/UFO Caused it, Contracts disease alien on non alien disease, someones wish gone awry etc. again use your imagination ) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdit 12/20/15:<br>\r\nPlease Please Please people no crazy Kaiju/Monster girl or Alien Girl stuff unless the girl in question looks 90% or more human and you don't go overboard on crazy powers this isn't Girlzilla here and the focus should be on her size, looks, personality , thoughts/reactions to her size etc. the rest to me serves as a distraction and there's plenty o other stories out there for it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdit: 2/5/18 <br>\r\nI\u2019ll be adding an \u201calt stories\u201d option somewhere <br>\r\nin which size stories, movies, episodes of shows/cartoons/anime <br>\r\ncan play out slightly different or ideally have an alternative ending or keep ongoing from what happened in cannon <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It exceeded her college fund<br>\r\nfortunately Nancy had offered up her excess funds seeing<br>\r\nas Nancy the eldest had went the cheaper route<br>\r\nof community college for beauty school.<br>\r\nShe did hair, makeup and nails. She wasn\u2019t famous but<br>\r\nshe did okay before meeting her husband a doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa had also made the mature selfless choice to<br>\r\nkick her college fund over to Sarah on of all things<br>\r\nthe promise that any future doctor care Lisa needed would<br>\r\nbe free on her so long as her studies and training<br>\r\nwould allow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir brother Chris on the other hand was<br>\r\ngoing the entertainment route studying music<br>\r\nand acting. He didn\u2019t plan to be super famous<br>\r\nbut he did have reasonable ambition and goals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Lisa she was the oddball of the family in some<br>\r\nways. It was her living situation that was unique.<br>\r\nShe lived alone at age 14 in her family\u2019s house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family just couldn\u2019t bring themselves to give it up.<br>\r\nNow of course some ground rules were set for <br>\r\nLisa. Fortunately the Porter\u2019s neighbors had been<br>\r\nmostly good folk and offered to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Peterson\u2019s and the Mossfield\u2019s would help with<br>\r\nsome yard work, check in on Lisa and small stuff like that.<br>\r\nonly Tina Peterson the bitchy teen next door had a problem with Lisa. She bullied her and excluded her from her clique.<br>\r\nTina could never understand how they could allow a<br>\r\n14 year old to live alone especially one so<br>\r\nfashionably challenged, nerdy, short and plain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately Dr. John Peterson had also volunteered to be<br>\r\nLisa\u2019s primary care physician.<br>\r\nHe had been friends with her parents for a fair number of years and owed them in a few ways including some bets<br>\r\nhe lost but fully intended to make good on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne such lost bet was that Lisa was gonna be<br>\r\nborn Lennord. Needless to say both John and<br>\r\nTimothy were shocked when Lisa was born.<br>\r\nChris wasn\u2019t exactly thrilled to have yet another girl<br>\r\nin the house either being the only boy besides his dad.<br>\r\nAt that age for Chris it was like <br>\r\n\u201cYuck more cooties\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Porters lived in a small often unheard of<br>\r\ncommunity. <br>\r\nLittle Ridge, New York.</span></div></div>",

She shivered again, and rubbed at <br>\r\nher eyes with her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa\u2019s eyes snapped open.<br>\r\nShe looked at her hand, then at her surroundings. <br>\r\nShe was in a small, white-painted room<br>\r\ndecorated with glass-door cabinets <br>\r\nand anatomical charts and pictures.<br>\r\nA thin white sheet was pulled over her. <br>\r\nLisa peered under the sheet and found she was only dressed in a thin hospital gown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You\u2019re awake,\" a voice said. She looked toward the voice and saw a man looking around the door frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey, doc,\" he called. \"She\u2019s awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa felt her throat.<br>\r\nHer memory was a blur but she remembered<br>\r\nfeeling like she was choking on something before she<br>\r\npassed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a realization hit her as a woman<br>\r\ndressed in a sweatsuit and a white <br>\r\ndoctor\u2019s coat strode into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2019m Doctor Sparago,\" she began. <br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re in the Gailton Medical Center. <br>\r\nCan you tell me your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I umm I\u2019m not sure\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feared as much\u201d sighed the doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know your age or remember anything at all\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm I\u2019m not sure. I think I\u2019m 14 and I vaguely remember<br>\r\nbeing in the dark in pain then waking up here\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs we feared. You have a mild concussion<br>\r\nbut you also seem to have amnesia\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you hurt still anywhere?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah my head\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s to be expected.

She also noted how cute and handsome<br>\r\nhe was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noted his features Framed by straight <br>\r\ndark brown hair, his face was <br>\r\nregular save for a nose that looked just <br>\r\none size too large. His brown eyes were <br>\r\nwarm, sharp and intelligent. <br>\r\nHis body was slim yet build in a shapeless<br>\r\nplaid shirt and chinos that bore the muddy <br>\r\nevidence of a recent mishap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked like a geek or nerd had fused with<br>\r\nPrince Charming and a football jock.<br>\r\nHe seemed only a few years older than herself.<br>\r\nHe followed her eyes and looked down <br>\r\nat the dirt and stains on his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight this young lad here helped save you\u201d<br>\r\nsaid the doctor<br>\r\n\u201cIf you ask me he\u2019s a real fox. If it weren\u2019t for<br>\r\nthe age differences between you two I\u2019d <br>\r\ntotally suggest you date him after this ordeal\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both blushed this time then he introduced<br>\r\nhimself. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Michael. Michael Gail. Sorry that we aren\u2019t<br>\r\nmeeting under better circumstances\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway darling I\u2019m afraid to say you were in a<br>\r\nterrible traffic accident\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved to shake her hand.<br>\r\nLisa didn\u2019t pull her hand out of his grasp. <br>\r\nHis hands were large and warm, <br>\r\nlike his eyes.<br>\r\n She found herself momentarily <br>\r\nforgetting the frightening experience <br>\r\nshe had\u2014how long ago was it? Or her current one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t wanna admit it but there was something<br>\r\nabout him even tho they had just met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What time is it?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It\u2019s just after nine,\" Michael answered. <br>\r\nHis voice was deep and musical. <br>\r\nShe blinked and smiled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for helping me,\" she said. Michael nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You\u2019re welcome. It\u2019s not every day I get a <br>\r\nchance to help a pretty girl on the road.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked at his hand holding hers, <br>\r\nthen up at his face. His features were <br>\r\nhandsome, his expression open and honest. <br>\r\nHe was very attractive, she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was she thinking. He\u2019s older, they just met<br>\r\nand despite that Baka\u2019s compliment she knew<br>\r\nshe wasn\u2019t what boys would consider<br>\r\n\u201cattractive\u201d<br>\r\nIt was an empty meaningless lie of a compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem,\" Dr. Sparago suddenly said. <br>\r\nBoth Lisa and Michael  looked at her,<br>\r\nMichael releasing  Lisa\u2019s hand.<br>\r\nBoth teens blushed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you were lucky,\" the doctor said shortly. <br>\r\n\"Good thing Romeo here found you and<br>\r\ngot you here fast! Aside from your apparent amnesia<br>\r\nand the minor head injury  I detect no other injury. I don\u2019t think you need to go remain in the hospital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa. realized her clothes and belongings <br>\r\nwere nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your clothes were soaked,\" Sparago said, <br>\r\nanticipating her next question. <br>\r\nShe gestured to Michael. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Gail here has already spoken to <br>\r\nthe police about the accident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told them where it was,\" Michael  added. <br>\r\n\"They said they would come to see you <br>\r\nin the morning after you regained consciousness\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been out for a few days.<br>\r\nIt\u2019s Tuesday in case you were wondering.<br>\r\nWe imagine that someone might be looking for you<br>\r\nalas with your amnesia and the fact that the bus you<br>\r\nwere on exploded and the occupants being tricky<br>\r\nto identify you and Mr Gail have a tricky road ahead\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the Sheriff popped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh I see the patient is awake.<br>\r\nI\u2019ll keep my promise to wait to talk to her but<br>\r\nseeing as she can\u2019t remain in the hospital <br>\r\nand we have neither a shelter, orphanage or<br>\r\nChild Services nearby I think Mr Carter should take<br>\r\ncare of her for now\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey just because she\u2019s cute doesn\u2019t mean I<br>\r\nKnow how to take care of a kid!<br>\r\nBesides  I was going to offer that anyway<br>\r\nfor a day or 2 at my family\u2019s vacation house\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat kid comment stung Lisa for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou stupid jerk! I\u2019m not gonna say thank you\u201d<br>\r\nLisa said with a pout that <br>\r\nMichael oddly found cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine but for that jerk comment<br>\r\nYou can make your own breakfast in the morning\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa the lovebirds already get along well.<br>\r\nI have a strange yet special feeling about you<br>\r\ntwo\u201d said the doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway without taking a jab at your size<br>\r\nor age deary aside from your injuries<br>\r\nif you haven\u2019t already I suggest a follow up with<br>\r\nanother doctor possibly a specialist.<br>\r\nYou appear to be a bit on the petit and I\u2019d be remiss <br>\r\nas a doctor if I weren\u2019t concerned.<br>\r\nYou may be strong willed, and an unusually quick<br>\r\nhealer but that\u2019s still a health concern.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso I\u2019ve detected some unusual hormone<br>\r\nlevels in you that should probably be monitored\u201d</span></div></div>",

Call it intuition and instinct.<br>\r\nMy folks always said I had the best instincts after all<br>\r\nand so far nearly every bet, gamble or risk I\u2019ve<br>\r\ntaken since I was 5 has paid off\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea I still can\u2019t believe you and your<br>\r\nmother actually saved the heir to a Fortune 500<br>\r\ncompany once leading Yinz to a big merger.<br>\r\nI\u2019d ask how rich you are but I don\u2019t wanna come<br>\r\nacross as a gold digger. I despise girls like that\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHnn ha haha\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny jerk? I\u2019m over here being all nice<br>\r\nand you\u2019re laughing at me\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not at you per say. It\u2019s funny but besides<br>\r\nmy gut instincts about you you remind me a lot of<br>\r\nmy mom\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Lisa blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy mom didn\u2019t care about looks, money, status<br>\r\nor how the rich were supposedly supposed to behave.<br>\r\nShe had a certain knack for looking past all of that<br>\r\nseeing the good in people and doing what\u2019s right.<br>\r\nThe people around us especially the rich ones<br>\r\nwould often be shocked by her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa hung on his story with interest<br>\r\nignoring another wave of vertigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne time at the theatre a poor homeless<br>\r\nperson and her child approached. <br>\r\nThe husband and wife that were with my family<br>\r\nwere disgusted then flabbergasted when my mom<br>\r\nhanded them a business card after writing on it<br>\r\nThen handed them, a stack of<br>\r\n20\u2019s and gave the mother her jacket.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another chuckle from Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c3 weeks later the phone rang.<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but listen in.<br>\r\nIronically the same husband wife pair <br>\r\nthat shamed my<br>\r\nmom was there. The woman had<br>\r\nread the note<br>\r\nmy mom wrote on it. She set up a <br>\r\nmeeting with the woman.<br>\r\nI was brought along cause my <br>\r\nmom said she wanted me to learn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDays later that woman was no longer homeless<br>\r\nnor was her daughter.<br>\r\nWithin a month the daughter was in school<br>\r\nmaking friends at  Grove Elementary<br>\r\nand the woman had become the best<br>\r\nfloral assistant mom had ever hired.<br>\r\nYou see mom was an unusually kind <br>\r\nsmall business woman. She was of course<br>\r\nonly a manager when her and dad met but with<br>\r\npops help she lived out 3 dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt may sound odd but she owned a florist shop<br>\r\na full service laundromat and tailor shop in one<br>\r\nand she owned a restaurant in the time spent with<br>\r\ndad. Some tried to call her a gold digger or<br>\r\nas greedy as any rich person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoms response was I\u2019m living out 3 dreams.<br>\r\nLife is about more than money and besides if<br>\r\nI truly wanted money I\u2019d have more than 1 location<br>\r\nof each of my businesses and besides hadn\u2019t you<br>\r\nnoticed the prices at 2 of my shops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people Would usually shut up by that point.<br>\r\nYou see moms laundromat and tailor was<br>\r\nso cheap she was actually losing money but<br>\r\npops didn\u2019t care he was happy to see mom happy<br>\r\nand it had become the busiest tailor and laundromat<br>\r\nin a 50 mile radius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe restaurant wasn\u2019t as bad but again<br>\r\nthe prices were so low she only made about<br>\r\na 1%  profit and she never paid herself<br>\r\na single cent as owner-manager or even when<br>\r\nshe cooked or acted as hostess.<br>\r\nHer tips went straight to the rest of the staff.<br>\r\nBusiness at her restaurant though was boomin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen asked her reasons mom would say her goal<br>\r\nher dreams and her desire were to see and<br>\r\nmake people happy doing the things she loved.<br>\r\nThose things mom loved just so happened to<br>\r\nbe cooking, sewing, crafts, and floral arranging.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was incredulous.<br>\r\nMichael\u2019s mom sounded perfect.<br>\r\nHow could she compare and why did<br>\r\nshe feel she wanted or needed to compare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway Lisa call me crazy but like I said<br>\r\neven after 8 days I see a little of mom in you.<br>\r\nYou may be a bit brash, hot headed and<br>\r\nthe class Tsundere from the anime we\u2019ve both<br>\r\nwatched but deep down you\u2019re kind, good hearted<br>\r\n, strong willed, strong minded, mostly honest<br>\r\nand a survivor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa blushed again.<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m not that great and..and should we really<br>\r\nbe wasting time on story time like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight I almost forgot my new girlfriend has<br>\r\na not so small dilemma\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa blushed<br>\r\n\u201cWh-who said I was your girlfriend idiot?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell do you have any better offers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked shocked.<br>\r\n\u201cW-well I I err uhh\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax I wasn\u2019t expecting a solid answer right<br>\r\naway. Anyway we can hash out our relationship<br>\r\nlater right now I figure as you\u2019ve apparently grown<br>\r\nagain I might have to gift you some new clothes\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked down and realized her clothes<br>\r\nhad finally bit the dust a 1 Foot plus height gain being<br>\r\ntoo much especially as another wave of vertigo hits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael\u2019s eyes bug out a bit but he recovers.<br>\r\nLisa was now eye level with his kneck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI uhh\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax Lisa it\u2019s pretty obvious that your clothes<br>\r\nwon\u2019t fit anymore.<br>\r\nI do however have a suggestion to get you to<br>\r\nthe tailor and store at least tho it <br>\r\nmight be kinda crazy\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked at Michael curious what he was<br>\r\nplanning. He went to the hall and came back<br>\r\nwith a sheet. He came back and made a loose<br>\r\nfitting toga out of it then made some adjustments to<br>\r\na pair of her sandles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTada there we go. It fits and gives you a<br>\r\nbit of growing room on the way to the tailor shop\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait tailor shop?\u201d Lisa questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yea think about. It\u2019s 525 am on <br>\r\na Saturday morning<br>\r\nExactly how many stores are open that you think<br>\r\nwe can just waltz in and magically pick you up<br>\r\nthe right sizes without getting looks or questions<br>\r\nabout your garb.<br>\r\nGranted my idea is to claim we were at a<br>\r\ncostume party last night but I think it best<br>\r\nwe stick to people and places I can trust<br>\r\nand if need be buy their silence\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-you really thought this thru\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey being an heir to a wealthy family<br>\r\nand thrust into being a young CEO requires<br>\r\ngood judgement, quick thinking at times and<br>\r\nbeing smart\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore like being a smart ass\u201d quipped Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr I could let you go nude and let your<br>\r\nnot so little cat out the bag so to speak\u201d<br>\r\nhe countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then let\u2019s go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey hopped into his car Lisa dressed<br>\r\nin sandles and a makeshift toga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride was rushed but mostly quiet.<br>\r\nMichael got on the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Edna it\u2019s Michael Gale I\u2019m sorry to call<br>\r\nso early and I know the shop normally<br>\r\nwouldn\u2019t open til 1030 but I have a situation.<br>\r\nCan you please head to the shop<br>\r\nand come alone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was shocked she could hear the conversation.<br>\r\nShe heard the woman on the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky I just woke up.<br>\r\nDid you tear a whole in your pants again?<br>\r\nOr is this another date gone wrong where<br>\r\nI have to sew some unlucky girls dress or<br>\r\nsomething?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething like that.

It was quite large and it was<br>\r\njoined to a clothing store next to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman in her 40s greeted them.<br>\r\nShe was only slightly taller than Lisa\u2019s current size<br>\r\nbut shorter than Michael.<br>\r\nShe appeared to be Asian or Japanese.<br>\r\nShe had black hair.</span></div></div>",

A soft snoring <br>\r\nreassured her that Michael  was still there.<br>\r\nShe rose slowly so as not to disturb him <br>\r\nand padded softly out of the room, feeling<br>\r\nher way in the dark for the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her hand found the bathroom doorknob<br>\r\n she halted, struck by a sudden thought. <br>\r\nShe turned to face the door. <br>\r\nReaching inside, she found the light switch,<br>\r\nand light flooded out of the room. <br>\r\nLisa choked. She was now as tall as the top<br>\r\nof the door. She looked down at herself <br>\r\nand muffled her soft cry. Her body had <br>\r\nexpanded even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa\u2019s new breasts were still barely A Cups<br>\r\nthough. She wasn\u2019t concerned.<br>\r\nShe actually shared Michael\u2019s Wish from<br>\r\nthe other day that they not become mellons or<br>\r\n\u201cknockers\u201d as he called them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa felt unnaturally clumsy and unsure as<br>\r\nshe entered the room and closed the door.<br>\r\nLisa left the bathroom and walked down the <br>\r\nhallway towards the living room,<br>\r\nmoving slowly. Sure enough, she found <br>\r\nthe edge of her couch in fewer steps than she was accustomed to. She went to the windows<br>\r\nand pulled open the curtains.<br>\r\nIt was just beginning to become light,<br>\r\nand she could see that it was still cloudy <br>\r\noutside. The windowpane was cold and<br>\r\ndamp to the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> It\u2019s still happening. I\u2019m still <br>\r\ngrowing, and growing, and growing. <br>\r\nI must be seven feet tall now. <br>\r\nHow big will I be tonight? <br>\r\nTomorrow morning?<br>\r\nThe day after? <br>\r\nMichael  may get his fifty-foot fantasy girl<br>\r\nafter all.

She covered her<br>\r\nbreasts with her hands, pressing, weighing.<br>\r\nMostly pressing and feeling her budding breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> My adolescent fantasies have come to life, too.<br>\r\nFinally something equivalent to puberty is<br>\r\nhappening to me Lisa Porter of all people.<br>\r\nIt\u2019s nice but yet part of me wants it to stop.<br>\r\nAt this rate I fear it might not tho.  </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa left the curtains open and settled on her couch, <br>\r\nshaking her head as her new weight made its<br>\r\nsprings creak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> Well, Michael, I really hope you do like big girls,<br>\r\n\u2018cause I think I\u2019m becoming the <br>\r\nbiggest girl ever.<br>\r\nI dunno how big I\u2019m going to get if this <br>\r\nkeeps up but I hope you  stick with me.<br>\r\nI hate to admit it to even myself but these 9<br>\r\ndays with you have been so great. </i></span></div></div>",

His features tightening, Michael<br>\r\nflung himself erect, the bedclothes<br>\r\nnearly tripping him. He pulled the bedsheet<br>\r\nloose, wrapped it around himself and<br>\r\nwalked swiftly to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was lighter in the living room,<br>\r\ncourtesy of the partially uncurtained<br>\r\nWindows. Lisa lay across her couch,<br>\r\nlegs trailing off the cushions, hands <br>\r\nnested under her cheek. She looked<br>\r\nvery pretty and cute asleep--a small half-smile <br>\r\ndecorating her features, her hair partially<br>\r\nhiding her ear, the soft sighing of her<br>\r\nbreathing, her bathrobe in charmingly<br>\r\nopen disarray. Michael felt a surge in his<br>\r\naffection and love for her. He bent<br>\r\ndown and gently kissed her on the lips.<br>\r\nHer eyelids fluttered, and he felt her smile<br>\r\nunder his lips. He kissed her again and<br>\r\nher eyes opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" he said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" she replied. She unfolded one<br>\r\nhand and rubbed his stubble and unruly hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look a mess,\" she said impishly. Michael grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afraid so. How did you sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa  sighed. \"Not very well. I kept waking up\u2026\"<br>\r\nHer eyes snapped wide open, and Lisa rose. <br>\r\nAs she stood upright she gasped and<br>\r\ncovered her mouth with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, God!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa had to look down to see Michael fully.<br>\r\nThe top of his head appeared level with <br>\r\nher chin. She looked down at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It\u2019s still happening,\" she cried. \"I\u2019m still growing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa turned and stubbed her toe on<br>\r\nthe leg of the endtable beside the couch.<br>\r\nShe stumbled, hissing in pain, then picked<br>\r\nherself up and limped to her <br>\r\nbedroom, Michael  following.<br>\r\nLisa stopped and bent at the knees<br>\r\nbefore her mirror to view herself in the glass.<br>\r\nA small, frightened sound escaped her lips<br>\r\nas she saw her image--she had expanded so much she almost didn't recognize herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had gone from barely bumps on her chest<br>\r\nto beginners boobs as her schoolmates would<br>\r\ncall girls with A cups.<br>\r\nHer torso had lengthened.<br>\r\nHer legs were impossibly long,<br>\r\nas were her arms. Even her face had<br>\r\nchanged, her jawline longer, her cheeks broader.<br>\r\nHer hands-- Lisa had raised them to her face--<br>\r\nwere longer than before, less dainty with long nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair fell thickly down her front nearly<br>\r\nto her nipples. She saw Michael\u2019s image in one<br>\r\ncorner of the mirror and turned to face him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael, what am I going to do?\"<br>\r\nshe asked plaintively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt kept waking me up during the night.<br>\r\nEvery time I woke up I thought my body<br>\r\ngrowing was a bad dream. Sometimes<br>\r\nI thought I could almost feel the changes<br>\r\nhappening inside me. What am I going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don\u2019t know, Lisa,\" Michael answered.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is happening to you is totally unique.<br>\r\nI-I just don\u2019t know-- I wish I did though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa suddenly gasped and fell to her<br>\r\nhaunches, reaching out to steady herself.<br>\r\nMichael nearly lost his makeshift toga<br>\r\nrushing to her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It\u2019s all right, I\u2019m okay, all right,\" she muttered<br>\r\nafter several deep breaths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, it\u2019s still happening.<br>\r\nLook, I need to get help for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael nodded, gripping her hand <br>\r\nand helping her to a seat on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, who?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can only think of one person to start,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. John Peterson sat at the kitchenette<br>\r\nin his home, dressed in terry<br>\r\npajamas, his breakfast of toast and coffee <br>\r\ncooling before him as he began his usual<br>\r\nSunday routine of losing himself in the<br>\r\nmorning paper.<br>\r\nHe was an early riser thanks in part to<br>\r\nhis chosen<br>\r\nprofession He was about to turn the first<br>\r\npage of his New York Times when <br>\r\none of the two wall-mounted phones in the kitchen rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. John Peterson  looked up. <br>\r\nIt was the patient phone. <br>\r\nHe let it ring the four times necessary<br>\r\nfor the answering machine to activate.<br>\r\nThirty seconds to let the message run, and then the machine began to record.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor Peterson, I need to see you right away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA female voice, young and obviously<br>\r\nfrightened, to judge from the tremulous tones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Lisa, Lisa Porter.\" <br>\r\nMaria and Timothy\u2019s little girl?<br>\r\nA fine couple -- their passing over a year ago<br>\r\nwas a great shame.<br>\r\nShe knows better than to try to make an <br>\r\nappointment on a Sunday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor was so annoyed and still sleepy<br>\r\nthat something had yet to click.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor, I know this is going to sound <br>\r\nimpossible, but I-I\u2019ve been--I was in<br>\r\na traffic accident last week, and ever since<br>\r\nthen I-I\u2019ve been experiencing these growth <br>\r\nspurts. Look--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn left his stool and grabbed up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa? it\u2019s John Peterson\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Doctor, thank God.<br>\r\nPlease let me come to see you today\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLisa are you okay? You\u2019ve been missing for days<br>\r\nand there\u2019s been this strange car at your house<br>\r\na couple times. We even took a missing<br>\r\npersons report out on you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever mind that Call it off! Anyway these<br>\r\ngrowth spurts are more pressing\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this about \u2018growth spurts\u2019?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that when you see me you\u2019ll understand.<br>\r\nCan I come to your office?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked at the clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s about 745am and I\u2019ll let the<br>\r\nPolice know you\u2019ve been located\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood we\u2019ll be right over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled the receiver from his ear as the<br>\r\ndial tone returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear?\" John\u2019s wife, Margaret, in nightgown<br>\r\nand down-at-heel slippers, padded into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Who was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was Lisa she\u2019s no longer missing but<br>\r\napparently she needs a doctor. It sounds urgent.<br>\r\nI\u2019m afraid I have to go into the clinic\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater John  finished knotting his bow tie<br>\r\nwhen he heard the sound of a large car or<br>\r\ntruck pulling into the slim macadam parking<br>\r\narea next to his office. He slipped into his loafers<br>\r\nand tweed jacket and strode to the walkway <br>\r\nconnecting his home and office.<br>\r\nHe turned the latch on the office door and<br>\r\nswitched on the lights.<br>\r\nHe hurried back into the reception desk,<br>\r\npausing when he heard a knock.</span></div></div>",

John turned.<br>\r\n\"Now, Miss Porter, what is--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Porter stopped in mid-sentence <br>\r\nas he looked up at the tallest,<br>\r\nmost statuesque teenager  he had ever seen,<br>\r\nwearing Lisa's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer clothing was unusual-- a bedsheet turned into<br>\r\na makeshift toga. She wore sandals<br>\r\ninstead of shoes, and what looked like two pairs of white socks each on her feet. <br>\r\nBeside her he saw a young man,<br>\r\na stranger, well dressed but unshave<br>\r\nand uncombed, who was holding her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeterson stared, then recovered and cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please excuse me,\" he said. \"I\u2019m afraid I haven\u2019t seen you for a while, Lisa even before you disappeared--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Peterson stopped again, shaking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2019m sorry,\" he blurted. \"I\u2019m--here, step into room two.\"<br>\r\nJohn led the way to Examination Room 2. <br>\r\nHe managed to refrain from looking over<br>\r\nhis shoulder at the couple in his wake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly looked in her folder as<br>\r\nshe ducked under the doorjamb to<br>\r\nenter the examination room.<br>\r\n At Peterson\u2019s gesture she sat on the leather<br>\r\ncouch in its center. She settled herself.<br>\r\nJohn  noticed her toes touched the floor, <br>\r\neven sitting on a four-foot high couch--<br>\r\nand felt for the young man's hand again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn flipped through the<br>\r\nfolder, looked at Lisa, glanced at the young man,<br>\r\nand then looked in the folder again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Growth spurts', you said?\" he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa\u2014please forgive me. I'm afraid you have me at something of a loss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should try it from my end, doctor,\" <br>\r\nshe replied, asperity in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked up, put down the folder, clapped his hands together and threw off his bemusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, young man--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMichael\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMichael please wait outside.\" <br>\r\nMichael  squeezed Lisa's hand<br>\r\nand smiled reassuringly.<br>\r\nPeterson closed the door behind<br>\r\nhim, seized his stethoscope and began<br>\r\nto examine his patient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick check of pulse, temperature<br>\r\nand blood pressure, then Peterson<br>\r\n palpated the glands under her jaw, looked<br>\r\ndown her throat, and into her eyes and ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pressed the stethoscope to her chest<br>\r\nand back, nodding at the result.<br>\r\n\"Please remove your err uhh clothes <br>\r\nand lie down on  the table,\" <br>\r\nhe said, reaching to snap the footrest into place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lisa complied, elbowing herself up as high <br>\r\nas possible on the couch. Peterson  blinked.<br>\r\nEven with her head level with the edge of<br>\r\nthe table, her lower legs still overhung the couch.<br>\r\nShe wore no bra on this visit presumably due to<br>\r\nher small chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cleared his throat again, and continued.<br>\r\n\"Have you been eating all right?<br>\r\nAny illness lately?<br>\r\nThat's fine. Any pain here? Here? Good.<br>\r\nHad any problems sleeping?<br>\r\nAre you exercising at all?<br>\r\nI'm going to remove your footwear here.<br>\r\nWhat, none of your shoes fit? <br>\r\nHmmm. Reflexes are fine. <br>\r\nOkay, you can put your shirt on. Come over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeterson led Lisa to the platform scale in<br>\r\nthe corner of the room.<br>\r\nShe stepped onto the plate,<br>\r\nand he adjusted the weights, cautioning<br>\r\nher to keep still.

Whipping off his coat,<br>\r\n he opened the passenger <br>\r\ndoor for Lisa, leaned inside, and kissed <br>\r\nher briefly while wrapping his coat across<br>\r\nher shoulders. Lisa unfolded her legs and bent nearly double to exit the car, then stood erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe all-too-familiar flutter in her chest staged another comeback as she noted that<br>\r\nMichael\u2019s  head now looked level<br>\r\nwith her adam's apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd think I'd begin to get used to this,\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael  shut the door and turned to face<br>\r\nher. His eyes were just above her chest.<br>\r\nHe peered up at Lisa, waggled his<br>\r\neyebrows and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there are some advantages,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPervert\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTsundere\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIdiot\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy big cutie\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know it\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was dim and much warmer in the<br>\r\nvestibule of the hospital. <br>\r\nMichael walked Lisa into the deserted<br>\r\nspace and looked about for a waiting area<br>\r\nwhen three people, a man and two<br>\r\nwomen, converged on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael and Lisa  looked both curious<br>\r\nat them--they all were dressed in surgical <br>\r\ngowns, hats and masks, and wore gloves <br>\r\non their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miz Porter?\" one of the women asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Doctor Schulman. Doctor Peterson called.<br>\r\nWe are preparing a room for you right away.<br>\r\nIf you'll follow me, we'll see you get set up<br>\r\nand then arrange for the tests Doctor Peterson ordered.\"<br>\r\nLisa was surprised, and showed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease pardon our appearance,\"<br>\r\nSchulman continued as she led Lisa,<br>\r\nMichael  and the other two down the hall towards the elevators. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a precaution. Now, the first thing<br>\r\nwe need to do is get some basic information<br>\r\nfrom you, then we'll start with some<br>\r\nx-rays and bloodwork.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa ducked into the elevator, the <br>\r\nothers following. She noticed that Michael was<br>\r\nlooking stern and even distressed, but she could not immediately fathom why. She also noted that<br>\r\nthe elevator seemed reserved for<br>\r\nthem--the gowned man used a key to operate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long have you had this condition, Miz Porter?\" <br>\r\nDoctor Schulman suddenly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It began earlier this,\" Lisa answered shortly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you feel any weakness? And dizziness?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weakness, no. I've been having dizzy spells, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly one of the side seams of Lisa\u2019s<br>\r\nmakeshift toga gave out. The ripping sound<br>\r\nwas loud in the confines of the elevator.<br>\r\nShe quickly wrapped her arms under her chest in consternation, her face and neck flushing deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Christ,\" the gowned man said,<br>\r\neyes above his mask boggling at Lisa\u2019s visible<br>\r\nchange  as she breathed. <br>\r\nMichael looked even more stern, <br>\r\nthen looked up at Lisa and rubbed her arm for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael clearly didn\u2019t like where this was<br>\r\ngoing and seemed very concerned Lisa noted.</span></div></div>",

Schulman led the way out of<br>\r\nthe lift onto the hospital floor. <br>\r\nLisa saw several signs on the wall opposite<br>\r\nthe elevator bearing boldly printed instructions<br>\r\nto any staff entering the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right over here, Miz Porter, please,\"<br>\r\nDoctor Schulman said, pointing to an open<br>\r\ndoor on the floor. Lisa bent under the doorframe<br>\r\nand entered the room. It contained two beds,<br>\r\nwhich had been butted end-to-end and apparently bolted together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it'll have nice scenery, at least,\" <br>\r\nMichael  mused--some kind soul had the<br>\r\npresence of mind to turn the beds in the room<br>\r\nso that the foot of the bed faced the one  window,<br>\r\nallowing Lisa a view of buildings opposite the hospital and, in the distance, the Hudson River.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Miz Porter, why don't you settle yourself. <br>\r\nKathy, did you get the admittance forms?\"<br>\r\nThe other gowned female produced a<br>\r\nclipboard bearing several pieces of paper<br>\r\nlike a magician. She handed the board and <br>\r\na pen to Lisa. <br>\r\nLisa  did not fail to notice that she<br>\r\nstayed at arm's length and stepped <br>\r\naway once Lisa took the clipboard. <br>\r\nOut of the corner of her eye she noticed<br>\r\nthe amusement in Michael\u2019s  expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please fill these out for us,\" Schulman continued. <br>\r\nLisa  flipped through the forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid I don't have my purse, Doctor,\" <br>\r\nshe said. She felt an attack of vertigo and<br>\r\nswayed slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I guess I didn\u2019t think to bring it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about the section<br>\r\non insurance right now,\" Schulman answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can get that information for us<br>\r\nlater if we need it. Right now you need to<br>\r\nget settled so we can start the tests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if by some hidden cue, Doctor Schulman<br>\r\nand the others spontaneously turned and<br>\r\nexited the room. Lisa peered at the papers on the<br>\r\nclipboard, and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well,\" Michael  said.<br>\r\n\u201cLeading an interesting life is interesting, indeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved quickly to close the door. Lisa dropped the clipboard on the double bed and seated herself, wincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI gotta get out of this tattered thing\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was referring to the torn sheet she\u2019d been wearing.<br>\r\nShe managed to get it off and Michael<br>\r\nogled at her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt good to be free of the restraint of her <br>\r\nmakeshift  clothes, and Lisa rubbed her arms<br>\r\nand belly in appreciation. She straightened and looked<br>\r\ndown. She\u2019d grown so much from the short girl<br>\r\nthat had once been a frequent bully magnet or<br>\r\ntarget of teasing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow short jokes about her would be ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tossed her hair--it had grown down below<br>\r\nher shoulder blades--and pulled her bangs<br>\r\nbehind her ears, then bent over to rub some <br>\r\ncirculation back into her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" she heard Michael\u2019s voice say. She looked up.<br>\r\nMichael stood beside the door, staring at her.<br>\r\nHis eyes were as big as Charlie's had been. <br>\r\nShe turned so that he could not see her front and looked over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPervert\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey you\u2019re the one that disrobed with me<br>\r\nin the room or say I say dis-toga\u2019d\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat joke was lame\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLame but accurate\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBaka\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut your Baka right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHnn I guess so\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa reached out to the hospital gown neatly<br>\r\nfolded atop the bed and shook it <br>\r\nout, thrust her arms into its sleeve holes, then flipped her hair across her front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd think a nurse would have stayed<br>\r\nin here to help me,\" she said. Michael  shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suspect they're drawing lots right now to see who'll be taking care of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am scary, then?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to me,\" he replied, his expression slightly annoyed. <br>\r\nLisa  felt contrite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, help me put this on,\" she gestured. <br>\r\nMichael came up behind her and<br>\r\nbegan to tie the cloth strings dangling<br>\r\nfrom the battens on the gown.<br>\r\nHe tied first the bottom, then the top, <br>\r\nthen he began to rub her back between her <br>\r\nshoulder blades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're cute and a beautiful  person, Lisa,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even now?\" she asked.<br>\r\nMichael  stopped rubbing her back, then slipped both his arms through the gap in her gown and circled her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven now,\" he replied.<br>\r\nHe raised his hands to her breasts and<br>\r\ncaressed them gently, tickling her nipples.<br>\r\nLisa felt herself respond immediately,<br>\r\nher tiny breasts engorging, her nipples<br>\r\nbecoming erect.<br>\r\nShe sucked in a deep breath, <br>\r\nfelt for his hands through the thin fabric of the gown and began to massage her breasts with him.<br>\r\n\"Mmmm,\" she murmured. \"That feels good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael started kissing her on the base of <br>\r\nher neck, then down between her shoulder<br>\r\nblades, his hands still working her bosom. <br>\r\nLisa  arched her back, thrusting her small breasts<br>\r\ninto his hands. He pressed harder, his fingers<br>\r\nrubbing her areolas. Lisa  moaned softly in response.<br>\r\nShe could feel her crotch becoming warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden creaking noise penetrated the room. <br>\r\nSomeone was opening the door. Michael <br>\r\nhands vanished from under her gown<br>\r\nas fast as lightening lest he get caught with his<br>\r\nhands in the cookie jar so to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa gulped and made a show of holding<br>\r\nup the shoulders of the gown as she felt <br>\r\nMichael pulling tight the middle set of cords.<br>\r\nThey both turned as one to see a<br>\r\nnurse, garbed in a similar fashion to the l<br>\r\nfirst three they met, with a large<br>\r\ntray hanging from her arm.<br>\r\nShe stopped at the threshold and looked at<br>\r\nLisa  and Michael. Her eyes were wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hello,\" she said. <br>\r\n\"I'm here to take some blood samples.\"</span></div></div>",

She was then<br>\r\ntransferred to a gurney that was too small for her<br>\r\nburgeoning body--her knees stuck absurdly<br>\r\ninto the air, covered by a thin sheet which flapped revealingly in the breeze of her passage from<br>\r\none location to another--and taken back down<br>\r\nthe elevator to the radiology department, where<br>\r\nshe was X-rayed, then put onto the moving exam<br>\r\ntable of an MRI unit. Thirty minutes later found <br>\r\nher back in her room, surrounded by a bevy of<br>\r\noverdressed technicians who wired her to a half dozen electronic machines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor nearly a half-hour flickering screens and<br>\r\na cacophony of beeps, chirps and warbles<br>\r\nsurrounded her. All the staff were hesitant to<br>\r\ncome near her, although some of them seemed<br>\r\nsympathetic to her condition, as her growth<br>\r\ncontinued unabated. Michael  stuck by her whenever<br>\r\npossible, holding her hand, reassuring her.<br>\r\nBy one in the afternoon Lisa became resistant towards<br>\r\nthe staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much more blood do you people need?\"<br>\r\nshe snapped.<br>\r\nThe technician, sampling syringe in hand, paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, ma'am,\" he replied. \"Orders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd better be able to live without all this,\" <br>\r\nLisa muttered, raising her arm. <br>\r\nMichael grinned and winked at Lisa<br>\r\nthen put on a stern face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd do better with some food,\"<br>\r\nhe said loudly. One of the nurses<br>\r\ncrowded beside her bed--a solid <br>\r\nwoman whose graying hair was visible<br>\r\nin her plastic cap--made a clucking noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've had nothing to eat today, dear?\"<br>\r\nLisa shook her head. Her motion caused<br>\r\nher to shift in the grip of the lab technician,<br>\r\njiggling the needle in her arm<br>\r\n She spit in pain and gave the technician a<br>\r\nwithering look. He paled and jumped back, leaving the syringe behind. Ellie yanked it out of her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" she said to the technician. \"I think you've had enough for today, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe technician gingerly picked the bloody <br>\r\nneedle from her hand. The older nurse stepped<br>\r\nforward and elbowed the technician aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHarry, what's the matter with you,\" she growled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou'd think you've never drawn blood<br>\r\nfrom a patient before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to be kidding, Miss Johnson,\"<br>\r\nthe technician replied. Johnson seized a damp<br>\r\nswab and dabbed the puncture on <br>\r\nLisa\u2019s  arm, barking orders as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry, leave the kit here.<br>\r\nYou and Paul take the samples down to the lab.<br>\r\nMaria, call the kitchen.<br>\r\nArrange for some food to be sent up here.<br>\r\nMake sure it's normal diet. <br>\r\nYou can tell Mr. Gonzalez that I ordered<br>\r\nit and if he doesn't like it he can talk to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused a moment.<br>\r\n\u201cI think the patient can do with a little rest, too.\"<br>\r\nJohnson folded Lisa\u2019s arm up and glared at<br>\r\nthe rest of the group standing numbly beside her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I trust everybody here understands english?\"<br>\r\nshe snapped. The group scattered out the door.<br>\r\nJohnson turned back to Lisa, unfolded her arm and<br>\r\nremoved the bloodied swab. She fished in the kit for a bandage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, dear,\" she said, her eyes smiling<br>\r\nabove her mask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you've been very patient with us,<br>\r\nbut we are trying to help you.<br>\r\nYou just need to be a little more patient, okay? Good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa seized Johnson's gloved hand.<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael  nodded. Johnson patted Lisa\u2019s hand and,<br>\r\nretrieving the lab kit, left the room, closing the door <br>\r\nbehind her.</span></div></div>",

But that Charlie guy who met u<br>\r\ndownstairs is guarding the door. I saw him<br>\r\nhanging around in the hall, trying to stay out of sight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Why would they guard my door?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael  stopped fiddling with the<br>\r\nlock and came to Lisa\u2019s bedside.<br>\r\nHe took up her hand--she was startled<br>\r\nby just how small his hand felt in hers--and squeezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're in an isolation ward,\" he said.<br>\r\n\u201cThose instructions on the wall we saw<br>\r\nwhen we arrived on this floor are standard<br>\r\npolicy for dealing with contagious infections.<br>\r\nPresumably they think that what happening to<br>\r\nyou is infectious, and that I'm infected as well.<br>\r\nThat's why they've let me stay with you as long as<br>\r\nI have--I'm right where they want me to be.<br>\r\nI know that's not true, but they don't.<br>\r\nSo, there's someone on the door to keep me here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me?\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael  motioned with his hands.<br>\r\n\"Stand up,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. I've grown into my gown again, anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa sat upright in the bed, and Michael  reached<br>\r\nacross the mattress to tie the straps of her hospital<br>\r\n gown more loosely, as he had done twice before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa  hitched up the second gown she was using as a wraparound skirt, and stood. Her head bumped<br>\r\nthe ceiling, and she bent in the middle to save her neck being broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael,\" she said. He nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid so, Lisa . They think you're too<br>\r\nbig to be able to leave freely if your own will\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate to admit they\u2019re right. This is insane how big<br>\r\nI\u2019ve grown and even my boobs are now mid A Range.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll find a way, once they clear you,\" he replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa  recognized a strain in his voice<br>\r\ndespite his outward levity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think they will let me go, Mike,\" Lisa said softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm so damned big and it's not stopping.<br>\r\nI shouldn\u2019t even be able to stand up at this<br>\r\nsize. All my blood should have rushed into my<br>\r\nlegs and made me pass out.<br>\r\nYou know, it's funny, but aside from being<br>\r\nso big and tall I've never felt better in my life.<br>\r\nI feel like I could lift up a locomotive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael looked concerned, then nodded.<br>\r\n\"What's happening to you is truly remarkable, Lisa. <br>\r\nI just don't know if others will see it the same way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clapped his hands together.<br>\r\n\"First things first, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who gave you a set of hospital keys?\"<br>\r\nLisa asked. She stepped across the room<br>\r\nto look over his shoulder. <br>\r\nMichael looked up at her, an impish expression<br>\r\non his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charlie--but he doesn't know it, yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You picked his pocket?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael  inclined his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep. Did it while we were exiting the elevator.<br>\r\nIt was easy. He was too busy staring at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey that\u2019s what the idiot gets for ogling my<br>\r\ngirlfriend. Anyway you\u2019d be surprised the skills<br>\r\nI picked up at my early college attendance.<br>\r\nWhen I was due to attend a really boring<br>\r\nlecture I'd stand at the door and exchange<br>\r\nthe contents of other people's pockets without<br>\r\ntheir noticing. Made classes a lot more interesting.<br>\r\nOne of my best friends from childhood had a<br>\r\nfather who was a reformed thief. Taught us both<br>\r\neverything he knew. By the time I was fifteen I<br>\r\nwas criminally proficient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You went to college?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Ah hah! Like I told you one has to<br>\r\nbe smart to be an heir to a wealthy family\u2019s<br>\r\nbusinesses. I hate to brag but for better or worse<br>\r\nI was bred and raised for it\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa heard the door lock click. Michael  slowly<br>\r\npulled the door open, peeking around the edge of the doorframe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" he said.<br>\r\n\"Nobody in the next room. Lisa, I'll be right<br>\r\nback to you. I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael  slipped through the door.<br>\r\n\"Michael, wait! Don't\u2026\" Lisa heard him lock <br>\r\nit from the other side. Concerned, she listened <br>\r\nintently for sounds that would<br>\r\nindicate Michael\u2019s transgression had been<br>\r\ndetected, but heard only silence.<br>\r\nShe squatted to ease her bent back,<br>\r\nthen stretched her arms. It felt good to move<br>\r\nher body freely. A sudden looseness in the<br>\r\nmiddle of her gown told her that the tieback<br>\r\nkeeping her gown closed across her chest<br>\r\nand back had broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down under each arm<br>\r\nthen at her chest. Sure enough, the gown<br>\r\nwas pulled forward against her small bust,<br>\r\nbroadening the gap at her back, her breasts <br>\r\npressing against the thin cotton of the gown<br>\r\nrevealingly. She would soon need another<br>\r\ngown to help cover her torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa stretched her back until her bones popped,<br>\r\nthen each leg, hitching up her makeshift skirt to <br>\r\nprevent it tearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa became increasingly nervous as time<br>\r\nwent by. It seemed like an hour since Michael<br>\r\nhad snuck from the room. Anyone entering to<br>\r\nsee her or perform another test would<br>\r\nimmediately detect his absence and<br>\r\nspread an alarm.<br>\r\nWhen she heard a soft jingling and saw<br>\r\nthe side door open again she was first relieved,<br>\r\nthen greatly alarmed.<br>\r\nA doctor wearing surgical greens and a<br>\r\nmask poked his head around the door.<br>\r\nWhen he saw only Lisa sitting on her bed,<br>\r\nhe pulled away the mask, grinned and waved 4 large, heavily loaded paper bags at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho else? These surgical getups are great.<br>\r\nNobody even asked me who I was.<br>\r\nAnybody show up while I was gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. You took a chance, Michael, sneaking out like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really.\" Michael grabbed the serving table from the corner of the room and wheeled it towards her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember Nurse Johnson said you were <br>\r\nto get some rest, and she sounds like the person<br>\r\nwho would enforce an order like that.<br>\r\nIt's midafternoon so the hospital cafeteria kitchen<br>\r\nis closed--I checked on the way out--and no<br>\r\none was likely to suddenly arrive with food,<br>\r\nso the odds were good you'd be undisturbed<br>\r\nby any visitors for a while. Anyway I was<br>\r\nhungry and as I understand it my growing<br>\r\ngirlfriend is probably starving by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRumor has it she theoretically requires<br>\r\n2 million calories or so they say\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe added the last part with a dig at the doctors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you! You\u2019re something else\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I\u2019ve been told\u201d</span></div></div>",

Lisa sniffed the<br>\r\naromas coming from the bags and her mouth<br>\r\nwatered. Michael opened each bag and<br>\r\npresented each item to her with a flourish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hamburgers, Hot Dogs, Pizza or club sandwiches?\"<br>\r\nhe asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou missed breakfast, so I figured I better bring<br>\r\na double helping of each for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa laughed--and grabbed for some grub.<br>\r\nShe ate quickly while Michael  opened a cold<br>\r\n2-liter bottle of soda for her and a smaller one<br>\r\nfor himself. She ate the hamburgers in two bites,<br>\r\nignoring how petite each looked. Next she ate a<br>\r\ncouple of Hot Dogs also in 2 bites apiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael  bit into a club sandwich. Lisa finished both<br>\r\nsets of fries and started on the untouched club sandwich, finishing her meal in a few minutes. Next she ate 3<br>\r\nslices of pizza, both soft pretzels with cheese sauce<br>\r\nand bowl of cottage cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you were a little more hungry than you thought,\"<br>\r\nhe said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa grinned sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey like the doctors said and you already knew<br>\r\nI\u2019m a growing girl and plus I haven\u2019t had anything<br>\r\nsince last nights petite dinner\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep that up and you\u2019ll be less petite\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you calling me fat or a pig?

Thank you,\" she replied, bending<br>\r\ndown to kiss him on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry I took some of the food you wanted.<br>\r\nthere\u2019s still some slices of pizza, and 1 Hot Dog left<br>\r\nif you want it? I call dibs on that Tuna Salad Sandwich<br>\r\nand the fruit cup though\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, apologies accepted,<br>\r\nI\u2019ll take one of those slices of pizza and the hot dog.<br>\r\nThe rest is yours my growing cutie and beauty\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww my hero.\u201d She said then kissed him again.<br>\r\nShe then took another slice of pizza and finished it<br>\r\nin 3 bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor hospital food this stuff isn\u2019t that bad\u201d<br>\r\nMichael added eating his hot dog as Lisa chugged her<br>\r\nsoda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSooo is Charlie still outside\u201d she asked<br>\r\nstarting on the last slice of pizza that wasn\u2019t claimed<br>\r\nand saving the other for Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me go look\u201d he said standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did so and as Lisa ate the pizza another<br>\r\nwave of vertigo hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa. That one was strong\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother spell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea. That one felt bigger. I haven\u2019t noticed but<br>\r\nI don\u2019t think the frequency or amount is the consistently<br>\r\nthe same every time\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm that\u2019s interesting to know\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo about Charlie is he still there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes and no. Charlie is gone which is good for<br>\r\nhim since I still kinda wanna punch him for eyeing<br>\r\nmy girl\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa blushed. Then took a bite of her Tuna sandwich.<br>\r\nat her size it was really only 2 bites to finish it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway it\u2019s not Charlie it\u2019s somebody else.<br>\r\nLooks like round-the-clock surveillance for both of us.<br>\r\nI keep wondering when they're going to try to grab me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrab you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep. There was quite a gaggle of doctors and<br>\r\nother folks at the end of the hall when I came<br>\r\nback upstairs. I couldn't get close enough to<br>\r\nhear what they were saying but they were pointing<br>\r\nthis way. From the x-rays they were holding I suppose<br>\r\nthey got your tests back and they're pretty excited about them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause and he noted their food still<br>\r\nleft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen I think we should finish the food quickly<br>\r\nand then dispose of the evidence before the come<br>\r\nand bust us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa nodded and chugged her fruit cup the whole<br>\r\nchunks of fruit seemingly not bothering her.<br>\r\nMichael finished his hot dog then ripped off a chunk<br>\r\nof pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you eat it. I\u2019m not knocking your appetite<br>\r\nbut you\u2019d finish this faster than I can and I hate<br>\r\nto waste good food\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa did so. Michael gathered the trash and<br>\r\npitched it in the room next door.<br>\r\nJust in good time too.<br>\r\nHe returned with unpleasant news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard them from the other room. They\u2019re getting<br>\r\neven more antsy over your results\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe they found a cause for my growing?\" <br>\r\nLisa said. Michael shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or, they just found a lot more questions to ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see Doctor Peterson  at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Not a bit.

Michael  half-closed his eyes and<br>\r\nleaned into her small but budding breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to rub her side and back.<br>\r\nThey sat together on Ellie's makeshift bed,<br>\r\nutterly contented in each other, and <br>\r\nLisa was surprised to find herself totally<br>\r\nhappy for the first time that day and the 1st time<br>\r\nin a long time. That wall that had built up for<br>\r\nso long shielding her emotions was starting to crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled in her mind.

All her blood tests had<br>\r\ncome back normal--no excessive gonadotropin or<br>\r\npituitary gland secretions, no chemical evidence of acromegaly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer growth was almost mathematically perfect and proportional except her breasts which showed small<br>\r\ntell tale signs of enhancement but as if naturally<br>\r\nand her legs were a bit longer than normal and she<br>\r\nwas actually getting slightly thinner losing<br>\r\nbody fat--no thickening of long bones beyond what<br>\r\nwould be proportionate to her growth, no excess <br>\r\ntissue in her hands, no broadening of her jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrine and fecal samples were also negative.<br>\r\nHer x-rays were the major surprise, because<br>\r\nthere were none. Every attempt to penetrate her<br>\r\nbody with radiation resulted in opaque films<br>\r\nwith no useable images at all.<br>\r\nSave for her steadily increasing size<br>\r\nthe one patient appeared utterly normal<br>\r\nand very healthy, in fact insanely so perhaps the<br>\r\nhealthiest human to ever exist and<br>\r\n the male patient was not affected at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNormal?\" Doctor Yolanda Scott said.<br>\r\nIsolation Unit Nursing Supervisor Debbie Johnson <br>\r\nstood her ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.

He was below-medium-sized<br>\r\nand rail-thin, pale and unpleasant looking.<br>\r\nBoth Scott and Johnson were stopped in<br>\r\ntheir tracks by his cold, gray eyes.<br>\r\nHe spoke no word but tipped his uniform<br>\r\ncap towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn which room is the patient?\" Kimball asked.<br>\r\nScott pointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"802, right down the hall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLang turned and motioned to the<br>\r\nmass of blue-suited figures.<br>\r\nThey moved en masse to the room Lisa occupied,<br>\r\npushing aside the orderly guarding the entry.<br>\r\nLisa was lying on her side in bed when<br>\r\nthe new people entered the room. <br>\r\nShe rose up on her elbow and gulped in<br>\r\nsurprise, her eyes flickering briefly at the<br>\r\nside door Michael  used to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's going on?\" she asked as the<br>\r\ngaggle of blue suited people surrounded her.<br>\r\nShe started to rise out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't get up, Miss Porter,\"<br>\r\none of the figures spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry if we frightened you.<br>\r\nWe're from the Centers for Disease<br>\r\nControl in Atlanta, Georgia.<br>\r\nMy name is Doctor Sadler.<br>\r\nWe've come to examine you and take a<br>\r\nlook at your case.

The people around her opened the bag<br>\r\nand began to push her body into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa  was horrified at being shoved<br>\r\ninto what looked like an oversized<br>\r\nbody bag and tried to thrash at the<br>\r\nhands pulling at her.<br>\r\nShe made contact with one of the figures,<br>\r\nflinging him across the room and<br>\r\nshattering his faceplate, but more gas was<br>\r\nsprayed on her, and she went<br>\r\ncompletely limp. She began to cry as her<br>\r\nbody was squeezed into the bag and<br>\r\nits opening was zippered shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Johnson was among the group of<br>\r\nphysicians standing around the nurse's station,<br>\r\nwatching the procession of blue-suited<br>\r\nfigures go by, surrounding a gurney bearing<br>\r\nan isolation unit. A high, hissing voice caught<br>\r\nher attention, and she turned slightly to see the l<br>\r\nArmy officer, Lang, on a portable telephone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't give a fat rat's ass,<br>\r\ndammit--I want that facility operational now.<br>\r\nI am tired of your excuses!<br>\r\nWhat the hell does that mean?<br>\r\nAre you telling me the Air Force shuts<br>\r\ndown on the weekends?<br>\r\nDamn right you will get the doors open<br>\r\nfor our cargo.

Lisa struggled against<br>\r\nthe paralyzing effects of the gas she had<br>\r\nbeen sprayed with, trying to raise her arms<br>\r\nor kick with her legs. She was suddenly<br>\r\npinned down by bands across her chest<br>\r\nand thighs. The restriction cut off what little<br>\r\nair she was able to draw. She tried to cry<br>\r\nout but her vocal cords wouldn't cooperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt herself begin to move, rapidly<br>\r\nand violently, swinging first to one side,<br>\r\nthen another. She then jolted to a stop.<br>\r\nShe heard elevator doors close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhew,\" a voice said. \"Jesus, what a job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan it, boys,\" a female voice snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, is she strong,\" another male voice said.<br>\r\n\u201cDid you see Cox? She tossed him fifteen<br>\r\nfeet and busted his suit. They're going to<br>\r\nhave to bag him, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa closed her eyes and forced herself to relax, concentrating on her breathing. A tiny amoun<br>\r\nof fresh air, probably from one of those filters<br>\r\nnear her head, was coming into the bag.<br>\r\nFeeling was returning to her limbs <br>\r\nbut cramping and queasiness put in an<br>\r\nappearance in her midsection.<br>\r\nShe inhaled more deeply, a moan escaping her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, she's still awake!<br>\r\nSomebody trank her, right now!\" <br>\r\nthe first male voice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa felt something pierce her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrank in,\" the female voice said.<br>\r\nLisa felt weakness spreading around<br>\r\nthe prick in her leg. She whimpered<br>\r\nin pain and an increasing fury, and began<br>\r\nto strain her arms against the bonds that<br>\r\nheld her to the stretcher. She felt something<br>\r\ngive, and she was injected with another dose,<br>\r\nthen another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new drug made her violently nauseous<br>\r\nand she turned her head just in time.<br>\r\nHer vomit fouled the space around her<br>\r\nhead and choked her. The voices outside<br>\r\nthe bag rose into a loud,<br>\r\nincomprehensible babble, and another<br>\r\nrestraint was applied across her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa ceased moving to ease the cramping<br>\r\nand nausea in her middle, not hearing the<br>\r\ncollective sigh of relief as she appeared quiescent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa felt cold touch her everywhere.<br>\r\nShe must be outside. She heard the<br>\r\nbeeping of a car horn, then a loud rattling<br>\r\nof metal. She thought she heard a faint<br>\r\nvoice call out her name as she went up<br>\r\nan incline and into a hollow-sounding box.<br>\r\nMore voices appeared and she heard a car<br>\r\nor truck engine start. The cramping in her<br>\r\nbelly grew greater and Lisa  struggled with the pain.<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes and tried to ignore how<br>\r\nher  own vomit was soaking into her hair,<br>\r\nwishing she would really fall unconscious<br>\r\nso she wouldn't hear and feel what was<br>\r\nhappening to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an awful horrible experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael watched with impotent rage<br>\r\nas a gaggle of suited people hurried<br>\r\nLisa  into the back of a truck. He pounded<br>\r\nhis fist against the cold brickwork of the<br>\r\nhospital wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa!\" he shouted, then restrained himself.<br>\r\nWhat these people were doing to her<br>\r\nwas totally wrong.<br>\r\nShe wasn't a danger to anybody.<br>\r\nShe didn't need or deserve to be treated this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ever hear of asking, motherfuckers?!. Two hundred fifty million Americans and the only ones we meet are all assholes.

A new commotion in<br>\r\nthe hospital parking lot caught his eye. Another group of suited people were climbing all over a few cars<br>\r\nthen they got to  his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe squinted to see against the westering<br>\r\nsun and realized they were pulling everything<br>\r\nfrom the cars and placing each item in plastic bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe overheard a few of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis Michael Person is annoying.<br>\r\nI can\u2019t believe we had to run the license plates<br>\r\non every damned car here and there\u2019s 4 people named<br>\r\nMichael\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the hospital PA switched on and the<br>\r\n2nd suit guy could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what do you expect with an incompetent<br>\r\nhospital staff of idiots\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral staff and patients glared dagger eyes<br>\r\nat the suits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap what the hell?

Michael was amused at that<br>\r\nprank though. Serves these guys right.<br>\r\nSomebody was watching us from the start.<br>\r\nHe felt the hair rise on the back of his neck and whipped around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking for me, are we?\" he whispered.<br>\r\nHe counted 9 men dressed in business<br>\r\nsuits and coats in the lobby of the hospital. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael sauntered from the parking area,<br>\r\nwalking down the sidewalk past the front<br>\r\nlobby, openly looking at the group of men.<br>\r\nOne had what looked like a crude drawing<br>\r\nin his hand. They turned to look at him,<br>\r\nthen looked away, none making any<br>\r\nmove towards the doors.</span></div></div>",

Four p.m. He sensed danger again<br>\r\nand looked around. Two of the men he<br>\r\nhad seen in the hospital lobby had rounded<br>\r\nthe corner and were casually walking in his direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You people have half a brain after all, </i><br>\r\nhe thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned away and walked briskly until<br>\r\nhe was near the corner. He looked back.<br>\r\nThe men were walking fast, directly for him. <br>\r\nMichael  jumped on to Lincoln Avenue,<br>\r\ndodging honking, screeching cars and<br>\r\ncomplaining drivers. The men tried to<br>\r\nfollow but were impeded by the maze of<br>\r\ncars created by his precipitous appearance<br>\r\nin the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael reached the opposite<br>\r\nsidewalk and ran headlong into the lobby<br>\r\nof the nearest building. He moved as quickly<br>\r\nas possible, still holding his phone and suitcase,<br>\r\ndashing through into an open hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected it was a professional office,<br>\r\nwith a lobby entrance on either side of the<br>\r\nbuilding. Michael ran headlong onto<br>\r\nSouth Street, pausing to whip his belt<br>\r\nout of his pants. He threaded the belt<br>\r\nthrough the lobby door handles and tugged<br>\r\nthe ends into a knot, then turned and walked<br>\r\nslowly towards Reade Place. As he reached<br>\r\nthe corner, a taxi arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael stepped in quickly and the driver<br>\r\naccelerated away. He looked through<br>\r\nthe rear windscreen. No one was behind him.<br>\r\nHe blew his cheeks out and<br>\r\nswallowed to moisten<br>\r\nhis mouth and throat, then dug into his<br>\r\ncoat pocket and tapped on the wire grill<br>\r\nseparating the passenger compartment<br>\r\nfrom the driver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy friend,\" he said, <br>\r\n\"I've got $2,000 extra dollars cash<br>\r\nwith your name on it.

It's rush hour! Okay, I'm on my way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the cab sped off Michael began furiously<br>\r\ndialing call after Call glad he had his portable<br>\r\ncharger on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Unknown Location -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was shivering, claustrophobic and<br>\r\nstarving for air when she felt the truck she l<br>\r\nwas in roll up a steep incline and come<br>\r\nto a stop. The door rolled open.<br>\r\nHer ears were assaulted by the howl of<br>\r\njet engines very close by, accompanied<br>\r\nby shouting. The sounds reached a crescendo,<br>\r\nthen dimmed, and she felt the bag around<br>\r\nher head being tugged and pulled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe restraints disappeared and light<br>\r\nsuddenly flooded into the bag, dazzling her.<br>\r\nHands reached into the bag, grabbed her<br>\r\nshoulders and began to pull her out of its<br>\r\nconfinement, tearing gaps in the hospital gown<br>\r\ncovering her front.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked around as best she could<br>\r\nin her drugged state. She was being<br>\r\ndrawn onto another stretcher, one with a<br>\r\nclear plastic envelope punctured by<br>\r\nmore glove holes, supported by<br>\r\nan aluminum frame. Something poked her<br>\r\nin the back and she squirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore hands reached into the glove holes<br>\r\nand help pull her into the container.<br>\r\nShe felt her head press up against the<br>\r\nplastic at the head of the stretcher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly--\" a voice she had heard earlier said.<br>\r\n\"She's too big for the isolation stretcher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, help me lift her legs.<br>\r\nYou guys up there lift her head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy way of much pulling and pushing<br>\r\nLisa  was shoehorned into the new <br>\r\ncontainer and heard it being sealed closed.<br>\r\nA soft hiss caught her attention.<br>\r\nOxygen, being pumped into the envelope.<br>\r\nShe inhaled slowly, tasting the sweet, dry air.<br>\r\nA gloved hand brought a plastic bottle to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go, soldier,\" a new voice said softly.<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you had an accident.<br>\r\nHave a little water. It's just water, that's all.<br>\r\nGood. Swallow some, it'll help clean your mouth out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa took a little water, gagged,<br>\r\nand drank some more.<br>\r\nShe looked more closely at the<br>\r\nsource of the voice. He was middle-aged,<br>\r\nheavyset, and bespectacled.

A door loudly opened, then her<br>\r\nhead was thrust into a small, square opening.<br>\r\nShe saw hands sealing her isolation<br>\r\nstretcher to the rim of the opening.<br>\r\nAnother metal thump immediately<br>\r\nabove her head made her jump.<br>\r\nShe felt the plastic over her head<br>\r\ncome loose and she stretched herself into<br>\r\nthe new space. It felt good.<br>\r\nThen the point of her shoulders<br>\r\nbutted against the hard metal rim of a hatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa tilted her head up and saw a<br>\r\ncrowd of people dressed in<br>\r\nmore anti-contamination suits--silver colored<br>\r\nand with larger faceplates this time--hovering<br>\r\nat the other side of the hatch.<br>\r\nThe nearest was a woman with oriental<br>\r\nfeatures who was in the act of reaching<br>\r\nout to her.<br>\r\nWhen Lisa moved she jerkedher hands back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe's too big to fit in the hatch,\"<br>\r\nLisa heard her say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, do the best you can,\" <br>\r\na man's voice replied.<br>\r\nHands reached in and grasped<br>\r\nher armpits and began to tug.<br>\r\nIt was both ineffective and painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\" Lisa yelled. \"That hurts!

With both hands available<br>\r\nshe now shoved herself into the room.<br>\r\nShe twisted her hips and leaned until her<br>\r\nfingers found the floor.<br>\r\nSquirming her body and legs, she was<br>\r\nable to force her way into her new<br>\r\nenclosure, the hatch closing after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa breathed deeply and stretched<br>\r\nin sheer ecstasy at actually being able<br>\r\nto move after so long. She opened her<br>\r\neyes and counted twelve people encircling<br>\r\nher. She was almost as tall sitting down as<br>\r\nthe tallest of them standing up.<br>\r\nHer joints throbbed as she drew her legs<br>\r\nunderneath her, then slowly stood erect.<br>\r\nAs one her newest audience all took a full<br>\r\nstep backward as she reached her full height,<br>\r\nsome pushing past their neighbors behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne man's legs buckled beneath him and<br>\r\nhe crashed to the floor in a heap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned as circulation returned to<br>\r\nher legs and buttocks and she twisted<br>\r\nfrom side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she remembered her state of dishabille.<br>\r\nThe remnants of her gown fluttered from<br>\r\naround her neck like streamers nearly to her<br>\r\nwaist, covering nothing.<br>\r\nShe felt herself flush, and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for letting me out of that thing,\"<br>\r\nshe said politely.<br>\r\n\"Now, if you don't mind,<br>\r\nI'd like to know where I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the suited figures moved<br>\r\nsuddenly, forcing his way to the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Doctor William Turner,\" he said,<br>\r\nhis voice distorted by his suit microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour name is Lisa Eleanor Porter?<br>\r\nYou see miss Porter, I received a very<br>\r\nunusual phone call from<br>\r\na Doctor John Peterson early this morning.<br>\r\nHe told me one of his adolescent  patients<br>\r\nwith a history of stunted growth was suddenly<br>\r\ngrowing at an incredible if not alarming rate<br>\r\nof speed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused.

A single bank of fluorescent lights<br>\r\nhung amid a maze of pipes, ducts and wiring<br>\r\nattached to an unpainted ceiling.<br>\r\nDirty imprints of tables and other objects<br>\r\ndecorated the floor. Everything was indicative<br>\r\nof hurried preparations for her occupancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only remaining pieces of furnishing was<br>\r\na large stainless steel sink on one wall,<br>\r\nthe laboratory shower and the patchwork<br>\r\nbed she sat on. Cool, plastic-smelling air<br>\r\nentered through a small vent in the wall.<br>\r\nThe only way in or out of the room appeared to<br>\r\nbe either the tiny hatch through which she<br>\r\nhad entered and a larger, sliding door with a<br>\r\nlarge glass panel in the opposite wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA silvery convex mirror, which Lisa<br>\r\nrecognized as a cover for a security camera,<br>\r\nhung in one corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a group of suited figures<br>\r\nreappeared.

All right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa nodded. She saw him smile<br>\r\nbehind his visor. His eyes slowly moved<br>\r\ndown her erect form. It was not hard to see<br>\r\nwhere his gaze paused, and Lisa felt herself flush in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething to wear, too,\" she reminded him,<br>\r\nloudly.

In his arms were a bundle<br>\r\nof towels and a small plastic bag containing soap, toothpaste, a toothbrush and a bottle of shampoo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came towards Lisa until he was just<br>\r\noutside her arm's length, dropped the<br>\r\ntowels and bag, and rushed back to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa turned her back on the visitor.<br>\r\nTearing the remains of her gown from<br>\r\naround her neck she tossed the rags<br>\r\ninto a corner of the room.<br>\r\nThe closure of the plastic bag was too<br>\r\nsmall for her to tease apart with her fingertips<br>\r\nand she used a nail to rip it open. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A torrent of cold water<br>\r\nsplashed her. After her sweaty<br>\r\nconfinement it felt good and she was<br>\r\npleased to note the drain beneath<br>\r\nthe shower head did its job.<br>\r\nShe soaked her hair and used the<br>\r\nsoap and shampoo, rinsed,<br>\r\nthen stood up to towel herself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then she noticed that her<br>\r\nvisitor had not left the room.<br>\r\nHe stood beside the hatch, staring up at her,<br>\r\nhis visor fogged cellphone in hand.<br>\r\nShe felt a sudden fury and made a quick<br>\r\nmotion in his direction.<br>\r\nHe jumped backwards, thumping himself<br>\r\nagainst the hatch, and frantically worked<br>\r\nthe controls to open it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle-Fucking Pervert-\"<br>\r\nshe muttered under her breath as he<br>\r\ndisappeared behind the door,<br>\r\nonly to reappear in the thick glass<br>\r\nwindow, watching again.<br>\r\nShe finished toweling her body and<br>\r\nbegan to work on her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa momentarily wished she had a comb<br>\r\nto put her hair in order. Motion in the<br>\r\nhatchway caught her eye and she<br>\r\nturned to see another suited figure enter,<br>\r\nbearing a large, black object.<br>\r\nShe saw the new visitor slap at the shoulder<br>\r\nof the first, then work the controls to enter the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, here--here's something for<br>\r\nyou to wrap around yourself,\"<br>\r\nthe new visitor said. <br>\r\nLisa recognized her as the oriental<br>\r\nwoman she first saw on entering the room.<br>\r\nLisa sank down to her knees so she was<br>\r\nnot so towering over the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don't have to be afraid of me, you know,\"<br>\r\nshe said.<br>\r\n\u201cI don't bite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman appeared astounded by Lisa's<br>\r\ncomment, as if she was surprised Lisa<br>\r\nwas able to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, take my hand,\" Lisa offered,<br>\r\nreaching out slowly. The woman dropped<br>\r\nthe object and nearly fell over herself<br>\r\ntrying to get away.<br>\r\nLisa snatched her hand back and<br>\r\nwatched the woman rush from the room.<br>\r\nShe looked down at the package the<br>\r\nwoman had brought, an oblong knapsack<br>\r\nwith carry straps. Lisa picked it up, opened<br>\r\nits lid and grabbed a handful of<br>\r\nits olive-drab colored contents--a parachute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cloth smelled moldy and she wrinkled<br>\r\nher nose at the odor. She spread the fabric<br>\r\nacross her lap and the floor and began to<br>\r\nmeasure the cloth with her hands and arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Turner returned to the lab, followed<br>\r\nby two others carrying a large wooden<br>\r\nbox between them. Under his direction<br>\r\nthey hefted the box into an unused corner<br>\r\nof the room. Lisa noted the circular hole<br>\r\ncut into the plywood top of the box and<br>\r\nthe large, heavy plastic sheeting beneath.<br>\r\nIt was a toilet, a giant, homemade porta-potty.<br>\r\nShe grimaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere!\" <br>\r\nTurner exclaimed with the air of a man<br>\r\nhaving done someone a huge favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you have everything you needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe eyed Lisa's new dress. She had torn a<br>\r\nhole in the apex of the parachute and folded<br>\r\nit into a large-paneled apron which she<br>\r\nwrapped around her body, secured by<br>\r\nparachute cord ties under her budding breasts<br>\r\nand around her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat looks better,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Mizz Porter, there are some<br>\r\nground rules we need to go over with you.<br>\r\nWith your cooperation we can have a<br>\r\ngood team effort towards<br>\r\ncuring your problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he began to outline a routine<br>\r\nthat she was expected to follow during<br>\r\nher stay. Lisa listened patiently until<br>\r\nher meal arrived--two trays loaded<br>\r\nwith food borne by two other men.<br>\r\nThe smell reminded her of her aching belly<br>\r\nand her hunger, and she cut off Turner<br>\r\nwith a gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore you start poking and prodding<br>\r\nme again,\" she said,<br>\r\n\"I'd like to eat, and get some<br>\r\nprivacy to use the john.\"<br>\r\nTurner reluctantly obliged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\" he replied.<br>\r\n\"In thirty minutes, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That reminds me, doctor,\" Lisa said.<br>\r\n\"I'd like a clock in this room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A clock?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. At least I can know<br>\r\nwhat time it is, even if I'm not entitled<br>\r\nto know anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. A clock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa couldn\u2019t make out Turner\u2019s grumbling but<br>\r\nassumed he was annoyed by the added last<br>\r\nMinute requests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa watched as the clock was attached to<br>\r\nthe wall and the time set.<br>\r\nThe clock had a large digital readout but<br>\r\ndisplayed higher numbers rather than twelve<br>\r\nshe was used to. Lisa read the time: 2030.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What time is that in english?\"<br>\r\nshe asked one of the two men attaching the<br>\r\nclock to the wall. They both stopped dead<br>\r\nand looked at one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, it's eight thirty, uh, Miss,\" one spoke. <br>\r\nLisa sat on her bed and sighed.<br>\r\nHer whole adventure had started just over<br>\r\none full week ago. It seemed impossible that<br>\r\nso much could have happened in so short a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa shifted and blinked as another one<br>\r\nof those vertigo spells hit<br>\r\nher--she had been having them so regularly<br>\r\nthat she only felt them when she paid<br>\r\nattention--and undid the cord under her<br>\r\nbreasts to loosen the flaps of her impromptu<br>\r\ndress. She was still growing, growing in a<br>\r\nregular pattern, for the time being as<br>\r\nopposed to earlier random spurts the<br>\r\ndoctors said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa sat on her bed and watched the clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery few minutes she felt something<br>\r\nshift around her body--her parachute-gown,<br>\r\nthe bedclothes, her bare feet on the<br>\r\nlinoleum floor. Breathing deeply she felt<br>\r\nthe nylon rub against her breasts and<br>\r\nshoulders. She stood up and pulled her<br>\r\ndress up a little to ease the sense of<br>\r\ntightness around her frame.<br>\r\nThe ragged hem of her parachute<br>\r\nwas at mid-calf--it had been<br>\r\nalmost ankle-length before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no doubt about it. Lisa was indeed<br>\r\nstill growing and this wasn\u2019t some nightmare.</span></div></div>",

She looked up and realized that<br>\r\nshe was approaching the height of the<br>\r\nductwork on the ceiling. Soon she would<br>\r\nhave to bend a little, then a little more, and<br>\r\nthen she would have to crouch in this room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa seated herself again and<br>\r\nmade herself look away from the<br>\r\nclock to the linoleum floor. She tried to<br>\r\namuse herself by finding images in<br>\r\nthe random dots of color embedded<br>\r\nin the flooring. For such an airtight<br>\r\nlaboratory, the mess inside the shadows of<br>\r\nthe removed equipment was surprising.<br>\r\nShe could see most of the dust,<br>\r\nsmears of grease or oil,<br>\r\ntears in the surface of the linoleum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa paused. She really could see all<br>\r\nthose tiny things--and her eyes had to<br>\r\nbe at least six feet from the floor's<br>\r\nsurface. She looked around the walls,<br>\r\nnoticing infinitesimal dents and bulges<br>\r\nin the otherwise featureless wallboard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa put her hand up to her face.<br>\r\nShe could see every line on her palm.<br>\r\nShe held her hand out at arm's length--<br>\r\nand still could see every line on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2019Curiouser and curiouser\u2019</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked across her room to the<br>\r\nwooden porta-potty.<br>\r\nLaying  beside it was a pile of<br>\r\nnewspapers--her extemporaneous<br>\r\ntoilet paper. She stood, instinctively<br>\r\nducking as her hair brushed the ductwork<br>\r\nagain, and stepped to her toilet, trying not<br>\r\nto sniff its contents. She looked down at<br>\r\nthe pile of papers and found she could read <br>\r\nevery tiny word on the page. It was incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arrival of the gaggle of doctors<br>\r\ndistracted her, and Lisa retreated to her<br>\r\nbed. The testing and measuring began again.<br>\r\nIt was announced that she was now ten<br>\r\nfeet, three and one half inches tall, or,<br>\r\nas one of the crowd announced in a voice<br>\r\nsuitable for the racetrack, two feet four and<br>\r\na half inches taller than the tallest human<br>\r\nbeing on record.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked at the clock saw that it<br>\r\nwas now nine p.m.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo point four inches per hour,\"<br>\r\nsomeone in the crowd said, echoing <br>\r\nLisa's thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne millimeter per minute. Amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa\u2019s promise to cooperate with<br>\r\nDoctor Turner and his hive of<br>\r\nexaminers and researchers lasted for<br>\r\nalmost eighteen hours.<br>\r\nShe was repeatedly drained, checked,<br>\r\ninspected and measured.<br>\r\nDifferent x-ray machines were wheeled<br>\r\nin, one after the other, with no<br>\r\nimprovement in results.<br>\r\nAfter a discussion which Lisa covertly<br>\r\noverheard but could not understand,<br>\r\nmore equipment was brought in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFibroscopes were slipped into every<br>\r\none of her orifices, gagging, hurting and<br>\r\nembarrassing her. An endless stream of<br>\r\nquestions were asked, over and over again.<br>\r\nDid she feel any dizziness?<br>\r\nDo her joints hurt?<br>\r\nAny muscle spasms?<br>\r\nBody aches?<br>\r\nHow about bowel movements?<br>\r\nShe felt no need for sleep whatsoever?<br>\r\nHas she menstruated since she<br>\r\nbegan growing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa  answered as best she could as she<br>\r\nalternately dressed and undressed<br>\r\nfor each successive test, trying to ignore<br>\r\nhow the cords she used to tie her dress<br>\r\ntogether were getting progressively shorter<br>\r\nor how her skirt hem was inexorably rising<br>\r\nup her legs past her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery hour the tests and questions<br>\r\nwere stopped, and the tapes and<br>\r\ncalipers made a reappearance.<br>\r\nBy 0800--eight o'clock to Lisa--she<br>\r\nwas twelve feet four inches tall and<br>\r\nhad to stoop when standing to avoid<br>\r\nentangling her longer hair in the pipes<br>\r\nand ducts over head. The level of the voice<br>\r\nannouncing her height grew louder<br>\r\nwith each passing hour and each<br>\r\nincreased measure until, at noon,<br>\r\nshe broke the thirteen-foot mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought the assemblage would cheer<br>\r\nor break into song as the stentorian<br>\r\nannouncement was made, and she grit<br>\r\nher teeth. Turner himself appeared only<br>\r\nonce, stayed for just a moment, then rushed<br>\r\nout of the room, looking less polished than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly one doctor,<br>\r\nthe elderly white-haired man who had<br>\r\nexpressed concern over her drugging the<br>\r\nprevious evening, had gone out of his way<br>\r\nto speak to her as a person, telling her about<br>\r\nthe weather or trying to comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaks for meals were a relief to her, allowing<br>\r\nher to collect her temper<br>\r\n (about the only thing, she thought with<br>\r\ngallows humor, that was shortening on her)<br>\r\nand nerve herself to endure the next set of tests and questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then one of the scopes they had put down<br>\r\nLisa throat discovered something in her stomach.<br>\r\nA strange glowing gem was imbedded into one<br>\r\nside of her stomach actually slightly lighting the<br>\r\notherwise dark cavern.<br>\r\nIt appeared to have fused with the skin.<br>\r\nNotably every heartbeat Lisa had the glow<br>\r\nchanged colors from Blue to green to<br>\r\npink to orange to blue again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEureka we may have found something\u201d<br>\r\nShouted the technician using the scope and<br>\r\nrecording the images.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Then after her three p.m.<br>\r\nmeasurement--the technician almost shouted,<br>\r\n\"Thirteen feet nine point five inches!\"--a<br>\r\nnew object was brought in contact with<br>\r\nthe skin on her left forearm and activated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa  screamed in pain as the curetter<br>\r\nneatly scalloped a four-inch wide slice of<br>\r\nskin from her arm.<br>\r\nShe jerked her arm away, crying in agony.<br>\r\nHer arm had started bleeding a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe need a skin sample--\"<br>\r\nthe technician began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa reached down with her injured arm<br>\r\nand grasped the technician by his suit front.<br>\r\nThe tough plastic shredded in her hand.<br>\r\nShe lifted the man into the air until his<br>\r\nhead banged off a duct on the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do that again and I'll--\"<br>\r\nShe was shaking badly from the rush of<br>\r\npain, pent-up anger and adrenaline.<br>\r\nThe technician was literally being rattled in<br>\r\nher hand. She flung him into the crowd,<br>\r\nknocking half of them from their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This ends now!\" she shouted.<br>\r\n\u201cGet out of here before I throw you out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd picked up the technician and<br>\r\nretreated en masse, leaving Lisa crying<br>\r\nin pain, clutching her arm. Blood dripped<br>\r\nfreely from between her fingers.<br>\r\nSuddenly the door opened again,<br>\r\nand she looked up, fierce anger<br>\r\netching her features. It was the elderly<br>\r\ndoctor and he had a first-aid kit in<br>\r\nhis hands. Despite her tears she<br>\r\ncould distinguish the trembling of his lip<br>\r\nfrom twenty feet away through his visor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put her head down again,<br>\r\nrocking her hurt arm. She felt a gentle<br>\r\ntouch on her knee. He had come closer,<br>\r\nand he beckoned to her with the first aid kit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me tend your arm,\" he said.<br>\r\nLisa sniffed back her tears and hesitantly<br>\r\nextended her forearm.<br>\r\nHe clucked with concern as he saw<br>\r\nthe gaping wound. He retrieved a towel<br>\r\nfrom the vestibule between the two hatches,<br>\r\nsoaked it at the sink and began to gently<br>\r\nclean away the blood from her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA repeated thudding on the other<br>\r\nhatch brought their attention to the<br>\r\nopen vestibule. Lisa could see Turner<br>\r\nframed by the glass in the outer door.<br>\r\nThe white-haired doctor gently placed<br>\r\nthe towel over her wound and told her to<br>\r\nhold it there, then went to the hatchway<br>\r\nand worked the controls.</span></div></div>",

She could see their<br>\r\nperspiration through their visors.<br>\r\nOne jerked up his shotgun by its pistol<br>\r\ngrip and made a show of working its action.<br>\r\nLisa put on the nastiest smile she could<br>\r\ncontrive and pulled her arm out the<br>\r\nfriendly doctor's grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up until she was fully erect,<br>\r\nbending over Turner and the two goons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD'you think your dinky little gun<br>\r\ncan really hurt me?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo their credit neither man moved,<br>\r\nbut she could see it get damper inside their suits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, Mizz Porter, fine Have it your way,\"<br>\r\nTurner snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you like the idea of being<br>\r\nlocked inside this room without support,<br>\r\ngrowing until you crush yourself inside it?<br>\r\nThere is nothing--nothing whatever--to stop<br>\r\nyour growing at this time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa seated herself again on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right bitch I call the shots here!<br>\r\nNow then I think,\" Turner continued,<br>\r\nshaking his head to scatter the perspiration<br>\r\ndripping into his eyes,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"that we all need to take a short break.<br>\r\nWe'll be back in--\"<br>\r\nhe looked at the clock--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"two hours.

Through his visor she could see<br>\r\nhis eyes, full of concern and sympathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" she whispered softly.<br>\r\nHe smiled, nodded to her and slipped his glove back on, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries.

Meredith Douglas, USAF,<br>\r\nwalked down the fourth floor hall<br>\r\nof the Curran Cancer Center,<br>\r\nher step slow.<br>\r\nThe Center, part of the huge USAF<br>\r\nSchool of Aerospace Medicine at Brooks<br>\r\nAir Force Base, was generally the last<br>\r\nhope of military personnel suffering from<br>\r\nadvanced cancers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of those was Major Shane Gailey, Douglas'<br>\r\nmentor for seven years, now dying of<br>\r\nadvanced lymphoma.<br>\r\nDouglas had been one of the first black female commissioned officers assigned to<br>\r\nthe 728th Air Control A-3 Sentry AWACS<br>\r\n(Airborne Warning And Control System)<br>\r\nSquadron and his tutelage had made<br>\r\nher one of its best TACCOs<br>\r\n(Tactical Air Command and Control Officers).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer promotion to Captain was solid proof of<br>\r\nhis confidence in her and she had come to<br>\r\nBrooks to show him her new captain's bars.<br>\r\nThe sight of him had been a shock--cancer and chemotherapy had made him emaciated,<br>\r\ntranslucent and sedated to insensibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer visit had been short and unpleasant<br>\r\nand she felt a vast sense of loss.<br>\r\nThe thick, mediciney atmosphere in the<br>\r\nhospital was stifling and Douglas rushed<br>\r\nthrough the doors to the facility,<br>\r\nstopping just outside to breathe the humid<br>\r\nafternoon air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDouglas looked up at the sky.<br>\r\nIt was dark with gray, overhanging<br>\r\nclouds and fog--El Ni\u00f1o weather.<br>\r\nA thin drizzle drifted down,<br>\r\nadding to her depression.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mere,\" a voice said. Douglas<br>\r\nturned to see<br>\r\nFirst Lieutenant Moncur Avery,<br>\r\na former classmate at the academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was immediately cheered by<br>\r\nhis round, grinning face.<br>\r\nHe looked at her shoulders,<br>\r\nstopped and threw her an exaggerated,<br>\r\njaunty salute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy cow!\" he exclaimed.<br>\r\n\"You're the first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Monk,\" she replied.<br>\r\n\"I'm the 'first' what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first in our class to get captain's<br>\r\nbars.

The sooner, the<br>\r\nbetter, I think. What brought<br>\r\nyou to Brooks? I thought you'd<br>\r\nfinally got your slot at Edwards,<br>\r\nflying all those snotty experimental<br>\r\nairplanes the taxpayers keep funding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm playing shuttle pilot for some<br>\r\nbrass today. Listen, I just heard that all<br>\r\nthe booze is free at the officer's club.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrust Avery to sniff out free alcohol,<br>\r\nDouglas reflected. She hoped he<br>\r\nwasn't scheduled to fly tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some civilian with money to burn<br>\r\nhad to get a GCA into Brooks.<br>\r\nI heard he suffered a total electronics<br>\r\nfailure while up in this goop and<br>\r\nhollered for help,\" <br>\r\nAvery said, pointing at the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDouglas nodded her understanding.<br>\r\nA Ground Control Approach,<br>\r\nwhere the radar operators literally talked<br>\r\nan airplane out of the sky, was unheard of<br>\r\nat modern civilian airports and a pilot<br>\r\nstuck in the murk without electronic<br>\r\naids would need to divert to a military<br>\r\nairfield to land safely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuy likes Air Force or something,<br>\r\nhe offered to buy the control people<br>\r\nand everybody else on the base a round<br>\r\nwhile he is waiting for his private<br>\r\nrepair crew to arrive,\" Avery continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou'll like the guy--he's a Texan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDouglas grinned. Avery was like a tonic,<br>\r\nutterly flippant and carefree. She shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, why not? I've time before<br>\r\nmy flight back to Eglin.\"<br>\r\nWhen Douglas and Avery walked<br>\r\nthrough the double doors of the<br>\r\nOfficer's Club their first impression was<br>\r\nthat a riot at broken out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was thick with people, a mixture<br>\r\nof Air Force and Army, congregated around<br>\r\nthe bar or mixed into knots.<br>\r\nConversations were being offered in<br>\r\nloud voices a few feet away.<br>\r\nValiantly trying to hold their own in the<br>\r\ndecibel ratings, a local bar band was<br>\r\noffering renditions of the latest top 40<br>\r\ntunes while the club jukebox blared<br>\r\ndeafeningly. Avery almost immediately<br>\r\nhailed a familiar face and dragged Douglas<br>\r\nwith him into the throng.<br>\r\nAvery thrust his way to the bar,<br>\r\nwhere the one harried-looking bartender<br>\r\ntook their orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything is on the house tonight, folks,\"<br>\r\nhe shouted, gesturing to the one figure at the<br>\r\nbar who was not in uniform and what appeared<br>\r\nto be his personal security.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery and Douglas got closer to the man.<br>\r\n\"Jeezus pleezus,\"<br>\r\nAvery groaned.<br>\r\n\u201cLook at him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe civilian Couldn\u2019t have been<br>\r\nolder than 18.<br>\r\nHe was  six feet tall and some change<br>\r\nand<br>\r\nabout two hundred thirty pounds.<br>\r\nThick bleached-blond hair<br>\r\nhung over his<br>\r\nears and collar.<br>\r\nHe looked like a rich football jock<br>\r\ncrossed with someone who could\u2019ve<br>\r\nhad military family background.<br>\r\nHe was dressed in a blue silk shirt<br>\r\nand khaki slacks over heavy black<br>\r\nboots. As he raised his glass a<br>\r\nRolex watch appeared on his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo diamond-stud earrings adorned his<br>\r\nleft ear lobe. A white silk scarf was tied<br>\r\ncowboy-fashion around his neck and a<br>\r\nblack ten-gallon hat adorned his head.<br>\r\nHe was waving a credit card in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYEEEEEEE-HAWWWWWWW!\" he shouted.<br>\r\n\"Y'ALL Air Force folks are THEE BEST!<br>\r\nBarkeep, another round for these good folks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, he's gorgeous,\" Douglas smirked.<br>\r\nShe accepted her beer and sipped.<br>\r\nAvery was in the motion of chugging his<br>\r\nscotch-and-coke when he was bumped from<br>\r\nbehind. He choked but did not spill his drink<br>\r\nand turned to snap at the interloper,<br>\r\nbut when he saw another familiar face<br>\r\nhe smiled instead.</span></div></div>",

Douglas exchanged<br>\r\ngreetings with the officer, who grabbed<br>\r\nAvery by the arm and dragged him away.<br>\r\nDouglas smiled and turned back to the bar.<br>\r\nAnother shout from the civilian hurt her<br>\r\nears and attracted her attention.<br>\r\nShe watched as he sipped his own drink,<br>\r\nJust a plain Coke and clapped backs and<br>\r\nshoulders as they came within range of<br>\r\nhis arms. Probably another oil-made<br>\r\nmillionaire's son with an patriot complex,<br>\r\nshe reflected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he homed in on a female<br>\r\nofficer, took off his hat with a flourish<br>\r\nand bowed deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, little lady,\"<br>\r\nthe civilian suddenly said.<br>\r\n\"Ah'd be pleased to buy y'all a drink and dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks, but no thanks,\"<br>\r\nthe female lieutenant replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Ah in-sist,\" the man persisted.<br>\r\nDouglas watched as he unsuccessfully tried<br>\r\nto wrangle the female officer over<br>\r\nbeside himself. He seemed downcast for a<br>\r\nmoment, then broke into a huge smile and<br>\r\nshouted again. Douglas began to feel<br>\r\nsuspicious of the overbearing civilian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something unusual about<br>\r\nthe guy. His accent. It was not quite<br>\r\nright--southern, yes, but not true Texan.<br>\r\nDouglas, a native of San Antonio, could<br>\r\nalways tell the difference between a genuine<br>\r\nTexan and a phony. Well, perhaps he<br>\r\nwas a recent transplant, immured in<br>\r\nhis new surroundings. Anything was possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, folks, it's been great meeting y'all,\"<br>\r\nthe man said suddenly, looking at his watch,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut ah got ta find out what's happenin'<br>\r\nwith my repair folks. Barkeep,\"<br>\r\nhe raised his voice again and dropped<br>\r\na big fat stack of $100 bills and a stack of<br>\r\n$50 bills on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"anything these folks want tonight<br>\r\nis on me. Just keep it on runnin'!\"<br>\r\nHis declaration was greeted with applause<br>\r\nand laughter. He waved his hat at the<br>\r\ncrowd and weaved his way across the<br>\r\nfloor of the club, asking one of the<br>\r\nwaitresses a question as he went.<br>\r\nShe pointed, and he headed<br>\r\ntowards the restrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a character, Douglas thought.<br>\r\nShe looked around the room for<br>\r\nfamiliar faces--she could see Avery<br>\r\nhuddled with a group of pilots around a<br>\r\nlarge table. She recognized their sleeve<br>\r\npatches--the 10th Squadron of the 33rd<br>\r\nFighter Group, F-15 Eagle pilots.<br>\r\nShe left her place at the bar and began<br>\r\nto head towards the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men's room door was in her line<br>\r\nof sight and she saw it swing open.<br>\r\nAn Air Force major stepped out,<br>\r\noutfitted in the blue dress uniform<br>\r\nand aigulette of the Air Police<br>\r\nand carrying a small plastic case.<br>\r\nThe uniform was surprisingly wrinkled<br>\r\nand rumpled-looking.<br>\r\nHis face seemed familiar, but her<br>\r\nvision was blocked by a mass of bodies<br>\r\nheading towards the bar before she<br>\r\ncould get a good look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw the major disappear out the<br>\r\nfront double doors of the Club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Mere, come on over here,\"<br>\r\nAvery called.<br>\r\n\"Guys, you'll recognize this voice, I'm sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDouglas turned to the waiting group.<br>\r\nSeveral arms stuck out, waving<br>\r\nher over. She smiled and joined<br>\r\nthe group. When Avery introduced her<br>\r\nall the pilots insisted on shaking her<br>\r\nhand. Her AWACS had been<br>\r\nresponsible for much of their air<br>\r\ncontrol during the Gulf War and<br>\r\nthat they credited her and her crew<br>\r\nwith helping them achieve two kills.<br>\r\nA happy shop conversation arose<br>\r\nand Douglas forgot her depression,<br>\r\nand that Air Police major.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa had curled herself atop the<br>\r\nquadruple bed in her laboratory<br>\r\nroom-turned-prison cell, watching<br>\r\nthe minutes on the clock installed in her<br>\r\nroom tick by. It read 1755--five fifty-five pm.<br>\r\nDoctor Turner had said he would return<br>\r\nin two hours, and that was around<br>\r\nthree fifteen--over two and a half hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa focused on listening for any noise<br>\r\nthat might herald the arrival of someone<br>\r\nto her room, but save for the whisper of<br>\r\nair entering through the ventilators the<br>\r\nonly thing heard was the creaking of her<br>\r\nbed as she shifted position.<br>\r\nShe pulled at the sides of her<br>\r\nparachute-turned-dress to ease<br>\r\nthe feeling of constriction across her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2019Another few hours and this<br>\r\nthing'll be a backless mini,</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had cried herself out quietly an<br>\r\nhour before but her eyes still itched.<br>\r\nShe rubbed them, then looked at<br>\r\nthe clock again. Six o'clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Felix Milbury rose from his<br>\r\nchair in the lounge of the Armstrong<br>\r\nLaboratory building and stretched his<br>\r\nshoulders. The last ten hours had been<br>\r\nan extraordinary, exhausting time for the<br>\r\nneat, natty NASA exobiologist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExamining that giantess was so<br>\r\namazing, and frightening--she had<br>\r\npicked up a technician a short while<br>\r\nago and used him for a bowling ball<br>\r\nand Milbury among others as pins.<br>\r\nHis knees still hurt from contact with<br>\r\nthe floor. Milbury yawned and wandered<br>\r\nfrom the lounge towards the main floor<br>\r\nlavatory. Inside the neat, warm<br>\r\nroom--only the government would<br>\r\nmaintain a mandated ninety-degree<br>\r\ntemperature inside a men's room in hot,<br>\r\nhumid Texas--the only other occupant<br>\r\nwas a major in an Air Force uniform at<br>\r\none of the two urinals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilbury noticed the shoulders of his<br>\r\ndress jacket were damp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRaining out there, huh?\"<br>\r\nMilbury said conversationally.<br>\r\nThe major nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Cats and dogs for a bit.<br>\r\nI hope it eases up before I leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilbury smiled and used the open facility,<br>\r\nyawning again. He followed the major to<br>\r\nthe sinks, pulling off his jacket.<br>\r\nHis security card, hanging on a chain<br>\r\naround his neck, flopped into the sink as he<br>\r\nbent to wash his hands.<br>\r\nWith a snort he pulled the card from his<br>\r\nneck and set it on the basin lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have a good day now,\"<br>\r\nhe heard the major say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you too,\" he replied, indulging in<br>\r\nanother jaw-popping yawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rinsed his hands and turned to grab<br>\r\nsome hand towels. He pulled on his jacket,<br>\r\nrubbed his face and walked out of the<br>\r\nlavatory, not seeing or remembering his card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-A Short time later-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa tensed when she heard the outer<br>\r\ndoor open. One man entered the vestibule<br>\r\nbetween the two doors to her room,<br>\r\ndressed in the now-familiar anticontamination<br>\r\ngarb and carrying a small plastic case.<br>\r\nThe man stopped and looked at her for<br>\r\na moment, tilting his head back and forth. </span></div></div>",

Lisa closed her eyes and bent<br>\r\nher head so she would not have to<br>\r\nsee herself being stared at again.<br>\r\nShe heard the man walking quietly,<br>\r\nthen a snapping noise made her lift<br>\r\nher head. The man had removed the<br>\r\nmirror covering the security camera on<br>\r\nthe wall. He reached into his case<br>\r\nand pulled out a square black box<br>\r\ntrailing two wires.<br>\r\nHe attached the wires to the back of<br>\r\nthe now exposed camera, hung the<br>\r\nblack box from the camera bracket<br>\r\nand became engrossed in whatever<br>\r\nhe was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa sighed, and bent her head again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later she heard a loud click.<br>\r\nShe looked up. His back to her,<br>\r\nthe technician was in the process of pulling off his anticontamination suit. She watched, puzzled,<br>\r\nas he slipped the helmet from his head,<br>\r\nrevealing a shock of bright blond hair.<br>\r\nHe let the suit fall into a heap at his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was dressed in a blue uniform adorned<br>\r\nwith some kind of striped cord wound around<br>\r\nhis left arm and shoulder.<br>\r\nHe grabbed his hair and pulled.<br>\r\nThe blond wig came away, leaving<br>\r\nbrown hair that was recently shorn and<br>\r\ncombed straight back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa's mouth dropped open and she began<br>\r\nto rise from her bed. The man rubbed his<br>\r\nhair briefly, then turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey cutie, I see someone\u2019s been growing<br>\r\nup a bit while I was gone\u201d he quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA  smile creasing his face he added.<br>\r\n\u201cI missed you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMichael\u201d Lisa exclaimed \u201cMichael\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael came towards her, his eyes bright,<br>\r\nhis smile broad. Lisa fell to her knees and<br>\r\nreached out to him. As he came within the<br>\r\ncircle of her arms she lifted him off the floor,<br>\r\nhugging him to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou Idiot! You dope! Baka I cant believe it.<br>\r\nI can\u2019t believe you came for me!<br>\r\nYou dummy you know they\u2019re after you too!<br>\r\nYou stupid idiot you should\u2019ve just forgot about<br>\r\nme and went on with your life!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause as she cried and hugged<br>\r\nhim.<br>\r\n\u201cMoron I\u2019m not worth causing you trouble!<br>\r\nAnd no one asked you to come back for me<br>\r\nStupid Baka\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears of joy spurted from her eyes as<br>\r\nshe felt his hands around her neck.<br>\r\nLisa looked at Michael, carefully<br>\r\nleaned forward and returned his feet<br>\r\nto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere that\u2019s better! Not that I didn\u2019t like<br>\r\nbeing closer to those adorable boobs of<br>\r\nyours\u201d he joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ignored it for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Michael\u2014 she began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at him as he stood in the<br>\r\ngap between her thighs--thighs that were<br>\r\nbig as his torso. His forehead was now<br>\r\nlevel with her shoulders as she sat on<br>\r\nher heels. Gulping back her tears she held<br>\r\none trembling hand to her lips and reached<br>\r\nout with the other hand to touch his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael leaned his head into her palm--it<br>\r\nwas astonishing to see his head almost<br>\r\nfit into her hand--and kissed it.<br>\r\nShe blushed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed you, Lisa,\" he said.<br>\r\n\"I'm-I'm sorry I let us become separated.<br>\r\nWhen I saw those bastards take you--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa saw Michael\u2019s eyes begin to mist over.<br>\r\nShe began to cry anew and bent down to<br>\r\ngather him again in her arms.<br>\r\nFlinging his hands around her neck<br>\r\nMichael pressed his face into the curve<br>\r\nof her throat. Crying all the while, she<br>\r\nsqueezed him in her arms until he<br>\r\ngrunted for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm never going to let anyone take<br>\r\nyou away from me again,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re my Tsundere Cutie and mine alone\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's not your fault, it's not your fault,\"<br>\r\nshe chanted, pressing his torso and legs<br>\r\ninto her. It felt so good--so right--for him<br>\r\nto be in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Michael, I'm so glad to see you<br>\r\nagain, so happy, so happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael began to squirm in her arms and<br>\r\nLisa  reluctantly released him back to<br>\r\nthe floor. He reached up and stroked her<br>\r\nface, rubbing her chin, caressing her lips.<br>\r\nShe kissed his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod, I'm glad to see you again cutie,\"<br>\r\nhe said, his voice harsh.<br>\r\nHe sniffed and cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever did you find me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story, cutie.<br>\r\nI'll tell you on the way home.<br>\r\nLet\u2019s just say there may have been some<br>\r\nLaw breaking involved but then again them<br>\r\ngoons haven\u2019t exactly treated you legally or<br>\r\nethically as I understand it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa sat up straight and she gripped<br>\r\nMichael  by the shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c'The way home'? Michael are you<br>\r\nas crazy as you are stupid, they're not<br>\r\ngoing to let me go from here. I was<br>\r\ntaken by military people. They brought<br>\r\nme to this place to study me.

Yours was the only<br>\r\noccupied one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe led Lisa into what looked like a<br>\r\nlobby area. A large square kiosk stood<br>\r\nin the center of the lobby, deserted.<br>\r\nFrom her perspective she could see half<br>\r\nempty coffee cups and scattered papers on<br>\r\nthe table inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is everybody?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably either fighting the dumpster fire<br>\r\n1 of my helpers set or the trash can fire I set<br>\r\nor dealing with the experimental maximum<br>\r\nstrength  laxatives my other helper slipped<br>\r\ninto their food and drinks across various parts of<br>\r\nthe base\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked incredulous at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe tossed in a tire for good measure  to<br>\r\nmake sure it stayed nice and smoky.<br>\r\nWhen I ran into the building yelling 'fire'<br>\r\nthe two guys here snatched up fire<br>\r\nextinguishers and very kindly went running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laxatives were just plan B but also<br>\r\npayback to the bastards that took you<br>\r\nfrom me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael turned abruptly to a short hallway.<br>\r\nAt its end was what looked like a solid fire<br>\r\ndoor. He walked quickly to it and pulled on<br>\r\nthe handle. A small piece of plastic slipped<br>\r\nfrom between the jamb and the door.<br>\r\nMichael looked back at Lisa and waggled<br>\r\nhis eyebrows, then he looked down and flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhew,\" he said. \"Don't do that.\"<br>\r\nLisa looked down at herself.<br>\r\nHer breasts were pressing firmly into<br>\r\nher parachute garb, stretching the neck<br>\r\nhole and revealing her still developing cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael's observation was so ridiculous<br>\r\nand inappropriate Lisa found herself smiling<br>\r\nat him for his apparent distraction.<br>\r\nHe peered around the corner of the door,<br>\r\nthen turned back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooking good,\" he said.<br>\r\n\u201cAll the activity seems to be elsewhere<br>\r\njust as planned! Let\u2019s go\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he flung open the door,<br>\r\nLisa following at a half-crouch. He ran full<br>\r\ntilt toward a dingy white van parked<br>\r\npartially on the grassy verge next to the<br>\r\nbuilding. Reaching the rear doors he<br>\r\nyanked them open, hinges squealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn you go,\" he said, bowing her into the<br>\r\nback of the van with a flourish. The rear<br>\r\nof the vehicle was almost empty, uncarpeted<br>\r\nand very dirty.<br>\r\nThe slamming doors hurt Lisa's ears.<br>\r\nShe crouched under the low ceiling of the<br>\r\nvan, twisting around to observe<br>\r\nMichael  as he jumped into the driver's seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled out a key and twisted it in<br>\r\nthe ignition switch. The starter ran, and<br>\r\nran. Michael began pumping the pedal,<br>\r\nreleased the key, then turned it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMichael\u201d Lisa whispered, touching his shoulder.<br>\r\nShe could see him sweating as he pumped<br>\r\nthe gas pedal again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The best-laid plans\u2026\" he muttered, turning<br>\r\nthe key again. This time the van's engine<br>\r\nroared to life with a backfire that<br>\r\nechoed like a shot.<br>\r\nMichael put the van in gear and roared<br>\r\naway from the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked out the front window<br>\r\nof the van as Michael raced down<br>\r\nthe road. In the distance she could<br>\r\nsee a large airport control tower<br>\r\nsilhouetted against an evening sun<br>\r\npeeking from under dark storm clouds.<br>\r\nOnce out of the area of the medical facility<br>\r\nMichael  slowed a little and rolled down the<br>\r\nwindow, allowing in the outside air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa leaned over his shoulder and sucked<br>\r\nthe air in greedily. It smelled of jet fuel,<br>\r\nairplane exhaust and the outside world.<br>\r\nShe welcomed the change from the filtered<br>\r\nair she had been inhaling for the last<br>\r\ntwo days. Two days. Had it been only<br>\r\ntwo days? To Lisa it felt like a lifetime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't keep away the sense fear<br>\r\nfor Michael  and herself combined with<br>\r\na feeling of sheer audacity at their<br>\r\nescape effort.<br>\r\nShe gripped Michael's shoulder to<br>\r\nsteady herself as he began to turn<br>\r\nfrom the street towards another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are we going?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to get as close to where my<br>\r\nplane is parked as possible before leaving<br>\r\nthe streets for the tarmac,\" Michael  replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDashing onto the airfield will attract all<br>\r\nkinds of attention no matter how many<br>\r\ndistractions we\u2019ve laid.<br>\r\nThe less time spent on<br>\r\nthe tarmac, the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait just how many distractions are there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell besides me and my help that will be<br>\r\naccompanying us on my plane I found a couple<br>\r\nof guys on this base that hate both this<br>\r\nLang and this Turner guy. I found out they<br>\r\nwere overseeing your \u201ccase\u201d and as far as the<br>\r\nguys know they\u2019re just pulling pranks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I understand it Turner was going to<br>\r\nget glued to his office chair and<br>\r\nLang\u2019s Office door was going to be wielded<br>\r\nshut with him and his underlings in a conference\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa had to stifle a chuckle but internally<br>\r\nshe was had to admit satisfaction out of it.</span></div></div>",

She took one step off the curb when<br>\r\nthe roar of a car engine and a loud screeching<br>\r\nscared her back onto the sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dirty, dented white van had come<br>\r\nracing down the street and its driver had to<br>\r\nstomp the brakes to prevent a collision with her.<br>\r\nDouglas fixed her darkest look possible on<br>\r\nthe driver, a brown-haired man wearing an<br>\r\nAir Force uniform but with no cover on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere the hell's the fire?\" she shouted.<br>\r\n\u201cDon't you know it's fifteen miles an hour<br>\r\nin this area?

That sorry--\" Douglas stopped.<br>\r\nWhy was that man so familiar?<br>\r\nThe van was certainly being driven for all it<br>\r\nwas worth. Douglas watched as it headed<br>\r\nout from the barracks area towards the tarmac.<br>\r\nShe called up in her mind's eye the man<br>\r\nin the van. Who did he resemble?<br>\r\nDouglas tried to recall what else she saw in<br>\r\nthe van.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe setting sun had illuminated the<br>\r\ninterior clearly. There was something big and<br>\r\nround, covered by what looked like a tarp<br>\r\nright beside him.<br>\r\nSomething was on his right<br>\r\nshoulder--why did she get the<br>\r\nimpression that it was a human hand,<br>\r\na hand with fingers so long--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDouglas turned around wildly as a loud<br>\r\ncar horn interrupted her. She realized she<br>\r\nhad wandered out into the road while<br>\r\nruminating over that van and its occupant.<br>\r\nThe honking Humvee slowed as it<br>\r\napproached her, and she thrust out her hand,<br>\r\npointing the driver over to the curb.<br>\r\nShe pulled open the driver's door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, you wanna not block the road?<br>\r\nUh, sorry, sir--ma'am!\" the driver said.<br>\r\nDouglas leaned into the driver's side door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got a radio in this vehicle, soldier?\"<br>\r\nshe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, ma'am,\" the private--the stenciled<br>\r\nname on his fatigues read DANIELS--replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, ma'am, I'm really sorry--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget that, private.

Suddenly she pointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n\"Get us over to that airplane.\"<br>\r\nDaniels drove the humvee around the<br>\r\nnested group of civilian aircraft--most<br>\r\nbelonging to Air Force pilots--towards<br>\r\na sleek, futuristic-looking white<br>\r\ncommuter jet. The van was parked beside it,<br>\r\nits rear doors facing the airplane.<br>\r\nDaniels saw a man jump from the cab<br>\r\nof the van and race up a small ladder<br>\r\non the side of the plane.<br>\r\nThe van began to roll away from the<br>\r\njet unattended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit, sir--ma'am--that van's still in gear,\"<br>\r\nDaniels called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop the hummer.

Daniels stood on the<br>\r\nbrakes and the humvee slid to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Douglas and Daniels jumped from<br>\r\nthe heavy military car, Daniels sprinting<br>\r\ntowards the freewheeling van and<br>\r\nDouglas towards the commuter jet a<br>\r\nhundred meters away.<br>\r\nShe would later wonder who had built the<br>\r\nthing--it was shaped more like a military<br>\r\nairplane than any kind of private or commuter<br>\r\ncraft, sleek and needle-nosed, with a<br>\r\nconformal air intake slung under the<br>\r\nbody and sharply angled wings and tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached it quickly and dashed up the<br>\r\nladder, pausing as she reached the top.<br>\r\nAll of the passenger viewports shades<br>\r\nwere drawn, darkening the passenger<br>\r\ncabin. Douglas jumped as some whining<br>\r\nmechanism closed the passenger door<br>\r\nbehind her, leaving her in near-total darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw a faint light to her right<br>\r\ncoming from<br>\r\nthe open cockpit door and she strode<br>\r\ninto the space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, mister, just what the hell<br>\r\ndo you think you're doing?\"<br>\r\nshe demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man turned and looked at her in<br>\r\nopen-mouthed astonishment.<br>\r\nHe was indeed the rumpled Air<br>\r\nPolice major she had seen before<br>\r\nat the Officer's Club--or somebody<br>\r\ndressed to look like one. In his hands<br>\r\nwere what looked like very thick sunglasses<br>\r\nwired to a panel beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDouglas had interrupted him in the act of<br>\r\nputting them on.<br>\r\nNext to him were 2 Men In Black looking fellas<br>\r\nwearing masks as if cat burglars however the<br>\r\none she recognized as the security guard or<br>\r\npersonal body guard that had been next to the<br>\r\nman at the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, buddy, you've all got a lot of explaining<br>\r\nto do SWEET MOTHER OF GOD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDouglas felt a touch on her shoulder,<br>\r\nspun around and fell backwards into the<br>\r\ncockpit. Crouching in the passenger cabin<br>\r\nnot two feet behind her was an incredibly<br>\r\nenormous teenage girl dressed in what<br>\r\nlooked like a torn-up parachute.<br>\r\nThe girls  head was so big it filled the cockpit<br>\r\ndoor. Douglas heard someone yammering<br>\r\nincoherently and realized it was herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared up at this gigantic face<br>\r\nframed by a disorderly mass of hair,<br>\r\nlooking down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, whoever you are, I'd like you to meet<br>\r\nLisa Porter. Lisa, whoever-she-is,\" <br>\r\nthe man spoke softly, his voice rich<br>\r\nwith amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello,\" the giant face said.<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don't be afraid. I'm not<br>\r\ngoing to hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What-what-what-what-what,\"<br>\r\nDouglas stammered. Lisa sighed sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMichael, what do we do about her?\" she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, we'll figure something out,\" he replied,<br>\r\nputting on the sunglasses.<br>\r\nHe threw a switch and began turning his<br>\r\nhead this way and that.<br>\r\nLisa heard him utter a soft curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, whoever-you-are,<br>\r\nyou're coming with us,\" he announced. <br>\r\n\u201cThere are five people surrounding us,<br>\r\nso reopening the door is not an option. <br>\r\nLisa, you should be able to lie on the floor<br>\r\nback there. I know that's not very comfortable<br>\r\nbut this takeoff might be a bit harsh.<br>\r\nOkay, Air Force, why don\u2019t you take<br>\r\none of the co-pilot's chairs.<br>\r\nBe careful where you place your feet.\"</span></div></div>",

He pushed the throttle levers<br>\r\nforward until the engines ignited.<br>\r\nHe lifted the sunglasses above his eyes<br>\r\nmomentarily and eyed Douglas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not this airplane, Lieutenant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaptain,\" Douglas snapped.<br>\r\nShe slowly rose from the cockpit floor and<br>\r\nclumsily seated herself into one of the<br>\r\nco-pilot's chairs. As she occupied the<br>\r\nchair it suddenly jerked and slid forward<br>\r\ninto the cockpit space, startling her further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Captain, then,\" Michael replied.<br>\r\nSeveral soft pings were heard in the cockpit<br>\r\nand passenger cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Douglas demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your fellow soldiers are shooting at us,\"<br>\r\nMichael  exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael--\" Lisa began.

He advanced the throttles<br>\r\nand the engines wound up incredibly fast.<br>\r\nDouglas felt like she was being pushed<br>\r\nfrom behind as the plane accelerated.<br>\r\nThe plane swerved suddenly left, then<br>\r\nright, then left again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?!\"<br>\r\nDouglas snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying to dodge roadblocks,\"<br>\r\nMichael answered.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, here's the runway. Canards out,<br>\r\nwings in full flap configuration--and away we go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed the throttles forward to the<br>\r\nstops and tilted his right hand back.<br>\r\nImmediately the airplane tilted up.<br>\r\nDouglas could feel the landing gear leave<br>\r\nthe earth. Michael kept the airplane at an<br>\r\naggressive angle, the g-forces pressing<br>\r\nthem into their seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\" Michael  said, leveling off the plane<br>\r\nand pulling back on the throttles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, on with the show.\" He raised his voice.<br>\r\n\"Computer-cockpit-display-on-execute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDouglas heard a beep and the<br>\r\nblank walls of the cockpit suddenly<br>\r\ncame to life. Where before she was sitting<br>\r\nin a chair staring at blank bulkheads<br>\r\nshe now appeared to be inside a cockpit<br>\r\nwith walls of glass. The small panel in<br>\r\nfront of her also flashed into life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDouglas looked at the symbols and<br>\r\nobjects flashing on the walls around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck me,\" she murmured.<br>\r\nMichael  removed the V-R glasses<br>\r\nand grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Works good,\" he said. He looked over<br>\r\nhis shoulder. \"Lisa, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she replied, thrusting her head back<br>\r\ninto the cockpit, her voice strained.<br>\r\nDouglas saw her again, screamed in fright and<br>\r\nclutched at her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComputer-radar-report-mode-execute,\"<br>\r\nMichael  uttered in the same loud,<br>\r\nsingsong monotone he had used before.<br>\r\nA series of readouts appeared on the<br>\r\ndisplay panel before him and intermittent<br>\r\nbeeps and hums could be heard in the<br>\r\ncockpit's speakers.<br>\r\nIt took Douglas a moment to orient herself<br>\r\nto the displays and sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell kind of airplane is this?\"<br>\r\nshe asked.<br>\r\n\"You're detecting every radar painting you<br>\r\nwithin a hundred miles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We call it the Special, or<br>\r\nthe Security Special.\"<br>\r\nHis head was on a swivel, looking<br>\r\naround, up and down.<br>\r\nDouglas saw that the image of the sky<br>\r\nsurrounding them even showed on the<br>\r\nfloor beneath their footrests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy company designed it for use by<br>\r\ngovernment officials or industrial executives <br>\r\nwho need protection from terrorists or other<br>\r\ngovernments.

Lisa, I think<br>\r\nthey've launched fighters to chase us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, God.\" Lisa put her hands up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God is right,\" Douglas snapped.<br>\r\nShe was listening to the sound of the<br>\r\nradars tracking the airplane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I recognize that radar signature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to clue us in?\" Michael said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do yourself a favor. Turn on your radio<br>\r\nand tell them your coming back, nice and slow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael, no,\" Lisa said. Michael shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way in Hell am I taking you back there,<br>\r\nLisa not after all those bastards have done<br>\r\nto you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reconsider, flyboy,\" Douglas said.<br>\r\n\u201cYou've got the varsity chasing you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat means there are two F-15 Eagles<br>\r\nafter you. They're from the 33rd Fighter<br>\r\nGroup based at Eglin Air Force Base.<br>\r\nThey're air combat veterans, the best of the best!<br>\r\nYou're not going to get away from them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael sighed. <br>\r\n\"This isn't easy at all,\" he muttered.<br>\r\nHe turned to Lisa and patted her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe're not going back. Let's see if my<br>\r\npeople are as smart as I figure them to be.<br>\r\nComputer-chart-overlay-execute.\"<br>\r\nDouglas' eyes boggled as a three-dimensional<br>\r\nversion of an air navigation chart appeared over<br>\r\nthe image in the cockpit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now the nearest big city is...<br>\r\nDallas-Forth Worth. Here we go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed the airplane's nose down<br>\r\nand turned the airplane slightly, heading<br>\r\ntowards the city.</span></div></div>",

It would be mete<br>\r\nthat Mackenzie would know Turner's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is impossible at this time, General,\"<br>\r\nresponded. Mackenzie's eyebrows came together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Colonel--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRifle 107 to base,\"<br>\r\na radio call interrupted him.<br>\r\n\"Target has slowed to 200 knots<br>\r\nand is executing a circle around the<br>\r\ncity at five thousand feet.<br>\r\nRequest instructions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"General,\" Lang said suddenly,<br>\r\n\u201cyou must order that airplane be forced<br>\r\ndown or shot down.

His ultrasleek,<br>\r\nsophisticated F-15 Eagle handled like a<br>\r\ndream at Mach 1 but was a bitch at one<br>\r\nhundred sixty knots, shuddering and rolling<br>\r\nat near-stall speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had already dropped his flaps and<br>\r\ndeployed his landing gear and<br>\r\nspeed brake to keep in position behind<br>\r\nthe airplane. His wingman had done the<br>\r\nsame. Snow looked at his fuel tapes.<br>\r\nThe gauges were steadily winding down<br>\r\nas his aircraft's powerful twin Pratt and<br>\r\nWhitney F-100 turbofans guzzled fuel.<br>\r\nHe had already expended all the fuel in<br>\r\nhis drop tanks and wing tanks, and now<br>\r\nhis fuselage tank was being steadily drained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJugs, what's your fuel state?\"<br>\r\nhe asked over the radio.<br>\r\n\"Six point oh,\" Jones replied.<br>\r\nSix thousand pounds, and they were<br>\r\nburning ten thousand pounds an hour<br>\r\nat this ridiculously slow rate of speed.<br>\r\nHe looked at the flashing anticollision<br>\r\nlights of the commuter plane.<br>\r\nIt was being steered carefully, never anywhere<br>\r\nnear any high-rise buildings and as far away<br>\r\nfrom the Dallas International Airport as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat pilot was real smart,<br>\r\nSnow decided--making us burn our fuel<br>\r\nlike this meant they would have to do<br>\r\nsomething soon or break off to land or tank<br>\r\nwith a refueling aircraft--if any were available.<br>\r\nSnow thumbed his radio switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brooks control, this is Rifle 107.<br>\r\nMy fuel state is five point nine. Request instructions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Brooks Air Force Base<br>\r\nOperations Center<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you insane?\" Mackenzie demanded.<br>\r\nLang's expression was unchanging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Major, you have seen my authority and<br>\r\nyou have my order. Shoot that plane down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"General Mackenzie? Sir?\"<br>\r\nEisley turned to Mackenzie<br>\r\nwhose face was black with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon, disregard Colonel Lang here.<br>\r\nCall the duty sergeant to the ops room<br>\r\nwith his sidearm. That is my direct order<br>\r\nto you on my personal authority as<br>\r\ncommander of this base,\"<br>\r\nMackenzie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took two steps and planted himself<br>\r\ndirectly in front of Lang, his bulk<br>\r\ntowering over the colonel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLang, I hope you can hide behind that<br>\r\npiece of paper you're carrying,\"<br>\r\nhe said softly.<br>\r\n\"I really do. When I report this to the Pentagon<br>\r\nevery officer senior to you will compete<br>\r\nto chair a court of inquiry into your actions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLang kept his expression calm but inwardly<br>\r\nhe was seething. Goddamned military<br>\r\nbureaucrat--that ET-affected woman was<br>\r\ngetting away! Turner had already screwed<br>\r\nthings up altogether, first by not handling<br>\r\nher properly and then by not getting that<br>\r\ndamned object that was described to have<br>\r\npotentially caused her change in the first place,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow the hell had his so called experts missed<br>\r\nsomething in the oversized slut\u2019s stomach?<br>\r\nOn top of that how wasn\u2019t it reported<br>\r\nimmediately to him and now they were<br>\r\nflying around, free as birds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to regroup now, to<br>\r\nappear to give in. Let the gargantuan<br>\r\nbitch come down out of the sky<br>\r\nsomeplace, and he'll be there to bag her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, Tommy. Good,\"<br>\r\nMackenzie said as a huge black<br>\r\nAir Force sergeant entered the room.<br>\r\nHis nameplate read T. WATERS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTommy, Colonel Lang here is under<br>\r\nhouse arrest until I complete a report to<br>\r\nthe Pentagon on the events here today.<br>\r\nTake him to his quarters and lock him in.<br>\r\nPost guards on his door. Remove his<br>\r\ntelephone from his room--Lang, you'll get<br>\r\nyour opportunity to speak your piece<br>\r\nafter I talk to the Pentagon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeneral, you don't understand the danger--\"<br>\r\nLang began. Sergeant Waters<br>\r\ngrabbed his arm in an iron grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will go to your quarters now, sir,\"<br>\r\nWaters said. Lang allowed his expression<br>\r\nto slip from his control for a moment,<br>\r\nthen he acquiesced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, sir,\" Eisley muttered as the<br>\r\nops room door closed behind Lang.<br>\r\nMackenzie pursed his lips and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the status of the chase?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Over the Dallas-Forth Worth Metroplex<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, you guys, let go,\"<br>\r\nMichael  muttered under his breath.<br>\r\nHe had slowed his airplane to its minimum<br>\r\nflight speed but the two fighters<br>\r\nhung on behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you,\" Douglas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMichael maybe she's right.<br>\r\nMaybe we should go back,\"<br>\r\nLisa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDouglas was astounded that someone<br>\r\nso big could sound so timid and shy even.<br>\r\nMichael frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be damned if I'm going to let those<br>\r\nbastards get hold of you again to torture<br>\r\nyou more Lisa! You\u2019re not some monster,<br>\r\nlab rat or thing to be mistreated and<br>\r\ndissected! For fuck sakes they practically<br>\r\ntore your arm off based on those bandages!<br>\r\nCaptain, what's the stall speed of those fighters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDouglas looked at him but said nothing.<br>\r\n\"Come on, Captain!\" Michael shouted.<br>\r\n\u201cIf they're crazy enough to shoot us down<br>\r\nyou go down, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It-it depends,\" she replied, obvious<br>\r\nreluctance in her voice.<br>\r\n\u201cWith flaps down and gear out it's around<br>\r\na hundred fifty five knots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo slow. Dammit,\" Michael muttered.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I can't get them away from me by<br>\r\ngoing slower than them.<br>\r\nI'll try something else. Okay, Captain,<br>\r\nwhat's their ceiling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTop altitude is eighty thousand feet,\"<br>\r\nDouglas replied.<br>\r\nMichael swallowed and licked his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMine's 50 thousand feet higher,\" he said.<br>\r\n\u201cLisa, Everyone, hang on. I'm going for altitude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDouglas was shocked the other 2 men<br>\r\nremained calm and stoic the entire time<br>\r\nunphased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled back on the control handle<br>\r\nand pushed the throttles to their maximum<br>\r\nposition. The airplane accelerated rapidly<br>\r\nand its nose rose into the sky.<br>\r\nDouglas watched as the airspeed display<br>\r\non the screens in front of her rapidly<br>\r\nreached Mach one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a shuddering thud, then<br>\r\nsmooth silence. Michael reached out to<br>\r\nanother button over his head and pressed it.<br>\r\nThe plane began to shudder again,<br>\r\nthen it smoothed and accelerated even more.</span></div></div>",

The Air Force captain who had<br>\r\nintruded into Lisa's escape sat in 1 of<br>\r\nthe co-pilots chair, observing the displays<br>\r\nilluminating the cockpit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy first advantage was that Lang<br>\r\nused a cellular phone,\" he continued.<br>\r\n\u201cAfter I escaped from New York I started<br>\r\ncalling some of my people to help. I<br>\r\nfirst contacted someone I'll call Frank,<br>\r\nwho's been a computer programmer for<br>\r\nover twenty years. I asked him to hack into<br>\r\nthe telephone company's computers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found one cellular phone used<br>\r\nSunday afternoon in Poughkeepsie<br>\r\nthat had a non-New York area code<br>\r\nin its security code. He filtered the<br>\r\ntelephone numbers that phone had<br>\r\nbeen used to call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the numbers had area code<br>\r\n404 and a prefix number for<br>\r\nNorth Druid Hills--Turner's number<br>\r\nat the Centers for Disease Control<br>\r\nin Atlanta.<br>\r\nThe others were Government use only,<br>\r\nwith area code 801--Utah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael straightened in his seat and<br>\r\nstretched his shoulders. In the dim<br>\r\nlight of the touch switches embedded<br>\r\nin the arm of his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa could see his eyes were red<br>\r\nand shadowed and his face was drawn<br>\r\nwith fatigue. She smiled and nodded for<br>\r\nhim to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrank went a little further and found<br>\r\nthe numbers Turner called after talking to<br>\r\nLang. That guy called everywhere from<br>\r\nNew Hampshire to Hawaii. Then he<br>\r\nchecked the eleven numbers Turner<br>\r\ncalled belonging to individual names<br>\r\nand found that all of them contacted<br>\r\nthe Human Systems Center at Brooks<br>\r\nAir Force Base--the department<br>\r\nresponsible for arranging housing on base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was congregating there after<br>\r\ntalking to Turner, and he was called <br>\r\nin on you. Ergo, you were being<br>\r\ntaken to Brooks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDouglas snorted derisively.<br>\r\n\u201cSome secrecy,\" she muttered.<br>\r\nMichael  gave her his lopsided grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe secrecy thing also worked in<br>\r\nmy favor,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo offense, Captain, but one thing<br>\r\nyou people in the military seem to<br>\r\nforget is when you make something<br>\r\ntop-top-secret the people who could've<br>\r\nprevented actions like mine are kept<br>\r\nin the dark, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact I was counting on no increased<br>\r\nsecurity at the only P-5 treatment lab at<br>\r\nBrooks, which was on the main floor of<br>\r\nthe Armstrong lab building.<br>\r\nElectronic security and the labs' original<br>\r\ndesign intention were supposed to keep<br>\r\nLisa's presence there secret. If Turner<br>\r\nhad increased security--say, by requesting<br>\r\nAir Police to patrol the building twenty<br>\r\nfour hours a day--he would have cut off<br>\r\nmy rescue attempt at the start,<br>\r\nor at least hindered it a bit and<br>\r\npossibly compromised keeping the<br>\r\nsecret because he would need help<br>\r\nfrom somebody outside the immediate<br>\r\ncircle he'd drawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, all I needed to do was defeat the<br>\r\nelectronics--with a pass card I borrowed<br>\r\nfrom one of the scientists and a little<br>\r\nrecorder to give them an image of Lisa<br>\r\non their monitors when she really<br>\r\nwasn't there--and get her out the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDouglas nodded her understanding.<br>\r\nShe snorted again, shook her head,<br>\r\nand gave Michael  a smile of grudging<br>\r\nrespect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one thing I hadn't counted on<br>\r\nwas the size of the hatch they apparently<br>\r\nused to get you in there in the first place,<br>\r\nLisa,\" he said, turning and smiling up in<br>\r\napology at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had a pretty good idea just how much<br>\r\nyou might have grown since I was with<br>\r\nyou last and that door wouldn't do the job.<br>\r\nSo, I improvised with my planned distractions,<br>\r\nand walked you out the front to some<br>\r\nborrowed transportation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really thought it out,\" Douglas said.<br>\r\n\"You've got guts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Michael's turn to snort.<br>\r\n\u201cRight now, Captain, I could shit through<br>\r\na screen door without hitting the wire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDouglas looked at Michael  and burst<br>\r\ninto a fit of semi-hysterical chortling.<br>\r\nShe shook her head again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time one of the black suit wearing<br>\r\nmasked men finally spoke up.<br>\r\nHe had a heavy Russian accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust veremember Michael you didn\u2019t do<br>\r\nit alone. You had help.\u201d<br>\r\nHe paused and noticed the look from<br>\r\nDouglas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd before voo ask Miss Douglas no I\u2019m<br>\r\nnot some VRussian Spy or enemy.<br>\r\nI owe my allegiance and gratitude to our<br>\r\nfriend Michael here and the<br>\r\nUnited States as does my family. Both have<br>\r\ngiven me and my family great opportunities\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDouglas looked mildly relieved.<br>\r\nSo,\" she said softly, her humor and the<br>\r\ntensions subsided,<br>\r\n\"what happens to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael\u2019s expression grew amused.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think will happen to you?<br>\r\nI'll have you taken back to San Antonio,<br>\r\nof course, or wherever else you wish to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't intend to have 'kidnapper' stuck<br>\r\nbehind my name. I already sent a message<br>\r\nto my airfield to have Special Number  Two<br>\r\nwarmed up and ready to go when you<br>\r\nget there. What happens to you after that<br>\r\nI can only guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sent a message? How? I didn't hear<br>\r\nyou talk on a radio at all since we took off,\"<br>\r\nDouglas asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael  motioned to what Douglas had<br>\r\nfirst taken to be a handrest near the left<br>\r\narm of his seat. She noticed the five<br>\r\nbuttons arranged across its surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a keyboard,\" Michael  said.<br>\r\n\"Works on much the same principle as the<br>\r\nkeyboards made for people with serious<br>\r\nhandicaps. With practice you can type<br>\r\nmessages as easily with this as a<br>\r\nfull-size keyboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sent an e-mail to my people at the<br>\r\nairport telling them to fly Special Two<br>\r\nin to my private strip to take you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just going to let me go? Just like that?\"<br>\r\nDouglas asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just like Michael  said, Meredith,\"<br>\r\nLisa said.<br>\r\n\"I don't want to hurt you, or anybody.<br>\r\nNeither does Michael.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDouglas looked up sharply at Lisa's use<br>\r\nof her name.<br>\r\nShe could see the giant teen--who actually<br>\r\nlooked bigger now than she did an hour<br>\r\nago--was utterly earnest.<br>\r\nSo was this Michael character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually I wouldn\u2019t mind smacking around<br>\r\nthe guys that groped you or whomever it<br>\r\nwas that used your arm as a carving board\u201d<br>\r\nMichael joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot helping Michael\u201d said Lisa flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway I told you, Captain,<br>\r\nI'm no kidnapper,\" Michael  said.<br>\r\n\u201cNor a terrorist, a foreign agent<br>\r\nor a little green man from Mars in<br>\r\ndisguise. Neither is Lisa.\"<br>\r\nHe rubbed the giant hand on his arm. </span></div></div>",

I'm not going to<br>\r\nlet some government sphincter-boy lock<br>\r\nLisa or me away.

Watch and see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe symbology running across the<br>\r\nimage suddenly changed.<br>\r\nA single elongated box appeared,<br>\r\nsurrounded by rapidly scrolling<br>\r\nnumerical readouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael  reset the wings to their<br>\r\nnormal configuration, causing the<br>\r\nairplane to shudder and roll side to side<br>\r\nfor a moment then smooth out once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the increased drag of the now<br>\r\naft-pointing wings the plane slowed<br>\r\nmarkedly, but to Douglas it was still<br>\r\ngoing too damned fast towards the<br>\r\ninvisible ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You land by virtual reality, too?\"<br>\r\nDouglas asked, her voice cracking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Big advantage if you need to<br>\r\nland someplace where there is no<br>\r\nestablished airport. Just tell the computer<br>\r\nwhere to land and it shows you<br>\r\nexactly how to get there.<br>\r\nGuides you to within five feet of your<br>\r\nplanned stop point.<br>\r\nYou Air Force folks should like it<br>\r\nwhen you get your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDouglas had a death grip on the<br>\r\narms of her chair as Michael flattened<br>\r\nout and deployed the landing gear.<br>\r\nTwo gentle thumps announced that the<br>\r\nwheels had touched down and<br>\r\nthe airplane began to roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pressed his feet into both<br>\r\npedals and the airplane shuddered<br>\r\nas it slowed. In the illumination from the<br>\r\nairplane's landing lights Douglas could<br>\r\nnow make out the thin macadam airstrip<br>\r\nthey had landed on and the two large<br>\r\nhangars beyond, each with it's own door<br>\r\nlight. As if on cue the anticollision lights<br>\r\nof another airplane became visible as<br>\r\nMichael  brought the airplane to a<br>\r\nsmooth stop and began to power<br>\r\ndown the aircraft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for flying Air Michael,\"<br>\r\nhe said, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds like a bad name for some<br>\r\nshoes endorsed by Michael Jordan\u201d<br>\r\njoked Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael reached between his legs<br>\r\nand released his seat, letting it<br>\r\nretract back to its rest position,<br>\r\nDouglas following his example.<br>\r\nHe stood and stretched, then turned to<br>\r\nLisa , still folded into the space aft of the cockpit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the removal of the seats from<br>\r\nthe passenger cabin of the airplane<br>\r\nit was still a tight fit for Lisa's expanded<br>\r\nbody. It took her a minute of struggling<br>\r\nwith her torso and legs to wend her<br>\r\nway deeper into the passenger cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized that her body had grown to<br>\r\nthe point where her developing bosom<br>\r\nhad occupied almost all the fabric around<br>\r\nher chest, leaving her back exposed,<br>\r\nthe cords holding the folds of her parachute<br>\r\ndress together exerting increasingly<br>\r\ngreater pressure on her ribs and belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another awkward reminder to Lisa<br>\r\nthat where once she had been as flat<br>\r\nchested as a newborn now she had to be<br>\r\nsomewhere in the B cup range by her guess<br>\r\nwere she still a normal sized person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation of the carpet rubbing<br>\r\nagainst her buttocks suddenly called to<br>\r\nLisa's attention that she was now so<br>\r\nlarge that her dress was now a<br>\r\nmicro-miniskirt that barely covered her<br>\r\nhips and she wore no panties or<br>\r\nother undergarments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing hotly, she stuffed the front<br>\r\nof her dress into her crotch to hide<br>\r\nher privates.<br>\r\nMichael noticed her motion, spun on his<br>\r\nheel and interposed himself between<br>\r\nher and Douglas, gently propelling<br>\r\nDouglas with one hand on her back<br>\r\nand working to open the door and<br>\r\ndeploy the boarding ladder with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter you, Captain,\" he said cheerfully.<br>\r\nDouglas yielded and began to negotiate<br>\r\nthe ladder. Michael looked briefly over<br>\r\nhis shoulder, smiled at Lisa and winked,<br>\r\nthen followed Douglas.<br>\r\nLisa  began to slide her way down the<br>\r\ncabin to the door, twisting to slide her<br>\r\nlegs out into the cool night air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a bid for modesty she tugged at her<br>\r\ndress front and crammed the extra<br>\r\ncloth between her legs, stretching the<br>\r\nnylon irritatingly tight across her breasts.<br>\r\nShe started to slide out the hatchway<br>\r\nbut became stuck in the hatch frame<br>\r\njust below her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe twisted her body, gripped the hatch<br>\r\nframe with her hands and heaved herself<br>\r\nout of the airplane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the plane it was nearly pitch dark.<br>\r\nMichael  had switched off all the airplane's<br>\r\nlights, leaving the dim lighting from the two<br>\r\nhanger lamps to illuminate the ground.<br>\r\nThe other airplane, its engines whining<br>\r\nand its anticollision and landing lights<br>\r\nbrilliant in the gloom, stood<br>\r\ntwo hundred feet away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black suit wearing figures exited the<br>\r\nSpecial number 1 last.</span></div></div>",

Lisa quickly sank to her<br>\r\nknees beside them.<br>\r\nMichael  reached up and took Lisa's<br>\r\nhand in his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Captain,\" Michael said,<br>\r\n\u201cYour ride's waiting for you.<br>\r\nPlease do me the favor of not trying<br>\r\nto talk to the pilot--the cockpit door'll be<br>\r\nlocked when you get in.<br>\r\nJust take a seat and enjoy the ride back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDouglas nodded wordlessly.<br>\r\nShe looked up at Lisa, who held out<br>\r\nher hand. Douglas began to reach for it,<br>\r\nhesitated, and then timidly grasped her<br>\r\nfirst two fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What--what's it like?\"<br>\r\nDouglas asked. Lisa soberly accepted<br>\r\nthe captain's handshake and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like nothing you can imagine,\"<br>\r\nshe replied.<br>\r\n\u201cI can barely describe it\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDouglas stood there for a moment,<br>\r\nthen nodded quietly.<br>\r\nShe hesitated in turning towards the l<br>\r\nother airplane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, there's something you<br>\r\nshould know,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to hide yourself and your<br>\r\nairplanes. The NSA and<br>\r\nthe PRO--that's the National Security<br>\r\nAgency, a part of the CIA, and the Photographic Reconnaissance Office--have a domestic<br>\r\nsatellite that can use to take very<br>\r\ndetailed pictures of anything in the<br>\r\nUnited States--the KF-11 satellite launched<br>\r\ntwo years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought that satellite was supposed<br>\r\nto be used to monitor environmental<br>\r\nchanges,\" Michael said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's how it got funding to be built,\"<br>\r\nDouglas replied.<br>\r\n\"It's also used for domestic surveillance.<br>\r\nI've been told it look down on any town<br>\r\nor individual location in the United States<br>\r\nfrom 880 kilometers up and tell what<br>\r\nbrand of cigarettes a man is holding in<br>\r\nhis hand.

It was such a sheer pleasure<br>\r\njust to be able to stand upright and move<br>\r\nwithout bumping into anything.<br>\r\nShe celebrated the freedom.<br>\r\nBeside her Michael watched the other<br>\r\nairplane lift into the sky with a roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding in satisfaction he strode<br>\r\ntowards one of the two hangars.<br>\r\nLisa was vaguely startled at seeing him l<br>\r\nmove away from her out of the corner<br>\r\nof her eye. She realized that it was his size<br>\r\nrelative to hers that was so<br>\r\nunusual--where she saw Michael now was<br>\r\nin the same part of her vision that she<br>\r\nwas accustomed to seeing small animals<br>\r\nor pets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael reached the near wall of the<br>\r\nhanger and withdrew a ring of keys<br>\r\nfrom his pocket. He opened the access<br>\r\nplate to a switchbox on the hangar wall and<br>\r\npushed a button that clicked loudly.<br>\r\nTwo rows of lights came on, illuminating<br>\r\na narrow road running from the two<br>\r\nhangars up a long incline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed the box, looked up at Lisa<br>\r\nand grinned boyishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've some things to show you, and<br>\r\na surprise for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.\"<br>\r\nMichael began to march up the road.<br>\r\nLisa followed, stepping small to match Michael's<br>\r\nstrides. She looked at her new surroundings.<br>\r\nIn the low lighting from the pathway lamps<br>\r\nand saw that dense deciduous woods<br>\r\nsurrounded the airfield--she could almost<br>\r\nmake out the different colors of<br>\r\neach tree's leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air was fresh, woodsy-smelling and<br>\r\ncool. Lisa exhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we?\" she asked.<br>\r\nMichael  looked up over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPolk County, North Carolina,\" he replied.<br>\r\n\u201cThe town nearest to us here is Edneyville,<br>\r\nover the hill. Over that way,\"<br>\r\nhe gestured to his right,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"is the city of Asheville. About 55 miles<br>\r\nbehind us is Charlotte.<br>\r\nRight up this road is my home, and if<br>\r\nyou follow it down to its end you come<br>\r\nto the little complex we've built to house<br>\r\nsome of our...well err some of my<br>\r\nfamily\u2019s companies in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa smiled at his enthusiastic response.<br>\r\nShe looked up at the sky and saw it was<br>\r\nbisected, with clear starry skies directly<br>\r\nabove and behind her and utter darkness<br>\r\nbefore her to the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the storm we flew out of up there,\"<br>\r\nMichael  said as he followed her observation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be over us probably by the end of the day<br>\r\ntomorrow or Wednesday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill breeze sprang up, scattering<br>\r\nleaves across the path. Lisa shivered and<br>\r\nwrapped her arms around herself.<br>\r\nThe ground brightened as the<br>\r\nnear-full moon suddenly peeked out from<br>\r\nbehind the clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at Michael  and found herself<br>\r\nwishing she could hold his hand while they<br>\r\nwalked, but she was now so tall it would be<br>\r\nuncomfortable for both of<br>\r\nthem to try--Michael  would need to hold his<br>\r\narm straight up and Lisa would have to bend<br>\r\nover nearly double for them to touch each<br>\r\nother's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn envelope of depression enfolded her<br>\r\nand her face fell into a sad frown,<br>\r\ndespite Michael's light-hearted antics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael  turned on his heel and began<br>\r\nto walk backwards, looking up at Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look very pretty in the moonlight,\" he said. <br>\r\nLisa blushed and smiled slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look a mess,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to me--GAWK!\" Michael  said.<br>\r\nHe tripped on his own feet and fell backwards<br>\r\nonto the path, exclaiming in pain.<br>\r\nHe shook his head and began to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, you'd think I'd been hitting the bottle.<br>\r\nIt's not Friday night yet.\"</span></div></div>",

Even you--you've been so<br>\r\ngood to me, and you're the most wonderful<br>\r\nguy I could ever have imagined meeting,<br>\r\nlet alone Kind of sorta like or make love with,<br>\r\nbut I'm becoming so big I'm really<br>\r\nafraid that I'm going to injure you or hurt you<br>\r\nin some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel my life is over, and it hasn't even<br>\r\nbegun, yet.

Special to some<br>\r\nother people whom you'll meet tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must tell you something. When I arrived<br>\r\nhome after I escaped from New York I<br>\r\ntold a few people what had happened<br>\r\nto me--how I met the cutest, nicest girl in<br>\r\nNew York who had the most amazing experience<br>\r\none could imagine and how it began to<br>\r\naffect her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first they thought I'd finally slipped<br>\r\nmy trolley. But as I kept talking about<br>\r\nyou I guess they began to see something<br>\r\nin me, something that<br>\r\nyou--and only you--could have caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey saw I was in love, something my<br>\r\nfriends kept telling me would never<br>\r\nhappen because I'd buried myself in<br>\r\nmy successes and in the life my parents<br>\r\nhad pushed onto me and wouldn't let<br>\r\nanyone else in, because I've never<br>\r\nbeen really close to anybody since my<br>\r\nfolks died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, they will accept you, because<br>\r\nI accepted you, whatever size you<br>\r\nhappen to be.<br>\r\nNo Lisa you're no freak, or monstrosity,<br>\r\nor anything else like that.<br>\r\nThat's those dickheads Turner and<br>\r\nLang talking.<br>\r\nYou're my friend, you were my first<br>\r\n\u2014blush\u2014-<br>\r\nand hopefully you\u2019ll be my lover, and<br>\r\nI want you to stay with me forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'll always be at home here no<br>\r\nmatter how big you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa began to smile through her tears.<br>\r\nMichael  beamed and nodded his head</span></div></div>",

He adopted a distant pose, then<br>\r\nwinked and ruined the effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They tell me I'm bad to the bone,\" he replied.<br>\r\n\"Now, on to the rotenburo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity propelled Lisa  faster as she<br>\r\napproached the apex of the road.<br>\r\nAs she rounded a curve a huge house<br>\r\ncame into view. She could see lights on<br>\r\naround what appeared to be a basement<br>\r\nand ground floor, and one light in a top<br>\r\nfloor window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately beside the house she saw<br>\r\ntwo towering tents, their white fabric<br>\r\nilluminated from within. She stopped,<br>\r\nuncertain where to go.<br>\r\nMichael  rotated in her hands and peered<br>\r\nat the tents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha!\" he called out. \"There.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked where he pointed and<br>\r\nmade out an area of thicker material at one<br>\r\nend of the tent, made up of two flaps<br>\r\noverlapping one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowered Michael  to the ground and<br>\r\nreached out to flip open the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was more comfortable than the night chill<br>\r\noutside.<br>\r\nLisa was stunned to see 2 combination<br>\r\nheater slash AC units  scaled to her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of that a large fan spun overhead<br>\r\nto mix the air within the space.<br>\r\nLisa also noticed what appeared to be an<br>\r\nenormous futon in the center of the tent,<br>\r\nunder the fan, covered by an expansive sheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pillow, probably composed of several<br>\r\nnormal-sized pillows sewn together<br>\r\ninside another sheet, topped the bed.<br>\r\nThick white canvas covered the floor beneath<br>\r\nher bare feet, soft and dry.<br>\r\nTall, bright lamps alternated with huge boxes<br>\r\nmade of polished wood and a high,<br>\r\ncanvas-covered object around the periphery<br>\r\nof the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right!\" Michael  exclaimed.<br>\r\n\"They came through. Lisa, come on over here.<br>\r\nTake a look at these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe led her to one of the boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, lift the lid,\" he said. Lisa did so,<br>\r\nand retrieved the parcel of soft white cloth<br>\r\nfrom inside the box. <br>\r\nShe stood up and let the thing unfold in her<br>\r\nhands, and gasped. It was a nightdress made<br>\r\nTo be presumably just the right size for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa held it against herself, running her fingers<br>\r\nover its soft fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D'you think it will fit?\" Michael asked.<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid that I could only give an<br>\r\napproximation of what your size would be--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMichael it's terrific!\" Lisa exclaimed.<br>\r\nShe drew out one of the nightdress sleeves<br>\r\nand laid it on her arm. She noticed the rows<br>\r\nof buttons and folds on the sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Extra panels,\" Michael  said in response to her<br>\r\nquestioning look.<br>\r\n\"There should be the same thing around the<br>\r\nshoulders, back, waist, hips, and on down.<br>\r\nYou won't have to reshape the thing every time--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked down at him. Michael  had stopped<br>\r\nand looked away, as if to avoid a painful subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa smiled and knelt down so she could kiss<br>\r\nMichael  on top of his head. He smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSilly of me, isn't it,\" he said.<br>\r\n\u201cNow, there should be the other things<br>\r\nI ordered in these other crates. Let's see,<br>\r\ntry this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa walked around the tent on her knees<br>\r\nand opened the lid on each crate in turn,<br>\r\nrevealing more treasures.<br>\r\nShe almost whooped with happiness when<br>\r\nshe discovered elaborately tailored panties<br>\r\nin one container and right-sized training bras<br>\r\nin another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther boxes contained huge towels and<br>\r\nseveral pairs of socks which had thick<br>\r\nleather-looking panels sewn onto their soles.<br>\r\nAnother smaller box held a huge, stiff bristled<br>\r\nbrush and a large metal comb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can't believe that you have all these things,\"<br>\r\nLisa said.<br>\r\nMichael , standing near the tall, cloth-covere<br>\r\nobject, nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made a special order with some people<br>\r\nin Hong Kong,\" he said.<br>\r\n\u201cI told them what I needed, what dimensions<br>\r\nI needed, and that they could name their price<br>\r\nso long as I got it within twenty four hours,<br>\r\nthe records and receipts were fabricated to<br>\r\nindicate anything but a special order and<br>\r\nno questions were asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was worried you'd have to wear<br>\r\nthat thing--is that a parachute?--until<br>\r\ntomorrow or the next day, but they came<br>\r\nthrough. The brush comes from Fuller's and<br>\r\nthe comb was made here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis stuff is so soft,\"<br>\r\nshe said, returning to the nightdress.<br>\r\n\"It feels like silk\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is.\"<br>\r\nLisa looked over at Michael, startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael, no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this must have cost you a fortune!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's worth it,\" he said, his expression<br>\r\nserious. Lisa  gave him a loving look like<br>\r\nmade him blush to his hairline.<br>\r\nHe motioned to her. Lisa rose and came<br>\r\nover to where he stood beside the<br>\r\ncloth-covered panel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere,\" he said. \"Lift the cloth off this.\"<br>\r\nLisa did so and took a step back.<br>\r\nIt was a tall, polished mirror.<br>\r\nA small sound escaped her throat as she<br>\r\nreached out to touch it.<br>\r\nIt wasn't glass, but polished metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remembered seeing a panel of stainless<br>\r\nsteel at the Asheville airport,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it was supposed to be formed into<br>\r\nsome old airplane's wing. Anyway,<br>\r\nI contacted the owner and bought it from him.<br>\r\nSome polish and it's a ready-made mirror for you.\"</span></div></div>",

It was her face, all right--perhaps her<br>\r\nchin was a little longer, surrounded by a halo<br>\r\nof long, unkempt brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body wasn't anything like she remembered.<br>\r\nHer neck was long and thin, her shoulders<br>\r\nnarrow and muscular, her arms well defined.<br>\r\nHer breasts were somewhere in B range if she<br>\r\nhad to guess. <br>\r\nIt seemed like they had slowed in their<br>\r\ndevelopement at some point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slim waist sloped out to somewhat slim,<br>\r\nyet well-formed and barely covered hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa slowly rotated before the mirror.<br>\r\nUnder a cascade of hair that ran to her mid back<br>\r\nshe could see the cheeks of her buttocks<br>\r\npeeking from under the hem of the dress,<br>\r\nbuttocks that were round and firm and would\u2019ve<br>\r\nbeen tiny had she not gone and grown into an<br>\r\nAmazon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs were incredibly long, making up fully<br>\r\nhalf her height, slim and lithe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2019I'm so strong-looking. No wonder I couldn't<br>\r\nfeel Michael's weight, I have a bit of muscle I<br>\r\nnever had before.

I can't thank you<br>\r\nenough for all this. This 'rotenburo' is quite<br>\r\nsomething.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael  visibly relaxed as Lisa spoke,<br>\r\nhis smile broad. Then he started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, no. This is your temporary<br>\r\naccommodations, until we can arrange<br>\r\nfor better ones. The rotenburo is next door.<br>\r\nCome on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa opened the flap on the other side of<br>\r\nher tent to reveal a narrow passage.<br>\r\nWith Michael leading she made her way into<br>\r\nthe other tent, which was butted directly against<br>\r\nthe side of his house. Here the canvas underfoot<br>\r\nended, replaced by polished wood battens and<br>\r\nthe stone deck of a large outdoor porch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw a framework of pipes braced<br>\r\nagainst the outside wall of Michael's home<br>\r\ntopped by a sprinkler head set directly over a<br>\r\nshiny brass drain. A faucet topped by two<br>\r\nlarge valve handles hung well down the wall.<br>\r\nThe lighting was all overhead and more<br>\r\nradiators gave the tent an almost sultry<br>\r\natmosphere. It was a shower, a<br>\r\ngiant's-sized shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa cried out an intricate arpeggio of happiness.<br>\r\nTo be able to take a decent, hot-water shower,<br>\r\nstanding erect instead of bent like a pretzel--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael motioned to catch her eye and<br>\r\ngestured to yet another flap in the side of the tent.<br>\r\nLisa  turned up the flap and shivered at the chilly<br>\r\ngust of wind that invaded the space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a rotenburo,\" Michael  said. A large,<br>\r\nstill pool of water adjoined the patio, its contents<br>\r\nsteaming in the cold evening air. It looked like it<br>\r\nhad been painstakingly sculpted, partly of stone<br>\r\nand partly wood, cast in a rough circle.<br>\r\nSoft lighting surrounded its periphery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stand of tall pole-like plants, their withered<br>\r\nleaves flickering in the breeze, occupied one<br>\r\ncorner near the pool,<br>\r\na bonsai--a gnarled, ancient-looking<br>\r\nminiature tree--another, its branches overhanging<br>\r\nthe water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rotenburo is a Japanese word,\"<br>\r\nMichael  explained.<br>\r\n\u201cIt refers to the kind of public bath generally<br>\r\nset up outdoors. I figured that after the ordeal<br>\r\nthose people put you through the best thing for<br>\r\nyou would be a scrub and a soak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's beautiful,\" Lisa said nearly speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEver bathe Japanese-style? I'd, ah, be<br>\r\ndelighted to show you, if you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael blushed again, charmingly.<br>\r\nLisa crouched down and picked him up to bring<br>\r\nhim to her mouth. Her kiss was long and intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Michael  said when she released him.<br>\r\n\"Does that mean yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it does,\" Lisa replied, carrying him into<br>\r\nthe shower tent and dropping the flap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder Michael's direction Lisa retrieved one of a<br>\r\nselection of large wooden tubs that were stacked<br>\r\nagainst the wall beside her shower.<br>\r\nHe disappeared through an open door and<br>\r\nLisa could hear him rummaging around inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got down on her hands and knees and<br>\r\npeered into a smaller shower room.<br>\r\nAnother door similar to the one Michael <br>\r\npassed through stood closed nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One shower area for men, the other for women,\"<br>\r\nMichael called out as he noticed her curiosity.<br>\r\n\u201cStandard system for public baths.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou set up a public bath in your own home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. I let my people use it when we have parties or meetings--lots more meetings than parties lately,<br>\r\nI'm afraid. It makes quite a splash, if you'll<br>\r\npardon the pun. Here you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe produced two wooden-handled brushes,<br>\r\na salon-size bottle of shampoo and a<br>\r\ncake of soap.<br>\r\nLisa took up the soap, noting that it was<br>\r\ncomposed of several bars cemented together.<br>\r\nIt smelled of coconut.<br>\r\nHe then produced a tube to toothpaste.</span></div></div>",

It was too large to be<br>\r\ncomfortable but Lisa worked it around her <br>\r\nmouth enough to raise foam, then spit it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cupped her hands under the taps and<br>\r\nfilled her mouth to wash out the toothpaste,<br>\r\nrinsed the brush and thrust the tub under the<br>\r\ntaps to fill. Lisa stood, tore her parachute dress<br>\r\nfrom around her body and threw it at the opposite<br>\r\nside of the tent. When the tub was nearly full and<br>\r\nLisa turned the selector valve above the taps to<br>\r\nthe shower setting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed an eternity of gurgling and<br>\r\nclanking hot water surged from the sprinkler head.<br>\r\nSteam rushed into the tent, warming it still more.<br>\r\nLisa  grasped the tub and lifted it over her head,<br>\r\nthe hot water stinging her skin.<br>\r\nShe put the tub down on the floor bottoms-up<br>\r\nand stepped into the shower, rotating under its<br>\r\nimpact. She soaked her hair and drew it<br>\r\naround her neck so that it hung across her front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw movement and looked down.<br>\r\nMichael had shed his clothing and now stood,<br>\r\nbucket and wash brush in hand, at the threshold<br>\r\nof the shower room.<br>\r\nHis eyes were big and he was rapidly<br>\r\nbecoming erect.<br>\r\nLisa took notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHnn you\u2019re getting excited already little pervert\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t help you\u2019re so pretty, cute and kinda sexy\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHnn Pervert come to scrub my back for me then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod, you--you are so cute and beautiful\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa blushed a bit.<br>\r\nLittle by little he was starting to melt that icy and<br>\r\nshy interior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yes. I am at your service, my supersized<br>\r\ncutie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa turned off the shower and seated herself<br>\r\ncarefully atop her wash tub. It creaked loudly<br>\r\nbut held together under her weight.<br>\r\nShe picked up the soap and handed it to Michael,<br>\r\nwho took the thick bar in both hands and<br>\r\nbegan to rub it across her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved slowly at first, then more vigorously,<br>\r\nextending his reach up to her neck and down her<br>\r\narms. He then slipped his arms beneath Lisa's and<br>\r\nstarted to soap her front. He moved to her breasts.<br>\r\nLisa  inhaled, pressing her bosom into his<br>\r\nquesting hands. She heard the soap clatter on<br>\r\nthe stone floor. She felt Michael's hard on against<br>\r\nher buttocks as he pressed up against her, his<br>\r\nhands caressing her, tickling her nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, that feels good,\" Lisa murmured.<br>\r\n\u201cThat feels so good.\"<br>\r\nLisa half-turned and pulled Michael in front of her.<br>\r\nHe was partly-coated with the soap he had<br>\r\napplied to her back. His expression was euphoric,<br>\r\nhis hard on throbbing.<br>\r\nLisa smiled and retrieved the soap bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow it's my turn,\" she said. She gently<br>\r\napplied the soap to his skin, drawing him<br>\r\ncloser to her. His hands returned to her breasts<br>\r\n massaging and tickling.<br>\r\nLisa felt moisture forming around her vulva.<br>\r\nShe rubbed her hands well with the soap and<br>\r\nbegan to lather Michael's face and body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran her fingers around his crotch,<br>\r\ncradling his buttocks in her hands, carefully<br>\r\nstroking his erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woo,\" he breathed loudly,<br>\r\na huge smile on his face.<br>\r\nHe squinted as soap trickled into his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's rinse off for a bit,\" he said.<br>\r\nLisa smiled and stood, reaching out to the taps.<br>\r\nWhen the water chuckled out of the sprinkler<br>\r\nhead she took Michael in her arms and carried<br>\r\nhim into the flow. She rotated under the stream,<br>\r\nrising both of them clean of the suds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael sputtered from the impact of the<br>\r\nwater as she carried him back towards the<br>\r\nbattens lining the patio deck on the far side<br>\r\nof the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLisa you're a dream come true,\"<br>\r\nMichael  said as she deposited him on<br>\r\nthe wood battens. She seated herself beside<br>\r\nhim and smiled down at his<br>\r\nerect--in more ways than one--form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael, I want you,\" she whispered. \"But\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave it to me, cutie. Lie back,\" he replied.<br>\r\nLisa laid back onto her elbows and watched,<br>\r\ncurious and excited. Michael straddled her belly,<br>\r\nfacing her, his bottom resting lightly on her ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to stroke her breasts again,<br>\r\nrubbing her nipples slowly, then faster and faster.<br>\r\nLisa moaned in response, her eyes half-closed.<br>\r\nShe was even more sensitive than the 1st time<br>\r\nthey had done this right after her growing picked<br>\r\nup pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael wrapped both hands around one breast.<br>\r\nHis mouth closed on her nipple and he ran his<br>\r\ntongue over its rough surface.<br>\r\nLisa  felt pleasurable shivers racing up her spine<br>\r\nand she encouraged him with her voice, rubbing<br>\r\nhis back with one hand.<br>\r\nMichael  began to suck, kneading the flesh<br>\r\nunder his fingers, her breasts swelling under his ministrations, her nipples hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael gave the nipple a last lick and transferred<br>\r\nhis attentions to her other breast.<br>\r\nLisa's moans grew louder and louder until she<br>\r\norgasmed, her torso bucking, her breath coming<br>\r\nin short pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that was wonderful,\" she breathed.<br>\r\n\"You are wonderful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you, cutie,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave her breasts a final caress and<br>\r\nraised himself. He bent over double and walked<br>\r\nslowly down her side, running his hands<br>\r\ndown her middle.<br>\r\nLisa focused all her attention on the gentle<br>\r\ntouch he applied. As he reached her thighs<br>\r\nhe put his hands between them and pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa opened her legs and Michael darted<br>\r\nbetween them. She watched as Michael<br>\r\nslowly caressed his way up to her crotch.<br>\r\nHe then seated himself on his heels before her<br>\r\nwomanhood like a worshipping acolyte.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began kissing and massaging her mons,<br>\r\nthen ran his tongue over her skin. Her labia<br>\r\nwere almost the perfect size for each of his hands<br>\r\nand he stroked them slowly. Lisa responded<br>\r\nimmediately, her organs swelling, her moans<br>\r\nlouder and more fevered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael rubbed each lip, his thumbs slipping<br>\r\ninside her to stroke her. He cupped her vulva in<br>\r\nboth hands and drew her labia apart.<br>\r\nHis mouth found her clitoris and he began to lick<br>\r\nand suck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHH! AHHH!\" Lisa cried out as she orgasmed<br>\r\nagain, and again, her juices dripping from<br>\r\nher organ. As she started to come down from her<br>\r\nrapture she felt Michael  start to penetrate her and<br>\r\nopened her eyes in surprise.<br>\r\nMichael was carefully pressing his hand inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing--ahhh, ahhh,\" she breathed.<br>\r\nShe felt his fingers spread slightly as she<br>\r\nlubricated even more. His hand suddenly slipped<br>\r\nall the way inside her to his forearm, stretching<br>\r\nher organ. He began to rotate his wrist, his splayed<br>\r\nfingers writhing against her vagina,<br>\r\nfinding every sensitive spot inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa writhed in utter abandon as one wave of<br>\r\nsexual energy after another exploded inside her.<br>\r\nMichael formed a gentle fist inside her vagina and<br>\r\nmoved his hand back and forth.<br>\r\nLisa closed her eyes as her strongest orgasm yet<br>\r\nshook her entire body. Her cries echoed in the<br>\r\nconfines of the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael slowly removed his dripping arm and<br>\r\nhand from her womanhood.<br>\r\nLisa lay on her back until her breathing slowed,<br>\r\nthen sat upright.</span></div></div>",

How about that soak?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\" Lisa exclaimed. They both returned to<br>\r\nthe shower area and soaped up again.<br>\r\nMichael finished himself quickly and helped<br>\r\nLisa  shampoo her hair. Then they both rinsed under<br>\r\nLisa's shower again and Lisa lifted Michael's naked<br>\r\nbody from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carried him through the tent flap to<br>\r\nthe pool outside.<br>\r\nLisa slowly inserted one foot in the water.<br>\r\nAs advertised by the steam rising from its surface,<br>\r\nthe water was very hot. Lisa found her feet<br>\r\nstinging from the heat of the water as the rest<br>\r\nof her shivered in the chilly night air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held her breath and slipped into the pool.<br>\r\nShe heard Michael  ahhh as he came in contact<br>\r\nwith the water. Under Michael's direction<br>\r\nLisa maneuvered herself until her back was against<br>\r\nthe wall of the deep area of the pool,<br>\r\nsubmerging until only her neck and head were<br>\r\nabove the water, Michael still in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments she felt herself relaxing. She<br>\r\nsighed, her breath raising a cloud of steam from<br>\r\nthe water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's very hot,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. A hundred four degrees. Makes every<br>\r\nmuscle in your body relax. Now, how about<br>\r\nsomething to drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe reached over his shoulder and dragged<br>\r\na wooden tray into the pool, floating it in front of Lisa.<br>\r\nAtop the tray she could see a small ceramic beaker<br>\r\nand a larger carafe of grape juice.<br>\r\nShe let go of Michael, who slipped to the edge<br>\r\nof the pool beside her, and reached out to the<br>\r\ncarafe. The juice was well chilled from being<br>\r\noutside and she sipped carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael reached out and seized up the beaker.<br>\r\nHe then grabbed a drink for himself.<br>\r\nHe then drank half its contents.<br>\r\nLisa took a pull from her carafe.<br>\r\nIt tasted good and the water was relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slipped a little deeper into the water.<br>\r\nMichael finished his drink, returning it to the<br>\r\nfloating tray.<br>\r\nHe reached behind Lisa and produced a washcloth<br>\r\nwhich he soaked in the water and folded atop<br>\r\nhis head. Then he conjured a towel for her to use.<br>\r\nLisa imitated him, the hot, sopping towel shielding<br>\r\nher head from the cold. They both soaked<br>\r\nquietly in the steaming water, their eyes closed,<br>\r\nwhile the night sounds of their surroundings<br>\r\nformed a soothing music to their ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMichael\u201d Lisa asked suddenly,<br>\r\n\"what am I going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" he replied sleepily.<br>\r\n\"You can do whatever you want to do, cutie.<br>\r\nI'll help you with getting clothes and stuff like<br>\r\nthat but the rest is up to you.

He had fallen asleep and began to slip<br>\r\nfrom the edge of the pool deeper into the water.<br>\r\nShe reached out with both hands to keep his head<br>\r\nfrom going under, her motion slopping water from<br>\r\nthe pool, the washcloth on his head slipping off<br>\r\nand floating away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa held Michael  in her arms and brooded<br>\r\nover him. He was smiling gently in his sleep.<br>\r\nLisa bent down to deliver the lightest touch of<br>\r\nher lips to his forehead and heard him murmur<br>\r\nin response.</span></div></div>",

Unfettered, her breasts stood out<br>\r\nproudly. She had to admit it was nice that she<br>\r\ncouldn\u2019t be called flatty or flatso anymore.<br>\r\nAlso they felt good especially when she or Michael<br>\r\ndid...things... with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly was tight and flat. Her pubic hair was lush and<br>\r\ndarker than her head hair was.<br>\r\nLisa thought she looked like those women she saw advertising exercise equipment on television.<br>\r\nShe rubbed her hair until it was approximately dry and snatched up her comb and brush. She drew<br>\r\nher hair to her front and began to comb out all<br>\r\nthe knots. It took a great deal of pulling and she<br>\r\nwinced in pain more than once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she applied the brush with vigor.<br>\r\nThe sensation of its hard bristles against her<br>\r\nscalp made her wriggle voluptuously.<br>\r\nFreed of tangles, her hair was a long brown mass<br>\r\nreaching halfway down her back.<br>\r\nShe turned sideways to see her profile and was so<br>\r\nshocked at her incredible body that she giggled,<br>\r\nholding her hand over her mouth as to not wake<br>\r\nMichael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she keeps growing she could have Michael<br>\r\nclimb her hair just like Repunzel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking of Michael  made her turn. She put down<br>\r\nher comb and brush and strode to the futon.<br>\r\nMichael had wrapped the towel closer to himself<br>\r\nand turned over onto his side, still snoring softly.<br>\r\nLisa took him back in her arms, towel and all, and<br>\r\ncradled him while drawing down the sheet and silk<br>\r\nblanket of her bed with a free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe extricated Michael  from the towel and<br>\r\ncarefully stretched him out on one corner of her<br>\r\nfuton, then slipped beside him, drawing up the<br>\r\nbedclothes. She settled herself and turned on<br>\r\nher side and rested her hand on Michael, feeling<br>\r\nhis warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa lay there and watched Michael as he slept,<br>\r\noccasionally closing her eyes yet unable to sleep,<br>\r\nlistening to the gentle outside sounds that<br>\r\npermeated the fabric of her new home.

Lang looked up at the bucolic<br>\r\nPacific sky and allowed himself a small grin.<br>\r\nIt was going to be a successful operation after all<br>\r\none way or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> Polk County, North Carolina<br>\r\nTuesday Morning Early AM<br>\r\nJUNE 1st 2010 </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa opened her eyes. She was lying on her side,<br>\r\nfacing the sleeping figure of Michael.<br>\r\nMichael had been quiet during the hours after<br>\r\nthey had made love, rolling over only once under<br>\r\nher hand. He now lay facing her, mouth open<br>\r\nand hair wild, his eyes flickering beneath<br>\r\ntheir lids in a dream.<br>\r\nLisa kissed him delicately and slipped from under<br>\r\nthe sheet and silk blanket covering her futon,<br>\r\npausing to tuck Steve under a corner of the covers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa stretched to her full height--whatever that<br>\r\nnow was--and bent each of her limbs to its limit,<br>\r\nreveling in the feeling of warmth and release as each muscle was pulled and loosened.<br>\r\nShe inhaled deeply and looked down at the pole lights surrounding her bed. She must remember to<br>\r\nask if there was a switch so she could turn the<br>\r\nlights out herself. Her eye then fell on the<br>\r\nlarge wooden crates surrounding her tent-home<br>\r\nand her curiosity reawakened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe retrieved some of her new clothes from the<br>\r\nboxes and spent a few moments orienting herself<br>\r\nto their construction. The socks were simple tubes<br>\r\nwoven in various sizes, with thick protective<br>\r\nleather-like soles sewn onto their bottoms.<br>\r\nLisa tried on three pairs until she found one<br>\r\nwhich fit well. The panties were silk with a<br>\r\ntwo-part elastic waistband that attached well<br>\r\nabove her hips with velcro fasteners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach half of the waistband had a large overlap<br>\r\nand all she would need to do is adjust the<br>\r\nfasteners to achieve a comfortable<br>\r\nfit--whoever designed these had tremendous<br>\r\nforesight, Lisa thought, to consider her future<br>\r\ngrowth in their design.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikewise, the bras were made of alternating<br>\r\npanels of soft silk and springy nylon with<br>\r\nsimilar fasteners under each arm and across<br>\r\nthe shoulders, save for two which were strapless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa grinned and slipped on one of the strapless<br>\r\nkind. The cups were soft and a<br>\r\nlittle loose--something, she thought resignedly,<br>\r\nthat would not last in the next day or so.<br>\r\nAt least her cup size were now more defined.<br>\r\nThe label read B Cup -??? <br>\r\nAlso her breasts while growing her body seemed<br>\r\nto have slowed down in swelling cup size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she pulled the white silk nightdress she had<br>\r\nexamined the night before over her head and<br>\r\nbuttoned the sash around her waist. It was crafted<br>\r\nlike a long-sleeved firenze gown with a translucent d\u00e9colletage and a ground-length skirt that called as<br>\r\nmuch attention to her figure as it hid.<br>\r\nThe soft silk against her skin gave her a licentious<br>\r\npleasure she had never expected to enjoy again<br>\r\nand she wriggled sensually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa strode to her mirror and looked at her<br>\r\nreflection. Clothed in simple white, she was<br>\r\nastonished to see such a  beauty<br>\r\nlooking back at her in the polished metal.<br>\r\nShe took up her comb and brush and smoothed<br>\r\nher hair. She drew the mass in front of her,<br>\r\nconsidering, then combed her hair into three<br>\r\nequal tresses and essayed braiding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers were unaccustomed to the<br>\r\ntask--she had not had long hair since she was<br>\r\nten years old--and her first two attempts were<br>\r\nirritating and painful failures, but on the third try she managed to plait one long braid that she flipped<br>\r\ndown her back after tying off its end with a small<br>\r\npiece of cord she broke from a tent panel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa saw a tiny motion in the background<br>\r\nimage in her mirror and turned.<br>\r\nMichael  had rolled over on his back.<br>\r\nShe smiled at his still form. His confidence,<br>\r\nenthusiasm, and unrestrained love for her<br>\r\nwere infectious, and for the first time since<br>\r\nshe had begun to grow Lisa found herself<br>\r\nsharing his emotions. She remembered the<br>\r\nsexual calisthenics they had engaged in the<br>\r\nprevious night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd been right about that,<br>\r\ntoo--they could be intimate despite the<br>\r\ndisparity in their sizes--and she blew him a<br>\r\nsilent kiss. Then a curious sound from outside<br>\r\ncaught her attention.</span></div></div>",

The sky was<br>\r\njust beginning to lighten and the air was<br>\r\nchilly for this time of year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the flap behind her she walked<br>\r\nslowly across a silvered lawn towards the<br>\r\nwoods that she could now see surrounded<br>\r\nthe property. Lisa looked up the side of the<br>\r\nmountain away from the dawn and saw a<br>\r\nbird soaring against a cloud-covered sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was some kind of raptor, with a brownish body<br>\r\nand brownish-red wings and tail--a red-tailed hawk?<br>\r\nIt repeated its thin, raspy cry, circling high up the<br>\r\nmountain. More sounds began to greet the dawn.<br>\r\nA loud, brazen call by a chickadee diverted her<br>\r\nattention downward to see the little bird boldly<br>\r\ncircling her. She grinned at its antics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa stretched again in the cold morning air,<br>\r\nher heart light. Despite the obvious chill<br>\r\nin the air she felt no sense of cold at all.<br>\r\nIt was a wonderful moment to be alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa turned and got her first good look at<br>\r\nMichael's home. It was a massive structure,<br>\r\nbetter than double maybe triple her present height.<br>\r\nWhite clapboards rose up from a rough stone<br>\r\nfoundation to a high gable roof punctured by<br>\r\nthree dormers on both sides. She noticed a small<br>\r\nrailed platform set in the center of the roof, with<br>\r\ntall posts at each corner--a widow's walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe many tall windows and a massive solarium<br>\r\non one side of the home meant that there<br>\r\nwould be plenty of natural light within.<br>\r\nIt was very pretty, if somewhat eclectic,<br>\r\nLisa thought--New England clapboard and<br>\r\nshingle with a touch of Victorian and a splash<br>\r\nof modernity--and it seemed to fit<br>\r\nMichael  very well, which probably meant<br>\r\nhe had a hand in designing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning was steadily advancing and<br>\r\nLisa was becoming concerned about more<br>\r\nprosaic things like her bladder and stomach<br>\r\nwhen she heard a soft footfall behind her.<br>\r\nShe turned, expecting to see Michael.<br>\r\nInstead a solid, middle aged man jumped as<br>\r\nshe turned to face him, his black eyes wide,<br>\r\nhis mouth open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis crewcut hair was black with strands of gray,<br>\r\nas was his neat moustache.<br>\r\nHe was dressed in a simple white shirt<br>\r\nand a black vest, pants and shoes, a red<br>\r\npaisley tie snugged at his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\" Lisa said in surprise. She turned to fully<br>\r\nface the man, who closed his mouth<br>\r\nand swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said you were different,\" the man said.<br>\r\n\u201cHe certainly was right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" Lisa offered.<br>\r\nThe man took two more steps forward, closer to Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good-good morning,\" the man replied.<br>\r\n\u201cIs-is Mr.Gail still asleep?<br>\r\nOh, I'm so sorry, please excuse my<br>\r\nbad manners. My name is Brian Rodgers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Mr.Rodgers,\" Lisa replied.<br>\r\nShe smiled at the man and her smile was<br>\r\nreturned. Brian was every bit an Englishmen it<br>\r\nseemed and perhaps a little smaller than<br>\r\nMichael  but more bulky, although it was difficult<br>\r\nfor Lisa to tell--all she could see for certain was<br>\r\nthat he came up to just above her knee.<br>\r\nTo her surprise he spoke with a clipped<br>\r\nBritish accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease Miss Porter call me Brian.<br>\r\nI am at your service whilst you are Mr.Gail\u2019s<br>\r\nguest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh umm thanks and yes Michael is still<br>\r\nsleeping.\u201d She replied then turned towards<br>\r\nthe tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no,\" Brian said quickly, \"please don't wake him.<br>\r\nMy, my, but I can see what Mr.Gail meant now,<br>\r\nMiss Porter .\" He bowed formally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\" Lisa  said, bowing slightly<br>\r\nherself. Brian beamed and gestured for<br>\r\nher to follow him. Lisa stepped slowly, internally<br>\r\nwarring with her now insurgent bladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I trust Mr.Gail acquainted you with the<br>\r\namenities he had crafted for you that are<br>\r\non the property?\" Brian asked, looking up<br>\r\nover his shoulder. Lisa  nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All but one,\" she replied.<br>\r\nBrian stopped in his tracks and looked up at Lisa,<br>\r\nhis eyebrows together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, dear,\" he said.<br>\r\n\"What are you missing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bathroom.\"<br>\r\nBrian was puzzled for a few seconds,<br>\r\nand then he suddenly slapped his forehead<br>\r\nin a dramatic gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course,\" he said.<br>\r\n\u201cI'm surprised he forgot he ordered it.<br>\r\nNow, look over to your right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa followed his pointing finger.<br>\r\nShe saw another, narrow tent standing<br>\r\namid a group of conifers at the edge of the<br>\r\ngrassy area perhaps two hundred feet away from<br>\r\nthe house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Off you go,\" Brian said, gesturing.<br>\r\n\"I'll have breakfast waiting for you at the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned on his heel and walked back<br>\r\ntowards the house. Lisa reached the new tent in<br>\r\ntwenty-two strides and threw up its cover.<br>\r\nAgain she found it warm--the local electric<br>\r\ncompany's going to love me, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside she found a simple wooden box<br>\r\nover what appeared to be a deep hole.<br>\r\nIt was so much like the potty she had been<br>\r\ngiven at the lab at Brooks that she felt a shiver<br>\r\nrun up her spine.<br>\r\nLisa shook her head to clear the sudden<br>\r\nnightmarish miasma that had overtaken her<br>\r\nand closed the flap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlanting her feet carefully on the wet grass,<br>\r\nLisa retraced her steps to the house until she<br>\r\ncrossed the stone walkway leading to the house.<br>\r\nShe began to follow the path, pausing to look<br>\r\nat a mass planting of now dormant roses<br>\r\nbordering the walkway, gathering her skirt in<br>\r\nher hands to prevent it snagging on the occasional<br>\r\nintruding branch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard her name called and looked up to see<br>\r\nBrian, standing beside a high, brightly-lit solarium<br>\r\nattached to the house. Lisa slowed her pace<br>\r\nwhen she approached the man, anxious not<br>\r\nto frighten him.<br>\r\nWith another gesture he grabbed<br>\r\ntwo metal handles attached well over his head<br>\r\nto the frames holding the glass panels<br>\r\nand yanked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frames split into a tall glass door.<br>\r\nLisa smiled in surprise and followed Brian<br>\r\ninto the space. Brian pointed out a tall,<br>\r\nopen-sided box covered with alternating<br>\r\nwhite and yellow tablecloths, a smaller,<br>\r\nsolid box topped by a kaleidoscope of cushions<br>\r\nset beside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA place setting for one rested on its<br>\r\nseven-foot high surface. Lisa did not fail to<br>\r\nnotice the size of the crockery and utensils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr.Gail gave instruction that his guest was to<br>\r\nbe taken care of properly,\" Brian said.<br>\r\n\"It certainly would not do to offer your first<br>\r\nmeal here on child-sized plates.\"</span></div></div>",

Brian had vanished, and now reappeared<br>\r\npushing a wheeled cart. He brought the cart beside<br>\r\nthe table and gestured to Lisa to be seated,<br>\r\nthen removed the covers from two serving platters<br>\r\nto reveal two oversized bowls, one of oatmeal<br>\r\nand the other of mixed fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother gesture revealed a right-sized<br>\r\nhandleless mug of coffee hiding beneath<br>\r\na tea cozy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must plead my inability to serve you properly--\"<br>\r\nBrian began.

Brian  glided from<br>\r\nthe solarium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa lifted her breakfast from the cart and<br>\r\nplaced it on the table. She ate quickly,<br>\r\npausing to look around the space.<br>\r\nShe was surrounded by shallow tubs filled<br>\r\nwith various plants she did not recognize,<br>\r\nsome flowering, some not.<br>\r\nThe air in the room was fresh and scented,<br>\r\nher meal was filling and the fresh coffee was<br>\r\na real pleasure that she had not tasted for<br>\r\nseveral days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe difference between this morning and her<br>\r\nprevious few mornings was so striking that<br>\r\nLisa felt like shouting or singing or crying<br>\r\nin joy. She rose from the table, coffee mug<br>\r\nin hand, to explore the solarium more thoroughly.<br>\r\nAs Lisa stood erect she became aware<br>\r\nof a source of heat warming her<br>\r\nhair--she had risen close to one of the floodlights<br>\r\nattached to the inside wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped away from the lamp, hitching up<br>\r\nher skirt to avoid entangling herself on<br>\r\nthe plants.  Lisa decided that the space was<br>\r\nperhaps three of her strides wide and<br>\r\neight long (at least, at her current size) and<br>\r\nat least double her current height.<br>\r\nOn either side wall of the solarium two stripes<br>\r\nwere painted, at different angles; <br>\r\nLisa puzzled over the strange marks on the<br>\r\notherwise featureless walls then abruptly<br>\r\nrealized that they measured the angle of the sun<br>\r\nat different times of the year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a solar house, then. She made out two<br>\r\ndoors into the space, a narrow one that Brian<br>\r\nhad used, and a much larger,<br>\r\ntwo-leaved wooden door with a rounded top.<br>\r\nFinishing her coffee, she placed the mug<br>\r\non the table and moved to the larger door.<br>\r\nLisa  squatted on her heels before the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was disconcerting to see that the top of the<br>\r\ndoor was at her chest height.<br>\r\nMichael had said he wanted to show her everything,<br>\r\nand he was going to have to do so soon,<br>\r\nLisa reflected, before she grew too big to fit<br>\r\ninside his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's never going to stop,\" she muttered to herself<br>\r\nin a mix of fear and sadness.<br>\r\nShe bowed her head and tried to dispel the sense<br>\r\nof helplessness that intruded into her thinking.<br>\r\nSuddenly a familiar voice called her name.<br>\r\nThe two door panels were flung open,<br>\r\nrevealing Michael. He was dressed only in<br>\r\na pair of sweatpants, his hair hanging over his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa!\" he called out, a huge smile lighting his face.<br>\r\nLisa's introspection vanished at seeing him.<br>\r\nShe seized Michael and kissed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, wait a minute,\" he called out.<br>\r\n\"I'm going back inside so I can open the door again.\"<br>\r\n\"You don't have to,\" Lisa said, smiling down on him.<br>\r\nShe kissed him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.

Massive wood posts rising up<br>\r\nto equally massive crossbeams supporting the<br>\r\nroof defined the space.<br>\r\nEncircling the space above her head within her<br>\r\narm's reach was a bannistered balcony leading<br>\r\nto the rooms of the second floor; another<br>\r\nbalcony above served the third.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one end of the room staircases led<br>\r\nupstairs and at the other a massive metal<br>\r\nfireplace squatted, its contents flaring.<br>\r\nShe saw bookshelves lining one wall,<br>\r\ncabinets and paintings lining the other.<br>\r\nIn one windowed corner stood a huge<br>\r\ndesk covered with papers and a personal<br>\r\ncomputer; in another corner stood<br>\r\na steel gun cabinet, its contents visible in<br>\r\nthe glass-paneled door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa took one step and bumped her foot<br>\r\nagainst something.<br>\r\nLooking down, she saw her foot had come<br>\r\nup against a wide, modern-style<br>\r\noverstuffed couch. She shifted her skirt and<br>\r\nnoted the matching chairs, the low table<br>\r\nstanding atop an intricately embroidered<br>\r\nrug thrown in the middle of the floor, the<br>\r\ngentle lighting of the table lamps illuminating<br>\r\nthe thick, solid carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Michael,\" she said, bringing her hands to<br>\r\nher face,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cit's wonderful--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael's smile faded as he observed Lisa's<br>\r\nexpression. She lowered herself to her knees<br>\r\nbeside him. He stepped to her side and touched her forearm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" he asked gently. Lisa looked down at him, blinking away an excess of moisture that was<br>\r\naccumulating in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" she said, shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just that--that everything here is so wonderful.\"<br>\r\nShe gestured to the living room, then to her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou've done more for me than I have a right to<br>\r\nexpect. But--I'm still getting bigger. I can feel it.<br>\r\nIn another day or two or 3 at most I won't be able<br>\r\nto fit through that door.<br>\r\nAt the rate I'm growing in a couple of weeks I'll be<br>\r\ntaller than your house. You've invited me into your<br>\r\nlife but I'm not going to be able to share it<br>\r\nwith you the way I want to. It's-it's all a little much.<br>\r\nI'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael's expression mirrored his consternation.<br>\r\nHe gave her a rueful version of his lopsided grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've stuck my foot in it big time,\" he replied.<br>\r\n\u201cLisa, don't be sorry. Heck, I should be the one<br>\r\napologizing to you. I dragged you in here<br>\r\nwithout even asking the important question.<br>\r\nI'll ask it now.\"<br>\r\nHe grabbed up her hand in his arms and gripped<br>\r\nit firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed unsure what to expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you like to do today?\" he asked.<br>\r\nLisa sniffed.<br>\r\n\"I'd like to stop growing, but that seems unlikely,\"<br>\r\nshe choked. She saw Michael's expression grow<br>\r\nsorrowful, and she offered him a sad smile,<br>\r\nruffling his hair with her free hand in apology.<br>\r\nHe bent his head down for a moment, then looked<br>\r\nup at her again, brightening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa, I wish I had the ability to do so, just so<br>\r\nI could make you happy,\" he said.<br>\r\n\"But, maybe if I can't do that I can at least help<br>\r\nyou get a handle on exactly what's happening to you.<br>\r\nIf you like I can call the Twins to take a look at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Twins?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my name for them. One's a physicist who<br>\r\nteaches at the Edneyville community college.<br>\r\nThe other's an internist and doctor--she's the one<br>\r\nwho twisted my arm to build the hospital at Edneyville<br>\r\nand a few other places to follow in my mothers shoes. They're married and they're very good in their fields.<br>\r\nWould you like me to call them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa hesitated, her eyes straying to the shrinking already<br>\r\nhealing scar on her arm from the curetter used on her<br>\r\nby the doctors at Brooks Air Force Base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" Michael added.<br>\r\n\"They will never do anything to you to hurt you, or that<br>\r\nyou don't want them to. Okay?\"<br>\r\nLisa nodded through her tears, echoing Michael's smile.<br>\r\nShe picked Michael up again and hugged him fiercely. Michael wrapped his arms around her neck and stroked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to be all right, Lisa,\" he whispered.<br>\r\n\"Trust me. It's going to be all right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa released Michael abruptly as Brian entered the<br>\r\nroom.  Brian's face bore a look of disapproval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Brian!\" Michael called around Lisa.<br>\r\nLooking over her shoulder she saw Brian's frown<br>\r\ndisappear to be replaced by a look of wonder.<br>\r\nHe seemed almost as surprised at Michael's behavior as <br>\r\nhe was at Michael's appearance and Lisa\u2019s earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna be a beautiful day today, Brian.<br>\r\nLet me introduce you properly.<br>\r\nLisa, please meet Brian, my domestic manager, butler, caretaker and all-around good guy.\"<br>\r\nBrian\u2019s surprise rose another notch as he smiled and<br>\r\nbowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how are you feeling this morning, sir?<br>\r\nI had hoped you would get more sleep than you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's always after me to take better care of myself,\"<br>\r\nMichael said in an undertone to Lisa. He walked<br>\r\naround her as she rose to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel great today, Brian. Got plenty of sleep last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, sir, if you say so,\" Brian answered.<br>\r\n\"But, after over two days of constant activity--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo days? Lisa wondered. That meant Michael hadn't<br>\r\nslept since the last  evening they were together.<br>\r\nNo wonder he'd fallen asleep in the pool last night.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Spread out on his desk were transcripts<br>\r\nof the interviews of every witness who had any<br>\r\ncontact with Lisa Porter and the mystery man,<br>\r\n\"Michael\". Lang looked at the rank of clocks parading<br>\r\nacross the far wall of the hut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was 8 a.m., Eastern time, and 10 p.m. the<br>\r\nprevious day here at Johnston.<br>\r\nHe felt his eyes closing from the fatigue of a 24<br>\r\nhour day. He reached out to his desk and pulled<br>\r\nopen the top drawer.<br>\r\nHe placed his hand in the drawer, gripping its metal<br>\r\nframe tightly. With a sudden, jerking motion he<br>\r\nslammed the door shut on his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noise echoed in the hut, abetting the pain he<br>\r\ncreated to keep himself awake.<br>\r\nLang looked down at his hand.<br>\r\nThis time he slammed the drawer hard enough to<br>\r\nbreak the skin on his knuckles and blood was<br>\r\nstarting to drip into the pencil tray of the compartment.<br>\r\nLang watched the blood oozing from his hand.<br>\r\nHe brought the throbbing digits to his mouth and<br>\r\nsucked the blood from them, swallowing the<br>\r\nsalty taste, then flexed his hand and looked at the transcripts again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There has to be something here,\" he muttered softly.<br>\r\nAll the transcripts had a few things in common:<br>\r\nall remarked on how fast Lisa Porter was growing,<br>\r\nhow big she was,<br>\r\nand how \"Michael\" stood by her and comforted her,<br>\r\nunafraid of her burgeoning size and strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interrogation of the senior floor nurse at the<br>\r\nhospital in New York gave Lang another nugget of information: she had seen the porter girl<br>\r\nand \"Michael\" cuddling together, implying intimacy<br>\r\nbetween them. That was useful information, though<br>\r\nit didn't help him currently.<br>\r\nThe latest transcript came from<br>\r\nBrooks AFB--Lang sneered his distaste at the<br>\r\nnearest wall for that shitter's paradise--resulting<br>\r\nfrom the abrupt return of an Air Force captain who<br>\r\nhad been abducted by this \"Michael\" along with the<br>\r\ngiant girl. Unfortunately her people had gotten to her<br>\r\nbefore DART's could, as she put in a call to her<br>\r\nCO at Eglin and then to General Mackenzie's office<br>\r\nat Brooks, and apparently babbled her head off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLang had found it necessary to contact<br>\r\nhis own commander, Viscount, to secure<br>\r\nher transfer to his people, along with the results<br>\r\nof her debriefing. She should be arriving at<br>\r\nJohnston any minute now, he reflected.<br>\r\nSo much the better, he would get the opportunity<br>\r\nto polish his interrogation skills on that Air Force puke.<br>\r\nLang snarled at the papers scattered on his desk in frustration. The results of every inquiry made by<br>\r\nDART through various government intermediaries<br>\r\nhad resulted in no useful information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInquiries made to the CIA to find out about all<br>\r\nmanufacturers of private aircraft which may<br>\r\nhave stealth capabilities or near-military performance<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n (the airplane or airplanes used in New York and<br>\r\nTexas had both)<br>\r\nhad turned up nothing so far. There was a new manufacturer, Beddington Industries in<br>\r\nAsheville, North Carolina, who had actually<br>\r\nbuilt a high-performance airplane with some<br>\r\nstealth characteristics under government contract,<br>\r\nbut both their prototype airplanes were reported<br>\r\non the ground at the time of the rescue<br>\r\nof the giantess from Brooks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe FAA and the FBI were going nuts trying<br>\r\nto figure out how somebody had hacked<br>\r\ninto the FAA computers twice and adroitly removed<br>\r\nthe identity of the airplanes involved, with no success. Contacting Customs had been a fruitless act<br>\r\nand tracking every active newswire service<br>\r\ngained him nothing--no weird shipments<br>\r\nof live cargo being rushed out of the country<br>\r\nto points unknown, no news reports of sightings<br>\r\nof naked bigfoots or other things which might lead<br>\r\nhim to that Porter girl, that bitch of a giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLang was privately furious that for all the<br>\r\ninformation collected under the umbrella<br>\r\nof the U.S. Government his DART team<br>\r\nwas unable to fix the position of the most<br>\r\nunusual woman on Earth--somewhere,<br>\r\nsomebody had the information he<br>\r\nneeded to repair his Cordon.</span></div></div>",

Lang watched as her image<br>\r\ngrew and grew again on the monitor, his eyes<br>\r\ntracing the picture of her body repeatedly<br>\r\nenlarging against the confines of the clothing<br>\r\nshe had made for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLang's hands began to tremble and a bubble<br>\r\nappeared in the corner of his mouth.<br>\r\nHe suddenly became aware of the dead silence<br>\r\nin the room and jerked upright, wiping his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" he announced.<br>\r\n\"Here's what we're going to do.

That kind of information is guaranteed to<br>\r\nbe leaked by somebody to the media.<br>\r\nWith any luck this 'Michael' and the<br>\r\nET-affected target will be spooked sufficiently<br>\r\nto become visible.\" Lang paused for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inform the team in New York to close out their<br>\r\noperation and return here for reassignment.<br>\r\nMove it, people!\"<br>\r\nLang stamped back into his office as the quiet<br>\r\nin the room was replaced by a purposeful bustle.<br>\r\nNo one questioned his orders, or himself--that<br>\r\nwas how they had been trained.<br>\r\nAnd no one saw the small wet spot in his crotch<br>\r\nbefore he began to issue his orders.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Polk County,<br>\r\nNorth Carolina<br>\r\nTuesday<br>\r\nJune 1st 2010</i><br>\r\n\"Can you sit up for me now, please, Miss Porter?\"<br>\r\nAs Lisa sat upright she pulled the squeeze bulb of<br>\r\nthe blood-pressure cuff wrapped around her upper<br>\r\narm out of Dr. Canfield's hand. Canfield squeaked in surprise and grabbed the bulb back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Lisa said contritely.<br>\r\nCanfield adjusted her granny glasses and peered up at<br>\r\nLisa's worried expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, don't you be,\" she replied.<br>\r\n\"Now, this'll be the last time I take<br>\r\nyour blood pressure.\"<br>\r\nCanfield seized the bulb and began squeezing it,<br>\r\ntightening the cuff on Lisa's arm. Lisa began to<br>\r\nsee why Michael had referred to her two<br>\r\nvisitors as \"the Twins\". Professor Augustan Odegard<br>\r\nwas an absurdly young-looking physics teacher,<br>\r\ntall and thin, with shoulder-length blond hair and hornrimmed glasses. His wife, Joann Canfield,<br>\r\nwas a robust, middle-sized woman with a gentle yet commanding air.<br>\r\nThe two did indeed seem to act as one, even<br>\r\nthough the one was white and the other black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple had arrived very quickly on Michaels<br>\r\nsummons. On being introduced to Lisa they<br>\r\nhad behaved completely differently once their<br>\r\ninitial shock was mastered--Canfield was all<br>\r\nconcern and attention at first sight while Odegard<br>\r\nlooked at her with a clinical detachment that<br>\r\nreminded her strongly of the people at Brooks.<br>\r\nBoth however turned out to be quite different<br>\r\nfrom all the other doctors she had encountered<br>\r\nsince her growth began. For all his detachment<br>\r\nOdegard had been first to offer her his hand and<br>\r\nhis absurd Terry-Thomas gaptoothed smile<br>\r\ncompletely destroyed any sense of coldness on<br>\r\nhis part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCanfield had firmly taken control once the<br>\r\nintroductions were made and steered Lisa<br>\r\nback into her tent-bedroom, shooing her husband<br>\r\nand<br>\r\nMichael  away. Her examination of Lisa was brief<br>\r\nand mercifully unintrusive,<br>\r\nalthough peculiar--Lisa had never before said \"ahhh\"<br>\r\nwhile lying on her stomach propped up on her<br>\r\nelbows, while her doctor squatted in front of her<br>\r\nface peering down her throat.<br>\r\nAs Canfield placed her stethoscope on Lisa's<br>\r\narm she opened the bulb valve, releasing the cuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the gauge reading dwindled she listened<br>\r\nintently, then stripped off the cuff and pulled it<br>\r\nfrom Lisa's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the verdict is\u2026?\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\nCanfield looked up at Lisa and showed her a<br>\r\ndazzling smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For someone who is--how tall did you say<br>\r\nyou're supposed to be, now?\"<br>\r\nLisa looked at the large-digital watch hung from<br>\r\nher neck by a chain. It read 12:35 p.m.<br>\r\n\"I should be a little over 18 feet tall, now,\" Lisa replied. Canfield looked over her glasses at<br>\r\nLisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, you are about the healthiest patient<br>\r\nI have ever seen.\"<br>\r\nLisa nodded, accepting Canfield's news gravely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how, but you are perfectly healthy,\"<br>\r\nCanfield repeated.<br>\r\n\u201cYour blood pressure is a little high, but<br>\r\nI suspect cuff fever rather than any<br>\r\nphysiological cause--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cuff fever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fear of being in a doctor's office often<br>\r\ndrives up blood pressure,\" Canfield replied.<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, you never need to be afraid of me.\"<br>\r\nShe pointed to the nearly-healed scar on Lisa's<br>\r\nforearm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don\u2019t use brute-force methods, ever.<br>\r\nNo, you are utterly normal, and that makes<br>\r\nno sense at all. Now, what I'd like you to do<br>\r\nis stand up for me, walk to the end of the tent<br>\r\nthere, then walk back, directly at me.<br>\r\nWalk normally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa rose, a little self-conscious at Odegard's<br>\r\npresence while in her underwear, and walked<br>\r\nto the far corner of the tent, then turned and<br>\r\nwalked directly towards Canfield, who watched<br>\r\nacutely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. Sit down again, Miss Porter--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, call me Lisa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, Lisa. Sit down here beside me.<br>\r\nYou suffer from dizzy spells, don\u2019t you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I do,\" Lisa replied, surprised.<br>\r\nCanfield smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's visible in your walk.<br>\r\nYou hesitated slightly before planting<br>\r\nyour foot on your fourth step towards me.<br>\r\nDearest,\" she continued, turning to her husband,<br>\r\n\u201cI am completely mystified by this. You see, Lisa,<br>\r\nyou shouldn't even be able to stand upright<br>\r\nwithout passing out. For your size you should<br>\r\nhave nearly twenty-five gallons of blood and<br>\r\nother fluids inside you, all of which should<br>\r\ncome rushing down into your feet the moment<br>\r\nyou sit or stand upright, leaving none in your<br>\r\nhead and upper torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour legs should be ballooned out from all that fluid.<br>\r\nThey're not. You shouldn\u2019t be able to draw a<br>\r\ndecent breath of air--any exertion should<br>\r\nmake you breathless. You don't. You lifted Michael,<br>\r\nwho probably weighs--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two hundred pounds,\" Odegard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lifted two hundred pounds using<br>\r\njust your arms and<br>\r\nback--not your legs--without any visible effort.<br>\r\nMy diagnosis is that your body is<br>\r\ncompensating for your increased size.<br>\r\nI saw you read the time on that watch around<br>\r\nyour neck without squinting.<br>\r\nCan you read my dearest's T-shirt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked at the caption on Odegard's<br>\r\nDilbert T-shirt.<br>\r\n\"It says, 'Technology is not for wimps'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can read--what is that, dearest,<br>\r\ntwo-inch high print?--from almost thirty feet<br>\r\naway. I can't read what it says on my<br>\r\nhusband's shirt and I'm standing next to him.\"<br>\r\nCanfield suddenly stopped speaking and<br>\r\nbowed her head away from Lisa.</span></div></div>",

This much data's gonna take a couple of<br>\r\ndays to get there via radio link, especially since<br>\r\nwe're encrypting it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe technicians continued to banter among themselves, their attention wandering from the screens they were watching. One image transmitted showed a<br>\r\nverdant hillside in which a wide clearing had been cut.<br>\r\nThe roof of a large, square house stood in the<br>\r\ncenter of the clearing. Two tents stood beside the<br>\r\nhouse, with another, smaller tent sitting in a stand<br>\r\nof trees nearby. A figure could be seen walking from<br>\r\none of the tents towards the house.<br>\r\nClad in white, it was moving across the lawn of the<br>\r\nproperty, heading for the house--and it looked like a<br>\r\ntwenty-foot tall woman. The image was automatically classified and measured by the sophisticated imagery computers, then recorded on the massive disk drives<br>\r\nto wait its turn to be encrypted and transmitted to<br>\r\nJohnston Atoll.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Polk County, North Carolina</i><br>\r\nLisa opened the solarium doors and stepped into<br>\r\nthe house. Brian appeared as if by magic and walked<br>\r\nright up to her, a broad smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I trust everything went well with Doctor Canfield?<br>\r\nExcellent. Please come inside.\"<br>\r\nBrian gestured grandly as he opened the double<br>\r\ndoors and led her inside. Lisa frog-walked through<br>\r\nthe vestibule into the living room. She saw Michael,<br>\r\nDoctor Canfield, Professor Odegard and another<br>\r\nman, all having a heated conversation.<br>\r\nMichael looked up first and grinned at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa! Good. I'd like to introduce you to<br>\r\nDon Schiff. Don's my financial manager. He keeps<br>\r\ntelling me how much money I'm wasting.<br>\r\nDon, please meet Lisa Porter.\"<br>\r\nLisa stepped slowly towards the group.<br>\r\nSchiff reminded her of an old hound dog,<br>\r\nbaggy-eyed and wrinkled.<br>\r\nHis hair was graying and thick wire-framed<br>\r\nspectacles sat on his nose.<br>\r\nHe puffed a disreputable looking pipe as he rose to<br>\r\nhis feet and looked up at Lisa--and up, and up.<br>\r\nClouds of smoke erupted as he puffed harder on<br>\r\nhis pipe, filling the air. He rocked on his heels, back<br>\r\nand forth, his hand over the mouth of his pipe's bowl.<br>\r\nSmoke began to curl from his nostrils as he<br>\r\npuffed some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" Lisa said softly, smiling down at the man.<br>\r\n\"I am pleased to meet you.\"<br>\r\nSchiff said nothing. His pipe began to choke as<br>\r\nit ran out of tobacco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don\u2019t be afraid of me,\" Lisa said. Schiff's<br>\r\nface did not quiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not,\" he replied.<br>\r\n\"I'm astonished by you--and I am pleased to<br>\r\nmake your acquaintance.\"<br>\r\nHis didacticism made Odegard look like a<br>\r\nShakespearean actor.<br>\r\nThen he suddenly burst into a fit of giggling, his<br>\r\nexpression broken into a smile, shooting a wreath<br>\r\nof smoke up at Lisa.  Lisa almost giggled in return.<br>\r\nSchiff strode right up to her foot and reached up.<br>\r\nLisa took his hand and shook it, seeing Michael smiling enough to split his face in two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, Don, what did I tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are certainly guilty of no exaggeration this time, Michael,\" Schiff replied.<br>\r\n\"You are very pretty, Miss Porter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Lisa replied with a blush.<br>\r\nMichael motioned to her and she knelt<br>\r\nbeside the group. She noticed that Michael had<br>\r\nlost his ebullience of a moment before, and now<br>\r\nlooked up at her, frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa, I just got some bad news,\" he began.<br>\r\n\"I hope you won't mind my sharing with everyone<br>\r\nhere, because we need their advice.<br>\r\nNow, right after I left you at Vassar hospital,<br>\r\none of the first things I did was contact<br>\r\nGeorge McCandless, a private investigator in<br>\r\nNew York. I asked George to go to your home<br>\r\nand take a look at it--I figured that you would<br>\r\nwant some of your things from there, like your<br>\r\nCD's and your paintings, and I was going to have<br>\r\nhim work out bringing your stuff down here for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway when he got there yesterday morning, he<br>\r\nfound the place was crawling with people.<br>\r\nHe couldn\u2019t get close enough to see what was<br>\r\nhappening inside your house but he could see<br>\r\nmore of those CDC types in their special suits.<br>\r\nHe reported to me that they were literally<br>\r\nbagging your entire house, surrounding it with<br>\r\nplastic. He then went to Dr. Peterson's office and<br>\r\nfound the same thing going on.<br>\r\nNeither the doctor nor his wife was there.<br>\r\nHe hung around as long as he could, until the<br>\r\ngoons around your home took an interest in him,<br>\r\nin fact, then he booked.<br>\r\nHe tried going back to your house again this<br>\r\nmorning, figuring that the government people<br>\r\nwould have closed up shop and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa, I'm sorry, but he tells me they burned your<br>\r\nhouse down this morning. He said the place<br>\r\nlooked like it had been exploded--some kind of<br>\r\naccelerant was definitely used.<br>\r\nHe then checked Peterson's home and office<br>\r\nand found the same thing--'burning like crazy'<br>\r\nwas the way he put it.\"<br>\r\nLisa's mouth fell open, and a tear left one eye<br>\r\nand trailed down her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer home, the place where she'd been born,<br>\r\nwas gone. Michael reached out and touched<br>\r\nher knee, looking anxiously into her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm all right,\" she said, nodding for him to<br>\r\ncontinue. She blushed to see the obvious prid<br>\r\n he had in her, and then he turned back to<br>\r\nhis audience.</span></div></div>",

An overt act like burning down her<br>\r\nhouse, for whatever reason, speaks of a military<br>\r\nrather than a bureaucratic mindset.<br>\r\nI think Lang is the one in charge now, rather than<br>\r\nTurner, and that makes it dangerous for Lisa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa felt a chill run down her spine.<br>\r\nShe remembered Lang--his thin, sallow face<br>\r\nand hissing, scratchy voice.<br>\r\nMichael saw her blanch and rubbed her knee again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa, how would you like to take a trip for a while?\"<br>\r\nMichael asked. \"Australia, Japan, Bahrain,<br>\r\nSouth Africa?

He promises me it'll be ready<br>\r\nin two days. The other clothing I ordered for you <br>\r\nwill arrive this afternoon and tomorrow morning.\"<br>\r\nMichael reached out and grasped Lisa's flaccid hand, squeezing it tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can promise you sights you've never seen before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael, you're not the type to run<br>\r\naway--from anything,\"<br>\r\nLisa said after finding her voice.<br>\r\nShe saw the others nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to let those bastards try to hurt you.<br>\r\nNever. I can't fight the military that easily, Lisa.<br>\r\nLang probably has the entire drive train of the<br>\r\nmilitary at his disposal. I-I won't be able to protect<br>\r\nyou from that, and I'm not going to let them take<br>\r\nyou away again. Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was astonished at his depth of<br>\r\nfeeling--and she could see the others were<br>\r\nsurprised, too. She smiled in acquiescence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Idiot.... -sigh- Of course, Michael,\" Lisa replied.<br>\r\nShe bent low to kiss his forehead.<br>\r\n\u201cI'll go with you, wherever you want to go.<br>\r\nI'd like to see the world.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was late that night when the precipitation<br>\r\nfrom the storm finally arrived over Polk County.<br>\r\nLisa lay in the rotenburo, a hot towel on her head, <br>\r\nMichael nestled against her breasts in the<br>\r\nsteaming water. Two large trays floated on the still<br>\r\nsurface of the bath, one with two carafes of apple<br>\r\njuice and the other with two beakers of a fruit punch. Suddenly in the dim light surrounding the pool tiny<br>\r\ndroplets began to fall down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Michael, it's starting to rain,\" Lisa said.<br>\r\nMichael opened his eyes and looked up.<br>\r\nHe blinked as one droplet fell into his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humph.  A summer shower pretty rare around<br>\r\nhere this early in the season.

Lisa moaned in<br>\r\nresponse to his stimulation and ran her hands<br>\r\nacross his belly, then lower down.<br>\r\nShe smiled as his hands began to stroke her mounds.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian escorted Schiff from the house.<br>\r\nThey paused on the threshold, looking up at the<br>\r\nsky.

His stomach growled from<br>\r\nthe vending machine food he had been<br>\r\nsupporting himself on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing he needed was a distraction as the<br>\r\ncontract he signed with Gail put him on the clock<br>\r\nin the worst way, but there was no ignoring the<br>\r\nnew occupants of his office.<br>\r\nThe three investigators-- one from the<br>\r\nFederal Aviation Administration and two from<br>\r\nthe Civil Aeronautics Board-- were poring<br>\r\nover the documentation amassed so far on the<br>\r\ndesign and performance of the<br>\r\nSecurity Special prototype aircraft.<br>\r\nThe logbooks of their one test pilot, Sally Roder,<br>\r\nalso stood open, and were being inspected<br>\r\nover and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I probably could help you guys if you told<br>\r\nme what you were looking for,\"<br>\r\nBeddington offered, for the third time.<br>\r\nThree pairs of unfriendly eyes stared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just a standard inspection, Mr. Beddington,\" the FAA inspector said.<br>\r\n<i>\u2019At six in the fucking morning?\u2019</i><br>\r\nBeddington thought.<br>\r\n<i>\u2019They must take me for an idiot!

She was very careful not to disturb<br>\r\nMichael  as he slept peacefully in his corner of<br>\r\nthe futon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned onto her belly but the weight of her<br>\r\nupper torso pressed her bosom too firmly into the<br>\r\nfuton for comfort. She felt the breeze being<br>\r\ncirculated by the overhead fan on her bare feet<br>\r\nand shifted her blanket a little lower on her body.<br>\r\nHer feet also now just extended past the edge of<br>\r\nthe twenty-foot long mattress Michael  had<br>\r\ncrafted for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa rose on her elbows and looked at the<br>\r\nwatch-and-neck chain she wore yesterday.<br>\r\n7 a.m. She worked out the now-familiar math<br>\r\nin her head and sighed again. If her growth rate had continued as before--and it had--she was now<br>\r\n21 feet eight and one-half inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2019I wish I could sleep,\u2019</i> Lisa thought.<br>\r\n<i>\u2019At least then I wouldn't feel myself<br>\r\ngrowing.

The grass was coated by<br>\r\na layer of morning dew, slippery and cold,<br>\r\nbut Lisa felt no discomfort; last night she did not<br>\r\nfeel the stinging of the hot water in their bathing<br>\r\npool, so now she did not feel the cold--her body<br>\r\nmust be instantly adapting to extremes of<br>\r\ntemperature as well as improving her<br>\r\nperception and size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa stepped briskly, taking seventeen strides to<br>\r\nreach the tent. As she stepped into the tent over<br>\r\nher toilet she felt the first sense of confinement<br>\r\nsince she arrived at Michael's--no, their home<br>\r\nshe reminded herself.<br>\r\nThe heat lamp overhead warmed her scalp to<br>\r\nthe point of discomfort before she seated herself.<br>\r\nEverything had radically diminished in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, that was wrong. She had just grown <br>\r\n25% percent bigger since this same time yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shower helped restore some of  Lisa's sense<br>\r\nof equilibrium. She scrubbed herself raw,<br>\r\ncheered by the sensation of cleanliness.<br>\r\nShe emptied the remainder of her shampoo<br>\r\nbottle onto her hair, which now hung down just passed<br>\r\nthe middle of her back, massaged the mass<br>\r\nthoroughly, then rinsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts and vulva were still incredibly<br>\r\nsensitive--Michael  had brought her to climax six<br>\r\ntimes last night, and she had returned the<br>\r\nfavor twice. Smiling at the memory, she stroked<br>\r\nherself while standing under the shower until she<br>\r\nfelt a weak orgasm ripple through her frame.<br>\r\nThe pleasure was almost addictive.<br>\r\nIt helped her not to think about how alien her<br>\r\nburgeoning body seemed to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only she stopped growing, even if only for a<br>\r\nlittle while, then she could begin to adapt to<br>\r\nher new size and self, but she was still growing,<br>\r\nrapidly and methodically.<br>\r\nLisa cuffed the sense of fear gnawing her as<br>\r\nshe toweled herself.<br>\r\nShe slipped back into her bedroom-tent and<br>\r\nkneeled to administer a careful peck to Michael,<br>\r\nthen rummaged amongst the new clothing she had acquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst new underwear and a new pair of<br>\r\nsocks--she'd worn through the soles of the<br>\r\nprevious pair of sock-shoes in just one day\u2014<br>\r\nand then, this time, oatmeal-colored sweatpants<br>\r\nand pullover shirt, fleece-lined and comfortable. <br>\r\nShe braided her hair and stepped outside,<br>\r\ninhaling the cold air deeply. The sky had cleared<br>\r\novernight and the sun was peeking up over<br>\r\nthe horizon, warming her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa  smiled at the sun and decided to hunt up<br>\r\nBrian to see if she could be useful--better to distract<br>\r\nherself from the sensation of her body slowly<br>\r\nsqueezing itself out of her current clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa bent to pull open the solarium door and<br>\r\nstepped inside its lush warmth.<br>\r\nShe heard the sound of cooking coming from<br>\r\nher left through the small door leading into the<br>\r\nkitchen and pantry area.<br>\r\nThe aroma of cooking sausages and<br>\r\nfresh-baked bread made her mouth water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa dropped to her hands and knees and<br>\r\npony-walked towards the door, then stopped abruptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've had some excitement here for the<br>\r\nlast two days, dear,\" she heard Brian say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Porter is a very beautiful woman,<br>\r\nfor all she's so big and growing bigger every<br>\r\nday. But the most amazing thing is how much<br>\r\nMr.Gail has changed since he met Miss Porter.<br>\r\nDo you remember when we first met?<br>\r\nIt's the same for him. Miss Porter has changed<br>\r\nMr.Gail utterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemember when I told you how cold and<br>\r\ndistant Mr.Gail always seemed, never truly<br>\r\nopening himself up to any of the people he met?<br>\r\nHe has changed marvelously.<br>\r\nNow he lets his feelings show to everybody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa drew just close enough to the door to see<br>\r\ninside clearly. Brian, in a broad white apron to<br>\r\nprotect his major-domo clothing, was standing<br>\r\nbefore the huge cookstove in the kitchen,<br>\r\nscrambling a skillet full of eggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian's head was turned away from her towards<br>\r\na small portrait sitting on a table draped with a<br>\r\nwhite cloth in the corner of the room.<br>\r\nAbove the portrait Lisa saw a golden crucifix,<br>\r\ncarefully hung. She focused her eyes on the picture. <br>\r\nIt was of a middle-aged, solid woman, her hair<br>\r\nbound but uncovered. A tiny photograph of a small<br>\r\nboy with a brilliant smile was stuck carefully into<br>\r\nthe portrait frame.</span></div></div>",

It's wonderful to see young people<br>\r\nin love, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was embarrassed at eavesdropping on<br>\r\nBrian and his remarkable one-sided conversation.<br>\r\nShe backed slowly away from the door, then<br>\r\nstood and quickly exited the solarium, closing<br>\r\nthe glass panels with exaggerated care.<br>\r\nShe half-ran back to her tent-bedroom,<br>\r\nalmost jumping through the flaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped just inside the entrance, then moved<br>\r\nto stand next to her lover. Michael  was still asleep,<br>\r\nlying on his belly, half-covered by the sheet<br>\r\nand blanket. Lisa dropped to her knees and reached<br>\r\nout to gently lay a hand on Michael's bare shoulders.<br>\r\nHe murmured softly in his sleep at her touch, a<br>\r\nhalf-smile forming on his face. Lisa  bit her lip and<br>\r\nwiped away the tear that formed in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am very lucky, aren\u2019t I?\"<br>\r\nshe whispered down to him.<br>\r\n\u201cI am the luckiest girl  in the world.\"<br>\r\nShe shook him gently and he grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, sleepyhead.

Sleep well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best ever.\" Michael  caressed Lisa's<br>\r\nlips one more time, then flung himself<br>\r\nout of the bed and trotted towards the<br>\r\nshower tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did your night go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As usual.

He never misses anything<br>\r\ngoing on around him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SAS?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpecial Air Service--British antiterrorist unit.<br>\r\nYou see, Lisa, Brian is here as much to provide<br>\r\nsecurity as to be a butler or cook or caretaker.<br>\r\nI didn't tell you, but I had an incident happen three<br>\r\nyears ago when I lived in Asheville.<br>\r\nTwo thugs invaded my condo--I guess they figured<br>\r\nI had a safe full of money in the house--and<br>\r\nI ended up having to use a gun to defend myself<br>\r\nagainst the bastards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScared off one and held the other for the police.<br>\r\nThat happened right after I was interviewed<br>\r\nby the local media people here.<br>\r\nNever talked to them since--remember I ran<br>\r\nthat People Magazine asshole off my property?<br>\r\nOnce I stopped shaking I bought this property<br>\r\nand spoke to some people, who recommended<br>\r\nBrian to me. He's here to help keep<br>\r\nme--and you--safe from harm,<br>\r\nand he's very good at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was stunned. Michael reached up and<br>\r\ngrasped her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, beautiful,\" he replied.<br>\r\n\"There's a pretty sophisticated security system<br>\r\naround the borders of our property, Brian's here,<br>\r\nand that was the only time anything bad's ever<br>\r\nhappened to me. We're perfectly safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa allowed herself to be comforted.<br>\r\nShe cocked her eye at Michael's naked form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think it's time you got dressed?\" she said.<br>\r\n\"Brian's got breakfast ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, don't I look good?<br>\r\nHulk Hogan--pro wrestling,\" he said,<br>\r\nadopting several bodybuilder poses, flexing<br>\r\nand grunting. Lisa grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look terrific, but you're going to embarrass<br>\r\nyourself at my breakfast table with your bare butt<br>\r\nhanging in the air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be there in five,\" he replied, turning on his heel.<br>\r\nHe was almost through the portal of the shower<br>\r\nroom when he heard  Lisa gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLisa what is it? What-what's wrong? Lisa?\"<br>\r\nMichael said as he turned on his heel.<br>\r\nLisa  had suddenly gone nearly the same color<br>\r\nas the sweatsuit she wore. Her blue-green eyes<br>\r\nwere wide open.<br>\r\n\"Oh, God. Michael, I've forgotten something.<br>\r\nMy sister!

To boost his income<br>\r\nduring the slow season or slow periods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, I see now,\" Lisa  said.<br>\r\nShe had focused on the boat a hundred<br>\r\nyards away and saw<br>\r\nFARNSWORTH BAIT &amp; TACKLE stenciled<br>\r\nin yellow near its prow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael , I don't think those kids are<br>\r\nmore than eight years old. They sure look cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guttural sound of the boat's engine rose<br>\r\nand fell, sputtering occasionally.<br>\r\nMichael  cocked his ear towards the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope whoever's running that thing doesn't break<br>\r\ndown out there. I doubt there'll be anybody<br>\r\navailable to give him a tow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa smiled and watched the gaggle of<br>\r\nwell-wrapped children standing in the craft,<br>\r\nall wearing bright orange life preservers,<br>\r\nholding tightly to its metal handrails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boat was obviously old, its wooden hull gray. <br>\r\nThe engine sputtered and a backfired with a<br>\r\nresounding echo, then its noise stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boat, now perhaps fifty yards from the shore,<br>\r\nbegan drifting in their direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That figures.\" Michael  snorted again.<br>\r\n\"Well, if they can't get it started I'll call Farnsworth<br>\r\nand tell him he needs to retrieve his boat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa focused her full attention on the boat.<br>\r\nShe could hear high-pitched voices<br>\r\nchattering animatedly as a<br>\r\ncounterpoint to a low conversation from<br>\r\nthe three older people in the boat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne adult figure walked to the rear of the boat<br>\r\nand yanked at something below<br>\r\nthe gunwale. As a hatch cover came up<br>\r\nshe saw a tendril of smoke rise from the<br>\r\nrear of the boat.<br>\r\nIn a few seconds the tendril became a<br>\r\nchurning mass fanned across the boat<br>\r\nby the breeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMichael, that boat's on fire,\"<br>\r\nLisa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael  thrust himself into the brush to<br>\r\nget a clear view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shit!\" He yanked his phone from his belt.<br>\r\nLisa  stood fully erect, bringing her head<br>\r\nabove the brush for a clearer view.<br>\r\nShe saw gusts of white against the black<br>\r\nsmoke as another adult applied an extinguisher<br>\r\nto the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA distinct whoosh saw visible flames<br>\r\nflash into the face of the boat's pilot,<br>\r\nwho fell out of sight.<br>\r\nThe chattering was quickly replaced by<br>\r\nscreams and cries as smoke and<br>\r\nfire began to reach out towards<br>\r\nthe boat's passengers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa gulped, breathing heavily as she<br>\r\nsaw the kids all rush to the bow of the<br>\r\nboat, pressing closely together.<br>\r\nThe children began to abandon the<br>\r\nboat in the face of the smoke and fire,<br>\r\nsome jumping overboard, some being pushed,<br>\r\nstruggling as their clothes became waterlogged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chorus of tiny voices screaming in fear and<br>\r\npanic was nerve-shattering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMichael\u2014-\u201c Lisa began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael had the phone to his ear,<br>\r\ntalking quickly and urgently.<br>\r\nShe clenched her hands into fists and<br>\r\njumped through the brush,<br>\r\nrunning to the small beach beyond the path,<br>\r\nsplashing into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feet slipped on sand and mud as<br>\r\nshe made her way out to the boat,<br>\r\nwhich was now fully afire.<br>\r\nThe water came up to her knees,<br>\r\nher thighs, her waist.<br>\r\nShe kept moving, wading out until she was<br>\r\nup to her chest in the cold<br>\r\nwater--and within arm's reach of the kids<br>\r\nfloating around the boat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSwim to me, swim to me,\"<br>\r\nLisa called out.<br>\r\nShe cupped one child--a pretty blond-haired girl--<br>\r\nin her hand and swept her up to her shoulder.<br>\r\nThe little girl, choking and spitting,<br>\r\nlay face down on the warm, dry surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa reached out for more, wading around<br>\r\nthe boat, moving quickly but gently.<br>\r\nOne pitch-headed boy looked at her and<br>\r\nrealized how big his rescuer was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PISSFUCKBULLSHIT!\" he yelled,<br>\r\nhis dark eyes round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's all right, don't be afraid, swim to me,\"<br>\r\nLisa said softly.<br>\r\nHe slowly began to dog-paddle towards her.<br>\r\nShe raised her hand beneath him,<br>\r\nlifting him clear and prompting another<br>\r\nround of obscenities.

She tried to unsnap the<br>\r\nbulky vest but her fingers were too big to<br>\r\nwork its clasp. She gripped the vest front<br>\r\nand yanked, neatly snapping the webbing,<br>\r\nthen carefully drew it from around the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa  turned to the next child,<br>\r\nwho squeaked as her giant hands came near.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's all right.

Some of the children<br>\r\nwere so cold they couldn't speak<br>\r\nthrough their shivering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael, these kids need something to<br>\r\nwarm them,\" Lisa  said.<br>\r\nMichael  looked up from the three<br>\r\nteenagers whom he had laid out on the<br>\r\nbeach and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese three are non-smokers--no<br>\r\nway to make a fire except the<br>\r\nboy-scout way, and I was never a boy scout.\"<br>\r\n\"Next time I go jogging I'm bringing matches,\" he replied. </span></div></div>",

Here, Miss Porter,\"<br>\r\nhe said, offering her a covered roll of<br>\r\ngauze and a small tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take Mr. Gail  home and clean his hands<br>\r\ncarefully with cold water, then spread this<br>\r\ncream on the affected areas and wrap them<br>\r\nwell with the gauze.<br>\r\nI should be able to return within the hour<br>\r\nand look at Mr. Gail's injuries more closely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMichael, he's right,\"<br>\r\nLisa  said, suddenly shy of meeting other people.<br>\r\nMichael  gathered himself to argue, then nodded.<br>\r\nHe tried rubbing his arms with his hands and<br>\r\ngrimaced in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" Lisa  said, slipping the first aid<br>\r\nsupplies into a growth-fold of her shirt and<br>\r\nlifting him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brian, we'll see you back at the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\"Very well, Miss Porter,\" he replied.<br>\r\nLisa cradled Michael  to her and started<br>\r\nto turn for the path when she felt something<br>\r\ngrab her ankle.<br>\r\nShe looked down and saw the little<br>\r\nblond-haired girl hugging her leg.<br>\r\nLisa bent down to gently caress the girl with<br>\r\nher free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, you're okay, now.\" She murmured.<br>\r\nThe girl said nothing but looked up and<br>\r\ngrabbed at Lisa's fingers, trying to hold her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I have to go now--Kathy, isn't it?<br>\r\nThis man needs help, too,\"<br>\r\nLisa said in apology, smiling down on the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKathy reluctantly released her hold on<br>\r\nLisa\u2019s fingers and waved as Lisa began to<br>\r\nwalk quickly, back down the path they had come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that way. The volunteers'll be using the path,\"<br>\r\nMichael  said.<br>\r\nHe pointed out a continuation of the path<br>\r\nleading off to her right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go that way. It leads right back to the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa lengthened her stride and walked as<br>\r\nquickly as she could.<br>\r\nAlthough she did not feel cold at all after her<br>\r\nducking she could tell that Michael was<br>\r\nnot doing as well--he was beginning to shiver<br>\r\nin the breeze of her passage.<br>\r\nWhen Michael  suddenly sneezed<br>\r\nLisa  stopped momentarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\"Don't you dare catch cold,on me  Michael  Porter,\"<br>\r\nshe said with mock seriousness.<br>\r\nMichael rubbed his nose with his sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? I don't catch colds,<br>\r\nwe just make friends for a bit,\" he replied.<br>\r\nHe started coughing violently, doubling over<br>\r\nfrom the paroxysms. Lisa frowned with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was good for those kids is good for you, too,\"<br>\r\nshe said, pulling open the neck hole of her shirt and<br>\r\nslipping Michael  down her front.<br>\r\nShe cradled him through her shirt with one hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Comfy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael wriggled.<br>\r\n\"Your bra's giving me a wedgie,\" he complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? Okay,\" Lisa grinned.<br>\r\nShe reached under her shirt and slipped<br>\r\nher budding breasts out of their cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better?\"<br>\r\nShe felt Michael  settle against  her cleavage<br>\r\nas her bra rode up her chest and back,<br>\r\nhis head and shoulders sticking up out of the<br>\r\nneck hole of her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoo, you're cold.\"<br>\r\nShe began striding quickly down the path again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" he replied, and sneezed again.<br>\r\n\u201cThat does feel better, out of the wind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael was quiet on the journey back.<br>\r\nHe had stopped shivering but still sneezed<br>\r\noccasionally and his coughs were wracking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa  thought about jogging but decided <br>\r\nagainst the increased speed--<br>\r\nMichael  would rattle around inside her<br>\r\nshirt too much. Now that her sudden, unexpected<br>\r\nadventure was over Lisa  felt a jumble of emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized that all the efforts <br>\r\nMichael had  made to protect her from<br>\r\ndetection had just gone by the wayside.<br>\r\nShe was torn between a sense of reward for<br>\r\nhaving rescued the children from the burning<br>\r\nboat and shame at having undone 2 weeks of elaborate<br>\r\neffort to keep her unknown to the local populace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the children's stories about<br>\r\nher could be discounted as imaginary by<br>\r\ntheir parents, the three teen monitors would<br>\r\nnot be so easily dismissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would they say to the authorities<br>\r\nwhen they were asked what happened?<br>\r\nLisa wondered just how long it would<br>\r\ntake for the news of the incident to reach<br>\r\nfirst the state and then federal authorities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael had said that it would take another <br>\r\nseveral days or so for the airplanes to be<br>\r\nready for their escape from the reach of the<br>\r\npeople who had taken her before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa tried to focus on the positive thing<br>\r\nshe had done--rescuing those kids--but the<br>\r\nproblem she had just caused Michael  and<br>\r\nherself worked around like grit inside her mind.<br>\r\nEventually, she voiced her thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well blew it, didn't I?\" she asked.<br>\r\nShe slowed her pace and bent her head,<br>\r\nblinking. Then she felt Michael\u2019s arms<br>\r\nencircle her neck firmly, throttling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she asked, stopping and gently pulling<br>\r\non his arm to ease the sense of choking.<br>\r\nMichael lifted his head from the hollow of<br>\r\nher throat and gave her the brightest smile<br>\r\nshe had seen yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am proud of you,\" he said.<br>\r\n\"I am so proud I could bust.<br>\r\nYou are a wonderful person, Lisa Porter.<br>\r\nYou saved those children from real harm.<br>\r\nYou did so even at your own risks!<br>\r\nI must be the luckiest man in the<br>\r\nworld to have you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa opened her mouth in surprise.<br>\r\nMichael  laughed and hugged her neck again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't believe it's true,\" he said.<br>\r\n\"Believe me, it is. Every word of it.<br>\r\nIf you hadn't been there they would've been<br>\r\nburned in the boat, or gone overboard and<br>\r\ndrifted halfway down the lake until they were<br>\r\nhalf-dead from exposure. You saved them Lisa..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was lucky we were both there, <br>\r\nMichael--\" Lisa began, picking up<br>\r\nher pace again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-uh. Only you could have gotten<br>\r\nthose kids out of the water as promptly as<br>\r\nyou did. If I'd been there alone I would<br>\r\nhave had to swim from boat to shore over<br>\r\nand over again for each kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf of them would've floated away out of my<br>\r\nreach before I could rescue them.<br>\r\nNo, you are the reason they're all okay.<br>\r\nYou, the twenty-foot woman with the<br>\r\ntwelve-foot reach and hands big enough<br>\r\nto cup an eight-year old--only you,<br>\r\nas you are now, could have rescued all<br>\r\nof them so quickly.<br>\r\nAnd that's all that matters right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael coughed again.<br>\r\nLisa felt herself warm from Michael's praise.<br>\r\nShe rubbed his body through her shirt and<br>\r\nbrushed his head with her chin.<br>\r\nA smile of elation crossed her face, and<br>\r\nshe pressed Michael  against her and<br>\r\nbegan to run again.</span></div></div>",

It was weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the kids also seemed obsessed<br>\r\nwith the idea of a \"big lady\".<br>\r\nOne boy related how she held him in her<br>\r\nhand to warm him when he was shivering<br>\r\nall over from being in the water.<br>\r\nThompson's wife told him she was beginning<br>\r\nto be worried about Kathy because she wanted<br>\r\nto see \"the giant lady\" again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven more puzzling was the reaction<br>\r\nof the hardworking chief internist<br>\r\nand hospital administrator, Joann Canfield.<br>\r\nAfter overhearing the children talking Thompson<br>\r\nsaw Doctor Canfield's eyes grow wide,<br>\r\nthen she suddenly started guffawing<br>\r\nand excused herself from the emergency room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThompson had tried to ask about her<br>\r\nunusual reaction but she had just shaken<br>\r\nher head, convulsed with laughter.<br>\r\nIt was strange, unusual--hinky.<br>\r\nSave for the burned boy all the kids had<br>\r\ncome through remarkably well from the<br>\r\nboating accident, a happy event.<br>\r\nBut something was wrong, something<br>\r\ndidn't jibe, something didn't make sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the fax his office<br>\r\nreceived that morning.<br>\r\nOriginated by the North Carolina Department of Investigation, it relayed an alert issued by the U.S. Department of Justice about a weapons<br>\r\ntheft from a military base in Texas days ago,<br>\r\nwhich involved \"possible biological weapons materials\"<br>\r\nand the reported use of airplanes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThompson had received complaints<br>\r\nfrom one resident about low-flying jet<br>\r\nairplanes flying<br>\r\nthat night from Michael Gail's private airstrip<br>\r\nand the fax mentioned someone identified<br>\r\nonly as \"Mike or Michael\" as the leader of this new, apparently violent citizen's militia group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThompson did not automatically accept the<br>\r\ninformation as valid; his own experience<br>\r\nwith federal authorities had not exactly been<br>\r\nreassuring--a DEA raid on a purported drug<br>\r\nlab in Polk County turned into an embarrassing<br>\r\nexperience for a combination<br>\r\nfederal-state-local law enforcement task<br>\r\nforce and a frightening experience for an<br>\r\neighty-year old grandmother whose<br>\r\nonly drug habit was prescription medications<br>\r\nfor arthritis--but an interview with<br>\r\nGail was certainly in order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo many things happened over the<br>\r\nlast couple of days or so--too many strange things.<br>\r\nHinky.<br>\r\nThompson didn't like hinky things<br>\r\nhappening in his jurisdiction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty five minutes of rapid driving found him<br>\r\nback in Polk County on Reservoir Road.<br>\r\nAfter passing the deputy stationed at the<br>\r\njunction of the road with the highway he slowed,<br>\r\nfollowing the macadam bordering the<br>\r\nGreen river, heading for the reservoir and<br>\r\nthe Gail property.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThompson had only met Gail a couple of times<br>\r\nin Columbus three years ago, when he<br>\r\nhad proposed bringing new businesses<br>\r\nto the county.<br>\r\nThose businesses had generated tremendous<br>\r\nreturns and the resulting revenue permitted a<br>\r\nten percent drop in county taxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose businesses also boosted local economic<br>\r\ncircumstances so well that they had achieved<br>\r\nthe lowest unemployment and poverty in the<br>\r\ncountry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGail was a philanthropist, too, funding<br>\r\nthe building of that new hospital in<br>\r\nEdneyville and expansions to the medical campus<br>\r\nand an additional 2 wings onto the college there,<br>\r\nas well as a new school building in Columbus,<br>\r\nthe free senior clinic in Tryon--<br>\r\nand the new,<br>\r\nfully-equipped state-of-the-art patrol<br>\r\ncars he and his deputies were using<br>\r\nas well as renovations to 3 police stations<br>\r\nand 4 fire stations in the surrounding counties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGail had been pleasant if quiet, Thompson recalled. </span></div></div>",

Distracting<br>\r\nhimself by wondering about the weather<br>\r\nwas not going to get him any answers.<br>\r\nHe thumped his way up the steps to the front door<br>\r\nand rang the bell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the third ring the door abruptly opened.<br>\r\nHe saw the Indian-looking butler of the house,<br>\r\nwho smiled and bowed him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Mr. Gail here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" the butler replied.<br>\r\nThompson couldn't help feeling the man was<br>\r\nconcerned about something.<br>\r\nThe hinky meter jumped another notch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you will please follow me I will<br>\r\nbring you to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThompson followed the butler through a<br>\r\nhallway to the main floor of the home.<br>\r\nHe was impressed by the house, his eyes<br>\r\nprofessionally noting the furnishings and fittings.<br>\r\nNo wonder this Mr Gail had installed<br>\r\na custom-made security system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was led around a corner and found<br>\r\nGail sitting at his desk. Gail rose immediately,<br>\r\na smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Sheriff Thompson,\"<br>\r\nhe said, smiling broadly.<br>\r\nHe held up his two hands, which were<br>\r\nwrapped in gauze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please pardon me for not offering my hand.<br>\r\nI'm afraid I got a little burned this morning.<br>\r\nDo you want to speak to me about the<br>\r\naccident at the lake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Thompson replied.<br>\r\nHis hinky meter just went off<br>\r\nscale--this man was nothing like the quiet,<br>\r\ntaciturn speaker at those county board meetings<br>\r\nthree years ago.<br>\r\nHe was smiling and relaxed if<br>\r\na little pale in the light.<br>\r\nHe waved Thompson into the living area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I get you something?

No serious injuries?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were all right as rain.

I really need to speak to this Miss Porter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, sheriff. I didn't know she would<br>\r\nbe needed for your investigation.<br>\r\nLike I said, I can get her number for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would appreciate it, Mr. Gail,\"<br>\r\nThompson replied.<br>\r\nHe looked around the vast room admiringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not doing any remodeling or<br>\r\nbuilding, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those two big tents outside, and the<br>\r\nother tent off in the woods there,\"<br>\r\nThompson replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assumed you were engaged in some<br>\r\nserious building here. Brand new, from the look<br>\r\nof them. Are you working on another project?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not at all. The tents are for storage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorage? And with a dozen trucks<br>\r\nrumbling up the road every day for several days.<br>\r\nThe hinky meter exploded.<br>\r\nThompson made a show of sitting<br>\r\nback in his chair, and sipped noisily<br>\r\nfrom his coffee.</span></div></div>",

Well then, how about Hokkaido?<br>\r\nIt's full winter in northern Japan.<br>\r\nI could contract with the shop people to<br>\r\nbuild you a set of skis and we can shoosh<br>\r\nand plotz down the mountains there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don\u2019t know how to ski,\"<br>\r\nLisa said, smiling in disbelief.<br>\r\nMichael shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither do I. Good time to learn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa had slowly seated herself on the<br>\r\nliving room floor as he offered one travel<br>\r\nplan after another, each more outrageous<br>\r\nthan the previous one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian had slipped into and out of the room,<br>\r\nretrieving a thermos of hot water.<br>\r\nHe opened the library bar and began<br>\r\nmixing hot drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian  placed Lisa\u2019s  flower-vase and<br>\r\nMichael's smaller rocks glass on a serving tray<br>\r\nand hefted it over to where they sat.<br>\r\nHe had the feeling he\u2019d have to get used to<br>\r\nunconventional drink preparation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlice Springs, then,\"<br>\r\nMichael had said after nearly an hour.<br>\r\n\u201cMy ranch is perfect. There's a nice,<br>\r\nbig pond on the property to take cool dips in<br>\r\nduring the day. The sunsets there are spectacular.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa had smiled and nodded her assent.<br>\r\nShe had caught<br>\r\nMichael\u2019s enthusiasm and actually began to<br>\r\nfeel a sense of anticipation at their impending<br>\r\ntrip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe half-stretched herself out on the floor<br>\r\nbeside the couch, facing the fire, caressing<br>\r\nMichael\u2019s back.<br>\r\nBrian had discreetly left the room after serving<br>\r\nthem their drinks, his shadow slipping back<br>\r\nand forth from the upstairs rooms towards<br>\r\nLisa's tent-bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa had never tasted hot buttered rum before--<br>\r\nThen again she was a minor and technically<br>\r\ntherefore not allowed alcohol but given the<br>\r\nsituation, her size and all that has happened<br>\r\nBrian felt it okay.<br>\r\nPlus he had been careful to add more non<br>\r\nalcohol components including some water to<br>\r\nthe mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drinks Brian had prepared had just<br>\r\nenough bite to give the drinker a warm glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was just around a couple weeks ago\u201d<br>\r\nshe said softly, watching the embers of the<br>\r\nfire in the fireplace sputter and sparkle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael had finished his drink and leaned<br>\r\ninto her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust weeks ago I was an ordinary<br>\r\nUnpopular, plain middle schooler soon to be<br>\r\nhigh schooler with seemingly no prospects<br>\r\nfor luck in the relationship department.<br>\r\nBut now days later I'm having the most amazing<br>\r\nexperience I could imagine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael smiled but said nothing.<br>\r\nHe turned and kissed Lisa's soft, warm palm.<br>\r\nShe turned and looked down on him,<br>\r\na small smile lighting her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn such a short time I met a great guy<br>\r\nwho despite being a doting, pervert, Idiot,<br>\r\nsomehow managed be as life changing as<br>\r\nanother event in my life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had a close encounter and I-I began to<br>\r\ngrow into a giantess. It's all a little--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frightening?\" Michael  finished, looking up at<br>\r\nher  troubled expression. Lisa nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I told you before, Lisa,<br>\r\nyou're a very special person.<br>\r\nYou're a good person. Kind. Beautiful.<br>\r\nYou're a special girl whose been given a special gift.\"<br>\r\nMichael rubbed his stubble against her palm.<br>\r\nHis eyes began to twinkle and his lopsided grin<br>\r\nreturned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, they'll be making television specials<br>\r\nabout you one day. ''Lisa Porter\u2019s Amazing Adventures!'<br>\r\nSee her do amazing things!<br>\r\nWatch her eat her dinner!<br>\r\nSee her walk through her garden!<br>\r\nYou'll be famous and do shaving ads and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa had been torn between distress and<br>\r\namusement at Steve's stentorian predictions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sound like that TV announcer, Don Pardo,\"<br>\r\nshe said.<br>\r\n\u201cOr Rod Serling.<br>\r\nChrist knows he could probably write the script of<br>\r\nmy life for the last several days,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's funny, I never watched much TV<br>\r\nwhen I was growing up,\"<br>\r\nMichael  replied, chuckling.<br>\r\n\"Pop and Mom always wanted me to hit<br>\r\nthe books. Thank God for that.\"<br>\r\nHe rose from his seat and reached out his arms to<br>\r\nLisa. She obligingly lifted him up until their<br>\r\nfaces were level with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLisa I love you,\"<br>\r\nhe said softly, reaching out with one gloved<br>\r\nhand to tweak her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't care if you are never famous.<br>\r\nI don't care if you are--\"<br>\r\nhe looked her up and down--<br>\r\n\"well, however tall you are now, or grow to<br>\r\ntwice or 3x  this size.<br>\r\nI just hope that you will never leave me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis admission of his love for her melted<br>\r\nLisa's heart. Her eyes were wide and she blushed.<br>\r\nShe brought him close and kissed him.<br>\r\nHis lips tasted of rum and butter, and she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will never leave you as long as you never<br>\r\nleave me\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d rather die or deal with Canfield at her<br>\r\nangriest\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa chuckled.<br>\r\nShe cocked her head at him.<br>\r\n\"You look tired. Let's go to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay by me. I am tired, for once.<br>\r\nI hope you don\u2019t mind--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa chuckled once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll live without it for one night--but only one,\"<br>\r\nshe replied, her smile broad.<br>\r\nShe licked at him once, his stubble rasping<br>\r\nher tongue.<br>\r\nHe tried mouthing her tongue but settled<br>\r\nfor a long, passionate kiss instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But will I?\" Michael sighed as they parted.<br>\r\n\"Gotta get well fast.\"<br>\r\nLisa experienced another surprise as they had<br>\r\nprepared for bed.<br>\r\nAs he had done every morning since she arrived<br>\r\nBrian  had straightened up her tent-bedroom and<br>\r\nshower area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa appreciated the fresh sheets on her bed mat<br>\r\nand the washed neatness of her towels<br>\r\nand clothes, although the idea of Brian handling<br>\r\nher intimate things was disconcerting.<br>\r\nThis time he had added Michael's bedclothes<br>\r\nto the items neatly folded atop the blankets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael  also noticed the change in his<br>\r\narrangements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brian's the best,\" he had said, grinning as<br>\r\nLisa  carried him into her tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa put aside her memories of the day<br>\r\nin the darkness of her tent-bedroom and<br>\r\ngently stroked her lover's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael\u2019s breathing was slow and deep.<br>\r\nHe reached out in his sleep and wrapped<br>\r\nhis arms around Michael's hand, neatly<br>\r\ntrapping it to his torso.<br>\r\nLisa smiled, and gulped to try to ease the<br>\r\nlump in her throat. He was one in <br>\r\na million--no, probably one in a billion, she thought.<br>\r\nShe sighed, then paused, looking down at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer silk nightdress, which had been loosely<br>\r\ncomfortable and hung to the ground two days ago,<br>\r\nwas now form-fitting, hugging her shoulders<br>\r\nand hips, squeezing her budding breasts.<br>\r\nThey seemed to be slowing down still but<br>\r\nthere was no denying they were still developing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo think she once was nearly flat as a board<br>\r\nand even tho they seemed small to her new<br>\r\nand growing perspective they had to be<br>\r\nentering B cup territory.<br>\r\nShe just hoped they didn\u2019t get too big someday<br>\r\neither. She didn\u2019t fancy being a big titted freak<br>\r\non top of the size situation.<br>\r\nNo the lower 3 cup sizes would be good for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hem had stopped at mid-thigh when she<br>\r\nslipped it on tonight and she had to remove<br>\r\nits translucent silk front to fit her head through<br>\r\nthe neck hole. Even with every expansion panel<br>\r\nreleased her body pressed against the flexible<br>\r\nfabric at each breath almost to the point<br>\r\nof discomfort--a discomfort she had felt increase<br>\r\nover the one hour since she had slipped the<br>\r\ndress on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight would be the last night she<br>\r\nwould be able to wear the dress.<br>\r\nLisa  peered over Michael at the packing<br>\r\ncrate-turned impromptu nightstand she had<br>\r\nplaced beside her bed.<br>\r\nHer watch read ten thirty p.m.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was now exactly 26 feet tall.<br>\r\nAnd she was still growing.</span></div></div>",

I think you might want to see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to confirm her description the hiker<br>\r\ncalled Solomon produced a small<br>\r\nVHS camcorder and waved it in the air.<br>\r\nRomita noticed both hikers were very excited,<br>\r\nalmost euphoric about something.<br>\r\nWell, it beat staring at spreadsheets full of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Karen, let's see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStiller had squirreled herself behind her<br>\r\ndesk and reached out to a side table and<br>\r\nthe video tape player standing there.<br>\r\nShe thumbed the REWIND button, watched<br>\r\nthe counter for a moment, then pressed STOP,<br>\r\nthen PLAY.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monitor above the VCR flashed into life.<br>\r\nThe scenery was typical of this local area of<br>\r\nNorth Carolina--depressing pine barrens<br>\r\nrelieved by a scattering of deciduous trees<br>\r\nand shrubs.<br>\r\nThe owner of the camera was trudging up<br>\r\na mountain trail, but the picture was<br>\r\nremarkably steady.<br>\r\nElectronic motion-damping, no doubt.<br>\r\nThe picture jumped to the two men making<br>\r\nheroic poses atop a slab of rock with one<br>\r\nof the innumerable local hills in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRomita sighed--pictures of the local<br>\r\nscenery were not terribly exciting--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe picture changed again.<br>\r\nThere was a boat, some kind of party boat<br>\r\nto judge from the awning over its hull.<br>\r\nIt was on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClouds of black smoke were billowing out<br>\r\nfrom the rear of the boat and washing over<br>\r\nits passengers, who began to abandon ship.<br>\r\nThe image zoomed in for a close-up<br>\r\n(automatic focus, too, thought Romita\u2014nice)<br>\r\nand Romita could see that the passengers<br>\r\nwere small children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys got pictures of the boat fire<br>\r\non the reservoir today--\" he began.<br>\r\nBoth Stiller and the one hiker named<br>\r\nSolomon suddenly jabbed their fingers at the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There she is!\" Solomon intoned excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRomita looked on the screen.<br>\r\nA woman suddenly appeared out of the smoke,<br>\r\nswimming in the water.<br>\r\nNo, not swimming--she was too still for that.<br>\r\nShe was saying something but the sound<br>\r\nwas muddy. Then she reached out and lifted a<br>\r\nchild clear of the water--with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the--\"<br>\r\nRomita sputtered, his stomach doing flip-flops.<br>\r\nThe camera image zoomed out and in again,<br>\r\nmaking the picture jump and go out of focus<br>\r\nmomentarily, then the image shook.<br>\r\nRomita's mouth fell open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is the boat?--\" he said uncertainly.<br>\r\nHe blinked. Stiller looked at Romita's<br>\r\nexpression then reached out and stilled<br>\r\nthe image.<br>\r\nRomita looked at the still frame, then suddenly<br>\r\nstraightened and grinned tiredly at the<br>\r\noccupants of Stiller's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Karen, you know I'm not in a joking<br>\r\nmood this late at night--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Martin, this is no joke,\"<br>\r\nStiller replied, thumbing the STOP switch.<br>\r\nThe two hikers nodded their heads vigorously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No sir,\" the one called Ray said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the God's honest truth.<br>\r\nWe saw it out there today and Sol filmed it.<br>\r\nWe kept rewinding it to see if it<br>\r\nwas real ourselves--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn near wore out the camera--\"<br>\r\nSolomon interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--and we figured we had to do<br>\r\nsomething with the tape--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--I remembered Karen here worked<br>\r\nfor a cable news station--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--so we hiked back to my car and drove<br>\r\nhere right away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--even got a traffic ticket for speeding!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRomita looked from one face to another.<br>\r\nBoth men and Karen were utterly serious<br>\r\nand very excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karen, this thing looks like some<br>\r\nhome sci-fi movie,\" Romita began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so,\" Stiller replied confidently.<br>\r\nSolomon shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, this was real, totally real!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at the film carefully, Martin,\"<br>\r\nStiller said, her expression earnest,<br>\r\nher eyes sparkling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe next few pictures are even more convincing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned the film back on.<br>\r\nRomita watched for another five minutes.<br>\r\nHe stumbled over the legs of the two hikers<br>\r\nto reach the VCR's controls and stabbed the<br>\r\nREWIND button.<br>\r\nRomita watched the tape counter reverse,<br>\r\nthen stopped and played the tape again,<br>\r\nwatching the entire sequence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remembered to breathe when he felt<br>\r\nhimself going faint from a lack of air.<br>\r\nHe turned to the two hikers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karen, draw up a contract. Gents,<br>\r\nI'll give you 1,500 dollars for that tape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth hikers still appeared stunned.<br>\r\nSolomon nodded automatically.<br>\r\nRomita half-stumbled from Stiller's office<br>\r\nand jogged down the hallway to his own.<br>\r\nWhen he returned to her office, check in hand,<br>\r\nhe found that none of the occupants had<br>\r\nchanged position at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly learned Solomon's last name,<br>\r\nscribbled it out on the payee line of<br>\r\nthe check, and thrust it into the<br>\r\nhiker's flaccid hand.<br>\r\nStiller had already rewound the tape<br>\r\nand was duplicating it onto another,<br>\r\nstudio-quality one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRomita's rushed good-byes were barely civil.<br>\r\nHe legged it back into his office and snatched<br>\r\nthe rolodex from his desk,<br>\r\nthumbing feverishly through the letters.<br>\r\nHe looked at his watch: 2:22 AM<br>\r\nHis old chum who was one of the producers<br>\r\nof the First Access Today! show should just be<br>\r\nhome on the west coast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin Romita smelled a big story,<br>\r\nin more ways than one--and he was going<br>\r\nto be right there as it happened.<br>\r\nEven better still if this panned out his<br>\r\nStation could be saved.</span></div></div>",

He berated himself for<br>\r\nhis na\u00efve feeling of excitement and<br>\r\nstepped out of his car, pausing to look<br>\r\nat his watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too late to alter his studio's<br>\r\nmajor network advertisements but he<br>\r\nwas just in time to send out a new feed<br>\r\nto the syndicated and cable channels.<br>\r\nHe tried to think about all the ratings points<br>\r\n(and dollars) he was going to garner from<br>\r\nthis sixteen minute, fifty-one second piece<br>\r\nof video footage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would insert the carefully-chosen pieces<br>\r\nof the footage in tonight's ads and then<br>\r\ncall his friend Marty back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Asheville Regional Airport<br>\r\nAsheville, North Carolina<br>\r\nSunday June 13, 2010<br>\r\n845 PM<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy Porter sat in the plush chair of the<br>\r\ncommuter jet that had taken her and<br>\r\nher husband Mark from the<br>\r\nCanc\u00fan International Airport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had just landed but as she looked<br>\r\nout the small window beside her she could<br>\r\nonly see a few lights<br>\r\nnearby--and those weren't the lights of the<br>\r\nMinneapolis airport.<br>\r\nThe lighting within the cabin of the plane was<br>\r\ndim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides herself and her husband the only<br>\r\nother occupants were an efficient<br>\r\nstewardess and the immense, dark-complected<br>\r\nman who had suddenly intercepted them<br>\r\nat the airport in Mexico.<br>\r\nAs the one millionth guests of the<br>\r\nPuerto Candide Hotel, he had told them,<br>\r\nthe hotel was extending to them a terrific<br>\r\nprize to show its<br>\r\nappreciation--a refund of their round-trip air fare<br>\r\nand a free ride in the hotel's executive<br>\r\nprivate jet back to Minneapolis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man had been at the head of an<br>\r\nentourage carrying champagne, balloons,<br>\r\nfruit baskets and other items and a mariachi<br>\r\nband suddenly surrounded them and<br>\r\nstarted playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been an unusual and exciting end to<br>\r\ntheir annual summer  vacation and<br>\r\nNancy and Mark had accepted his offer.<br>\r\nThey had retrieved their luggage and piled<br>\r\naboard the neat little airplane, which then<br>\r\ntook off with almost indecent haste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Nancy felt very unsure and even a<br>\r\nlittle frightened. The flight seemed shorter<br>\r\nthan it should have been, and once they<br>\r\nhad come aboard their host's demeanor<br>\r\nhad changed completely,<br>\r\nbecoming silent and watchful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy turned to her husband, sleeping<br>\r\nin the chair next to hers.<br>\r\nThey had both fallen asleep on the plane<br>\r\nright after drinking some of the champagne<br>\r\nand she had woken first.<br>\r\nShe saw the man suddenly stand up and<br>\r\nbegin to move across the cabin towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had Asian features and looked bigger than<br>\r\nRefrigerator Perry--he seemed to fill the cabin<br>\r\nof the plane when he stood up.<br>\r\nHe stood over her and offered her his hand<br>\r\nand a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMrs. Porter, I must offer my apologies to<br>\r\nyou and your husband,\" he said.<br>\r\nMark woke as if on cue, rubbing his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am afraid I got you aboard this airplane<br>\r\nunder false pretenses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy's anxiety rocketed upward and<br>\r\nshe did not take his hand.<br>\r\nWith his shaved head, neat moustache<br>\r\nand goatee the man looked like a villain<br>\r\nout of a James Bond film.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark struggled upright in his seat and<br>\r\nlooked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, we're home? Already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not, Mr. Burke,\"<br>\r\ntheir massive host replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be precise, you are in Asheville,<br>\r\nNorth Carolina.<br>\r\nHere, allow me to give you my card.\"<br>\r\nHe thrust one great hand into his coat<br>\r\nand produced a neatly printed business card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe offered it to Nancy but she refused to<br>\r\nraise her hand.

Guess what?<br>\r\nI got to go on a ride in a helicopter<br>\r\nand a big airplane with some very nice<br>\r\npeople and I talked on a radio to Aunt Lisa and<br>\r\nwe did all kinds of great things,<br>\r\nbut Annie cried and acted like a little baby and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aunt Lisa--?<br>\r\nAre you sure you\u2019re okay?\"<br>\r\nNancy asked again.<br>\r\nHer daughter nodded enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a very pretty daughters\u201d<br>\r\na young black haired woman said,<br>\r\ncoming up to them and offering her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was very well-behaved for the entire trip<br>\r\nhere. So was her sister.

Then the middle-sized dark<br>\r\nman approached them and gestured formally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me to introduce myself,\" he said, bowing.<br>\r\n\u201cI am Brian Hadad, the domestic manager of<br>\r\nthis house.

Funny, it sounded<br>\r\nlike the sound came from some distance<br>\r\naway yet it also sounded like it was right<br>\r\non top of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark had wrestled Annie into some<br>\r\nsemblance of order and rose, turning<br>\r\non his heel.

You can't be Lisa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy's eyes opened in fear and awe<br>\r\nat the sight of the giantess who slowly<br>\r\nrose to her full height behind them.<br>\r\nThe giantess wore<br>\r\nLisa's face--it looked just a little different<br>\r\nthan she remembered, the jawline a little<br>\r\nlonger, the cheeks a little broader--yet it was<br>\r\nLisa's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the rest--the rest was an impossibility.<br>\r\nNancy felt herself going faint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo strong hands grabbed her arms,<br>\r\nkeeping her upright.<br>\r\nShe looked behind herself to see<br>\r\nMichael  holding her. He nodded slowly and<br>\r\nsmiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy turned to look for her husband and<br>\r\nfound he was being supported by Brian,<br>\r\nwho had appeared from nowhere.<br>\r\nHer daughter ran headlong to the<br>\r\ngiantess and now stood beside her<br>\r\nfoot, looking up and smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pick up, please,\" the little girl called out,<br>\r\nwaving her arms in the air.<br>\r\nLisa looked down, smiled and reached down<br>\r\nto the little girl.<br>\r\nNancy broke free of Michael\u2019s grasp and<br>\r\nstumbled around the couch, her expression<br>\r\nfrantic, but she was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge hand cupped her daughter and slowly<br>\r\nrose into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa smiled down on her niece in her hand,<br>\r\nwho giggled and jumped to her feet, fidgeting<br>\r\nto find firm footing on Lisa's palm.<br>\r\nSally popped her head up over Lisa's fingertips<br>\r\nand waved down to her mother, who had<br>\r\nrounded the couch and half-ran,<br>\r\nhalf-stumbled closer to Lisa's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Mommy,\" Sally called out.<br>\r\n\"Look, Aunt Lisa can lift me higher than<br>\r\nyou or Daddy can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa snorted softly at her niece's<br>\r\nantics and took one step closer to the couch.<br>\r\nHer sister froze and fell backwards with a<br>\r\nthump on the floor.<br>\r\nNancy's mouth opened and shut<br>\r\nspasmodically but no sounds came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa inhaled deeply to dispel the sense<br>\r\nof heaviness that weighed on her chest and<br>\r\nminced across the floor until she stood<br>\r\nbeside the couch.<br>\r\nHere she knelt, carefully balancing her<br>\r\nniece in her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowered her hand to the floor and<br>\r\nSally spilled out, laughing happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mind your mother now,\"<br>\r\nLisa  said, applying a gentle swat with<br>\r\ntwo fingers to the girl's butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Sally said, primly pulling her<br>\r\ndress into place and running around the sofa.<br>\r\nMichael had already helped Lisa's sister to her<br>\r\nfeet, a sardonic version of his lopsided<br>\r\ngrin occupying his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark had stood stock still, one arm raised<br>\r\nlike a cigar-store indian.<br>\r\nLisa noted Brian looking over each of Mark's<br>\r\nshoulders, as if he were studying the reaction.<br>\r\nLisa crossed her legs in her faux kimono,<br>\r\ncarefully pressing the cloth around her thighs<br>\r\nto preserve her modesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really should sit down,<br>\r\nNan, I think you'll be more comfortable,\"<br>\r\nLisa said, nodding towards the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sound of her nickname Nancy<br>\r\nsuddenly looked around herself as though<br>\r\nshe had just awakened from a short nap<br>\r\nand shook off Michael's assistance again.<br>\r\nSally raced over and seized one of her<br>\r\nmother\u2019s hands, tugging at her.</span></div></div>",

She suddenly seemed to<br>\r\nrecognize for the first time that the gigantic<br>\r\nteen sitting on the floor before her was her<br>\r\nsister and not some strange apparition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy reached up cautiously and touched<br>\r\nLisa's outstretched hand.<br>\r\nLisa lowered her hand, rotating it slowly<br>\r\nuntil it faced palm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, Little Casino, you are huge!\"<br>\r\nNancy said.<br>\r\n\"You've never had long nails like that before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey grew in on the first day,\"<br>\r\nLisa replied, smiling at her sister's incredulous tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did these.\" Lisa pointed with her other<br>\r\nhand at her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese have been growing in steadily ever since that<br>\r\nday but thankfully not too much\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy looked up, her eyes boggling.<br>\r\n\"God Almighty,\" she breathed.<br>\r\n\"And this--this just started a few weeks ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa sniffed again and nodded.<br>\r\n\"I'm growing at the rate of one millimeter<br>\r\nper minute--almost two and a half inches per<br>\r\nhour. Or four feet, nine-and-a-half inches per day.<br>\r\nI learned that when the government people<br>\r\ngrabbed me and took me to a laboratory in Texas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy said nothing in reply.<br>\r\nShe ran her hand over Lisa's skin and touched her fingernails. Lisa willingly turned her hand palm up for inspection.<br>\r\n\"What-what's it like, Leece?\u201d<br>\r\nNancy asked softly.<br>\r\nLisa shook her head again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't imagine it, Nan.<br>\r\nEvery minute I can feel myself getting<br>\r\nbigger and bigger.<br>\r\nThese clothes I'm wearing were custom<br>\r\nmade for me.

Every day<br>\r\neverything looks smaller because I just<br>\r\nkeep growing and growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it wasn't for Michael and the other people<br>\r\nI've met here I think I would have gone<br>\r\ncompletely crazy by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I just can't believe it's possible,\"<br>\r\nNancy said, stepping closer to Lisa's thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you call me when this happened, Sis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at first I couldn't, Nan,\"<br>\r\nLisa replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The CDC people had locked me up inside<br>\r\na laboratory. They were treating me like I<br>\r\nwas carrying a contagious disease.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CDC? Are-are you contagious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa shook her head.<br>\r\n\"Michael  has been with me since the night..\u201d<br>\r\nShe paused and blushed.<br>\r\n\u201cWe-we even did..You know.. He was my first\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLisa\u201d Nancy said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway we\u2019ve been together nearly constantly.<br>\r\nIf what was happening to me was contagious,<br>\r\nMichael  should be just as big as I am now,<br>\r\nand all the other people I've met would be<br>\r\nplaying catch-up. No, what's happening to me<br>\r\nis happening to me alone.<br>\r\nThat's the really scary part, Nan--I feel so alone, sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes?\" Nancy's eyebrows rose.<br>\r\n\u201cGod, Lisa , you must feel totally alone all the time.\"</span></div></div>",

I hadn't realized I'd forgotten to be descriptive enough for what I was looking for in this story so..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEXTRA Guidelines:<br>\r\nPlease keep the story  Preferably Gentle or Gentle and mischievous day to day life with a giantess type deal with the Giantess having either <br>\r\n<br>\r\n 1&gt; Been born that way in some mysterious way ( Disease, experiment etc. Use your imagination )<br>\r\n 2&gt; Becomes a giantess thru unusual or rarely used means ( Unique experimentation ideas, Aliens/UFO Caused it, Contracts disease alien on non alien disease, someones wish gone awry etc. again use your imagination ) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdit 12/20/15:<br>\r\nPlease Please Please people no crazy Kaiju/Monster girl or Alien Girl stuff unless the girl in question looks 90% or more human and you don't go overboard on crazy powers this isn't Girlzilla here and the focus should be on her size, looks, personality , thoughts/reactions to her size etc. the rest to me serves as a distraction and there's plenty o other stories out there for it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdit: 2/5/18 <br>\r\nI\u2019ll be adding an \u201calt stories\u201d option somewhere <br>\r\nin which size stories, movies, episodes of shows/cartoons/anime <br>\r\ncan play out slightly different or ideally have an alternative ending or keep ongoing from what happened in cannon.</td>",
