A small balcony-like rock formation jutted out to one side had a bucket full of rainwater sitting on it and a small mailbox. A pile of straw in the corner was made up like a bed. <i>Is this where he lives?

These things tell the Pelipper Mail Service that this is the mailbox of an official Adventure Team!\" He grins at you, but seeing the blank look on your face, sighs. \"Adventure Teams help citizens with requests in return for rewards. I couldn't afford an Adventure Banner before, but now I can earn some money. Although...\" His face falls. \"Adventure Teams need at least two members. I got the badges, I just need a second member.\" He looks at you with puppy dog eyes. \"Would you join my team? I haven't seen you around here before. If you join, you can live here!

We're surrounded by stone!\" Treecko just waggles a finger. \"These rocks are special. Once thrown at an enemy, they lock on to the target. They're very difficult to dodge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally,\" he holds up a seed, \"this is a Reviver Seed. They can bring back a fainted Pokemon. We were lucky last time. If a single member of an Adventure Team is knocked out in a Dungeon, the whole team is sent back to their base. So be careful. This thing is our backup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he finishes his explanations, the familiar clunk of Pelipper delivering your mail is heard from outside.

Alright, to Murky Forest!\" He marches out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" you say as you arrive, \"I can see why they call it Murky Forest.\" The woods ahead of you are shrouded in a dark mist, limiting visibility significantly.

It's an old trick someone taught me once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you stumble along blindly, encountering very few Pokemon. Finally, you get to the end of the Dungeon, a clearing in the trees where the mist lifts just a little. In center, you see five Pokemon: the children and Ledyba, along with a Cleffa and a Staryu. \"Those must be the other members of Team Star!\" Treecko shouts before running towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah, but... where is this tough enemy Ledyba said they encountered?</i> You look up. \"Treecko, stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTreecko skids to a stop just in time. In the space he would have been a moment later, a clear object smashes into the ground. You look up to see a Honchkrow descend from the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Caw!</b> You're pretty quick, to dodge my Air Slash. And you,\" he turns his attention to you, \"You're quite clever, recognizing that as a trap. And you both look to be rookies!\" He caws in laughter. \"You'll make a fine ransom. Get 'em boys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud flapping sound draws your attention to several Murkrow flying out of the trees to surround you. \"You got it, boss!\" They crow, launching several Peck attacks. You barely manage to dodge them in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fire off a few Embers to buy yourself some time. You look over to see Treecko trying to take down Honchkrow by himself! He's doing well, until he takes an Air Slash to the face, launching him across the clearing. With a type disadvantage and level difference, there's no way he survived that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you remember the Reviver Seed. If you can just get it to him, he'll be fine! Unfortunately, there are just too many Murkrow in the way. What should you do? If you don't get it to him quickly, you'll both be forced out of the Dungeon!</span></div></div>",
