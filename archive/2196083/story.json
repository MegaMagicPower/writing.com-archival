He was a 6ft adult twenty-something border collie with black and white fur with some purple blotches esp. over his left eye, wearing a light blue polo shirt and blue jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to him in the passenger seat was his littlest brother, Tyrone \u2018Roni\u2019 Collins, a black and white furred border collie with white on his forelimbs, his muzzle and chest, and the tip of his curved tail and left floppy ear, black on everything else and a bit on the pudgy side and a height of 4.5 ft, wearing a white and blue striped shirt with brown shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tail wagged in anticipation as he was getting his new costume since he outgrew his last one. They exited the car and went through the sliding doors inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA female gray wolf with lengthy white hair dressed up in a purple witch\u2019s outfit manned the register on the left side near the entrance. The walls fit the Halloween theme of blacks and oranges with wool spider webs and string lights hung around. There were creepy displays of various elaborate eerie d\u00e9cor of pumpkins, ghosts, and everything inflatable. But what was surprising how many costumes this store had, filling the shelves, pegs on the walls, racks and tables. These costumes ran the gamut from the scary and spooky to the fun and playful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyrone looked around the place in bright eyed awe. So many to choose from! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you like to get Roni?\u201d his older brother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d the pup was in deep thought on what would he like to be for Halloween.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of costume did he choose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everything was there: the large diaper, Big Baby blue shirt, the rattle and the bottle. The border collie stripped down, tossing his shirt, shorts, and socks into a heap to the side.

He brought the nipple to his muzzle and sucked, drinking some of it. He wore a shocked expression at the surprising almond vanilla taste and how it was still fresh. He continued to drink until it was all gone, letting out a burp afterward. He looked at the empty bottle and just thought he'll refill it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Yawwwn....Ooh.\" he started to get a bit sleepy and woozy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went over to the bed at sat down, letting out another long yawn.

Like his feet and legs, his arms extended into slender fashion with hands that have thin fingers with manicured claw nails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head grew to match his new body with a more feminine face as his muzzle elongated and narrowed.

Along the right wall there were a couple of urinals and toilets and four shower stalls with milky white shower curtains. Opposite wall had the three steel sinks with mirrors above them and an hand dryer at the end. It seemed like he was the only one there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe headed over to the second stall, opened the curtain and stepped inside, closing it behind him.

The sands had a sea of umbrellas with towels and blankets underneath and a volleyball court or two with five lifeguard posts evenly spaced and overlooking the entire area. Behind that were a bathroom/shower building and some food vendors and vending machines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA trio of border collie brothers settled on a spot that was in between the waters and the shoreline's edge. Cam, the eldest brother who has some blotches of purple and brown along with black and white fur, wore purple swim trunks and pitched up an umbrella. Jesse, the middle athletic teen brother with mostly white fur with spots of black on his right ear and left eye, wore white swim shorts while holding a boogie board, heading towards the water. Tyrone or Roni, the youngest slightly tubby brother who had black fur mainly but had white on his forelimbs, torso, left ear tip and tail tip, wore light blue swim trunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe border collie pup was digging in the sand with yellow shovel and red pail in hand, pretending to be a pirate searching for hidden treasure. He dug a good few feet into the hole he made until his plastic shovel struck some kind of object in the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did he find?</span></div></div>",
