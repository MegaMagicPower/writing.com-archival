The dirt path also turns into a stone bridge that crosses the river, leading into a mountain region in the distance.

Problem again would be the level lock with high level monsters along the way and might be getting way ahead by not meeting certain requirements into the next location.

At the foot of the bed was a window above a toy chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed the door behind him and tear open the packaging, laying the costume on the bed. Everything was there: the large diaper, Big Baby blue shirt, the rattle and the bottle. The border collie stripped down, tossing his shirt, shorts, and socks into a heap to the side. He slipped on the diaper and shirt and wielded the rattle and bottle. He went over to the closet and opened the door to see his reflection on the inside mirror. He giggled at the look and shook the rattle for fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked at the bottle and got curious. Was it actually milk? He shook the bottle. Well, there was only one way to find out. He brought the nipple to his muzzle and sucked, drinking some of it. He wore a shocked expression at the surprising almond vanilla taste and how it was still fresh. He continued to drink until it was all gone, letting out a burp afterward. He looked at the empty bottle and just thought he'll refill it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Yawwwn....Ooh.\" he started to get a bit sleepy and woozy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went over to the bed at sat down, letting out another long yawn.

His legs followed suit, stretching and growing into mature shapely womanly ones with thick thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pelvis region cracked as his hips began to widen and his waist thinned and trimmed down.

He moaned as two dark nipples became erect and fatter as two mounds slowly grew from A cups to EE cups in matter of seconds. Unlike the diaper, the shirt unfortunately ripped apart, spilling the big jugs. Like his feet and legs, his arms extended into slender fashion with hands that have thin fingers with manicured claw nails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head grew to match his new body with a more feminine face as his muzzle elongated and narrowed.

He plugged the drain, turned on the warm water and dump about 1/3 of the purple bottle into the tub that emitted a nice grape scent and purple bubbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the tub was full of water and suds and Roni began to submerge himself into the water at one end. He let the water soak into his fur while playing with some of the bubbles. Soon, he felt himself too relax to the point his eyelids were getting heavy, eventually he fell asleep, unaware of the changes to commence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath the water, his feet cracked and popped as they grew and stretched up a few shoe sizes yet having petite pedicured toes. His legs also lengthened giving him about a foot in height but taking a womanly shape with thick thighs as his feet almost reached the other end of the tub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pelvis cracked as his hips widened, waist thinned, and his butt gain a few pounds. His tail extended and grew, becoming a bit fluffier like a female's. He groaned as his furry sheathe receded into his body along with his dick as a pair moist lips took their place, developing a female reproductive system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis chest widened a bit as it aged but two black puffy nipples stood erect and enlarged. Roni moaned as he developed breasts that slowly went to A to FF cups. His arms elongated into a slender and feminine form and hands with long thin fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final changes reached his head as it grew and aged, morphing to fit his new body. His muzzle lengthened and narrowed for a feminine look. Raven black wavy hair grew from his scalp until it reached mid back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male pup was now a grown canine woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni stirred a bit in the tub before being fully awake. She opened her eyes and it took a moment for her to register that something was off. Was it her or did the bathroom seemed smaller than before? And why did her chest felt heavy? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down to see a massive pair of jugs blocking her view, sending her into a state of shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BOO-BOOBIES?!\" she cried out, only to realize how much her voice changed to a slightly low yet higher pitched tone. She then reached down to her crotch to find something missing. \"IT'S GONE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly stood up to find herself wobbling and imbalanced due to her new height a couple inches below six feet and new weight on her chest. She leaned against the wall to steady herself. Then she stepped out of the tub and grabbed the towel to dry off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe caught her reflection in the mirror and froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is... that me?\" she said as she touched her face. She was almost as tall as her older brother Cam and probably in her early to mid 20s. She let her hands outlined and traced every curve of her new body, shuddering a bit at how sensitive it is esp. when she squeezed her tits and fingered her new pussy. Were females always this sensitive? Before going too far, she left the bathroom and back into the main room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Behind that were a bathroom/shower building and some food vendors and vending machines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA trio of border collie brothers settled on a spot that was in between the waters and the shoreline's edge. Cam, the eldest brother who has some blotches of purple and brown along with black and white fur, wore purple swim trunks and pitched up an umbrella. Jesse, the middle athletic teen brother with mostly white fur with spots of black on his right ear and left eye, wore white swim shorts while holding a boogie board, heading towards the water. Tyrone or Roni, the youngest slightly tubby brother who had black fur mainly but had white on his forelimbs, torso, left ear tip and tail tip, wore light blue swim trunks and had a yellow inner tube around his waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni was about to follow Jesse into the water before the older brother stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa there squirt. You better take a shower first and wash up. Don't want to get your fur too tangled with salt water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...do I have to?\" Roni pouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis oldest brother gave him a stern look that caused a floppy ear and tail to twitch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh alright...\" he said begrudgingly as he took off the inner tube and began to trek towards the restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went inside male restroom and was greeted with brown sandy tiles, white painted walls, and low hanging ceiling lights. Along the right wall there were a couple of urinals and toilets and four shower stalls with milky white shower curtains. Opposite wall had the three steel sinks with mirrors above them and an hand dryer at the end. It seemed like he was the only one there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe headed over to the second stall, opened the curtain and stepped inside, closing it behind him.

He wore a button down red Hawaiian shirt with yellow palm tree print and jean shorts.

In the back were the youngest, Tyrone with white furred limbs and underbelly and ear and tail tip and black everywhere else, he was playing a handheld game device. He wore a green tee and brown shorts. The final passenger was a dalmatian pup name Dustin similar in age to Roni with white fur and black spots and a tuft of spiky white hair on his head. He wore a plain white tee with blue shorts and was playing a similar handheld game as well. He's Roni's school and neighborhood friend whose parents actually let him go on the trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the minivan was approaching two desert mountains that the road was running through. But upon closer look it seemed to be blocked with a lot of construction vehicles in the way. Looks like they have to take the long route around to Cam's dismay as the GPS rerouted. He had to turn left onto a dirt road, which was a bit bumpy despite being smoothed out. But once they were going wide around, the engine light on the dashboard came on with a ding sound. Cam uttered a curse underneath his breath as he had the mini in the shop before the trip with no problems. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong, Cam?\" Roni said as he heard the ding sound with a hint of concern, looking up from his game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.

There were two rows of old wooden buildings that stretched nearly a few miles with a large gap that served as a road to pass on through. Despite how rickety they look they seemed well preserved with only much of the paint being chipped and faded away. Signs were posted on buildings to tell what they were such as the saloon, sheriff's office, general store and so on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the car stopped, Cam stepped out after popping the hood of the car up as smoke and steam seeped out. He had to step back when opening the hood fully as more steam and smoke blast out. He fanned some of it away and looked into the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Cam?\" asked Jesse, looking out the passenger window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like something overheated. Gonna have to call AAA to get a tow truck and probably going to be awhile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni and Dustin looked at the ghost town with awe, like they were on a movie set for a western film.

Just don't go too far and be careful.
