The sands had a sea of umbrellas with towels and blankets underneath and a volleyball court or two with five lifeguard posts evenly spaced and overlooking the entire area.  Behind that were a bathroom/shower building and some food vendors and vending machines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA trio of border collie brothers settled on a spot that was in between the waters and the shoreline's edge. Cam, the eldest brother who has some blotches of purple and brown along with black and white fur, wore purple swim trunks and pitched up an umbrella. Jesse, the middle athletic teen brother with mostly white fur with spots of black on his right ear and left eye, wore white swim shorts while holding a boogie board, heading towards the water. Tyrone or Roni, the youngest slightly tubby brother who had black fur mainly but had white on his forelimbs, torso, left ear tip and tail tip, wore light blue swim trunks and had a yellow inner tube around his waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni was about to follow Jesse into the water before the older brother stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa there squirt. You better take a shower first and wash up. Don't want to get your fur too tangled with salt water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...do I have to?\" Roni pouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis oldest brother gave him a stern look that caused a floppy ear and tail to twitch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh alright...\" he said begrudgingly as he took off the inner tube and began to trek towards the restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went inside male restroom and was greeted with brown sandy tiles, white painted walls, and low hanging ceiling lights. Along the right wall there were a couple of urinals and toilets and four shower stalls with milky white shower curtains. Opposite wall had the three steel sinks with mirrors above them and an hand dryer at the end. It seemed like he was the only one there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe headed over to the second stall, opened the curtain and stepped inside, closing it behind him. However, he noticed that something unusual was in the stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did he find?</span></div></div>",
