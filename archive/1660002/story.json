I've known you and your siblings for so long it's almost as if you were my own children.\" Alex's mother, Elizabeth, said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where should we put everything, mom?\" Alex asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karen and Stephanie can take the guest room upstairs. Ashley can share Kate's room, and Matt can stay in the downstairs guest room,\" she explained to everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Karen said as she and Alex walked upstairs to the guest room, followed shortly thereafter by Stephanie, as her and her other siblings deposited their stuff in the specified rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after that, Alex and Karen decided to go sit outside. The two sat on the back porch and just talked for a while. Then, something caught Karen's attention. She pointed up to the sky at a light that seems to be getting bigger. As they stared at it, they realize that it's getting bigger because its getting closer. As it's about to crash, the two get up to find cover, but it proves unnecessary as when it comes to the ground, rather than crashing, it just stops on the ground without impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" Alex asked as the two stared at what looked like a large glowing sphere bigger than either of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" Karen said as she got up and walked towards it, and Alex followed. When she got near, there was a brief flash, and there was a small metallic ball on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously, Alex bent down to touch it. After nothing happens, the two decided to bring the thing inside and examine it. Alex picked it up and brought it into the living room, and set it on the coffee table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think it is? Some weird alien device?\" Alex asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Maybe?\" Karen said. She then reached over and touched it. Suddenly, the ball glows a bit, and a light shines out of it and went over Alex and Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-SCANNING SUBJECTS-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Alex said as they heard a mechanical voice say that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-SCANNING COMPLETE-<br>\r\n-SUBJECTS REGISTERED-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Karen said this time, and then there was a flash of light before they blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho are you?</span></div></div>",

The first is that you are no longer in the living room with Karen, and are now in your room in your bed. The second thing you notice is that it is no longer night, and is now morning. The next thing you realize is that while you had been fully clothed before blacking out, you are now dressed as you normally would be when going to bed wearing a white t-shirt and your boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then notice a metal ring around your wrist. Its mostly plain, and has a single button on it. \"What is this thing?\" you ask out loud. As you look at it, you wonder how it could have gotten on you. It seemed to fit tightly around wrist, and when you tried to take it off, it wouldn't budge. Not making any progress with removing it, you decide the only thing to do is press the button. As soon as you do this, a holographic image appears in front of you. Its sudden appearance cause you to jump back in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-GREETINGS REGISTERED USER ALEX WILLIAMS.

He was at the stage of his life where there was no reason to wait so long for him to be married.  It had been a year, maybe they are right.  \"OK,\" he finally said somewhat exasperated.  \"If Roger doesn't propose by New Years which is only three months away, then I'll start seeing other people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is all we are saying, you don't have to dump Roger, just start seeing other people and see how you feel then,\" Anne said speaking for all the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's next?</span></div></div>",

So you went to Mrs. Jenkins house, she has a two year old that you have been babysitting.  You thought it would be easier to babysit if he grew out of a few things, like diaper changes.   Petey was only two years old and potty training wasn't going to be for well over a year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou used your PAID on Mrs. Jenkins and made Petey your son so you could take him where you want without a problem.  Then you brought him over to Mike's house.  Mike answered the door and then you zapped him with your PAID.  You next zapped little Petey and you could see both individual's stats on the holographic screen.

You loved Petey, he was a sweetie and you didn't want to hurt him at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe easiest thing you selected was potty training.  This was a no brainer.  It wouldn't hurt Petey to be out of diapers so early and this was perfect for Mike.  The next thing you selected was bottle feeding.  Petey needed a bottle at least twice a day, it'd be best if he ate more solid foods, plus it'd be hilarious if Mike had to have a bottle.  Mike would probably have to make his own bottle too. (as well as change his diapers.)  Next, you give Mike Petey's thumb sucking habit and a lack of shame at doing it.   You laugh to yourself at the thought of Mike sucking his thumb in class as if it's perfectly ordinary.  You didn't want to give Mike Petey's need for a pacifier.  You liked being able to give Petey is paci to quiet him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmmm, is there anything else you can swap between Petey and Mike?  No this is enough.  You select Apply Changes and time resumes.  Mike immediately puts his thumb in his mouth.  Then he takes it out again to ask, \"What do you want?\"  Nothing you said as you turn to leave.  Still holding Petey, you can tell he isn't wearing a diaper anymore.  You return Petey to his mother and change their relationship back too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do next?</span></div></div>",

He thought himself too muscular and his skin too rough so he swapped both things with a dancer in his class, Kimberly which smoothed out his skin and left him very toned in a feminine way.

You use the device again on your mom, and time stops and the hologrphic display is brought up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren notices time has apparently stopped and she can't move. \"What are you doing?\" she asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't feel like going to school today, so I'm gonna make my mom go to school for me.\" you explain to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I'm gonna go to school and test out mine around there. I'll see you later after school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down the information about yourself, and find \"High School Student\" on this list and select it then \"Apply Changes\". As soon as you touch the option, time resumes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karen, I almost forgot. We have that test today, so can I borrow your notes to study? I can't find mine.\" Your mother turns around and asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" your mother says as she walks off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it worked. I remember you lost your notes the other day.\" Karen points out before she heads back into the room to get ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then decide to head off to take a shower. Once done you dry yourself off and wrap a towel around you, not noticing you wrapped it to also cover your chest as well like a woman would do. When you exit the bathroom, you notice your mom downstairs dressed in your former clothes, wearing a pair of jeans and one of your shirts. You notice that the clothes have adjusted to fit her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then hear a knock on the door, and see you friend Greg. \"Hello Mrs. Williams. Are you and Karen ready to go yet?\" Greg asks, not finding anything strange about a 40 year old women going to high school school with teenagers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm ready greg.\" she says as she picks up your backpack. Karen and Greg head out the door, and your mother calls out to you. \"I'm leaving now, Alex. Make sure your sister and Amanda and Matt make it to school.\" she says before walking out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look out the window and watch Karen, your mother, and Greg head over to the bus stop. Suddenly, you realize that you needed to get ready for work! You think about how stupid you were for procrastinating. You head back into your room and to quickly get dressed. You look through your drawers and pull out one of the bras that used to be your mothers and now belonged to you. It was now adjusted to fit you despite having no breasts. At first you wonder why you would need to wear one of these, but brush off the thought as you just feel that you have to wear one. You then pull out a pair of panties and slip into those as well. You then get dressed in the clothes your mother would normally wear to work. You then put on a pair of heels, then head into the bathroom with a few make-up supplies to apply it to yourself. As you walk, you have no problem with the heels, and walk as if you've always worn them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you go about getting dressed, you don't realize that \"your\" job you have to get ready for is your mother's. When you switched with her to make her go to school for you, you also made so that you now had her job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at yourself in the mirror, and think you look good. You know that these clothes are supposed to be your mother's, but at the same time, you wearing them seems more natural than your mother wearing them to you. You walk downstairs and see your mothers friend and your co-worker Linda pull into the driveway. \"Kate! Amanda! Matt! Its time to go!\" you call out to them. You grab what is now your purse, and follow them to the car and get into the passenger seat. \"Hello, Mrs. Smith.\" you greet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex, I tell you all the time that you can call me Linda. We do work together, so even if I'm your mother's friend, that doesn't mean we can't be on friendly terms either.\" she says. She drives over and drops your sister and the others off at their elementary school before the two of you head to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what is your job now?</span></div></div>",

You picked the social standing option and pressed apply changes and then like that time resumed, you noticed some things as time resumed, in the cubicle you shared with Karen there was a play pen now and the nameplate on your desk had changed from 'Alex' to 'Wendy'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Natalie walked over to your cubicle and saw you sitting in what was now Wendy's seat \"excuse me Alex could you please move out of Wendy's seat so she can get back to work?\" she asked while pointing towards the pen, you obliged and moved to the pen which you could easily step over and then sit down in. As Natalie turned away Wendy made a babble sound to which Natalie replied \"i know you don't want to work but you are responsible for Alex's kid's and you need to earn them a living!\" before returning to her office. Karen looked over at you sitting in a play pen made for babies and whispered \"what did you swap?\" to which you whispered back \"social positions\" Karen thought for a moment \"well unless you're going to swap back anytime soon you should probably give Wendy the ability to you know actually do her new Job?\" to which you asked \"why?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"because she now has your mum's job and is responsible for her income and if she loses it by not doing anything then you're mums out of a job\" Karen explained, Alex thought about it she was right he didn't know the full extents of the swap yet so if he wasn't going to swap back immediately then it's probably a good idea to put up some precautionary measures.</span></div></div>",

Looking at the laptop on your desk you pulled up the details of the trip the original Claire had just been organizing a trip with the owner of the company, Nathaniel E. Whitmore III, with whom she was apparently having an affair. It was a very odd sensation, but although you could remember who you were originally, you could also remember this new life as Claire. When you\u2019d traded lives with your mom the sensation hadn\u2019t been as strong since you already knew a lot about her, but this was all new. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire had always been drawn to powerful men and it didn\u2019t get much more powerful than a multi-billionaire like Whitmore. She already had him wrapped around her finger, just a bit more time and she would be the next Mrs. Whitmore. The current Mrs. Whitmore was a complication, but Claire wasn\u2019t too worried about it. She had planted the idea of the trip so well that Whitmore thought he had come up with the whole thing all on his own, that was how perfectly devious Claire was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou absentmindedly ran a perfectly manicured finger over your lip as you tried to make sense of these new memories. Looking down you reveled in the expensive outfit you were wearing; your heels alone were $2,500; they had been a gift from Whitmore. What wasn\u2019t as impressive was you body. You still very much looked like your original self and that wasn\u2019t going to get you very far. It was then that you \u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You pause on one the bags, thinking about the brand new lingerie that lies within, and you feel your penis stiffen slightly in your silk panties as you imagine all the things Karen will do to you that evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking your way up the path, you open the front door and suddenly find yourself face to face with your father and mother kissing in hallway.  You have to fight to keep the surprise off your face as you take in their outfits.  Your dad was wearing a white halter top that sat just below his belly button, with a pair of blue denim shorts and some white strappy sandals; you recognised it as an outfit that Karen often wore.  Everything seemed to fit him, despite Steven\u2019s much larger proportions.  A hand bag was slung over one shoulder and you could clearly see the traces of some light makeup, with his ears holding a couple of small silver studs and hoops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mum on the other hand was wearing a pair of dark baggy jeans with a black t-shirt sporting the Black Sabbath logo, the sort of thing you normally wore\u2026or used to wear, at least.  Now that you were an executive, designer heels and dresses were far more your speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hi Mrs Williams!\u201d your dad greeted you, giving you a smile and blushing slightly as he moved away from Liz.  \u201cI\u2019m feeling much better than this morning, so I was about to walk Matt round his friend\u2019s house; they have an arranged play date for the evening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed a somewhat bored looking Matt sat at the bottom of the stairs, his face in his hands.  You had to hide a smirk as you realised that Steve and Liz may have been making out for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously Karen had already swapped with both Linda and your dad you reasoned, meaning that he now believed himself to be your girlfriend.  <i>Actually my son\u2019s girlfriend</i> you think, memories of Liz nervously breaking the news that they were dating flashing through your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course Steven, that\u2019s very nice of you.  In fact,\u201d you respond happily, putting your shopping down and reaching into your handbag to retrieve your purse \u201cwhy don\u2019t you two go out and see a movie or something once you\u2019ve dropped him off?

This is a lot of money.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d you say with a laugh as you bend down to pick up your shopping again, \u201cMy job pays more than enough that I can afford it.  Just enjoy yourselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I\u2019ll drive us and we can drop off Matt on the way to the mall then\u201d Liz states, grabbing a pair of keys off the side table and going over to slip on some shoes.

Karen\u2019s wearing a pair of smart trousers and a shirt with the top button undone, looking every bit like she\u2019s just got in from work.  Despite the masculine clothes, they\u2019ve clearly been reshaped to fit her new body with the shirt conforming nicely to shape of her bulging breasts and thin waist.  She has a huge smile on her face, and you both stare at each other for a few seconds, grinning stupidly, before she leans in to give you a long, lingering kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s excited\u201d she whispers against your lips, and you realise your penis is standing fully erect, forming a tent in your skirt and digging into Karen\u2019s belly.

What should we do about the rest of the kids?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Zack and Stephanie are both out doing\u2026something.  With friends I guess?\u201d Karen shrugged.  \u201cThat only leaves Kate and Amanda; they\u2019re playing in Kate\u2019s room right now.  I suppose we could see if Linda is willing to look after them for the evening, or we can try and ask the Bakers next door instead?  I\u2019m sure the kids would leap at the opportunity to see their friend Christy.

I was thinking the three of us could go out clubbing tonight to get her mind on something else, what do you think?\u201d That was Julie\u2019s solution for everything, to go party and you had memories of some wild night together with your friends.

Looking down you found yourself wearing a figure-hugging black dress that came down to a few inches above your knees. It was cinched at the waist, highlighting your newly-acquired figure. Dark tresses of hair flowed over your shoulders, bouncing in unison to every movement of your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you did that,\u201d hissed Karen, barely above a whisper.

You turned back and winked at Karen, who just rolled her eyes at you again. You took mincing steps towards the bathroom, your arms helped to balance you while your hand hung limply and femininely with each step. Your hips gyrated from side to side and it was obvious by your outthrust bust and booty that you wanted others to notice you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noted the side glances and the open stares from your coworkers as you made your way to the bathroom. It was thrilling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the bathroom you took the time to take a good look at your new body. It was no mystery why Angie had been the office slut.

Your hips and rear topped a pair of long, smooth legs, propped on stiletto-heeled, black pumps. Your nails were long and carefully manicured, they likely made you useless for traditional office work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could explore any further one of your new coworkers walked into the bathroom and you decided you could explore further later on.

You turned around and pulled the bottom of your dress up.  This wasn't as easy as you thought it should be since the dress was so tight, especially at the hem.  It took a littl effort to get your dress past your thighs and your wide hips and butt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon you you were able to, you sat on the toilet and peed.

Karen complained that she wanted to hang out with you, not go to work, but you told her it might be fun to go to work with your PAIDs to test them out. She grudgingly agreed before she dropped you off at the plastic surgeon\u2019s office where your mom, and now you, worked. She headed off to a marketing firm not too far away from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou unconsciously readjusted your outfit, smoothing out your office skirt and made sure you looked presentable like your mother did every day before walking into the office. She was a receptionist at a renowned plastic surgery clinic in the city. You were the first in the office, so you went about turning on everything and getting the office ready for the day. After everything was arranged you sat at your desk near the entrance and looked through the day\u2019s appointments. It all came to you as though you\u2019d done it a thousand time before. You knew the passwords for your computer and where to access patient files, it was surreal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short while later the owner and chief surgeon of the clinic came in. \u201cGood morning, Doctor Henson!\u201d you greeted him in a cheerful tone. \u201cGood morning to you  too, Mrs. Williams,\u201d he replied. You had to admit Dr. Henson was quite handsome. He could have easily been on one of the soap operas your mother loved to watch. The thought of finding another man attractive stuck you as odd, but you didn\u2019t give it much attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know,  Mrs. Williams, you should really let me do some work on you. Having a display of my talents greet our patients when they walk in would do wonders for the business.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed at that, unsure of what to respond. Dr. Henson went to his office and patients and personnel came in soon after him. The comment echoed in your mind as you saw different patients walk in. They were all at different stages, some were looking for a simple consult on things they wanted to change, others had already gone through surgery and were just coming in for follow-up visits. A few were repeat patients who\u2019d gone under the knife many times before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was close to noon and you decided to \u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe \u2026 maybe being his \u2013  what had he called it?  - his display wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea. There were several of the doctor\u2019s repeat patients waiting to see the doctor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was Allison Clark, she was in her early 50s and was constantly visiting the good doctor to stave off the signs of aging. She had a small, upturned nose thanks to the doctor\u2019s ministrations and a placid face thanks to a series of Botox treatments. At her request, the doctor had given her plump, luscious lips that invited all sorts of lascivious thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy Bouchard was in her late 30s and had spent a small fortune on Dr. Henson\u2019s services.  She had large, impressive breasts that hung low on her chest after gravity had done it\u2019s job for a few years. You knew from her appointment record that she was looking to lift her chest a bit and to get a butt lift as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAva Lynn was in her early 20s and though she was one of the doctor\u2019s most recent clients, she was one of his most prodigious transformations. Her dream was to be a reality TV star and had spent a good portion of her daddy\u2019s fortune to transform her body. She had huge breasts, with that bolted on look that made men go wild. Her arse was large enough to put most celebrities to shame.

Pausing your decision making for a moment you stopped to think about what you should wear today you had your sisters clothes so you should probably dress like her, You started by putting on some white panties and then found a nice grey long-sleeve T-shirt and then put on an a denim overall dress with pockets on top of it. Once dressed you put on some white socks and her pink sneakers and to top it off added a hairband despite not needing it, then you were ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou checked your schoolbag which had been replaced with Kate's pink one that had a butterfly on the front pocket, it had all of her books and the work they were doing was simple addition and subtraction which was extremely simple to you. You picked up the bag and left it at the door then made your way to the kitchen table for breakfast where a bowl of fruit loops had been left for you like it normally was for Kate however now Kate was eating the toast you'd normally have. Your sister had dressed in a T-shirt and Cargo shorts which wasn't uncommon for you in warmer months, once breakfast was finished your mum lead you to the car where you saw Kate and Karen boarding the bus to high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile being driven to school you resumed your planning, you were going to make Kate seem like the smartest kid in school while you were there. Once dropped off your mum gave you a hug and you got to work, in class you were getting everything right and it was pretty amazing how easy second grade was and everyone was giving you praise, it felt good. You had aced a math and English test for Kate and you felt proud of yourself but you were getting quite bored, quite fast the question was how would you remedy this?, lunch was soon you could have some fun making chaos there, you could do something to the teacher maybe become the teacher for a while or make a student the teacher, there was one other option that seemed more risky, you could swap your intelligence or something else to make school a little more challenging for yourself however that would be counterproductive for your initial goal but still entertaining.</span></div></div>",

If you do well there, then you can go onto middle school.  Ms. Johanssen was smiling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't want to be promoted.  That would defeat the point of this whole thing.  You were happy with Kate's life and wanted to keep it.  Besides what would Kate do when you swapped back.  She wouldn't be able to handle the promotion.  You had to stop this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou used the PAID to swapped the bodies of Ms. Johanssen and Mr. Catello.  You used the option that allowed the swapped people to be aware of the change.  Mr. Catello even though he was still wearing his business suit and jacket, now had the petite five foot two inch body of your 24 year old teacher.  The first indication that something was wrong was when Mr. Catello saw his own body sitting next to him wearing Ms. Johanssen's blouse and skirt.  Ms. Johanssen looked pretty silly with Mr. Catello's body in her apparel and makeup.  She was now five foot eleven and 220 pounds.  Their clothes had resized themselves to fit their new bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swapped your bodies,\" Alex told them.  \"If you want to return to your former bodies, I suggest you return me back to my former class.  Because until I'm back in the second grade, with all my friends, you will stay in each other's bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you are back.  I'm ripping up the transfer papers right now.\"  Mr. Catello found the papers and ripped them up with his new delicate hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.  Now I don't want to hear any word that I can't stay with my class for as long as I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure, right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex swapped back the bodies of his teacher and counselor.  But he also made a change that neither was aware of.  After school, Ms. Johanssen would return to her new home that which she shared with Mr. Catello's wife of 35 years,.  Because as far as the 24 year old teacher and the world knew she was the one who had been married to Mrs. Catello for 35 years.   Mr. Catello was living his his 26 year old boyfriend (formerly Ms. Johanssen boyfriend).  They had been living together for seven months now.  Mr. Catello hoped that his boyfriend would propose soon.  He wanted to start a family, he wasn't getting any younger, he would be 58 on his next birthday..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex returned to the cafeteria to finish up recess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did what I think happen, really happen?\" Ms. Johanssen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suggest you do anything that Alex wants.\"</span></div></div>",

You then put on a pair of lacy white socks and some pink and white velcro shoes, since Kate didn't know how to tie her shoes yet. You grabbed Kate's backpack and ran out of the room and down the stairs to see that Karen was standing there in Amanda's favorite dress, similar to the one that you were wearing, but it was blue with Bubbles on it instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look nice! How's it feel?\" Karen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little weird, but strangely nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll get used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, your mom opens the door. \"C'mon, girls. Time to get you to school. Matt, hurry up or you'll be late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you, Matt, and Karen are in the car, your mom takes you to school where you and Karen head to your sisters' first grade class room. You were as tall as the teacher, but no one seemed to notice. You and Karen went to your seats, which were right next to each. It was then that your friend, Christy, came over to talk to you. She was wearing the same outfit as you and Karen were, but it was green with Buttercup on it. The three of you talked about the Power-puff Girls for a while, you knowing a ton about it since you had to share the tv with Kate. When the bell rang, everyone took their seats and the teacher started talking about how to tell time. You still remembered a lot from high school, but for some reason you couldn't remember how to tell time or do math past a first grade level. You shrugged this off, however, and continued to listen to the lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter awhile, it was time for gym class, where the boys were playing against the girls in dodgeball. You started to head towards the boys side until Karen reminded you that you were considered a girl by everyone. When the game started, you were hit by at least five balls at the same time and huffed over to the sidelines to wait for the next round. Karen quickly followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This stinks. We're the first ones out and the game only just started.\" Karen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I guess we'll just sit by and watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the game went the same way. After gym was over, everyone was taken to the cafeteria. You and Karen each had a peanut-butter and jelly sandwich and some chocolate milk. After finishing, you and Karen started to talk about the PAID.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I wonder what these things could really do.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why don't we find out? There are plenty of people in the cafeteria to switch with.\" You looked around and spotted a kindergarten boy and a kindergarten girl talking to each other. The little girl had blonde hair in pigtails and was wearing a short yellow sun dress and white tights.

But almost as quickly as it started up, it quickly selects an option, an initiates the swap between you and Kate, and time resumes. You look around in confusion, wondering what had happened. It happened so quickly, you are almost not sure that anything happened at all. Looking down at yourself, you were still standing where you were, you see that you still wore Kate's cute nightie, and you saw Kate go into your old room. \"I guess nothing happened.\" you say to yourself. And with that you head into Kate's old room, not paying much attention as you practically skip in there. You don't realize it, but the PAID had indeed swapped something between you and yor sister, and you now had the personality to match your current life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, you look around at what is now your room. It was a pretty girly room, almost stereotypically so. The walls were pink, the floor was littered with various dolls and stuffed animals, and other such things one would expect to find in a little girl's room. And you couldn't help but love it. \"Kate's room is way better than my old room.\" you think to yourself. You wanted to play with some of her toys, but knew yo had to get ready for school and your mom would be mad if you were late for school. Looking into your sister's closet, you see that all of her old clothes have now been resized to fit your much bigger body. Looking for something to wear, a frilly pink dress catches your eye. It was one of Kate's favorites, and you could understand why right now. \"This is really cute!\" you say to yourself as you take it out. Taking off your nightie, you take a pair of your sister and put them on before putting on the dress. After that, you put on some socks and a pair of mary janes, and looked at yourself in your sister's full length mirror. With a giggle, you think about how cute you look, and then go downstairs to meet with Karen before your mother takes you both to school with Matt.</span></div></div>",

Then Tommy's mom says, \"Ahhh there's my boy.\"  This snaps you out of it.  It was just an hallucination, you see Matt carrying Stephanie who is clutched in his arms like an infant.  Matt had heard Tommy's mother arrive and was bringing her baby to her.  But it wasn't her baby it was Stephanie who was acting like a baby or had switched lives with the baby.  It didn't matter what happened, you couldn't let the woman leave with Stephanie...at least not with Stephanie's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly bound upstairs towards Karen's mother's room and see the apparent baby still sitting in the middle of the king sized bed and reading a magazine.

She started screaming, \"What are you doing?\"  But you are ignoring her, there isn't much time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get down stairs and put her on the floor.  You them point the PAID at her, time stands still and all of the stats appear.  Next you turn around and see Matt handing Stephanie to Tommy's mother.  You point the PAID at Stephanie who was about to be put in Tommy's mother's arms and select her on the PAID.  Now both the baby and Stephanie's stats were on the PAID holographic screen.  You select switch bodies and activate the PAID.  Within an instant, time resumes and the baby is being passed from Matt to Tommy's mom.  You didn't notice that the baby was wearing Karen's mom's clothing except it was resized for his little body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy's mom left with her baby and you thought that a catastrophe was averted and then you heard from behind you.  \"Alex what do you think you are doing?\"  You turn around and see Stephanie's body still clad in just a diaper.  If you could look into Karen's mother's drawers and closets you would find that it contained only clothes styled for an infant in a size that would fit Stephanie's body and diapers or in a similar size.  You were in a hurry when you made the switch but you didn't have to be.  Once selected time stops and you can have seen what damage had really been done and fixed it.  But now not only did Karen's mom have Stephanie's teenaged body, she also had Tommy's one year old penis in her diaper (which was a good thing since she also had Tommy's potty training) she even had Tommy's name, not that you would notice since you always called her Mrs. Jones anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing your mistake you head towards the door, but by the time you had gotten there, Tommy's mom  had driven off with her son (whose name was now Stephanie and had Stephanie's vagina and her bathroom abilities along with all of the apparel of Mrs. Jones..)  It was too late, you didn't know what to do.  You turn around to face Mrs. Tommy Jones  in all her nineteen year old glory, who was naked except for a soon to be flooded diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The baby wasn't as she had left him (or her, the baby did have the name and genitals of a nineteen-old woman.)  She came up with a plan immediately.  She then pointed the PAID at Kate and swapped her intelligence with the baby.  The baby now had the intelligence of a seven-year-old.  Tommy's mom then put her baby into a car seat and drove away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda took Kate's hand and led the girl who had the intelligence of an infant towards her house.

You had seen everything in the room before, but you didn't know what they did or what they were called.  This realization started to frighten you as you realized your mom wasn't around.  To calm yourself you stuck your thumb into your mouth.

The PAID made the previous events hazy in \"Tommy's\" mind.  \"You are right, I\"m sorry Alex.\"  She then turned around to head to her room and return to reading her magazine.  But before she left Amanda on a whim pointed the PAID at her and you.  When time resumed you had the breasts of a nine-teen-year old woman.  Karen's mom now had the chest of a teenaged boy to go along with the penis and fashion sense of an infant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren then took you by the hand and removed your PAID.

When I got the PAID and found out what it could do I phoned three house cleaning services and told them I was looking for some full time help.  They each sent someone over.  I used the PAID on each of them and my dad.  I first checked out what the maids could do and I swapped those abilities with some of my dad's enjoyments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate: \"Enjoyments?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda: \"Yes things like sports, watching TV, talking politics, you know the things he likes to do.  Anyway, for example, this one woman was an expert cook.  She had worked as the live in cook and maid for a family for many years. so I substituted all of dad's knowledge and like of sports with the woman's knowledge of cooking and as you see he not only knows how to cook he loves it.  But sports he now really doesn't know a thing about it and even if he did he couldn't want to be involved in sports anyway.  I did that type of thing for every one of what dad liked to do, now he would prefer to scrub the bathroom until it shines than watch TV or separate the colors and the whites before doing laundry than read the paper.  When he gets home from work, he wants nothing more than to clean the house from top to bottom.  He doesn't even have an interest in sex anymore.  Which is a good thing, I never liked the thought of mom and dad...well you know in the bedroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate had thought that using the PAID was just a joke and that eventually everyone would be returned to normal.  Now she wasn't so sure.  She could see that Amanda was totally serious and that she didn't want to turn anyone back to normal.  Kate started worrying about what would become of herself.  She didn't mind having Alex's intelligence, but what would Amanda do to her in the end.  Amanda hadn't asked her if she wanted Alex's intelligence.

The world grew still as it gave a faint blue light, and even the tiny particles of dust were suspended in mid-air. All of the air currents stopped and it was as if time itself had completely halted. With one exception. <i>I love this time stop effect, it makes me feel really powerful.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks down and finds that he\u2019s back in his original body, however a terribly unsettling feeling goes through him. As if there\u2019s something completely wrong with his body. <i>Did the device screw up the switch?</i> He checked his body, but he found that it was exactly as it was before he became a girl, and yet it felt completely wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes passed, and you realised exactly what was wrong with this body. <i>It\u2019s male and I\u2019m a girl.</i> What happened unbeknownst to him until now is that the device switched his gender identity with Kate, so he\u2019s begun thinking of himself as a girl now. <i>This body\u2019s no good at all, should I swap back? No, I have a better idea.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he\u2019s aware that he was changed, there\u2019s little that he could do as it\u2019s completely natural now, with his old self being completely alien to him. He couldn\u2019t even begin to comprehend how he could have thought differently before. He walked into the hall, thinking about his plan when he saw Amy back in her original body walking out of the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat tea party was surprisingly fun, we should do it again sometime,\u201d said Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we should meet here more often,\u201d he responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey met in a dining room for breakfast, where they confirmed that Alex\u2019s parents didn\u2019t have any of the devices, and gave a sigh of relief as they won\u2019t be interfering with their plans, especially Alex\u2019s. Kate looked extremely uncomfortable as she ate her food, almost as if something was really bugging her, this didn\u2019t escape Alex\u2019s eye and he put together a little plan to solve her problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suppressed his surging desire to talk about dolls with Amy as he didn\u2019t want Karen to catch sight of anything unusual, at-least not yet. His parents found a little strange that he wasn\u2019t excitedly talking about dolls like he usually does, but they didn\u2019t look into it further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone finished up their food, just in time for the school bus to arrive outside the house. The group quickly went on-board and it sped off towards the school. He glanced over the girls in the bus and an idea hatched in his head. <i>Unfortunately, these fellows are here, I\u2019ll have to get away from them at some point.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus arrived at the school and he dove into the crowd as if he was enthusiastic about the lessons to separate from the group which might create problems with him, if he was to swap with someone. They simply shrugged and assumed that was an effect of the device on his personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ran through the crowds, he glanced over the girls in the crowd and started forming a mental shortlist. Once he found one which he was satisfied with, he activated the device. As always, all motion in the school halted, and it was as if he was alone in a sea of frozen statues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t dawdle though, as he figured that people with the devices wouldn\u2019t be impeded by something like this. <i>Perhaps, they can. Or perhaps, they can\u2019t. I\u2019d rather be cautious.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl in his sights had ash blonde hair and a good figure. Her breasts while not the biggest he has ever seen fit perfectly with that body. Unfortunately, she was a little on the young side, only 15 but it\u2019s not like that really mattered to him, and the other attributes made up for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his eyes and looked down at his new body. Not only did he do a life swap, but he also did all of the ones necessary to truly take on the new role he\u2019s been given. While he still has his old memories, he couldn\u2019t care less about something stupid like being a boy. <i>Even if they discover that my old body doesn\u2019t have the device anymore, they\u2019ll never be able to find me, I ran past five people with those devices, ehehe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe or should I say, she rejoiced at being a girl once more, feeling the empty void between her legs and slight chill of the wind going between her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Christina,\u201d a short girl with auburn hair called out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh Maria, let\u2019s go to the mall tonight,\u201d she responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d her friend replied as they gracefully walked into the classroom, and sat down waiting for the teacher to arrive. Several students were chatting with each other, some were listlessly staring into the void as if their very souls were sucked out, some looked extremely uncomfortable and some were cross-dressing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Looks like the folks with the devices have been busy, there\u2019s five people cross-dressing and no one gives them a second glance, ehehe. I should mess with some people too, ehehe.</i> She grinned happily and glanced around. Half of the people didn\u2019t give her more than a couple glances, however some of the male population kept looking her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to feel extremely self-conscious about so many boys looking at her, but when one dressed in a little girl\u2019s dress started staring into her eyes, she involuntarily giggled and the feeling dissipated.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Some of the people who failed spectacularly in the previous activity had a chill run down their backs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor this activity, you are to swing from bar to bar,\u201d the teacher announced. He, or should I say she gave a demonstration as she swung from one bar to the other effortlessly. <i>Whose talent did you steal for that, ehehe?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the cross-dressing men gracefully ran onto the course, jumped and grabbed a bar, swung back and forth to build up momentum and launched his face right into the other bar. The teacher laughed and Christine couldn\u2019t help giggling at the bulging muscles under the feminine outfit as he swung on the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pride crushed, he retreated back into the side-lines, although if it wasn\u2019t for the device\u2019s reality bending effects, then his pride would have been crushed into a million pieces a long time after seeing what uniforms he\u2019s been wearing for the past few hours, while one or two of them would actually enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t do this, it\u2019s too difficult,\u201d one of the personality swapped boys said as he cowered in the corner, and the teacher gave up on dragging him out. They still got a spectacle out of the cowering scene, so they were very satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChristine Taylor,\u201d the teacher said. <i>My turn.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gracefully jumped onto the bar, and started swing back and forth to build up momentum. <i>Surprisingly hard.</i> She launched herself at an angle at the higher bar, but she narrowly missed it and landed in the soft embrace of the safety mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up and awaited the next event, hoping that it would be as amusing as this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThree laps around the field,\u201d the teacher announced. <i>Oh no, nonononono.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe involuntarily stepped back and sighed as she came to terms with the upcoming event which would put a huge drain on her dreadfully low stamina. And so, she along with the rest of the group walked out to a large field with some trees dotting the landscape here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group moved to the starting position, before shooting off along with the teacher to complete the laps around the field, which wasn\u2019t helped by the cold winds blasting at their faces. Fortunately for Christine, the winds were blocked by the people in-front as she was fairly slow compared to many of the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn\u2019t even completed the first lap, and she was already tiring out with her heart frantically pushing her body to its limits. In her moment of darkness, someone stumbled and tripped onto the ground. That\u2019s when she remembered that there were people even worse than her thanks to the swaps and that no one would blame her too much for having little stamina as she was a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral boys who tripped started crying and throwing tantrums before running away never to be seen again until the next class. Christine passed the first lap, although it costed her stamina dearly, and she could already feel her legs getting close to giving out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of girls bowed out of the run, and several more feminised boys made a disappearance when Christine\u2019s legs finally gave out, and she panted from sheer exhaustion. She went over to join the rest of the crowd as the main group continued to run their laps. She was extremely satisfied by it all, however as she got to see the reactions of the swapped people during the event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled as more cross-dressers bowed out and started bawling uncontrollably. Before long, the only one who was still running laps was the teacher, although the sheer exhaustion could be seen on her face as she completed the third lap. She was a little confused as to why Christine didn\u2019t use the device to augment her stamina, but she didn\u2019t think too hard on it and concluded the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine followed the rest of the girls to the girls\u2019 shower room to get themselves cleaned up after sweating profusely for the last hour. The mysterious gaze among the girls continued to sneak peeks at her without her noticing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly removed her clothes starting with her top and shorts before moving onto her undergarments. She looked down at herself and saw an absolutely splendid naked body. Before completely losing herself to her own charms, she stepped into the shower and started cleaning herself while appreciating her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sorry Christine, this body\u2019s too good. Oops, I\u2019m Christine, ehehe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she shampooed her hair and cleansed her body, the girl from before started sneakily taking peeks at her in the shower, blushing profusely and her heart rate sped up dramatically. No one noticed it, however as they were either too envious of Christine\u2019s good looks to care or were too busy cleaning themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResisting the urge to make poses in-front of the mirror and saving it from when she goes home, Christine dries herself off and dresses herself in her uniform again. Putting the undergarments back on, and then her top, skirt, shoes and leggings which nearly reach her knees. <i>I\u2019ll have to try some other clothes later, ehehe.</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Christine glanced at a familiar face in the distance for an instant before returning to her conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one over there was naturally Karen who happened to be talking about her, \u201cWhere on earth did he vanish to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t know, probably swapped with someone for fun, he\u2019ll be back sooner or later when he gets bored,\u201d another replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, that guy,\u201d Karen responded. Christine couldn\u2019t help giggling when she overheard that part, although Maria just assumed that she was laughing at one of her jokes. <i>Sorry, I\u2019d like to stay as this forever, and the devices lower the chances of that. Who knows how many secrets they hold.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put a portion of the sandwich in her mouth, and enjoyed the delicious sensation of the tomato sauce and other bits spreading through her mouth. <i>Christi- I like this stuff, ehehe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fight erupted on another table between two cross-dressers. Tables and chairs were violently thrown around, and people gathered to watch the fight. Unlike most of the spectators, the device users were barely able to contain their laughter at the absurdity of it all. It ended up with one guy getting knocked out and security guards charging in to break up the fight.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The two friends were excited about their trip to the mall later today. <i>It\u2019s going to be soooo much fun, ehehe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine moved onto her soup, slowly lifting the liquid up to her mouth, and flinching at the uncomfortably high temperature. Ow. After that, she used all methods to cool it further, although she didn\u2019t want to draw too much attention to the fact that it\u2019s hot and that she\u2019s being too desperate or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried eating it again. The tasty substance filled her mouth, and she savoured the taste before swallowing it. A cheerful grin rose to her face, which helped to lighten the atmosphere, even her friend wasn\u2019t completely immune to it, although she was mostly used to her antics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced over to the side and grimaced in disgust as a familiar figure walked to a nearby table and started blatantly staring at her. <i>Just had to have him spoiling my day. Mark Tullington. Chris- My most annoying stalker. I\u2019ve even heard rumours he has some sort of shrine in his room. Disgusting. Creep.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed her glancing at him and gave her a smile. To the people around the room who didn\u2019t know about his true face, he seemed like a charming gentlemen, but she knew better and saw the disgusting intent below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I\u2019ll have to deal with him somehow. Swapping him with the people here is too good for him. What to do\u2026 Ah, knowing him, he\u2019ll follow me when I go to the mall. Let\u2019s see him try to stalk me after I swap his body with a toddler\u2019s, ehehe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine continued eating, but her mood was much sourer than before, and Maria noticed. She already knew about the situation going on between the two, but there was little that she could do without evidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention, the guy was a lunatic, he might go after her, if she got in the way. While many don\u2019t know his true nature, she heard the stories of how he had been arrested after sending his old girlfriend to hospital after she voiced the desire to break up with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe eventually left the room, but gave Christine a wink and blew a kiss before leaving sending a shiver down her spine and the strong feeling of disgust resurfaced.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The usual mischievous smile rose to her face as she thought about the next class. <i>Ehehehehehehehe.</i> Maria was confused about why she was so excited, but shrugged it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe departed for the next class, arriving at a large pool and headed into the adjacent changing rooms. She started removing her clothes, when she as if something was watching her, but dismissed it as her feeling insecure from the previous incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff came the skirt, blouse, lacy undergarments and other miscellaneous items. And on went the top and bottom half of her black bikini. She took a look at herself in the mirror and felt slightly embarrassed about exposing herself in-front of her classmates, but sacrifices must be made and she departed for her class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA surge of embarrassment went through her as countless people started looking at her in the outfit, and she promptly jumped into the water to hide her embarrassment. <i>Please stop staring so much.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face turned red from the embarrassment and watched as the best part was about to begin. Several men wearing bikinis and one piece swimsuits casually walked out of the changing rooms as if it was perfectly normal. Bulges visible in the bottom part of their swimsuits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer embarrassment subsided as she nearly swallowed the water from giggling. <i>So good.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gracefully swam through the water, but like before, her stamina gave out before she had gone too far and she went up to rest. She watched as the boys swam wearing female swimsuits and enjoyed every moment of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water dripped from her body, and she kind of liked the sensation. Of course, the people who liked it the most were the ones who were sneaking glances at her. She was painfully aware of it all, but barely managed to ignore it in favour of watching the silly antics of the swimmers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of girls wearing no tops and male bottoms walked out of the changing rooms, although no one gave them a second glance strangely enough, and continued to look at Christine. <i>Oh, come on. You\u2019re still staring at me? Sometimes I wish there was an option to make people notice the changes.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened up the device menu and pondered some things. <i>Ah! Of course. I\u2019ve been using clothing swap, but what I should swap is their dress sense, so that they go out and buy opposite gender clothing of their own accord, and it\u2019ll look unusual to other people. That might be a little too cruel, I might have to save it for that guy.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally looked over at the teacher who was sitting upon her lifeguard tower, who was shockingly enough the same teacher as in the previous classes. <i>Is she the only teacher in this school? She\u2019s appearing all the time! Ah wait, she probably swapped the schedules to watch the boys here.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher was wearing a red bikini and like before had the form of a teenage girl. She even decided to swap names with that girl and now has everyone call her Sara, as she felt weird having people refer to her by a male name after a couple of classes. The class still thought the teacher was male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class eventually came to a close, so Christine walked back to the changing room, droplets of water dripping from her and her bikini. <i>Ah, what a fun day. I\u2019m looking forward to the mall, ehehe.</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He listened to their every word and decided to \u2018accidentally\u2019 run into them at the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two excitedly chatted, until they separated as Christine first planned to go home to change her clothes, as she didn\u2019t want to go there in a school uniform. She wanted to try wearing something else instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gracefully walked back to her home, even when no one was watching, the habit of doing so thoroughly ingrained into her body and mind. She peeked around to see if the infamous guy was following, but he was nowhere in sight and had already departed for the mall after hearing their prior conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Phew, maybe he isn\u2019t following me today.</i> She happily headed towards her home, walking past various people, some of whom were teenagers who took glances of her. As she walked, the wind threatened to expose her lower body, but she managed to promptly push her skirt back down. <i>Windy days are so annoying.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her well maintained garden with various exotic flowers and smiled happily at it. Several of the neighbourhood cats ran past, as she walked up to the door and inserted her key. <i>So cute. I should buy one, ehehe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine entered the house, although her new parents hadn\u2019t arrived yet, and neither had her new sister. She excitedly ran up the stairs to her room and closed the door. She \u2018played\u2019 with herself for a few minutes, enjoying the sensations of her body, and stripped off to change into a new outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found an elegant black dress which she always wanted to wear, and some black flat shoes to go with it.

Mark made small talk and invited himself to come with Christine.  Christine didn't mind.  She actually encouraged Mark tagging along as she wanted to make changes to him and it would be much easier if she knew where he was at all times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine's first instinct was to swap Mark's body with a toddler.  But she had to find a suitable toddler to swap with.  She maneuvered their trek through the mall to places where should could find since a 'person.\"  But when she found an adorable toddler, Christine decided not to swap them.  She didn't want the toddler to become an adult physically.  It didn't seem fair to the toddler.  But that didn't mean that the two year old would have to suffer being in diapers and needing to go through potty training in about a year when he became three.  Soon the toddler was in male briefs and underneath Mark's pants he was wearing a baby's diaper.  He knew as much about potty training as a two year old and was just as concerned about it.  Over Mark's shoulder, the diaper bag that had once belonged to the mother of the toddler appeared.  It was full of all the changing supplies that Mark needed when he needed to change himself.  Although the style of the diapers where still babyish the size were big enough to fit Mark comfortably.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine was happy with the changes she made in Mark, but this didn't deflect from his still annoying behavior.  Christine allowed Mark to continue to tag along until a new plan hit her.  After a while, an opportunity presented itself.  Christine spotted a young woman who was dating a very burly man.  He was strong, very muscular and quite handsome.  It seemed that this woman had a thing for buff strong men.  This was perfect.  Christine swapped the preferences of the woman with Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Mark didn't know why he was tagging along with Christine nor her friend in the first place.  The woman on the other hand, didn't like men of any type.  She was strictly for the girls now.  The woman would break up with her boyfriend before the end of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" Mark said.  \"I think I made a stinky and I need to change myself.\"  Mark was using an excuse to separate himself from the girls.  Christine noticed that Mark now talked about his 'biological' needs like a toddler would.  She didn't consider this, but it made her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, OK.  Should we wait for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you go along, I'm sure I'll see you at school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, see you next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark left the girls and walked off presumably towards the restroom to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

This was a bit unusual for a mall in which people do a lot of walking.  This woman had a love hate relationship with shoes, she loved them.  She truly loved them, she loved how they looked.  She loved how they made her feet look.  She loved how they made her look taller than she really was.  But she hated the pain she had to endure.  It seemed that the better the shoe looked, the more painful it was for her to wear.  But she couldn't resist them.  She had scores of pairs at home.  She constantly looked in shoe stores for the next pair she wanted.  She didn't even have to buy shoes, it was just great fun to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine decided to transfer not only the woman's love for shoes to Mark, but also anything that had to do with the woman's feet.  Not only was Mark now wearing the shoes that this woman had formerly worn, but also his room was filled with scores of women's shoes in his size.  His sock drawer was now filled with women's socks, along with stockings and pantyhose although he preferred to not wear any of those.  His feet had also been pedicured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine watched Mark recede into the distance wearing his new shoes, oblivious of any changes.  But despite wearing women heeled pumps, Mark's gait hadn't changed.  He still walked like a man.  Christine chuckled at the way Mark walked with his new shoes. </span></div></div>",

It scanned the mall for someone with a mismatching gender identity. I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t get you a new body, those guys would just swap it back, if only I could make it permanent for you. More importantly, let\u2019s buy some clothes, ehehe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine dove into a clothes store and stared intently at the pretty dresses. <i>Thanks for the money, Mark, ehehe.</i> She looked at the money which she managed to swap away from Mark, most of which was in a piece of plastic with her name on it. Unlike Christine who was practically broke from shopping all the time, Mark had many thousands of dollars which he got from his rich parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at a pink frilly dress. <i>Haven\u2019t tried one of these, I\u2019ll buy it. And that blue one. And that green one. That black dress is kinda cute. Ooh, there\u2019s a nice checkered skirt. That tie might look nice with my school uniform. Oooh, look at those shoes, how cute, ehehe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two chatted away as they browsed through various items, bought some and after an hour of excitement walked out of that store. Of course, that wasn\u2019t going to be the only one they went to, especially with the generous \u2018donation\u2019 Mark made to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe caught sight of Mark once again, still wearing his diaper and not so stealthily tailing a muscular man. She took a look at the device and giggled when she saw what it said. <i>That guy\u2019s straight, ehehe. This should be fun.</i> Mark\u2019s personality kicked in and he started inappropriately touching the man landing him a punch in the face. Blood dripped down his face as Christine gleefully watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pondered for a moment and loaded up the device once again. She found a woman in the second week of her pregnancy with the search system. <i>What happens, if I give it to Mark, does he become a pregnant man? Ehehe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The swap you selected is physically impossible without killing the subject, thus the swap was modified to include the female internal organs necessary (a womb) in exchange for one of the subject\u2019s testicles. As an additional note, without a vagina, the child would have to be surgically removed upon childbirth. We\u2019re sorry for the inconvenience, Miss Christine.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It did a partial body swap? Is that even possible? Probably missed it, ehehe. This is even better.

Thanks for the tip, I\u2019ll try it out,\u201d Sara replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You can now where whatever you want within reason. Casual. Formal. You can even cross-dress, if you wish.<br>\r\nOver the years, Euphoria High has been a strong supporter of gender equality, so it\u2019s only natural for us to make this decision. Thank you for listening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hahaha, they changed the dress code just for him? And to think that the headmaster was such a hard-line traditionalist before, ehehe.</i> Christine giggled at the announcement and the teacher gave out a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short distance behind them and also heading to the same class was David. He was a weak and effeminate boy who loved cross-dressing, as such he was stifled by the archaic dress code for years, and was ecstatic at the new rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slipped away from the class before it started to change into something more comfortable. Little did he know that he was going to receive a device in there which would let him go further. Much further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine arrived at the music class with the usual people showing up, the cross-dressers, the personality shifted ones, the teacher Sara, etc. She even overheard them talking about Mark behind his back, as if his attire was shocking. What made it more ironic is that they completely overlooked their own attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This place is slowly turning into \u2018Cross-dress Academy\u2019, ehehe.</i> She sat down with her friend and giggled as she looked around at the usual people. <i>First up will be singing, let\u2019s swap some of their voices around, ehehe. Got to love the body part swaps, I just have to select the vocal cords.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around to notice David coming in wearing a blouse and a skirt. He was extremely effeminate for a boy and it was hard to distinguish him from a real one, asides from some hard to disguise aspects like the muscle tones, Adam\u2019s Apple, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost importantly, she noticed that he was a PAID user. <i>He didn\u2019t have one yesterday, it must have arrived today, ehehe. A new swap buddy. It says he\u2019s still male. Hm. Could he have received it a moment ago and didn\u2019t have the chance to swap yet?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she thought that, she noticed time stop for a few seconds, taking the time to speak to them, \u201cI take it that you\u2019re PAID users too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, good to have a new friend in the club, ehehe,\u201d Christine replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m shocked that there are so many cross-dressers, I\u2019m guessing you swapped them? Strangely enough, I just accepted it as perfectly normal yesterday, this device is incredible,\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s amazing, ehehe, what should I call you, \u2018David\u2019?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me think. There are some nice options here. How about\u2026 Anna?\u201d he said as he initiated the swap turning himself into a cute red haired girl. <i>Have fun, ehehe.</i> Anna excitedly sat down and looked down at her new body. Luckily, she was at the back of the room, so she was able to mostly hide what she was doing to her body.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everyone in the class had happy smiles as they were soothed by her beautiful voice. Anna\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t too bad, although it wasn\u2019t as amazing. It\u2019s really easy for her to fix that problem with the device. <i>It\u2019s time for the best part.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral of the students started oinking like pigs, some started barking like dogs, and some started meowing like cats. <i>Turns out I can swap humans with animals, including their languages. For whatever reason, everyone just seems to think of it as a normal foreign language, probably the device doing its thing.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the students started licking himself like an animal and the other device holders were unable to contain their laughter. The class looked at them weirdly and they just brushed it off as remembering a joke they told each other earlier. They too started to come up with new creative ways of using the devices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine fiddled with the device and remotely selected Mark who she saved on her list. <i>Ehehehehe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in another class, Mark sat in his frilly dress when he pushed the chair aside and sat down on all fours. He felt all his knowledge of the Spanish language slip away and be replaced with the dog language turning him into the one true dog whisperer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher was shocked by him sitting on the floor, shrugged and just accepted it as part of Mark\u2019s insanity. He continued his lecture on quantum mechanics, when one of the device users in the room had enough and replaced all of his knowledge on quantum mechanics with fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gleefully started teaching them about all of the latest fashion trends, while Christine was looking forward to seeing Mark at lunch for the first time in her life.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ll leave Mark like that forever though.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flash occurred and they were suddenly able to speak English once again, albeit with the vocal cords of various animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine tapped into her musical knowledge to play a beautiful lullaby on her harp, while some of the male students cut their fingers on the strings and started breaking down into tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music lesson came to an end and they departed to their next language. Spanish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine took the opportunity to ask her classmates a couple of questions, \u201cHow long has Mark been like\u2026 That?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s been cross-dressing for a long time, but he\u2019s never had the balls to do something like that. Hah, balls. It\u2019s ironic saying that,\u201d a student replied. <i>Ah, I see. That\u2019s how their memories were altered, ehehe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived at the Spanish class where Sara was once again teaching it, it turns out that she liked being with her test subjects, I mean, \u2018favourite students\u2019. Switching jobs where ever necessary. Unfortunately, or fortunately, she was going to be teaching a different set of students for the next one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ehehe, I wonder how Mark\u2019s doing. He used to be one of the top Spanish students and now he can\u2019t remember a thing, ehehe.</i> Christine managed to speak Spanish on some level, although you could barely call her \u2018fluent\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna and the teacher were surprisingly fluent, although they probably stole that talent from someone else. Something which Christine was thinking of doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile that was going on, Mark was still barking in the other class and had to start relearning Spanish from scratch. The teacher wasn\u2019t amused by his lack of knowledge after studying at the school for several years, but he didn\u2019t dare bring it up, otherwise he might be fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis life was about to change when a glowing sphere suddenly phased through the ceiling as if it didn\u2019t exist and appeared before him. A metallic band appearing on his arm and him learning of the school\u2019s true reality, \u2018Hahaha, I understand now. That was a brilliant move, Mark\u2019s been a horrible person for ages, he got what he deserved.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe classes eventually came to a close and Christine went to get some food, accompanied by her best friend, Maria who was fairly average in the previous class.

The other students accepted talking animals as something that was perfectly normal, except the device users who had looks of shock on their faces. Christine couldn\u2019t help but giggle at their reactions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, hello Christine,\u201d a stray black cat said with a student\u2019s posh accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Mr. Tiddles,\u201d Christine responded. This was the stray who liked wandering the school and who the students named Mr. Tiddles. <i>How cute, I need my own talking cat, ehehe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a fine day, is it not?\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she responded and held back a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked into the room, she saw Mark walking on all-floors wearing his frilly pink dress and diaper. He turned to the people staring at him and said, \u201cWhat the hell are you looking at?\u201d and they turned around and pretended to ignore him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to him walking on all-fours, the surrounding people could see up his dress, the wet diaper ready to be changed in full view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine had to freeze time before laughing ceaselessly at him. The other device users did the same. <i>I wonder if I could swap his face with a pig\u2019s face. I could name a pig \u2018Ganon\u2019 and swap their names, ehehe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Christine who had the benefit of being Christine, Anna who had a much smaller swap was nervously walking around and trying to get used to her jiggly parts. The surrounding people misinterpreted her as a shy girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine sat down with her good friend, Maria and Anna joined her as a fellow device user from the same classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to the pet store earlier, I want my own bundle of cuteness around my home,\u201d Christine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe already have a bundle of cuteness,\u201d Anna said to Christine which made her giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, and then we could go to the mall afterwards,\u201d Maria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Christine said. <i>I wonder if I should make another withdrawal from the \u2018Bank of Mark\u2019, ehehe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark started eating out of his bowl (he instructed the teachers to put all his food in a doggie bowl with Mark written on it) like a dog, the horrible smell of poop spreading from his diaper and making the surrounding people back away from him, \u201cArgh, that horrible smell\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other device users had a confused look on their faces when they saw students who were speaking with a strong animalistic accent (thanks to them having animal vocal cords), and then they put two and two together with the talking animals they saw earlier and \u2018got it\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, many of them hadn\u2019t unlocked the body part swap yet, but other plans came to mind on how to deal with the people who used to bully them (other than making them wear dresses, screwing with their personalities, etc.), other enemies, and people who generally annoy them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This body feels completely different.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna walked with her new friend Christine over to the swimming class, while trying to imitate her movements to move more gracefully. <i>She stopped? Is she helping me? She\u2019s awfully friendly to me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a lot in common, ehehe,\" Christine muttered too quietly for Anna to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the air go through the now empty void below, slightly impeded by a thin layer of fabric and her upper body jiggled as they walked to the next class. <i>It feels so weird, not bad, but weird\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna nervously walked into a changing room filled with other teenage girls. She noticed one looking intently at Christine. <i>Molly\u2026 She doesn\u2019t have a device.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group undressed with Anna having some slight issues with her bra, before quickly managing to figure it out. She looked down at her own body and felt slightly aroused before snapping out of it. <i>I\u2019ll have plenty of time for this at home.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nervously put on a pink bikini, while Christine easily put on a black one as if she\u2019s been doing it her entire life. She walked out with Christine and felt almost naked at how it exposed her body. She was extremely embarrassed at the gazes flying her way, little did she know that most of them were actually looking at Christine and she happened to be standing next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine gracefully walked to the pool, Anna was a little less than graceful. They found their new teacher, he\u2019s the one who received a device during Mark\u2019s class. He was now tall and extremely muscular, almost like an idealised superhuman. They noticed the metal hoop around his arm. <i>Another one.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed Christine gesture to not tell him too much. He turned around and noticed the two with their devices. He briefly smiled and started the class. <i>She doesn\u2019t want him to know too much, what could she be thinking? Well, according to the device, she is a lot smarter than me. She must have noticed something.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dove into the water. She felt the sensation of the wet substance over her entire body, even the parts the thin fabric normally protects. <i>Ur, this feels weird. And tingly.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine gestured to her as she spaced out. <i>Ah right, I\u2019m supposed to be swimming.</i> She shot off towards the other size of the giant pool, before swimming back to the other side. <i>Not much stamina as a girl, huh.</i> Little did she know that her stamina was far above Christine\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled along with Christine as the cross-dressers arrived with the visible bulges in the bottom half of their bikinis. Even she didn\u2019t go that far when she was a boy. The teacher who was now clued into this world\u2019s true reality also chuckled at the absurdity of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey shot across the pool, some almost drowning and others like professional athletes which would almost look impressive, if it wasn\u2019t for their outfits. Christine jumped in, gracefully swam across the pool, but ran out of energy before she could go for another lap. <i>She has less stamina than me\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh, Christine. Why don\u2019t you improve your stamina?\u201d Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be too easy, I can\u2019t improve everything or it\u2019ll get boring, ehehe,\u201d Christine replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last one to jump into the pool was the teacher. Jumping off the lifeguard\u2019s tower, sending a big wave in all directions. He shot forward at an ungodly speed without the slightest shred of exhaustion and managed to complete a whopping five laps without using his time stop power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Show-off,\u2019</i> Christine and Anna thought. Half of the class was in shock at his incredible athletic talent and he stood before them like an invincible god, \u201cWow, that\u2019s incredible,\u201d half the class said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, if you train every day, you\u2019re bound to reach my level,\u201d he said which made the two giggle as he stole that talent from someone else. Probably an Olympic Athlete, if they had to guess. Where he found one on such short notice is anyone\u2019s guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class came to a close with that explosive climax and he walked towards the two girls, \u201cYou also have these metal hoops. I assume you have that swapping power?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d the two said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, I thought as much, to think that I\u2019ve been living among all these people distorted by that power and I never realised it, I\u2019ll see you two tomorrow,\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two swapped phone numbers (not a magical kind of swap, the normal kind) and had a private conversation away from the crowds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you want to hide stuff from him?\u201d Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he would care too much for your transformation, Anna. It\u2019s better to stick with those sympathetic to your cause, ehehe.\u201d Christine said, not mentioning her own swap in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood point,\u201d Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInformation about the device is a strategic resource. If handled wrongly, it could be used against us,\u201d Christine said with a serious expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight,\u201d Anna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough serious stuff, ehehe.

She also made sure that the water bowls, food bowls and litter boxes were setup for their use and departed for the mall. Again. As the house was empty, she took the time to make a phone call informing her family about the new acquisitions. They didn\u2019t mind and were actually excited about the new additions to their family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, they departed for the mall where they saw Mark scurrying around, and it brought a grin to her face when she remembered the years of him hiding in the shadows watching her. <i>I\u2019m sure there are some great traits to give him in the lunatic asylum, but I fear for my safety, if I go to a horrifying place like that. I\u2019ll pass on that, ehehe.</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They bullied the weak and powerless for years, they got what they deserved, ehehe. Of course, Mark deserved a far worse fate, ehehe,\u201d Christine replied and then her eyes narrowed as she spotted someone in the distance, \u201cSteve Long, he\u2019s your bully, right? Why don\u2019t we play with him? Ehehe\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe mocked me for cross-dressing for years, I\u2019ll have a lot of fun with this,\u201d she replied pulling up her device, \u201cWhat to pick\u2026? Oh, I know, hehehe,\u201d she picked the option to replace his male organs with female ones, however something goes wrong and he ends up entirely female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrm, it alters reality, so it\u2019s as if he\u2019s always had those. If he\u2019s always had those, then the hormones would shape his body from the very beginning,\u201d Christine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like it unlocked a Gender Swap option,\u201d she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice, what else do you want to do with \u2018her\u2019?\u201d Christine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s a lesbian, right?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, she\u2019s still attracted to girls,\u201d Christine replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s make her absolutely disgusted with female clothes and have her wear male clothes instead,\u201d she said as she fired up her device again. The woman shrieked after seeing what she had on and ran into the closest male clothes store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two met up with Maria once again and headed into the nearest clothes store, Christine obviously wasn\u2019t going to lose the chance to do so, now that she had a virtually infinite supply of money. <i>Now that I think about it, doesn\u2019t the device make me immortal? I could just hope from body to body when I grow old, ehehe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did she know that this was the very reason why the female scientist was laughing madly when she got the device. It was like the holy grail landed in her lap, it would lead her to the pinnacle of her field of science and make her name eternal. Or so she hoped, but how could such a powerful device be comprehended by mere humans?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine tried on various articles of clothing. Dresses. Tops. Swimwear. Undergarments. Skirts. Bottoms. She looked good in just about anything, but her tastes were much more refined than that, she didn\u2019t want to wear anything less than the best. She had an inexhaustible supply of money after-all, why would she wear shoddy clothes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also decided to get some new clothes for her newly transformed friend, Anna who was fairly used to wearing female clothing, but was still embarrassed about her new body, and the undergarment side of things. <i>She\u2019s so cute when she\u2019s embarrassed, ehehe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Little did she know that even the lab wasn\u2019t beyond the influence of the devices. It\u2019s only natural, however as she\u2019s never seen any device users\u2019 asides from the ones at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cuddled with her bundles of cuteness before drifting off into the land of dreams, a new day awaiting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in a high tech research lab, the blonde scientist was examining her device\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This device is incredible, when I use the body swap option between two subjects, their body structures are identical to the other prior to the swap down to the genetic level. The obvious theory is that they somehow have some mechanism for transferring minds, and then they swap the positions of the bodies to create the illusion of each transforming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ll need additional data to verify this. Fortunately, I don\u2019t have a lack of test subjects and they don\u2019t suspect a thing thanks to the device rewriting people\u2019s memories. I then simply have to take a sample of their DNA for a study on \u2018inherited diseases\u2019 or some other nonsensical excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the subject of the device \u2018altering reality\u2019, it likely uses the same mechanism for altering people\u2019s personalities, traits, etc. to change their memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hard part is the transformation of the clothes and generating the \u2018fake\u2019 history. Perhaps, they have some sort of computer simulation which simulates what life might be like, if those changes were in play. Unfortunately, computer science isn\u2019t my field, and I don\u2019t want to experiment on myself quite yet with a dangerous alien device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also need to confirm if I\u2019m the only one who has it, or whether there are others out there. I wonder who made it? The government? No, the government isn\u2019t capable of something like this. Even if they were, they wouldn\u2019t give it out to a random person like me. Possibly, aliens? A civilisation so advanced that something like this is a piece of trash and it gives them research data on us?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde scientist pondered over how the device worked, but couldn\u2019t come up with a solid theory without more data. Little did she know that the existence of the Body Part Swap feature which she hadn\u2019t unlocked yet wrecked one of her theories. The device more mysterious and elusive than she ever could have imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Let\u2019s go through the options again. Personality. Body. Life. Personal Info. Personal Info. Hm. I\u2019ll need to go to a place with more test subjects, I\u2019m severely limited with the ones we get in this lab. It looks like I\u2019ll have to take a trip to the mall tomorrow.</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She turned to the bundle of cuteness and instinctively hugged it. <i>So cute, ehehe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature opened its eyes before drifting back to sleep as she rose up from her soft mattress. She yawned and started getting dressed for yet another day. She was about to dress herself when she remembered the new dress code, and so she pondered over what to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eventually settled for an exotic blue dress, tying her hair up with a blue band to go with the outfit, and descended down the stairs. She heard her sister giggling in her room as she played with one of the bundles of cuteness. <i>Have fun, ehehe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father was passed out on his bed after yet another all-nighter at the lab, so he didn\u2019t go down for breakfast. She slowly ate her bowl of cereal, as she listened to her mother excitedly chat about how much she loved the bundles of cuteness. <i>Just wait until they grow, ehehe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped out into the street and noticed that it wasn\u2019t anywhere near as hot as the previous day. Luckily, it wasn\u2019t too windy either, so there shouldn\u2019t be too many issues with her dress, and as far as her personal safety went, the device was the ultimate weapon to use against people without one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did she know that there were many many people with the devices in the world. Of course, this is only natural, why would such devices only appear within a certain area?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA black car with tinted windows sped past her and she took a glance at it before looking back. The vehicle had no signs of slowing either. The blonde haired scientist was sitting inside the vehicle and swapping the personalities of the other drivers as a kind of social experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t notice Christine at all though, not yet at-least, she was too focused on the experiment, noting down the results on her computer. To prevent rivals from breaching its security, it was permanently disconnected from the internet, the data was fully encrypted with a single key press preventing others from accessing it physically and other fail-safes were present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese weren\u2019t measures she came up with, of course. They were ones the lab came up with to prevent corporate espionage. If any random kid could walk out with their valuable data, they would be completely screwed over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, they never thought that a life changing device which could pull the codes from someone\u2019s mind could exist, naturally she\u2019s the only one who knows the ones on her computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she thought about the device, a couple of cars sped past Christine at a clearly illegal speed. They horned at each other, Mark\u2019s middle finger visible in the window. <i>Bad Mark, don\u2019t you ever learn? Ehehe. I\u2019ll have to punish you again, ehehe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine was nearly back at school when an expensive car (one of the ones from before) stopped outside the school gates, and Mark crawled out. <i>I have to find a more suitable car for you. Pink and girly should do, ehehe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark had his backpack strapped to his back, pink and girly as he liked it. Within which was a drill for him to create a hole in the men\u2019s changing room for him to stare at his desired lover without them suspecting a thing. In fact, he used to do the same thing to Christine when she was changing all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought he was being stealthy, but she knew full well about what he was doing, but couldn\u2019t do a thing thanks to his family\u2019s influence. Everything changed with the device, of course. With it, she\u2019s like a god compared to an insignificant insect like Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething appeared different about his appearance today however. He seemed to be wearing make-up, it didn\u2019t even enhance his appearance, but made him look hideous like a ghost. This was the result of him annoying the scientist with his terrible driving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave a gesture to the teachers. They walked towards him with a chair, lifted him onto it and carried the chair into the school. This way, he avoided the slow process of crawling entirely. <i>Bad Mark, you\u2019re not supposed to avoid being punished, ehehe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA transformation swept through his body and he had a powerful sensation of seasickness as they carried the chair. One teacher was unlucky enough to have the contents of his stomach dumped all over them. <i>Poor teacher. I\u2019ll fix it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nReality shifted and the one who Mark vomited on changed from the teacher to a bully who had been tormenting students for years. He was absolutely outraged, but didn\u2019t dare to anger Mark, as he could easily destroy his social life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna arrived shortly after, catching a glimpse of Mark being removed from the chair, as he was now incapable of handling the shaking of the chair and resuming his usual crawl. She quickly found her original body and switched back to Christine\u2019s surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not staying like this,\u201d he said before inverting his gender and creating a body far prettier than her previous one. The one she swapped genders with was naturally yet another known bully. Unfortunately, the bully kept her original personality and started tormenting other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, it\u2019s like you were always meant to be a girl,\u201d Christine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Anna said before swapping the names around to get her new name Sally.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She quickly stopped time and found a boy using the hole which Mark left years ago to watch her change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Sally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s peeping on us,\u201d Christine replied and Sally was shocked, \u201cI know exactly how to deal with him, ehehe. If he wants to watch girls change so badly, let\u2019s make him into one\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat idea,\u201d she replied and the boy\u2019s body started transforming as the transformation started taking effect. Replacing the boy was a cute girl wearing a blouse and skirt. She also teleported into the changing room to join them in changing herself, although she kept sneaking peeks at the other girls. <i>Still interested in girls, ehehe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile that was happening, Mark was peeping through a hole into the men\u2019s changing room with a huge smile on his face. Little did he know that someone was watching him from afar with binoculars. It was none other than the blonde scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mark Tullington. The idiot I ran into this morning. I give a 90% chance that someone else has changed him. Closer to 95, perhaps? I refuse to believe that he was naturally born with a womb, condemned to a life of diapers, happens to be a cross-dresser and gets seasickness whenever he doesn\u2019t crawl naturally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a complete imbecile would think that. Intriguing. Very intriguing. To think that someone could give him a womb. There must be features in the device which I don\u2019t have access to yet. Wait, what\u2019s this. Haha. I get it. That\u2019s how they did it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime stopped across the school, Christine momentarily felt it before a swap came into effect and time returned to normal. Another swap occurred immediately afterwards to reverse the initial one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Intriguing. Very intriguing. I unlocked a new type of swap. Appears that one of my theories were wrong, not like I expected them to explain this device to begin with. I\u2019ve gotten a couple samples of his DNA, just in case it\u2019s changed him on the genetic level, so that he can pass this trait onto his offspring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can\u2019t stay here for too long, otherwise it might be viewed as suspicious by any possible rivals. I already know that other people have the devices from Mark\u2019s Transformation and I don\u2019t want to tempt fate. I\u2019ll investigate further into this school tomorrow.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde scientist walked into her car and drove off at high speed in the direction of the lab with several of Mark\u2019s DNA samples. She was in such an urgent rush to get the samples analysed that she didn\u2019t even do any social experiments with the surrounding drivers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the changing room, Christine walked out with her newly transformed friend, Sally. Christine quickly realised how truly horrifying this class would be, when she saw a bunch of people lifting weights to build up their upper body muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transformed teacher Sara presided over it and effortlessly picked up heavy weights as if the weight didn\u2019t exist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are the new students?\u201d She asked and Christine froze time to respond, \u201cIt\u2019s Anna. Well, her name is Sally now. The other one is a boy we turned into a girl since he was peeping on us\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I should have expected as much,\u201d Sara replied and time returned to normal. Several people across the school noticed time stop and took the time to have their own discussions in the frozen time.</span></div></div>",

No, I\u2019m fairly sure there is a way, I just need to find it like with the other new swap options.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally picked up one of the weights and started lifting it. She struggled with some of the heavier ones and decided to go for the lighter ones. <i>I could\u2026 Swap? No\u2026 Christine might be right; the power of the swaps would go to my head\u2026 Besides, she said something horrifying about it.

She\u2019s a girl though\u2026 And so am I</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued lifting weights until Christine was absolutely exhausted, Sally went to join her and the rest of the class continued. <i>I can\u2019t ask her about the random swaps yet\u2026 Sara doesn\u2019t look like a bad person, but we still can\u2019t talk about this in-front of a class.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two giggled as they watched several of the usual men in ridiculous looking outfits like a ballerina outfit, dresses, etc. trying to lift the weights. One of the personality shifted ones started throwing a tantrum about not being able to lift the weights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine\u2019s delicate muscles slowly recovered as he laid back and drank water out of a cute bottle to replenish that lost sweating. Drops of sweat rolled down her body and she was anxious to have a shower to get the horrible sensation off her. Sally had similar thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara was like a cactus in a desert, the exhaustion had next to no effect on her and she kept showing off by using heavier and heavier weights. Christine rolled her eyes at this and Sally had an envious look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the class ended, the two went to have a shower. The warm water washed away the accumulated filth and a comfortable sensation spread throughout her body. The same happened to Christine, although Sally was less familiar with her new body, so it was more of a surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dried herself off, savouring the sensations of her new body and got dressed.

She was extremely tempted to swap her physics knowledge, but didn\u2019t want to risk a random swap swapping something random with someone else over something so petty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile that was happening, Mark kept running laps around the field on all-fours, attracting looks of disdain from his fellow students. Some of the device holders took note of him, and sniggered. They had a good idea of what happened, how could they not? Only a fool wouldn\u2019t be able to tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them was an athletic teenage boy who had a body approaching that of an Olympic athlete and the other was Karen who still had no clue where Alex vanished to and doesn\u2019t really care that much anymore. Why would she when she has the \u2018power of the gods\u2019?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the device, she gave herself the most exaggerated body imaginable, little did she know that the exaggerated proportions which were supposed to make her the most beautiful woman in the school had actually backfired by making her look somewhat inhuman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong the device users was the janitor who decided to leave the school, swapped lives with a multi-millionaire and was now living in a big mansion with maids tending to his every whim. Little did he know that his excessive abuse of the device would eventually lead to a \u2018glitch\u2019 giving him the personality of a little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Christine and Sally learned about vectors, the scientist was driving as quickly as she could back to the lab to get the samples analysed. One of the other drivers decided to give her the middle finger, so she decided to swap his car with the bike of a nearby cyclist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bike suddenly materialised in the middle of the road and he swerved to the side to avoid getting hit by a car, confused as to why he was riding a bike in the middle of the road. The former cyclist was thinking the same thing as his new car appeared on the pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile that was happening, several glowing balls flew towards a big blue planet, looking for more humans to snare with their powers. They narrowly missed a collision with a weather satellite and dove down into the atmosphere where they narrowly avoided a commercial airliner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA child on the flight screamed about seeing the shining lights, but his parents simply dismissed it as childish nonsense. Several armed men tried to hijack the plane, raising their guns at the cabin crew, but then time stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilot ran up to them, disarmed them, and tied them up before restoring time back to normal. Cheers erupted across the plane, reality shifting so that everyone saw a scene out of an action movie of him effortlessly dancing around and disarming them all.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The mentally drained Christine emerged from the classroom, with a Sally who was in desperate need of something fun after the long ordeal. Even the teacher was bored of that class and decided that he would swap his way out of teaching it from now on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven their beauty was slightly diminished as the enthusiasm slowly returned to their faces, by the time they went to get their food, they had reverted back to their usual cheerful selves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine grimaced as she saw a disturbing scene at the corner of the room and readied her device against the fool who dared to ruin her lunch after the long ordeal she had to undergo in the previous class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHand over your money,\u201d a boy who was a couple of years younger than Christine demanded from a weak scrawny kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO\u2026Okay\u2026\u201d the scrawny kid replied as he reached for the money in his pocket, a tear in his eye which only caused more laughter to erupt from his oppressor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, one of these clowns disturbing my lunch,\u201d one teenager said while smoking a pipe without anyone seeing it as vaguely abnormal. A dozen device users activated their devices at once to distort the bully into an abomination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ended up wearing a sleeveless purple dress showing off his long hairy legs, a tiara, a bikini under the dress, a ball gag on his mouth, a vibrator in a place best left unmentioned, and he kept checking his body for body parts he never had as he now thought that he was a woman. Christine took notes on what she could do to Mark from their antics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe formally scrawny kid transformed into a muscular giant. The tables turned as he landed a punch on his oppressor who was now extremely timid and broke into tears. Several people looked at him in disgust and didn\u2019t make the slightest move to go over to help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine did the unthinkable by restoring the cashier back to normal, although she wished that she could make people aware of the changes. She bought a tasty bowl of soup which she slowly consumed bit by bit, savouring the taste as it permeated her taste buds and the glorious sensation spread through her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe corrected her transformed friend on the proper mannerisms which were drilled into the depths of her psyche and happily chatted despite a dark shadow tugging at her mind. Her paranoia at work. <i>Too many secrets. Secret after secret about this device are unveiled every day. It\u2019s scary, but I\u2019ll do everything I can to protect our happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat other secrets could it hide. Ah. I should try it. But not here, not in-front of them, I don\u2019t know who my enemies are. It might be possible for me to swap memories. Possibly awaken memories? Memories of \u2018this\u2019 reality would be helpful. Would I be able to watch someone\u2019s memories like with the other aspects?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine pondered things with a strange yet cute expression on her face which Sally quickly picked up on, \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN\u2026No\u2026\u201d Christine replied, gesturing for them to discuss it somewhere more private, away from the prying eyes of the others. Her thoughts quickly reverted back to the usual fun and cuddly ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile that was happening, the scientist was getting the DNA samples analysed. <i>Tch, it\u2019ll take a few hours for me to get the results back. I know that it\u2019s better than waiting a few weeks like with the older equipment, but it\u2019s still really annoying, especially with these mysterious people running around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body part swap was interesting. I reckon that there are other secrets hidden within this device. Possibly a way to swap genes rather than body parts? It would really help me in unlocking the hidden secrets of the human body. While the device hides its existence, I should still be able to publish research on the human genome.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Christine dusted off her dress before rising up for the next class. Unsurprisingly, she had to go to the changing rooms once again. This time, she didn\u2019t have anyone watching her, not through the peephole at-least. Her more feminine watchers on the other-hand had no need for peepholes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly took off her dress and related footwear, not realising that the \u2018show\u2019 was making several hearts race with excitement. Sally was pondering a certain swap, although she wondered whether she should go through with it. Her body was fully female, but her mind had certain\u2026 defects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both slowly fitted themselves with more appropriate outfits for dancing. The same sort of clothing as for the gym class, but a clean set. It\u2019s only natural however. How could you possibly expect them to wear dirty clothes drenched in sweat from a gruelling exercise session?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike their favourite outfits, the clothes for the gym class were extremely plain, although it didn\u2019t fail to show off their figures. It didn\u2019t mean that they liked them, however as they preferred their pretty dresses and skirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey slowly walked out of the room, Sally finally beginning to get more of a hang of the new mannerisms which Christine was helping to drill through her head. Christine grinned at her progress, her mind closer to the ideal which Sally pursued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, they felt the gazes of the other students, but they gradually managed to zone it out, thinking about the more exciting things. They quickly caught sight of Sara who was still in her female teenage student form. <i>She really seems to like that body\u2026 I hope she doesn\u2019t get bored of it\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine wasn\u2019t a complete fool, although she wilfully ignored many things. It was still impossible for her to ignore someone who she spent much of her time with. She noticed the strange gaze mixed with Sally\u2019s expression from time to time. <i>Ah. How cute. I wouldn\u2019t mind it either way, but I feel closer to you like this, ehehe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine began her entrancing dance, gripping the minds of the audience like an enchantress. The mesmerising jumps and movements of her cute feet. The mannerisms and twists of her upper body. The gusts of wind swaying her soft hair back and forth. Her body swayed as she finished her beautiful dance and the entire class started applauding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped to the side with a grin as she winked at Sally to get onto the stage next to dance for her. Despite what one might think, Sally was actually extremely talented at dancing, in both his body and in her original male body. This body more so, which served to deepen her muscle memory when it came to dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was likely that if she ever unlocked this body\u2019s full memories, she would probably surpass even Christine in the field of dancing. That day might even come soon. She stepped onto the dance stage and began her beautiful dance. She expertly swayed her body around, expertly doing the moves without the slightest mistake or lack of grace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs equally beautiful under her mesmerising dance. Although she didn\u2019t reach Christine\u2019s level, she still got a high level of attention of the class with several people placing her higher in their hearts than before this class. <i>Wow, she\u2019s really good at this, ehehe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Sally herself was surprised at how easy it was and how graceful her movements were. She didn\u2019t let this surprise appear on her face or to get in the way of her dance however. She still made graceful moves which moved the hearts of the audience, her friend grinning at her moves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ended her dance with a spectacle and received a grand applause. She excitedly walked down the stage to her friend and got even more excited when she saw her grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI loved your dancing,\u201d Christine excitedly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, yours was great too,\u201d Sally grinned. Christine had a slightly awkward look on her face before her grin appeared once more. <i>No seriously, your dancing\u2019s really awesome. I cheated. Maybe? Does it count as me? Why wouldn\u2019t it? It feels wrong having skills from two mes\u2019, ehehe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine giggled and praised Sally as a less talented student rose to the stage. He wore a splendid dress which showed off all of his curves. Or more accurately, his lack of curves and manly figure. A bulge clearly visible but not too prominent on his dress. Long socks covering half of his hairy legs which only served to highlight the other half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>W\u2026Wait\u2026 He\u2019s wearing that for the dance? Wasn\u2019t he supposed to change? Did someone swap gym clothes with other clothes? Ah. Sara. Ehehe, good one.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe caught sit of Sara who was grinning as the boy\u2019s grand performance was about to begin. Luckily for him, reality had shifted for most of the people in the room, thus he wasn\u2019t completely humiliating himself, although it\u2019s unknown how long this would be the case for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer awkwardly jumped around, not the slightest shred of grace present in his dance nor the elegance which Christine used to mesmerise the crowd. His hairy legs and dishevelled hair on his head swaying in the wind. A portion of his hairy chest was visible in the upper part of his dress, along with his hairy armpits on his sleeveless dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine\u2019s face distorted as the urge to laugh ceaselessly rampaged through her cute body. Sally was no different, her legs trembling as the urge to laugh slowly overcame her reason before time stopped entirely and they all collapsed on the ground laughing with no end in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher joined them in this. They eventually regained their composure and continued watching the hilarious dance. The momentum from the swaying occasionally lifting up the lower part of the dress and showing parts best left unmentioned to the entire class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Christine\u2019s laughter wasn\u2019t as unbridled as before, she still let out a giggle as she watched him do the most humiliating dance imaginable while thinking of it as something perfectly normal, not catching onto the strange looks and giggles coming from the three girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn\u2019t the end of it either, as several more boys rose to the stage, although most of them didn\u2019t wear a flamboyant dress like the first. One clumsily tripped, exposing his rear end and started throwing a tantrum like a six-year-old child. This had the consequence of producing an unusually mature child over in the junior division of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther students who clumsily tripped broke into tears and slowly walked off the stage in shame. Sara naturally took the opportunity to show off her moves, her elegant dance catching the attention of the crowd, although she shockingly wasn\u2019t able to match up to Sally or Christine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere weren\u2019t any dancers more talented than them, thus she couldn\u2019t improve herself further as device users can\u2019t target device users without their permission. Not that she minded, as it was still extremely graceful and skilful. Far beyond that of the rest of the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lesson finally came to a close, the girls enjoying every second of it, they were still excitedly chatting and giggling as they walked out of the dancing hall putting together their plans for tonight. <i>This is going to be so much fun, ehehe.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The blonde scientist, Prof. Diane Willson stood over a dissected corpse with a slightly excited and annoyed expression on her face. She placed it back in the morgue and washed the filth off her hands. She could never get used to how messy dissections can be. Unlike amateurs, she wasn\u2019t the slightest bit squeamish, but it was still messy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laid back in one of the comfy executive chairs which she swiped from one of her superiors with the device, and looked at the genetic analysis which had finally finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I didn\u2019t expect one of my test subjects to die in a car crash, how annoying. Luckily, they signed a contract with us. It appears that the body swap gave him a completely female brain, although they behaved contrary to all of its directives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the IQ tests done on her prior to the accident, it appears that behaving contrary to their true nature puts a strain on the brain, thus lowering their intelligence quotient (their IQ). The same results have been seen in certain brainwashing techniques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m curious as to what results may occur with the body part swaps, although fatalities are extremely inconvenient with the number of samples available to me. The results of the DNA test also came in. It appears that Mark with a womb has a genetic structure different from his original genetic structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe DNA is consistent across his entire body from the womb to the other parts, so there\u2019s no sign of it being a foreign object. It\u2019s likely that his descendants will also possess their own wombs, unless the swap is reversed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m curious as to what would happen, if a male mind was to be placed in a female brain without the strange brainwashing which seems to be the case in most swaps. Unfortunately, it\u2019s unlikely that I\u2019ll be able to gather this data without the co-operation of other device users and it\u2019s unlikely that they would want to be my guinea pigs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s a fairly low priority piece of research, thus it\u2019s not too particularly important. Perhaps, there\u2019s a mechanism for removing some of the brainwashing in the device. Research in that direction might be more productive than co-operation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs planned, I\u2019ll go to the mall to gather more test samples, although I might have to lay low just in case any potential rivals appear. Luckily, the device takes the form of a metal band, thus I can simply cover it up to prevent them identifying me as a rival.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist pondered and typed the results of the experiment into her computer. The device locked the information into the dark depths never to see the light of day again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile that was happening, an excited Christine emerged from her dance class with various plans whirring around her head, her cute shoes bouncing off the pavement as she made her graceful steps. Sally imitated it, but couldn\u2019t quite reach her level yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome over to my house, Sally. We\u2019ll have lots of fun, ehehe,\u201d Christine giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d Sally replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou too, Maria,\u201d Christine called out to her other friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, why not?\u201d Maria replied. They giggled as they strolled off into the streets where Christine jumped up and down with excitement at the thought of having her friends over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as they turned the corner, a slim man with a knife in hand and a suspicious moustache walked out. \u201cHand over all your money,\u201d he shouted. Maria gasped in shock, Christine grimaced and Sally was slightly amused by how foolish he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t quite understand the strange look on Sally\u2019s face and repeated his demand in case they didn\u2019t quite understand the situation. \u201cHand over all of your money,\u201d he said while moving the knife in a threatening manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn annoyed expression rose to Christine\u2019s face as time stopped entirely. <i>How dare you disturb my fun.</i> Sally already knew it would happen and watched expectantly as Christine kept smacking and kicking the man over and over in various locations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood perfectly still, almost like a statue until time was restored and all of the forces were applied to his body at once. His face bloody and Christine\u2019s clothes not dirty in the slightest. Maria\u2019s memories shifted to Christine single-handedly pulverising the enemy, \u201cWow, that was incredible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine shrugged and giggled as she knew that the device came up with a ridiculous scene out of an action movie rather than what actually happened. Some would even say that the man suddenly collapsing after being stared down by Christine would be even more frightening than the fake action scene the device came up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio continued their journey to Christine\u2019s home while excitedly chatting about the defeat of the vile villain who was absolutely traumatised by the event and decided that he would never underestimate his enemies again, even if they did look like weak and vulnerable teenage girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine shrieked and jumped to the side in terror as the neighbour\u2019s dog ran up to the gate and started barking ceaselessly. <i>Scary\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer terror was quickly washed away when she saw the new paw shaped mat outside her front door and she grinned. She pulled her key out of her bag, a paw shaped key chain attached to it, raised it up to the front door, turned it and the lock clicked giving her access to the interior of her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bundle of cuteness excitedly jumped towards her and she caught it in her arms, almost losing her reason in-front of her guests from the incredible wave of cuteness which was washing over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guests giggled at it and had similar thoughts about the bundle of cuteness. They even had thoughts of getting their own bundles of cuteness, as they didn\u2019t want to be separated from it. How could they live without it, now that they\u2019ve been introduced to the good life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine cuddled the bundle of cuteness before landing on a comfy couch which wrapped around her beautiful body. The cuteness of the bundle of cuteness adding to her own, a scene of perfection to those around. Sally grinned as she sat down next to her, looking down at the small creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Maria could barely resist the urge to start petting it, it\u2019s transcendent beauty ensnaring even her heart. Christine rained down endless love upon the small creature, petting it and hugging it endlessly. A sight which would send countless boys into a mad obsession and would drive others mad with envy, wishing that it could be them receiving that treatment instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome boys might even be willing to sacrifice their own manhood or become cats themselves in order to receive that treatment which transcends all others. Unfortunately, they would never get this chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine almost falls into a trance as she admires the soft fur, hair which surprisingly enough surpasses even her own hair in softness. A feat nearly impossible for mere humans, but easily achieved by this bundle of cuteness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bundle of cuteness eventually decided to retreat for some food, Christine pouted at the loss of her furry comrade and sighed as she resumed excitedly chatting with her two friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWant to stay over?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d The two replied and that was settled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine smirked at Sally as a devious idea came to mind, she ran up, and returned with various pieces of clothing. \u201cTry them on, ehehe,\u201d she said. Sally sighed before grinning as she remembered that Christine had enough clothes to clothe the entire neighbourhood from her adventures at the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe size was slightly off due to their different figures, but it still fit surprisingly well, exposing much of Sally innate beauty. Even Christine was impressed, although it didn\u2019t reach her level. <i>I can\u2019t wait until we go to the beach, ehehe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally tried on various pieces of clothing, and even Christine joined her as she admired the various pieces which she had bought on the spot in the mall without trying it on for long. She could afford to do so, however thanks to the Bank of Mark. Bikinis. Dresses. Skirts. They tried them all and a plan formed in Christine\u2019s mind for what they would wear and do at the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe excitedly giggled, the others not having the slightest suspicion as to what she was truly thinking. They merely thought that she was just enjoying their company. To some extent, she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bundles of cuteness peered at them curiously, confused as to what these strange garments were, their simple minds not understanding the intricate depths of fashion and beauty. Despite that, they admired their mistress who lavished praise and attention upon them.</span></div></div>",

The room was extremely elegant and slightly cute, like one would expect from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>My room looks so\u2026 Plain\u2026 I never had money before to make it look nicer, but thanks to the Bank of Mark\u2026 Ehehehehe. Should I buy it at the mall or online? Hm. Shopping with my friends sounds like more fun, ehehe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it looked plain and ordinary to her, Sally was looking around in wonder and excitement, as if it was a clothes shop. Her imagination was sent into overdrive when she imagined her sleeping with Christine, and she tried to shake the thoughts out of her head. Where are you, my bundles of cuteness\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to her bed was a smaller bed with a paw shaped symbol on it. Christine glanced at it and said, \u201cI got a bed for you, Sally, ehehe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally rolled her eyes and said, \u201cThe best bed should go to the host, you should sleep in it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, but how could I force one of my guests to sleep in my boring old bed?\u201d Christine joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine pulled out some discs and pondered what to watch. <i>Romance? Nah, it might unsettle Sally, I know what she\u2019s constantly thinking of, ehehe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want to watch, Sally?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about the Invasion of the Body Snatchers?\u201d Sally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, the film where they have some supernatural power which lets them steal people\u2019s bodies. Interesting choice, ehehe,\u201d Christine winked at Sally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat down for several hours, Christine giggling at certain parts of the film due to the irony, to the dismay of Maria who didn\u2019t understand the joke, but she brushed it aside and decided to ignore it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat would you do, if the body snatchers were real, Maria?\u201d Christine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be really horrifying. You wouldn\u2019t know who to trust,\u201d Maria said and Christine sat there with a thoughtful expression as something went through her head. Her expression quickly returned to normal and she continued excitedly chatting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine was in the middle of a joke when a pillow landed right in her face, she turned her head, and grinned at Sally who had already armed herself with a second pillow. <i>How could I forget this? Ehehe. Great idea!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine rolled to the side, dodging the incoming pillow, quickly scrambled for one of the ones on the floor and launched it at Sally. Sally wasn\u2019t able to dodge in time and had a piece of soft fabric hug her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine was about to follow up with another shot when one hit her from behind, Maria standing there with a grin on her face. Christine said, \u201cTraitor\u2026\u201d and Maria shrugged before readying another projectile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine wasn\u2019t going to be fooled again, as she leapt onto the bed, and throwing one at point blank at Sally\u2019s face. Sally broke her concentration when she was about to ready another with a big affectionate hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine was about to respond when Sally\u2019s stomach rumbled, and she giggled at it. Sally was extremely embarrassed at her stomach doing such a thing, and Christine led the group down for some food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at her meal and pondered something before elegantly eating the meat with small mouthfuls. Each movement was filled with grace and elegance. Sally tried to imitate it, but a day or two of being a girl wasn\u2019t sufficient for her to truly imitate Christine\u2019s lifetime of experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria ate the food slightly gracefully, but she wasn\u2019t anywhere near Christine\u2019s level, it was almost as if Christine was descended from a noble household. It didn\u2019t take much food before Christine decided it was enough and retreated with her friends back to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three excitedly chatted about their day, with Sally accidentally letting some things slip which she shouldn\u2019t have like the cross-dressers humiliating themselves at the school. Maria acted confused about it and assumed that she had missed something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should go to the beach tomorrow.\u201d Christine said and a shiver of excitement went down Sally\u2019s back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s do it!\u201d Sally shouted with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I don\u2019t see why not,\u201d Maria replied and Christine got even more excited. <i>Yes! This will be so much fun, ehehe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey watched various other movies, chatted for hours, played various games, etc. before Sally yawned from her tired she was. Christine grinned and invited them onto her bed. Despite being tired, Sally started acting extremely nervous and blushed slightly at the thought of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria on the other-hand didn\u2019t noticed anything wrong about her behaviour and didn\u2019t see any problem with sleeping on the bed at all. \u201cYou\u2019re so cute, Sally,\u201d Christine whispered into Sally\u2019s ear and her face heated up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three retreated into the bed sheets and even Sally who was extremely nervous eventually sank into the world of dreams. Her dreams were filled with the excitement of being a girl, but every now and then, a dream with Christine in it appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the scientist, Diane was driving up to the mall and her mouth dropped in shock when she realised what was going on. <i>There aren\u2019t any open parking spaces? Grr\u2026 Oh. I know.</i> She activated the device and her car was swapped with one neatly parked in a parking space. The car was now blocking the road and all of the other drivers were horning at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after that, a tow truck showed up to tow it away, following by Mark showing up seconds later chasing it to get his car back. <i>Hahaha, it\u2019s him again. How ironic.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked into the mall where she found loads of people shopping, eating and wandering around. She tried to do a swap, but it didn\u2019t work for some reason. Diane tried to figure out why it wasn\u2019t working when she was greeted by a screen saying, \u201cInstalling Updates 1/2382.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Installing updates?! What. How could you be installing updates? Aren\u2019t you supposed to be a ridiculously advanced godlike artefact? Oh, fine. I\u2019ll just go to a restaurant. I hope this thing will be finished by then.</i></span></div></div>",

He started cackling like a mad man and stared at the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Great God of Transformations has finally answered my prayers, bestowing a divine blessing upon me. I am honoured to be chosen as his prophet. I will lead this world into a new era, an era where all the people of the world recognise the divine might of the great god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with a tiny portion of his divine might, I\u2019m capable of impossible acts like stopping time and overwriting our very \u2018reality\u2019 with a new history. This is truly the power of the gods. And I will be the Church of Transformations\u2019 High Oracle.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile that was happening, Christine yawned as she opened her eyes, two people on either side. One of whom was leaning on half her body and completely out cold. Naturally, it was Sally who unconsciously moved around in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine gently lifted her off her body and rose up from her bed. She smiled as she spotted the bundle of cuteness who was snuggled next to Sally. <i>Finally, it\u2019s the weekend, ehehe. Being around those device holders\u2026 What\u2019s it called? PAID? Anyway, being near those guys was a real pain. I don\u2019t trust them. Don\u2019t trust them at all. Especially, since I\u2019m Christine, everyone wants the best body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow to deal with them, if they come after me\u2026 Dealing with normal people is easy, just stop time, but they\u2019re immune to the time stops. Firearms, perhaps? It\u2019s very likely that they\u2019ll rely heavily on their devices and physical strength. I could intimidate them with a better weapon\u2026 What if they\u2019re armed too? So complicated. I don\u2019t suppose I could make a gender bender alliance? Ehehe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine stood there pondering, when she noticed one of the people under the blankets moving. Sally gave out a yawn and looked over at her. She had a blank expression before she became extremely embarrassed about the whole situation. Maria was out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine started undressing and wearing extremely casual clothing including jeans. Sally was embarrassed once more before joining her in changing. They picked out swimsuits for today\u2019s adventures and Maria joined them in this a few minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey descended down the stairs, narrowly dodging a bundle of cuteness who was foolishly sleeping on one of the steps and grabbed a light breakfast before departing for the beach. As they walked out the house, the bus-stop came into view and they waited for the next one to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey waited for fifteen minutes and Sally started to get really impatient. Christine wasn\u2019t much better. <i>What\u2019s taking so long\u2026</i> A bus suddenly appeared from around the corner and stopped to let them on. There was only five or so people other than them and the driver in the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter paying for the ticket, they sat down on the closest seats and started giggling about how fun the sleepover was. The bus shot past the blonde scientist, Diane\u2019s car which was going in the opposite direction. Diane ended up having to go home without any fruits thanks to the unexpected update and had only just woken up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine had a slightly grim expression on her face as several thoughts ran through her mind. <i>Should I tell Sally about\u2026That? What if she doesn\u2019t trust me for hiding it? I don\u2019t want to think about it. That dark era. The nightmarish memories embedded in my mind from that body\u2026 I don\u2019t want to be that. I don\u2019t even want to think about it. I\u2019m Christine\u2026 Right\u2026?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally noticed Christine\u2019s distraught appearance and gave her a big hug. She didn\u2019t know what was going on, but she wanted to help her friend. Christine said, \u201cSorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Sally replied. The two hugged for several minutes before they stopped and returned to their usual happy mood. They were really looking forward to swimming around, especially Sally who was curious as to how it would feel with her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the bus reached the half-way point, it stopped outside a fairly ordinary bus stop. Two people departed and a sinister looking teenager got on-board. He glanced at a scrawny kid sitting at the back and a smug expression rose to his face. <i>Not another one of these\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swaggered over to the back and feigned surprise as he said, \u201cHaha. To think that I\u2019d see you here. What a coincidence,\u201d the scrawny kid cowered in terror. This only served to stoke the flames of his arrogance and sense of superiority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m taking a trip to the beach today. I assume you are too? Haha. How convenient. I\u2019ll have a lot of fun with you there. We need someone to act as our slave after-all,\u201d he said as he sat down next to him. The kid descending further into terror. <i>I can\u2019t let him do this. What to do\u2026 Ah!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine fired up the device. Time stopped as always, but she saw something strange, \u201cUpdate Complete. You now have more control over what specific swaps do.\u201d <i>Update Complete? They added new features? Ehehe, this should be fun.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine noted a little girl sitting with her mother at the front of the bus, and found the perfect thing to swap with the bully. She selected the desire to wear the girliest clothes imaginable, noticing additional options pop-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I could either make it so that he\u2019s always done that. Or\u2026 I could make it so that he\u2019s suddenly decided that he wants to do it. I\u2019ll choose the second, it\u2019s more exciting that way, especially with how confused he and his friends will be, ehehe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime returned to normal, and Sally whispered to Christine, \u201cWhat did you give him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see very soon, ehehe,\u201d Christine said. The bully looked down at his outfit in disgust, unable to understand how he could have ever liked wearing such a disgusting set of clothing. He couldn\u2019t wait for the bus to arrive at the beach, so he could buy a pink bikini and a matching dress.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The bus screeched to a halt outside of a bus stop with countless people wandering the streets outside. The three girls excitedly descended down the steps and they shot towards the beach while the swapped bully headed into a small clothes store with his minion trailing behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stepped into the clothes store where he pulled the guy into the woman\u2019s section and he had a look of despair on his face. <i>Oh no, he\u2019s not going to humiliate me further by making me wear a dress, is he? Just when I thought it couldn\u2019t get any worse. Why me? How could I have such terrible luck to run into him of all people on the bus?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was even more shocked when the bully started trying the dresses and bikinis on himself, but he didn\u2019t dare laugh, otherwise he\u2019d have to say goodbye to his teeth. The bully sneered at him in disgust at how \u2018terrible\u2019 the bullied kid\u2019s clothes were, so he left him alone expecting him to be absolutely humiliated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter trying on dresses in several colours, he grabbed a pink bikini, tried it on and paid for it before putting it back on. A bulge visible in the lower portion and his rippling muscles visible on the upper body. <i>What the hell is going on?! He\u2019d never be caught dead in something like that. And he was sneering at me in disgust the whole time. That\u2019s what I should be doing!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shopkeeper naturally showed understanding for the boy\u2019s unusual hobbies, she understood that there weren\u2019t many who had the courage and confidence to embrace their inner desires like he did. Many would be too scared for strangers laughing and sneering at them, but not this boy. She was even impressed by how indifferent he was to it, as if wearing it was something that everyone did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, if it was someone like Sally who was actually into that, even in her previous inferior state, then it would be understandable, but this guy would have been appalled at the thought of doing something like that the hour before. Alas, that\u2019s the power of the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked out into the streets, walking in an extremely masculine manner which contrasted with the pink bikini covering a tiny portion of his body. It was so eye-catching that everyone in the street turned and looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hushed voices commented on it, while those who blatantly mocked him earned a punch in the voice knocking out several teeth. No one dared to do so after that first example, as he began to say, \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with these people? Are they blind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bullied kid was naturally smart enough to stay silent, even after he voiced the question and he was slowly beginning to feel more humiliated by hanging around someone in that outfit than the fact that he was being forced to act as his slave for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe marched into the beach where he saw various cute girls running around including Christine and Sally. Christine curiously looked over at him for an instant, inwardly praising herself for how the crowd was sneering at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally felt a little bad for a cross-dresser being mocked, but then she reminded herself that it\u2019s his punishment and that he was never like that to begin with and started inwardly laughing too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine grabbed some ice-cream from one of the stands, savouring the taste. The delicious taste of vanilla spreading throughout her mouth. She was still in her casual wear, as she hadn\u2019t had a chance to change yet, especially since she wanted a front row seat to the show which would unfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite not having a device, Maria was also curious about this guy wearing a bikini clearly showing his muscular frame and bulge. He assertively walked forward as if he was the ruler of the world to a congregation of other boys who were shocked at how he was dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid he lose a bet or something?\u201d one muttered to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably,\u201d the other muttered. They didn\u2019t dare say it at a higher volume, as they didn\u2019t want to rub it in and earn themselves a punch in the face each. Little did they know that he chose to wear it and was loving every second of it minus the people who he thought was mocking him for no reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys pretended that things were perfectly normal with an awkward expression on their faces. They looked behind him and jumped on something to change the topic saying, \u201cI see that idiot is with you. A slave, I\u2019m guessing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I ran into him on the bus,\u201d he said while adjusting his bikini top which was flat over his hairy chest. He continued, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go pick up some girls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two had extremely awkward expressions on their faces, normally he would have no trouble doing so, but with an outfit like that it would be a miracle if they found one, or so they thought. They nodded regardless and went with him to a couple of 18 year olds with highly developed bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started saying his usual lines and was shocked to see when they weren\u2019t working as well as usual. The two girls looking at him in disgust, giving him a prompt refusal and retreating from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved onto Christine\u2019s Group as Christine was incredible in her own right, when she decided that she didn\u2019t want to deal with him. She fired up the device, making him decide that he now likes muscular men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at Christine again and decided that she wasn\u2019t attractive in the slightest. He was confused, as she looked incredible a few seconds ago but brushed it off and scanned around the beach for a new target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shot towards a bodybuilder and started making out with him. His friends were utterly horrified at this, but they still forced themselves to think that it was some sort of bet. Or was it? They were beginning to question it themselves, but they wouldn\u2019t jump to conclusions until they investigated it back at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was coincidentally the exact same school which Christine and the other two girls go to, but this was only natural as it was a fairly big school in Christine\u2019s area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bodybuilder wasn\u2019t too amused at his attire or at him assuming that he was into men and gave him a solid rejection. The bully naturally didn\u2019t dare to tangle with a bodybuilder, so he immediately retreated right away. He was confused as to why no one found him attractive anymore. Didn\u2019t they treat him like a god in the past? What could have happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this moment where he heard someone shouting, \u201cThere he is!\u201d and several police officers ran up to him accompanied to one of the people whose teeth he knocked out. They pinned him down and dragged him to the police car still wearing his pink bikini and holding a bag holding various dresses. They looked down on him in disgust and sped off towards the police station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine giggled as the car took him away and she found a place to change in with the other two girls. She removed her casual wear and slipped on her bikini. The other two did the same. They threw their original clothes in the bag before heading out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally felt extremely exposed in these clothes, she thought that she had gotten used to it after the swimming classes, but that was mainly because she was dealing with people who she was already familiar with for the most part. This time, she was surrounded by countless strangers. Some of whom looked at the three girls, especially Christine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the sensation of the soft sands under her feet and felt the light wind flow over her exposed areas. As she got used to it, she began to realise that she really enjoyed this and her time at the beach had only just began.</span></div></div>",

You now have more control over what specific swaps do.\u201d  Update Complete?  They added new features? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine noted a little girl of about four years old sitting with her mother at the front of the bus.  She was going to swap the girls desire to wear extremely girly apparel, but looking at the girl's expression and the stern look on her mother's face, Christine decided that it wasn't the girl's idea to wear such a girly outfit.  She suspected the girl would prefer to wear some leggings and a t-shirt so she could play, but her mother had commanded her to wear what she was wearing.  So instead you swapped the relationship of the girl and the bully with her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother seeing what was going on, commanded, \"Johnathan Lester Wright, what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bully whose name you now knew as Johnathan turned when he heard 'his mother's' command.  \"I'm not doing anything,\" he said sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't lie to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just talking to my friend here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnathan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just...uh uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were trying to bully that boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnathan what have I told you about bullying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it was wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to apologize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to me, to the boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to the boy Johnathan said in a small voice, \"I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\" the mother reminded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for trying to bully you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and it'll never happen again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good now come sit next to Mommy,\"  Johnathan complied.  Continuing, \"Johnathan, this has all got to stop.  It has gone on long enough, but it has to stop now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise I won't do it again,\" Johnathan said plaintively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No not just that, everything.  From now on, you are going to act like a proper young lady.  I am going to see to it.\"  What Johnathan's new mother meant was that he was going to make him act like a proper four year old young lady should act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be good, I promise.  But don't do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's too late.  There are going to be a lot of changes.  The first thing we will do, is to fix your hair.  I'm going to take you to the stylist.  They will add extensions to your hair until it grows naturally.  I am also going to color it blonde and braid it into proper pig tails or something more appropriate for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want....\"  The mother's stern look quieted Johnathan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will get them and you will like then too!\" the mother demanded.  Then a little more quieter almost to herself she said, \"and look at those clothes.  They are just awful.  Even for a boy.  But from now on you won't be wearing pants again.  It's dresses for you from now on.\"  Johnathan wanted to say something but he knew better than to interrupt his mother.  \"You and I are going to be spending an awful lot of time together.  I have so much to teach you.....and your first lesson is how to sit.  A young lady sits with her legs crossed.\"  Johnathan crossed his legs like a boy would.  \"No not like that,\"  then she instructed him how to sit like a young lady.  This was very uncomfortable for Johnathan on a way that it wouldn't have been for the woman's 'real' daughter since unlike her, Johnathan had a penis and testicles between his hips.  But when she put him into the proper sitting position, Johnathan didn't move no matter how much it hurt.  \"Better,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother started to criticize everything Johnathan did to make him conform to what she thought a proper four year old young lady should be.  Several stops later, the mother lead Johnathan off the bus, they had found the exit to her hair salon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Then braid it into pig tails and tie them off with a pink ribbon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attendant thought that the woman was overbearing and shouldn't treat her son like that, but the woman was the customer and so she kept silent.  \"I can do that,\" is all that the attendant said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnathan tried to speak for himself, \"but I don't want to have pig tails,\" the boy whined.

His mother gave Johnathan another stern look which cowed the boy for a second.  \"But, but..\" the boy continued when his mother looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop whining, or I'll give you something to whine about,' the mother told him.  Johnathan was as helpless as the woman's former four year old daughter.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After school, Christine decided to visit Mark to see how his life had changed.  Christine went to his home in the 'good part of town.'  There she saw his large lovely home in a gated community.  It was in  fact very impressive.  Christine rang the door bell and soon the door was opened by one of the domestic help that keep the place running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, I am here to see Mark,\" Christine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who may I say is calling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Christine, I am a friend from Mark's school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine was led to Mark's room.  Christine noticed Mark's mother sitting in the den watching some TV.  When she got to Marks' room the door was closed.  The 'maid' knocked on the door and then entered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shameka, what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone to see you sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show her in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine was about to enter the room when she thought, wouldn't it be great, if Mark's name was Shemeka?  By the time she had entered, that was his name.  Shemeka was messaging his boyfriend.  \"What do you want?\" Shemeka said rudely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine entered Shemeka's room.  She had never been here before, but she assumed it had changed a lot.  The decor was a mixture of a highly girlie room with closets full of dresses and all sorts of feminine finery and a toddler's room with supplies for little babies including diapers and toddler toys.  There were posters of hunky boys on the walls that were painted in bright babyish colors.  But despite all this there were still elements that a teenaged boy lived here too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shemeka, I was wondering how you were.  I mean with being pregnant and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do.  I really do.  I know it must be tough to carry a baby at your age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh carrying it is noting.  But when the little poop machine is born that will be another thing.  The servants will probably be doing most of the work.\"  Christine realized that Mark now Shemeka had no maternal instincts at all.  She didn't think that would be good for the baby, so Christine swapped all of Shemeka's mother's maternal instincts with Shemeka.  Christine didn't think she had too much judging by the way that Mark turned out.  But it was still better than it was.  Shemeka's attitude changed immediately.  He was suddenly looking forward to having his baby.  Continuing he said, \"I am going to start looking for the things I need.  My baby will stay in here with me for at least six months.  I want him close.  I'm going to have to buy a crib and a playpen and all sorts of things for the baby.  I am goign to have a baby shower in a few months.  Can you come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of it'll be great.  I don't have many female friends.  I want you to come.\"  Shemeka in reality didn't have any girl friends.  Being a bully who had no interest in girls sexually anymore he didn't have much use for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Christine said.  She wasn't sure if she wanted to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think about it.  I'll be right back.\"   Shemeka then used the walkie talkie feature on his phone.  \"Mark,\" he said talking into the device, \"I made a stinky.  I need a new dypee.\"  A minute later, Mark walked in.  She followed Shemeka into the bathroom and closed the door.  Before the door closed Christine saw a large changing table.  It seems that although Shemeka changed his own diapers when he was in public, at home Shemeka had his servants change him.  Christine saw how hard the domestic servants worked at Shemeka's house.maybe she should help them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once you got home you were free to do whatever you wanted, you went upstairs with Karen and Changed out of school clothes, your wardrobe now filled with Kate's clothes meant you changed into a summer dress as opposed to Your usual t-shirt and jeans combo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex and Karen headed downstairs to find that Kate and Amanda were bugging your mum to play a game with them, they kept on asking to either play house or to play dress up. Then Amanda spotted you and asked \"do you guys want to join in?\"</span></div></div>",

Kate took a place at the center of the room and begun explaining how it would work \"so, Karen will be the mum, Alex and mum will be the 7 year olds and Amanda and i will be the 16 year olds!\". You took Karen aside for a minute \"so my plan is to swap everyone's personality and clothes to match who we're meant to be, and you will be mum so you can be the safety net in case something goes wrong\". Amanda nodded \"sounds good, it'll be interesting to see you act like a 7 year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex walked back into the room and then Kate asked \"so is everyone ready?\", to which everyone nodded \"alright then pretend\". As she said the word pretend Alex and Karen paused time with their PAIDs and begun to swap things around so that everybody had the clothes and personality of who they were meant to be. As time resumed Alex looked at his mum with excitement and said \"hey we should play dress up\" Then Alex and Elizabeth ran off to Kate's room, meanwhile Kate and Amanda simply walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren felt weird she had never swapped before and even though she had only swapped personalities and clothes she felt weird, she knew that she had to be the safety net in case anything goes wrong. After a few seconds Karen got bored and decided to do housework as she found that somewhat meditative now, as she entered Kate's room she saw Alex and Elizabeth wearing princess dresses and sitting at a tiny table pretending to have a tea party. Later she passed by Alex's room and saw Amanda and Kate doing homework together while talking about school mainly gossip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren wondered how long this was meant to last it was 3:30pm now maybe she'll get everyone to swap back at 5pm?</span></div></div>",

Knowing you still had to finish getting ready, you grab some of your makeup supplies and head into the bathroom. You never realize that you hadn't had them before. After finishing up, you head back to your room to grab your backpack and your cheerleading uniform since you had practice after school.</span></div></div>",

You didn't see any obvious changes to her, aside from the fact that she seemed to be walking differently. You shrugged your shoulders and skipped down the hallway. You only realized that you were skipping when you were halfway down the hallway, at which point you stopped in surprise. A large grin goes across your face. You are amazed by how natural acting this way feels. You know that you should be more concerned about this, but you really aren't. You assume that your now happy-go-lucky attitude is because of the swap. You don't really mind: you like the way you feel.

You felt genuinely sad now, and you were really angry at your mom when you lashed out at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom says, \"Thank you. Now go take care of the trash.\" She then bends over and kisses your forehead. You feel much better, and let out an involuntary giggle.<br>\r\nYou pick up the trash and take it out. \"This is heavy,\" you say, even though no one was there.

Better than she would for an ordinary trip to the mall, but not so dressy as she would for a serious night time date.  It was a balancing act.  This was her third date with her new boyfriend.  She wanted to be pretty but not too suggestive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou envied Stephanie's dating life.  You hadn't dated much.  True you and Karen were sort of boyfriend/girlfriend but even though you have known her forever it really wasn't serious.  You wanted more, but you didn't want to ruin the friendship.  It was complicated.  But Stephanie had had many dates and boyfriends in her life.  They would come and go and you envied how she could fall in love so easily.  She also seemed to be having allot of fun even in the relationships that didn't last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour new lack of maturity meant many things had changed in your personality.  It wasn't just that you liked to skip down the hall.  The biggest things were that you was now much more impulsive and less concerned with the implications of your actions.  This is why children had to be watched all the time and would run out into the street after a thrown ball.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour envy caught up with you when you thought how come she goes on so many dates and you didn't.  You took out your PAID and swapped \"Relationships\" with Stephanie.  You meant that it would make your relationship with Karen become more serious, but you didn't think it through.  Now it was you who had a date.  (You also had all of  Stephanie's friends instead of your own.)  Your clothes changed subtly.  You were now wearing better quality clothes.  You weren't wearing a suit for your date, but you were wearing dress pants, a button down shirt and dress shoes with black socks.  You are also carrying your bear.  It is your favorite and you take it everywhere even on your dates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie was dressed more casually since she didn't have a date anymore.  She hadn't had any plans at all.  Stephanie's answer to \"Whatcha doin?\" changed, to a simple \"Nothing.\"  Now it was you who had the date to prepare for and you were unconcerned about what Stephanie was doing.  You decide to brush your teeth again, your mouth couldn't be too fresh when your date picked you up.  You expected him to be here soon, but even though you was ready you would make the boy wait.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your lack of maturity you was even more excited about your date than Stephanie would be.  The problem is that you really weren't mature enough now for any date with anyone (man or woman.)  But you didn't care.  You had even forgotten that you had swapped maturities with the real Amanda.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Cindy doesn't know why you and her are friends.  You really have little in common, even though your dating Phillip your still a guy.  You are very immature, she has to watch out for you when you are together.  In fact you are so immature that your mom has to hire babysitters when you are alone to watch you.  Fortunately none of your friends is also your babysitter.  But for some reason you are friends and that is it.  Such was the power of the PAID.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe its because you get all the cute guys (as Stephanie used to) and so Cindy could get your overflow.  On the other hand, these straight guys didn't know why they were attracted to an immature boy like you, but they couldn't help it.  They would take you out and spend good money on you.  Unlike with 'your friends', these guys didn't have much in common with Stephanie either, but that wasn't why they were asking her out.  To be truthful, the guys had more to talk about with the immature you then to the normal Stephanie who was very much a girlie girl whose life revolved around fashion and daytime TV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty soon, Phillip had arrived.  Even though you were dying to see him, you made him wait...maybe thirty seconds.  Stephanie would had had him wait at least five minutes.  You rush down to greet him when you couldn't stand the waiting and hug him chastely showering him with kisses much like a little girl who  was running into her daddy's arms.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready for our date,\" you tell him.</span></div></div>",

Matt then gives you a kiss on the cheek as you were about to leave and he reminds you again of your curfew.  The curfew time didn't change only it was now Matt who was going to enforce it.  You didn't think you would have much trouble if you missed your curfew with Matt so you told him \"Sure.\" and you left with Phillip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhillip took you out to a nice restaurant.  You picked something out of the kids menu and he ordered a steak for himself.  While the food was being prepared, Phillip told you about what he was up to.  He was bragging actually.  But more disturbing to you, he kept putting his hand on your knee no matter how many times you made it obvious that you didn't like it there.  Even though you had the body of a young man, the maturity of a seven-year-old and were carrying a teddybear Phillip still had the same 'relationship' with you that he had with Stephanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had had enough of Phillip with his roaming hands and other things so to make him stop you pointed the PAID at him and a nine-year-old who was at the next table.  You swapped \"Personalities\" with them and soon as time resumed, Phillip had no interest in your knee anymore.  He was more interested in coloring with some crayons that the boy had originally had.  With your lowered maturity you also found coloring fun.  But now that Phillip wasn't touching you, you still thought that he needed to be punished for what he had done before.  So you took out the PAID again and swapped Phillip's body with the one of the pretty waitress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress after the swap looked like all the other employees.  Even though her male body was still wearing panties and a bra (whose cups had deflated to accommodate her flat chest) she was wearing a button down black shirt with dress pants that looked normal on her despite her sex change.  Phillip didn't look too odd in is attire either although he did need a bra to support his now slightly sagging tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, you and Phillip went to a movie.  With your lowered maturity and Phillip's new personality picking a movie that you could both agree with was pretty easy.  You had no problem arriving home before curfew was up since Phillip had no longer any plans to keep you out late for some alone time in his car.  He didn't even walk you to the door.  You entered your house and Matt was waiting up for you.  He asked how it went and you said fine and then up to your room for the rest of the evening.</span></div></div>",

She was kicking herself for not being prepared with a panty liner since she knew it was about time, but in the confusion of having to change into her own clothes she had forgotten about it.  She went up to the bathroom to deal with her menstral problem.  She had a choice to make, she could use a normal maxipad.  But if she did that she would have to fold her penis under her body so that the blood would flow the right way.  Or she could use a tampon.  The PAID had changed reality so that for Matt a tampon was similar to a maxipad except it was encased in plastic and went around the penis.  It made a water tight seal.  Tampons were harder to put on, but once on, they were more comfortable than a maxipad and you could wear them when exercising or swimming.  She decided to just wear a maxipad since she was in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she got it on, she looked in the mirror and realized she didn't have a drop of makeup on.  Matt spent the rest of the time before leaving to pick up her husband applying makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Elizabeth was finishing up her homework.  It didn't take him too long.

But something seemed wrong to him.  He looked at himself in a full length mirror.  He thought he looked fine.  There was some makeup on his face.  \"Hey where did that come from?\" he thought.  But other than that he looked fine.  But what about the blood he saw, something must be wrong down there.  His mom didn't believe him and he couldn't tell anyone else.  But it was gone now.  \"Was he really OK?\"  He wasn't sure.  He decided to try something.  He had to make sure he was like all the other boys.  What he would do the first chance he got with one of his friends.  He would play a game of \"If you sure me yours, I\"ll show you mine.\"  If they looked the same then he would know everything is perfectly fine.  With this plan in mind, he went into the other bathroom to clean off the makeup off his face.</span></div></div>",

God knows what. Do you realize you could go blind doing that? And on top of everything I catch you with my clothes on. Do you care to explain that.? Elizabeth felt terrible. he had no idea why he was dressed like his mom. He was the meeker of Matt's children very shy and sensitive. Elizabeth could feel the humiliation raise like a bubble in his throat. And though he didn't want to he began to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThats when Matt started to feel bad for yelling at him.

She had allot to think about and didn't want to talk or argue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized that she had overreacted when it came to what she saw Elizabeth doing.  All boys do that, she just hadn't expected it at his age.  Elizabeth was only ten.  \"Shesh kids are starting younger and younger these days.\" Matt thought.  Plus he was a boy and boys did it more than girls, especially when young.  Matt had been using a vibrator when making love with Steven for quite some time, but she didn't do it alone.  She thought about it sometimes, but had enough control to stop.  But this was besides the point.  What Matt had to do was talk to Steven and have him talk to Elizabeth.  She didn't know if it had to be a birds and the bees talk or just a talk about masturbation.  \"Were these the same talk?\" she thought, but she just didn't know.  Besides it was Steven's problem.  Steven didn't give her any advice when she had to talk to her girls when it came to feminine issues.  Steven quite frankly didn't want to know anything about it and so Matt would take the same attitude when it came to talking to Elizabeth on such matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they got to the pickup point.  Both Matt and Elizabeth got out of the car to wait.  Steven was about quickly.  Steven gave Matt a kiss on the lips.  Matt had to stand on her tiptoes and Steven had to bend way down but it wasn't too much trouble.  Steven then mussed Elizabeth's hair.  They all got into the car and drove towards home.  Steven was doing the driving.  Matt was in the passenger seat and Elizabeth was in the back.  Steven knew Matt well enough that he knew she wanted to talk about something.  He also knew that she wanted to talk about it in private.  He could tell all that just from the expression Matt had on his face.  Since they couldn't talk about whatever it was now, small talk was exchanged between the people in the car as the made their way home.</span></div></div>",

She needed to remind Mandy to have that talk with Elizabeth, but that could wait until after dinner. Elizabeth had been such a good boy that Matt did not want to ruin the evening and she would talk to Mandy about it more tonight in bed. Right now Matt had to make sure her family had a good dinner. \"Now what to cook?\" Matt thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy's view<br>\r\nMandy was in the living room watching the basketball game. Even though she did not understand the game at all she felt a weird desire to watch it. Another thing that was weird was that she felt like getting a beer out of the fridge. As a matter of fact she was going to do that right now. So she got up out of her Laz-boy and walked into the kitchen. She patted Matt's behind and she turned and smiled at her. Then she walked over and popped open a cold brew. \"Hmmm that will make the game better.\" She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth's view<br>\r\nElizabeth was so worried. His mom caught him with with his hands in his pants and  he wanted to start behaving so that she would forget. So far it seemed to be paying off, ever since they got home she has not mentioned anything about the incident. \"Elizabeth could you go and start asking everyone what they would like to drink for dinner?\" Elizabeth perked up as he heard his mother ask him to help out. \"Yes ma'am\" replied Elizabeth as he walked out of the kitchen looking for the others in his family. \"Thank you sweetie.\" Matt said in her pleased mother voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven's view<br>\r\nMeanwhile Steven was upstairs and getting ready to call Karen. She was so excited to try out the PAID. \"This device could really change up my family, heck it could do more than that.\" Steven thought to herself. \"But I better make sure Karen is here so that she can help me if I can't remember if anything is not right\". With that Steven picked up the phone and dialed Karen's number. Since the PAID had changed reality Karen did not think it was weird that a 40 year old man was calling her. She willingly came over and told Steven she had been experimenting with her own PAID and that she had some really good ideas to try out with her. She told Steven she would be over in 15 minutes. which meant Steven's family might be in the middle of dinner. This could be a great opportunity Steven thought.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

You hadn't pushed it, it was done by accident, but it had obviously worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went to the door and let Karen in.  Karen was Steven's best friend.  They had been friends for what seems forever.  They were closer than best friends, they were more like sisters which was more accurate with all the relationship swaps that had occurred.  Steven excused himself and Karen and Steven went to Steven's room.  Matt told Steven to finish up quickly before his dinner got cold.  Steven assured him it would only take a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it and it worked,\" Steven said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not quite sure, but it worked and when I hit the 'Reset' button.\"  Steven didn't say anything about dropping the PAID. \"Everything returned to normal as you can see.\"  It was true everything seemed perfectly normal to Karen.

You can also make some changes of your own and I'll go back to your house and see if anyone notices.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a great idea.  You can put up with my family, especially my sister Stephanie, she has always been acting weird.\"  Alex, when he was Amanda had switched his social life with Stephanie as you recall.

She was eating what was left of the dinner that was put in front of her but her mind was more occupied with what she could do.  Elizabeth (her supposed brother) and then Mandy (her new dad) finished dinner and left the table leaving her and Karen (her Mom the former Matt) at the table.  Since Matt had been serving the meal, it took her longer to actually eat it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren decided to make one more 'TINY' change just to see if Steven would notice when he returned the next day.  Karen was going to swap 'Lives' with Matt.  \"Why not,\" she thought, \"we had already switched names.\"  It would be fun being the mom.  She also wondered if Steven would notice the difference.  She also wondered if Steven noticed what she had done to her own family.  Karen was a bit disappointed that Steven had returned everything to normal before she got here.  She wondered if she could notice the changes that Steven had made.  She thought she would be able to see the changes with Steven's family as clearly as she had seen the changes that she made to her own family.  Karen took out the PAID and made the 'Life' swap with Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had worked.  She was the mom of the family now.  Matt (now Karen) left the table.  Karen started to take the dishes to the kitchen to wash them.  Karen thought to herself, \"Maybe I should have made the switch after the dishes were done and everything put away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she realized...  \"Karen, Elizabeth get down here,\" Karen shouted.  A few moments later her 'kids' had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Mom.\" Elizabeth said.  Matt said \"What do you want,\"  at about the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me clean up the table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I have to?\" Matt said first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder her breath Karen said, \"Would you two like to be old people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Elizabeth and Matt said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, you had better help me if you know what is good for you.\"  Karen used the voice she had heard her mom use on her millions of times.  This voice always worked, because she knew her mom was serious and she was too.  Although that old people crack was more of an inside joke.  Soon all the dishes were cleared and cleaned and the table was reset.  Karen went up into the master bedroom and found Mandy there.  He was already dressed for bed in Spiderman pajamas   He was drawing in a coloring book with his crayons courtesy of his lowered maturity.  Karen got dressed for bed and climbed into bed next to him.  She picked up the book that Elizabeth had been reading before all this started.  It was marked at where Elizabeth had gotten to.  Karen feigned reading it when in reality she was just too excited to see if Steven would notice the changes she made when she saw him tomorrow.</span></div></div>",

Shit,Shower, and Shave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThan Karen went downstairs to start breakfast for her new family. Again Elizabeth's maternal instincts took over and Karen had bacon, eggs, coffee ready for the \"morning rush\" which is what Elizabeth used to call it. Than Karen(Matt is her name now) went to each cild's room and woke them up.<br>\r\nShe went into Elizabeth's room first and shook her awake. Elizabeth was the easiest to get up, and she was the hungriest, since being a growing boy and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThan she went into Karen's room and got her up. Karen took a little while longer and told Matt that she no longer needed her mother to wake her since she had an alarm clock. This was the usual disagreement between the mother and the daughter before the PAID came into the picture. It was odd how, even though so manny changes have occurred some things stayed the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Karen(Matt) made her way downstairs to serve herself and her new family breakfast the phone rang. Karen went to pick it up and heard a familiar voice coming from it. \"Hey, girl how's your morning going?\" It was Steven but he sounded different and Karen couldn't put her finger on what was different. For some odd reason Karen felt compelled to call him Lori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Lori you know the same old same old.\" Karen responded but than a faint and fading thought was in the back of her head. Wasn't Lori my mom's name? But than a stronger thought came to her. How could Lori be my mother's name when my mom lives an hour away from here. Of course that would have been true except it was Elizabeth's mother who lived an hour away.<br>\r\n\"Well I was thinking if you are not doing anything today maybe we could slip out and do some shopping and maybe use the PAID.\" Lori(Steven) said. Karen(Matt) thought for awhile and responded.\"That sounds great Lori about what time?\" Than Steven(Lori) said, \"Let me get my crew sent off and I will come pick you up around 10:30.\" \"Sounds great.\" Karen replied and hung up the phone.<br>\r\nKaren was so excited memories of Lori and her shopping rushed through her head. These were not really her memories, but Elizabeths. Than Karen thought how normal everything seemed and couldn't wait to see her best friend.</span></div></div>",

Karen had wanted to play with the PAID, but the day before her mother, Susan had made the girls (Stephanie, Karen and Alex [the former Amanda] visit their grandmother. Lori at the home.  This irked Karen something fierce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the family irked Karen.  Things had changed.  Zack who used to be Alex's twenty-year-old brother when this all began was now Karen's brother.  But she didn't know there was a sibling switch between Zack and Matt.  The twenty-year-old Zack who was a college student now had some 'weird' passtimes.  Some days after classes at the local college he would have to rush to the high school.  He was on the cheerleading team and wore the female cheerleading uniform.  But he was one of the strongest of the girls who were at the bottom of the pyramid.  Other days he went to girl scouts.  He was in the Daisy group with girls who were between four and seven.  Once a week he was part of a book club where he drank coffee and ate cakes with women in their thirties.  He had a very busy schedule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren's grandma Lori was now Karen's mother and she was in great health mentally and physically.  Whereas, Karen's real mother, Susan was living at the nursing home.  She is in worse shape mentally than Lori ever was.  Susan doesn't recognize anybody around her and she is kept in special clothes to keep her from removing them at inappropriate moments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie, who had the old Alex's social life, was quite obvious in her new feelings toward Karen.  When Alex had this feeling Karen could manipulate him, but now that Stephanie has these feelings, Karen just finds them annoying.  When Stephanie left the home, she was dressed like an elderly man.  She wore a button down male shirt with some brown slacks and brown lace-up male shoes with black socks.  But this was fine since Stephanie sexy nineteen-year-old curvy female body also had a saggy penis that had once belong to a man approaching his eighties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren's annoying younger sister Alex (whose name used to be Amanda) despite being a seven-year-old had volunteered to be a candy-striper  at the home.  She works there five days a week after school and so she isn't in Karen's hair anymore.  In fact she was still doing her shift at the home when Steven arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven didn't recognize any of these changes.  So he swapped lives and bodies with Lori who he thought was Karen's mom but was really her grandmother.  Steven now had the body of a woman in her seventies but had had the health of a woman over thirty years younger.  He also had the responsibilities of a single mother although oddly enough he played basketball sometimes with the boys at the local college once a week.  As it turned out tonight was the night and so Steven left to play basketball with his or was it hers or was it his again friends at the college gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, Steven decided to phone.  \"Hey, girl how's your morning going?\" he said.</span></div></div>",

Going through the menu system she had found Zack's past times and hobbies.  She decided it would be very funny to switch them with each of the other girls in the family.  The first thing that Karen switches was Zack's steady evening game of basketball with his friends with Susan's (Karen's mom) weekend bookclub meeting.  The next thing she switched was Zack's part time job at the garage with Stephanie's cheerleading practices.  Finally, Karen switched Zack's interest in fantasy football with Alex's interest in girl scouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack's schedule was still busy but with new things.  Such as when he went to girl scouts.  Today at girl scouts, Zack and the other young girls were going to make cat masks.  Zack cut out the shape of a cat face from a piece of thick white paper.  Then he attached pipe cleaners for whiskers.  He then colored the face in with crayons to his taste and then finally added sparkles to make the face look exotic.  The last step was to staple an elastic string to the back so it would stay on his face.  Zack and all the girls enjoyed this activity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs each mask was completed, the scout would put it on their face and then get down on all fours and start acting like a cat.  They would crawl around on hands and knees and meow at each other and act very cat like.  This is how Zack spent a day doing one of his new activities.</span></div></div>",

Since Amanda didn't have a clear idea of what swapping a life would mean the life swap wasn't perfect.  This is why the clothing wasn't swapped as part of the life swap and why Matt and Elizabeth had become related when they never really were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Elizabeth was doing his homework, Matt went to her bathroom to put on some makeup.  She wasn't going to put on anything special, just some lipstick, blush and a little eye shadow.  Something she had been wearing everyday for years and years.  But something didn't seem right to her.  Shouldn't she already be wearing her daily makeup?  How had she gotten into Elizabeth's clothes to begin with?  Something was very strange.  She put it out of her mind and finished putting things in the hamper and then separating the clothing for the wash she was going to do after dinner.  Since she was busy she hadn't any time to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon it was time to go pick up Steven.  Steven's car was in the shop so she had to pick him up from the train station.  She took Elizabeth with her.  Elizabeth got into the back seat and Matt took her place in front of the steering wheel.  While driving Matt's mind went blank as she drove on autopilot towards the train station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt bothered her that she had been wearing Elizabeth's clothes.  She didn't know how she had gotten into Elizabeth's clothes.  \"Wait,\" she thought, \"she had called it Matt's clothes.  But she is Matt.  It is Elizabeth who is her son.... Isn't that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her head she tried to piece together what is what.  She started with the basics.  \"My name is Matt.  That is a fact.  I am a 43 year old woman.\"  She looked into the rear view mirror to see her face.  She saw Matt's ten-year-old boys face looking back at her and she was satisfied that that was her.  Moving on she thought, \"OK that is right, I am a wife and mother.  My husband is Steven.\"  This is fine since this is who she was about to pick up.  \"My children are Zack, Mandy and Kate....Wait, but isn't Elizabeth my son?  No Elizabeth is Angela's son along with her two daughters Alex and Karen.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this realization the damn broke.  She looked at the clothes she was wearing and she noticed that even though they fit her she wore a bra but her chest was flat.  She looked at the crotch of the pants she was wearing an noticed the slight bulge of her prepubescent penis.  It was small but it was there.  It should be flat she is a woman.   She looked at the rear view mirror again and then she noticed something wrong there too.  It was clearly her face, but it wasn't the face of a grown woman.  It was the face of a young boy.  She looked at Elizabeth through the mirror and could clearly see him as he was.  He was dressed like a little boy but he was clearly a grown woman.  It dawned on her that she should look like him not like a little boy.  She then pulled over the car as soon as she could.  Something is very wrong and she had to get to the bottom of it.  Then some of her old memories (those of when she was Matt the ten-year-old boy) returned to her.  She wasn't sure if she was a grown woman or a ten-year-old boy.</span></div></div>",

Matt didn't notice that she had gotten out in not such a nice part of town.  Matt was too busy with her problems.  A few hundred feet ahead of them a man in his mid-fifties had also stopped.  He saw a young 'lady' of about eighteen and the way she was dressed, he knew just what she wanted.  She headed for his open passenger side window.  It was at this moment when time stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen time resumed, Harold told Arias to get back into the car.  They had to get going if they wanted to be on time to pick up Harold's husband Steven.  Harold, a fifty-seven year old man, got back into the drivers seat of Elizabeth's car.  He was wearing a business suit, with a dress shirt and tie.  Before all this started, Harold was a successful business man who was having a mid-life crisis.  He was very successful but he had been thinking \"is this all that life is?\"  So he bought an expensive, flashy car and developed some new habits which included picking up hookers.  But that is now Elizabeth's life, Harold is now a wife and mother on her way to pick up his husband at the train station.  Harold didn't know why he stopped the car in the first place, especially (now that he looked around) at such a run down part of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArias got into the car with Harold.  Arias' body and clothing hadn't changed just like Harold's, but her entire life had changed.  She didn't have the life of a nineteen year-old prostitute anymore.  Despite what she looked like and how she would continue to dress, she thought of herself as a ten-year-old boy.  She was wearing a faux-leather minidress that would have barely covered her panties, if she had worn any today.  The dress had a full length zipper that made it easy to take off and put back on if the need arose.  But the dress was so short that she used to be able to service her clients without taking it off.  The only other clothes that she wore were a pair of five inch stilletto pumps.  As they drove off to pick up Steven, Arias opened her purse and fetched some red hot lipstick and refreshened her lips as they drove off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn their respective homes, the clothing of Harold, Arias, Elizabeth and Matt had  been swapped.  No one noticed the change though.  In the morning, Arias would be returning to the fifth-grade wearing a skin tight crop top/hot pants combination.  She would still be wearing stillettos, but this time she would be wearing a thong.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Harold's former sport's car:  \"What are you up to honey.\" Elizabeth asked Matt.  Elizabeth was back in her normal clothes of a pair of women's knit pants with and elastic waist and no zipper.  She wore it with a matching blouse.  Her bra and panties also matched.  On her feet were a pair of stockings and sensible flats.  This was the attire she usually wore to her job as one of the senior partners at the law firm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just working, have to make those bucks you know,\" Matt said with a seductive lilt in his voice.  Matt was wearing a Spiderman t-shirt and a pair of jeans on his ten-year-old body.  Since he ran away from home years ago and learned to live a life on the streets, he learned how to dress to get the most money.  So under his jeans he wore boys Hanes briefs and he had on a pair of tube socks and sneakers on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure look fine,\" Elizabeth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That may be, but I can do more than look fine if you have the money.\"  Soon a deal was struck and Matt got into Elizabeth's car.  They pulled around the corner to a place that Matt knew that they wouldn't be disturbed to complete their transaction.</span></div></div>",

Matt had gotten out of the car so violently that she startled a young mother who was pushing the stroller that contained her fifteen month old baby.  The baby started crying at the sudden jolt of his carriage.  Then time paused for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen time resumed, Matt who was in the body of a woman nineteen years-old, heard his baby crying.  Matt was dressed like any typical woman close to twenty despite being a mother already.  Matt wore a sun, moon and feathers graphic tank top with a pair of skinny-jeans and sandals with a one inch heel.  She dashed around his stroller and picked up Elizabeth his crying baby-boy.  Elizabeth had been crying because of the frustration of knowing something is wrong but not knowing what to do about it.  With his new body and the abilities that came with that body all he could do was cry.  Matt instinctively picked up Elizabeth and tried to soothe him with soft words.  When that didn't work, she took out the bottle she always carried in her diaper bag and started to feed Elizabeth.  Elizabeth suckled instinctively and and by the time he was done he had forgotten about all the strangeness that he was worried about.  He was put back in his stroller and soon fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Carrie now in Elizabeth's forty-three year old body didn't know why she had stopped the car.  She called for Ray who was now in Matt's ten-year old body to get back into the car.  The former Ray-Ray has Carrie used to call him, dutifully got back into the car.  They drove off to pick up Carrie's husband Steven at the train station.  Everyone thought that this was perfectly normal,except for Mandy.  Maybe if Mandy is in a good mood, she'll swap back the lives of Carrie and Ray.</span></div></div>",

He is wearing one of your mom's skirts and has makeup on his face. Looking down, you see that his toenails are painted red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was your date, Mandy?\" he asks, in a motherly tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was great, 'Mommy!'\" you say, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt smiles and says, \"Glad to hear it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell him that you're going to your room, so he starts to walk off. You think that it would be funny if your toenails were painted red (with your lowered maturity, you can't quite grasp gender boundaries). So you activate the PAID. After a few clicks and a flash, you walk up to your room giggling, staring at your red-painted toenails. You only exchanged the paint; you have no idea how to actually paint them. You figure that you can swap that later: right now, you want to call Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dial her and tell her to come up to your room, to talk about the PAID. She obliges, and is up in your room in two minutes. You are sitting cross-legged on your bed, proudly displaying your painted toenails. When Karen sees you, she smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I noticed that you swapped my brother with your mom, and I can see that you gave yourself a pedicure as well. Did you swap anything else?\" she says, sitting across from you on your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also swapped relationships with Stephanie,\" you say, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would explain why she kissed me on the cheek earlier,\" says Karen. \"Do you want to swap back? I'm not very comfortable dating my sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could understand that, so you swap back. When Karen asks if you swapped anything else, you can't remember swapping maturity and names with Amanda. You know that you swapped something, but you don't know what. Just then, the PAID starts flashing. When you activate it, it begins to give you and Karen a tutorial  on the \"Swap History\" feature. Basically, it keeps a record of all the swaps a person has performed. When you see that you swapped names and maturity with Amanda, you giggle and say, \"Oh, right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren, however, was concerned. \"Alex, why did you swap maturity?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to play with the PAID a little bit,\" you said, \"and it turned out to be really fun! I become happy more easily, and I don't really wanna swap back. You should try it, Karen. Swap maturity with Kate. Even if you don't like it, you could swap back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren doesn't know if swapping maturity is a good idea, but she could swap back. What does she do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She could hear everything from her vantage point and understood what they were talking about.  She hadn't recognized any changes around the house.  Matt had always been her and Mandy's mother.  Mandy had always painted his nails.  Her brother's name had always been Mandy, but since she was so young she didn't have any problem believing that such a thing as the PAID existed even without proof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she heard that Karen was going to swap maturity with her she thought great.  Kate didn't understand exactly what maturity was, she thought it meant smartness.  It did mean smartness but it meant a whole lot more too which she didn't realize.  Kate thought it would be fun to be as smart as an adult.  To Kate, anyone who was old enough to babysit for her was an adult.  She saw Karen agree and head towards to door to presumably swap 'Maturity' with her.  She scampered to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kate got into her room, she hid in the corner so that Karen would have to enter the room to do the swap.  Karen thought the swap would be fun and she could just swap back if there was a problem.  But that was the mature Karen's thoughts.  After the swap, Karen was no longer mature, Kate was the mature one and worse yet, Kate knew what had happened because she had heard Karen and Mandy talking.  With Kate's new found maturity, she could manipulate Karen.  Kate convinced Karen that it was her bed time and that she could 'play' in the morning.  Karen tried to protest, but without the maturity of a teen, she was no match for Kate.  Soon Karen was brushing her teeth and getting ready for bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate then slipped away to talk to Mandy.  \"I didn't just swap maturity with Kate, I also swapped bodies too.\" Kate told him.  She made up a story that it would be more fun to act immature if she also looked immature.  Mandy who had the maturity of a child bought it.  Then Kate also convinced Mandy it was time for bed.  Soon Karen and Mandy were fast asleep like 'little kids.'  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate used this time to find Alex and tell her what had been done to them.  Alex who had the maturity of a teen but the body of a little girl realized that Kate was right.  They soon made plans to manipulate, Karen and Mandy into doing what they (Alex and Kate) wanted.

You think it would be great to be able to believe in Santa like that.  At least for a little while.  You take out your PAID and look through the options, there wasn't one specifically for believes in Santa.  But there was an option for beliefs and you choose it.  When time returns to normal, you believe everything a seven-year-old does.  You believe in Santa, the Easter Bunny, the Toothfairy, monsters, the Boggyman, that babies come from the stork, that mommy can make everything better and other beliefs.  You know that some of your beliefs aren't right, but you don't know which ones are true and which ones are childish beliefs.  They all seem equally true to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda knows that her mom gets the toys for her, not Santa but she still expects to get a tea set for Christmas.

You know where the elementary school is and plan to walk there.  Your mom who was impressed that you finished the entire bowl says \"Where are you going, Mandy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not going to walk alone, young lady.\"  You forgot to stay in character for a second.  Little girls don't go anywhere alone.  You think to yourself you had better get used to being watched by an adult at all time.  \"Also, aren't you forgetting something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I I I don't think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is your bookbag and what about your lunchbox?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm,\" looking around \"I don't see them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda's mom expect seven-year-olds to be forgetful so it is no big deal for her.  Although she was concerned about Amanda trying to leave the house without her.  Amanda's mom fetched her things.  Amanda's school bag was actually a Dora knapsack.  It seems all seven-year-olds have Dora the Explorer knapsacks you think.  Amanda's mom helps you put on your knapsack.  She then gives you a Carebear's lunchbox.  You want to know what is inside, but you decide to wait to open it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda's mom then takes your hand and leads you out the door.  She walks you all the way to the school never letting go of your hand.  During the trip she reminds you that you have to wait for  mommy.  She tries to do it in a way that is both urgent for a young girl but not so much so that it'll scare her.  Amanda's mom doesn't want her daughter to think the world is a scary place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you arrive at the school grounds and Amanda's mom makes sure an adult takes charge of you before leaving herself.  You are then escorted inside the school with the other students in your class.  You wait for everyone to sit down and try to figure out which is your seat.  You use your skills as an adult to figure it out somehow. There is only one desk that is big enough for a person of your size.  You assume the PAID changed reality to make it possible for you to be in this class.  That must be your seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you see you are in the first grade.  You have no idea what they teach children that young.  You don't even know if you are supposed to know your ABCs.  You sit there quietly and look at what the other kids are doing.  The kids who are not playing around take out a notebook and you look in your bag and do the same.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher, you don't know what her name is, gets the class quieted down.  Today's lesson is on odds and evens.  The teacher holds up a picture with a group of things, balls, snakes, teddy bears, whatever and the students have to decide if its odd or even.  You are much more concerned with what is the teacher's name than to worry about the lesson.  The teacher notices your attention is elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanda...Amanda...Amanda.\" the teacher says.  She then moves towards you.  What do you do?</span></div></div>",

Every twenty minutes, the lesson structure would change, but the topic was always on odds and evens.  The teacher drew on the board, various shapes and you have to count them and tell if they were odds or evens.  This lesson didn't only teach the math but also reinforced shapes to the students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the students call the teacher Miss Konner.  You finally kn.w your teacher's name.  You smiled to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there were manipulatives where the students were put into groups of two or three to work together.  Later there was a work sheet.  The class moved from lesson to lesson quickly to keep the kids engaged.  You didn't notice, it was all fun to you, not work.  There was even a break in the middle for milk and cookies.  Miss Konner was a very good teacher and you liked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally it was time for lunch and recess.  Miss Konner took the class to the lunch room to eat.  Everyone was reminded to take their lunchbox with them.  Miss Konner then left the whole class with the lunchroom attendants.  You guessed this was so she could eat her own lunch in peace.  You were proud of yourself for figuring it out.  You guessed that none of the other kids would have reasoned it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down with some girls.  You only knew a few of their names from class, but this seemed to be the group of kids that Kate played with.  You finally got to see what was in your lunchbox.  It was a tuna sandwich on white with the crusts cut off.  There was a grape drink box an orange and some M&amp;Ms.  You started with the M&amp;Ms first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listened to the conversations of the girls and tried to jump in where you could.  Once you got the hang of it, you started to have fun.  After your group was finished all they were going to eat, tThey decided to play a clapping game.  So you paired up with one of the girls and sat across from her indian style.  The other girls didn't understand why you didn't know the rhyme.  It went:<br>\r\n\"Miss Mary Mack<br>\r\nMiss Mary Mack, Mack, Mack<br>\r\nAll dressed in black, black, black \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou seemed to remember hearing it before, but you couldn't remember how it went.  Finally one of the girls did the whole thing for you, and you sort of mouthed the words until you got it.  The clapping pattern was pretty simple.  You clap twice and then clap your right hand with your partner's left, clap twice again and then your left hand with your partner's right.  It seems you have to do it as fast as you can.  So you missed the other girls hand quite frequently.  But all in all, it was a lot of fun.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou learned the rhyme, eventually. Well you couldn't really remember the order, but the other girl did and you could catch on a split second later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour partner singing, \"With silver buttons, buttons, buttons \" and you singing \"... silver buttons, buttons, buttons,\"  Missing the first word. But remembering the next line \"All down her back, back, back\"  Then you forgot the next line so the other girl singing \"She asked her mother, mother, mother \" and you singing \"uh uhed her mother, mother, mother....\"  Even if you didn't know the words, you had a lot of fun anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys were outside in the fenced off school yard running around.  You preferred to be sitting and playing the clapping game instead.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Apparently, the girl you swapped with wasn't very good at math, because you are having a very difficult time. There were fifteen problems on the sheet, and Miss Konner said you only got two of them right. Or was that three? You couldn't count very well either. You glance over at the girl you swapped with. She had completed every problem in record time, and Miss Konner was congratulating her because they were all correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mutter, \"Smarty pants.\" Miss Konner hears you, and says, \"Amanda!

Suddenly, an idea hits you.

Amanda's mom asks if you are getting sick, and you say that you think so. She decides to let you stay home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way home, you were very excited.

Since Toby's tastes in apparel had changed he didn't find anything 'funny' about your apparel and stopped teasing you.  Besides Toby was much more concerned with the fact that his diaper was a little wet.  He wondered if he should tell his mom now or wait until after they get to school.</span></div></div>",

You bumped into me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, it was your fault, just apologize and we can just forget this whole thing happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan must have been feeling over confident.  He towered over Amanda, it wasn't just his height, but he always sported a permed updo you usually find on women in their forties or older which made him look even taller than he was.  \"I will not, I'm not afraid of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not afraid of me?  You should be.\"  Amanda said with the confidence of her position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan, took his thumb out of his mouth long enough to say.  \"You may think you own the school, but you don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'll tell you what, you turn your butt around and leave and I'll forget your rudeness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan didn't turn his butt around.  It was a huge bubble butt that you usually see on plus sized black women.  He just stared into Amanda's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda wouldn't look away.  Finally Duncan had had enough.  He finally turned away and skipped down the hall like a grade school girl.  Amanda continued on her way as if nothing had happened.  It's so great to be with Amanda she doesn't take s&amp;*t from anyone.</span></div></div>",

She now wore a over sized t-shirt with a sports logo on it.  She wore now baggy jeans which was supported very low on her hips with a loose belt.  You could see her men's style boxer shorts in the 4 or 5 inch gap where her shirt ended and jeans began.  The jeans legs pooled at her feet on which she wore men's basketball sneakers (which costs over $100 and was now the most expensive article of clothing she wore.)  She didn't wear any makeup or jewelry anymore.  Without makeup her face took on a more plain look.  The over sized clothes hid most of her best assets even though you could clearly seem a great deal of her boxers she didn't look sexy at all anymore.  You like Ellen's new look as now she is no longer a threat to you.  You didn't even consider what happened to Jamall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamall was now dressed in a fashionable form fitting layered look.  It started with the pretty camisole that peaked under his u-neck long sleeved top which was under a short sleeved tunic that extended to his thighs.  He wore a tri-colored legging that matches the colors of his three tops.  The leggings extended to mid calf which highlighted his cream colored stockings and wedged sandals.  This look was accessorized with earrings, necklaces, rings and an ankle bracelet that was worn under his stocking.  His face was expertly made up and his nails were finely manicured with an elaborate multicolored patterned.  All parts of his apparel and makeup was coordinated to give a refined fashionable look that you could see in any one of a dozen fashion magazines.  (His lingerie was also coordinated although you couldn't see much of it, except for the hint of his bra straps.)  But Jamall was still a man and even though the look was fashionable he still looked ridiculous as he was dressed.  Not that you cared, your concern was about Helen not Jamall.</span></div></div>",

She is wearing glasses since her eyes can no longer tolerate contact lenses.  She had hearing aides in her ears and her jawline is depressed because of the full dentures in her mouth.  These were just the most obvious changes in her life.  You couldn't see that she now wore adult diapers.  She wasn't fully incontinent but she did leak frequently.  Other more subtle infirmities has given her a very strict diet.  Menopause has given her a very dry vagina and lowered her libido.  Miranda appeared behind Jessica making Jessica the only student in the school who has an aide of this type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then use the PAID to swap the 'Life' of Adam and Mrs. Overholt.  In Adam's place you now see Mrs. Overholt wearing Adam's clothes retailored to fit her .  She is standing up straight for the first time in all the time you have known her.  She looks in good health, but she is still in her eighties.  She may not have the ravages of her former infirmities but not of age.  Her skin is dried and wrinkled all over.  Without the heavy bra that Mrs. Overholt usually wears her breasts (which are bigger than Jessica's) hang low on her chest.  Her thinning hair is styled in Adam's usual style.  Mrs. Overholt who now has Adam's life is still in love with Jessica.  She escorts Jessica down the hall steadying her as Miranda usually does until they part outside Jessica's classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile at Mrs. Overholt house, Adam was wearing Mrs. Overholt's blouse and skirt.  He is straightening up his house while the TV is broadcasting one of the soap operas that Mrs. Overholt enjoys.

You didn't know which student it was, but it was obviously a girl from the cute yellow and gold jumper and dark mary janes that she was wearing.  But that was the only thing girlish about the student.  The student was a woman in her early thirties.  She was about five foot five tall and weighed close to 160 pounds.  Her hair was tied back with a ribbon with a bow but she didn't wear any makeup at all.  There were other students in the school courtyard but they were children who weren't in your class and they looked quite normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'adult' woman greeted you.  She knew who you were, but you didn't know who she was.  You played along as if you knew her by simply avoiding the use of a name.  She talked about this and that but you weren't paying attention.  You were waiting for more of your classmates to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one they did,  The only way to tell which was by seeing who brought them.  When the student was brought by his/her dad that didn't work though.  Pretty soon all of your classmates had shown up.  All of them had the bodies of their moms.  You could usually tell the boys from the girls by the clothes they were wearing.  None of the women wore any makeup.  Few wore jewelry except for the occasional cutsy earring or some sort of charm necklace.  All of your classmates are now women mostly in their late twenties or early thirties.  Some were a bit older and there was one 'boy' who was actually a woman of forty-four.  None of the women wore bras of any sort and thus many of them dependent on their age or breast size had very saggy breasts particularly while they were running around playing games.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only exception was Richard and Toby.

You quickly pull up your pink tunic and pull down your leggings your pants and pull down your underwear, you are still wearing men's underwear, it is one of the few things you are wearing that isn't pink.  Despite being pregnant you still have your own male penis.  You point it between your legs and you let the pee flow as you sigh in relief.  As it turns out only a few squirts trickle out.  For a moment you wonder how come you needed to go that badly but only pee so little.  Then you remember, you are going to have a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do next?</span></div></div>",

Alex was now an official student in the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was taken to the appropriate class.  There were only six other students in Alex's new class.  They arranged in age from sixteen to thirty four, but they all were at the same 'grade' level (about third grade).  They worked at a very slow pace.  There was a teacher and an aide to help her.  Alex was introduced to the class and was asked he he would like to tell about himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was dressed in a cute pink tunic with a butterfly on it and a matching skirt.  In the report that accompanied Alex it said that these clothes made him feel comfortable and shouldn't be questioned so none of the teachers did.  Plus the students were warned about it and they didn't say anything either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HI, my name is Alex and  I am very smart and so I was sent to this special school.  I want to be a princess or a nurse or a ballerina and that is why I am here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher, Mrs. Brown said, \"Well Alex we are sure glad you are here.  I am sure you will have lots of fun learning new things.\"  Then she escorted him to his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe work was slow but still challenging for Alex's first grade mentality.  He wasn't the smartest kid anymore.  He quickly got jealous of another boy who was in his late twenties who seemed to the the smartest.  He was actually of a much lower intelligence than Alex, he had just been at the school for almost two decades so he knew more.  But with only a first grade intelligence he couldn't tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex took out his PAID and when the screen came up, he said \"I want to be as smart as him.\"  When the PAID had finished, Alex was now as smart as the other kid.  But now instead of having the intelligence of an above average first grader he was now truly autistic.  He was certainly smarter, but his thinking had slowed to a crawl and he developed a bunch of other mental and social problems that comes with autism.</span></div></div>",

The teachers encouraged the students to work in groups in the afternoon, but Alex was a bit antisocial so he wasn't totally comfortable with it.  The girl he was paired with didn't have this problem.  She had a host of other problems but she was very chatty and outgoing.  That is why she was paired with Alex to bring him out.  Alex wished he could be like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled out his PAID and said \"I wanna be like her.\"  The PAID knew what he meant and gave him all of the girls social graces.

She waited for Alex to return home and went to his house when he got there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she saw him, she knew right away that things had gotten worse.  She could see in his face that he was now mentally challenged.  Before he wasn't too smart but he didn't look retarded, but now that was different.  She could also see the physical changes.  They were very extensive and that didn't include that he was wearing a diaper (which she couldn't tell until he took off his skirt.)  Her face dropped.  She also didn't love him like a boyfriend anymore.  She knew she should like him like that, she remembered loving him, but the PAID had changed that when it swapped his social life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Alex saw Karen though his face lit up.  He was happy to see her.  He now felt that she was his best friend but he had no interest in her socially.  \"Oh school was so much fun,\" he gushed.  \"We learned so many things and the people there were really nice.  They are going to teach me to be a princess\"  He went on to tell about his day, about the students and teachers at the school.  That he is the smartest kid at the school and that he is training for the Special Olympics.  He also talked about this boy there that he liked and Karen got the impression about his new changed feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren knew that he had gone way too far and that she couldn't fix him.  There was just too much, he would never be the same and the more things continued, it probably would get worse.  He wasn't retarded when he left for the school.  (She knew that retarded wasn't the right word, but she wasn't in the mood to be politically correct.  At least not in her own mind.)  He wasn't deformed.  He wasn't gay.  Now look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she loved him so much and she needed to help him.  So she took one last drastic step.  She had noticed this feature a while back, but now was the time to use it she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren pointed the PAID at Alex and she was going to swap 'LIVES' with him and use the 'TOTAL' and 'PERMANENT' option.  This would mean, both lives would be totally switched in every way.  He would be Karen and she would be what Alex had become in every way.  That was the 'TOTAL' part.  The 'PERMANENT' part meant that after the exchange the PAID for both of them would be permanently inactive.  They couldn't use them again, and no one who had one could use them on them either.  It was a permanent change never to be undone.  Karen would remember what happened since she uwas the only using the device but Alex would not remember.  This was an act of true love.  She would give up everything to save him.  She couldn't bare to see him like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought about what he had become, he was now a retarded, homosexual transvestite, with many physical problems and mental problems.  She didn't know about the emotional and other problems he had acquired.  This would be her life from now on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't see him like that, she would give him her life.  She had a bright future, even if it wouldn't be with Alex.  She clicked the appropriate options.  The PAID flashed an 'Are you sure?' message.  She clicked that too.  The last thing she thought as her life faded away was, 'I wonder what's its like to be a princess.'</span></div></div>",

This made you extremely happy as you got revenge on the kid and now he liked Pretty dresses just like you!.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied you went to find Amanda's mum and then walked home with her feeling very proud with yourself for your revenge but instead telling her about how well you were doing in class leaving out the bit about the swaps, when you got home you saw Amanda there and swapped your LIFE back. As far as you were concerned you were back to normal so you decided to have some fun that's when you remembered your aspirations of being a princess and that you have princess dresses in your wardrobe so you rushed to your room and saw all of the clothes that were now yours and saw a princess dress.

However during the explanation you never used words like intelligence you said \"smarts\" and other much easier words that you could actually comprehend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"alright then when did you swap clothes with somebody and why are you dressed like a princess is this some other swap?\" this caused you to look at her like she was an idiot \"what do you mean, this is how i am all the time\" you replied. \"you don't normally dress like a Princess, you dress like a 16 year old boy and you speak with more refinement and use more complex words than smarts\" You felt offended and your lack of emotional stability started to kick in and you started fighting back tears \"don't call me stupid!\" you replied. Then it dawned on Karen, those random swaps must have swapped something else with the girl and he didn't realise and he obviously didn't swap back with the right person because he had the intelligence of a 7 year old at best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hey I'm sorry\" Karen quickly responded trying to calm you down you sniffed and wiped away the tears starting to trickle down your face \"really?\". \"yeah i didn't mean it, you're a really pretty princess how about we play pretty princesses outside?\" that sounded amazing to you, not only could you be a princess so could your best friend it would be amazing!.

You had completely forgot that your sister existed at all and that she would be living at the  Jones' house with you for the few weeks you were there. \"sounds like it will be fun\" you replied. You walked over to Amanda and Kate and selected LIFE and Karen swapped Lives with your sister. Karen started walking back to the garden leading you with her and you resumed being princesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later you noticed Kate and Amanda inside watching the news it was about the English monarchy and the current thing they had done that garnered the media's attention. On the screen you saw the princesses and Queens and realised they were all women and you were a male, \"hey Alex what's wrong?\" Karen asked \"I wish i was a pretty girl like a proper princess, nobody would like a boy princess\" then the PAID's voice activation function activated \"SWAPPING BODIES\" and then suddenly you had swapped bodies with Amanda \"Alex you swapped bodies with Amanda you will want to swap back\". You looked down and realised that you had become a girl, specifically Amanda. \"no i don't\" you replied, \"what do you mean, of course you do\" Karen asked with a worried tone in her voice \"I want to be a proper princess and only girls can be princesses so I'll be a girl!\" you yelled stamping your foot\". Karen not wanting to have you throw a tantrum quickly replied \"you know what you're right, sorry\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce dinner was ready Karen noticed that nobody saw anything wrong, Amanda now with Alex's body and life was wearing the Denim skirt and tank top she had been wearing a few hours ago and Kate was acting like nothing had happened to her best friend complaining about how hard calculus was. Alex was being picky with his food but being sure not to get any on his dress and Her mother didn't pay any notice to this at all seeing everything as normal. Once dinner was over Karen and Alex had to go to bed earlier than normal due to Their new bedtimes, \"alright Karen I've set up a trundle in Alex's room for you to sleep in\" Karen's, now Alex's mum explained \"thanks Mrs Jones\" she replied. Mrs Jones kissed Alex on the forehead and said goodnight. As Karen fell asleep she though about how much Alex Owed her after she fixed this.</span></div></div>",

As Amanda opened her eyes properly and saw you and the Pajamas she was wearing it all came back to her, the catastrophe you were in and how she was going to try help you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"sorry Alex i forgot you swapped with Amanda, silly me\" She replied in a joking manner \"come on we need to have breakfast\" you replied, Karen got up and begun walking downstairs with you. It was slightly disorienting for Karen being taller than you for once, not only that but you had her sisters body. As you get downstairs Karen's mother addressed you \"looks like the princesses have woken from their slumber!\" this made you giggle a bit and smile, \"so it's bacon and eggs as usual?\" she asked \"Yes!\" you replied with a very prominent smile quickly taking over your face. Following Karen's lead you sat down and waited for breakfast, Karen seemed to be deep in thought but suddenly she looked at you and begun saying \"maybe we should do some swapping at school when we get there it could be fun\" before pausing for a moment and continuing by saying \"do you have any ideas?\". Unbeknownst to you Karen was trying to get you to think that swapping was a good idea ahead of time so that it would be easy to manipulate you to swap what she told you to at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could swap things around to make people look silly!\" you suggested \"good start, let me know if you come up with something else\" she replied. Due to your lack of intelligence this has you thinking really hard but then just as you were about to come up with something you hear Amanda's mum call out \"Breakfast is ready!\" and with your new attention span you completely forget what you were thinking about. As you started eating Karen asks \"so did you think of anything else?\", stopping for a moment to look up from your plate \"think of what?\" you asked \"never mind\" Karen responded with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were finished and put your plate in the kitchen you went back to Amanda's room to get changed for school, you changed into a pink dress with a flower on the front that stopped just below your knees, some grey leggings, white socks, sneakers and a hairband to top it off because you could pretend it was a tiara. When you were ready you ran down to the Car in which you saw Karen was already there waiting for you. She had changed into a t-shirt yellow shirt with white stripes and jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car ride was majorly uneventful, when Karen arrived she noticed something off, there was a boy who was wearing a tutu and had a rather sizable bulge in his pants as if he was wearing a diaper. She looked at Alex puzzled and asked \"whats with him?\" Alex simply replied \"Jason was mean so i did that to him now he likes pretty dresses and wears a diaper!\". Karen could tell this was going to be a lot of work.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Karen tried to walk over to Jason (the boy in the dress and diapers) but he ran away.  Then she noticed that he wasn't running away from her, he was playing tag with other boys.  Karen ascertained that there were four boys playing in the game although, Jason was the only one playing in a dress. She could see that despite wearing a dress and a diaper he was still acting like a boy.  He wore the sneakers and socks of a boy.  He also had a boyish haircut and didn't care about exposing his diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she was going to 'fix' the boy then she would have to get him to stay in one place so she could swap him back.  She would have to find a baby who should be in diapers but wasn't.  And a girl who was wearing boyish clothes..  The latter part wasn't going to happen, as the girl Karen was looking for didn't swap her wardrobe just her love of dresses.  She was wearing pants and a t-shirt.  Jason's drawers were still filled mostly with his boyish stuff, he just preferred to wear dresses instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren called out to Jason, \"Nice dress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason didn't take it as a compliment.  He was teased for wearing dresses, but was tough enough to end the teasing.  In Jason's mind there were many times that he ripped or ruined a pretty dress because he got into a fight with another student.  Jason wasn't going to give up dresses he loved them, but that didn't mean he would let anyone bully him.  \"What's it to ya,\" he shouted back.  Then he approached Karen ready to defend his right to wear a dress.  It was pretty comical since not only was he wearing a dress, but the dress he did wear was juvenile for even a second grader.  It was a dress usually worn by a much younger girl.  A dress that even four year olds might have outgrown, but certainly something that a girl entering school should have long since abandoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren was taken aback.  She expected him to act like a girl and accept the compliment then say something akin to \"Thank you.\"  She didn't expect hostility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jason approached he said menacingly, \"What did you said about my dress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just that I like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think that even though you are bigger than me and a girl, I won't beat you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean it like that.  I mean I think the dress is pretty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you mean.  And you had better stop making fun of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren tried to defuse the situation.  She could take care of the little boy quite easily if she wanted to.  She was still a teen even though she was in the boys' grade now..  To get rid of the kid she apologized.  All she did was want to do something nice for the boy.  To get him back to normal and all she got was hostility.  She didn't even say anything mean to the boy.  Karen decided that Alex was right, this boy was mean and deserved what happened to him.  She then took out her PAID and made additional changes.  She made sure that the dress wearing boy in a diaper would be the youngest, smallest student in his grade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren never did find out who Alex had swapped the boy originally with.  It was hard to tell.  It was hard to tell if any of the girls were purposefully wearing boys clothes.  She also didn't know which babies were wearing boys briefs when they should be wearing diapers.  Karen realized that swapping Alex back to normal was going to be harder than she thought.</span></div></div>",

Karen walked over to the girl who you pointed out to deduce if she had Alex's intelligence, it didn't take long to figure out that she did in fact not have Your intelligence and she was a pretty average student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only made things harder for Karen, not only did she have no idea who to swap you with but all the things you swapped were quite hard to notice and she didn't even know all of them. From what she knew, your career goals changed due to your sudden urge to be a princess, ballerina and Nurse she knew you wanted to become a Biomedical engineer which would be unique. Additionally she knew your clothes had changed but that would be hard to pin down as she'd have to find a girl wearing boys clothes which wasn't easy as there were numerous girls with pants and T shirts like you would wear. She also knew you had swapped emotional stability based on how quick you were to tears but this would be hard to test without making everyone cry, and besides intelligence she knew your attention span was noticeably shorter so she'd need to fix that somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Karen feared once in the classroom nobody was an obvious candidate for having Alex's traits and that only made things harder, her concentration was broken by you as you told her \"Karen it's your turn for show and tell!\"</span></div></div>",

You don't even really fit into these little chairs and desks they have you sitting in.  You know you look ridiculous.  You have to sit with your legs straight.  If you sat with your knees bent, then you would lift the desk up off the floor.  Not only that, you are clearly a man.  You aren't even dressed in women's clothes, let alone girls clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around to see how the girls are dressed.  Most of the girls are wearing jeans and t-shirts.  The difference between most of the girls clothes and the boys clothes is usually the design on the t-shirt and sometimes the colors.  But it is pretty much the same.  There are a few girls in skirts, but very few.  You look for the stereotypical girl in a dress with tights and mary janes, but you can't find one.  The closest thing you find is a girl who is wearing a skirt and a shirt that looks more like a blouse than a t-shirt.  She has a ribbon in her hair tying it back into a pony tail.  She is wearing girly sandal type shoes, but she isn't wearing tights, she is wearing knee high socks. That is as girly as the girls get, at least today in this class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think it would be so much fun to swap clothes with this girl.  You point your PAID at the girl and time stops.  When you see the holographic screen you pick 'Clothes'  When time resumes, you are dressed as the girl was except the clothes have been resized to fit you.  You even had the ribbon in your hair.  But the problem with the ribbon is that you still had short hair and so it didn't give you a pony tail like the girl.  You take out the PAID again and swap hair with the girl.  You could feel the hair cascade down your neck.  Now the ribbon made a proper pony tail or so you thought.  You couldn't see it since you didn't have a mirror.  You reach your hands up to feel your hair to make sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't thought of it before, but all of a sudden you realize, 'Hey I must also be wearing panties.\"  The underwear you was wearing did feel a little tighter than before, but it also felt like cotton and not too different than your usual briefs.  You couldn't be sure without checking, but you can't do that now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou assume you look more ridiculous than you did before.  But no one seemed to think anything was out of place.  The girl you switched with, looked more like a boy than a girl now that she was wearing your clothes and had your hair style, but no one reacted to that either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do next?</span></div></div>",

Her breasts sag a little since they weren't supported by a bra, but the teacher is young enough so her breasts are still perky.  If you looked closely now you could see her nipples under her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you didn't know, was that all of your clothes at home were now a mixture of the girl you swapped with and the teacher's clothes.  All of your outer clothing were in a style of a young girl, but all of your underwear (you should call them lingerie now), shoes and hose were that of an adult woman.  The teacher's lingerie now consisted of the panties, socks and shoes of a young girl.

On her feet she put on her Elmo slippers.  Now that she was comfortable she checked the homework of her students and went over the next day's lesson plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was looking it over, the phone rang, it was her boyfriend.  He wanted to come over, but she wasn't in the mood, she just wanted to play.  She wished that he would play with her more.  She couldn't make him understand that if he engaged in some of her activities such as playing Sorry or Monopoly or playing with her Transformers could lead to more fun in the bedroom.  But he just didn't like playing with her toys or watching the cartoons she liked to watch.  It was the age old conflict between men and women, if men would do some of the things that women liked, then women would do more of the things that men liked (and women liked too.)  Her boyfriend tried very hard to convince her, after all, tomorrow night she would be busy at boy scouts and wouldn't have much time for her boyfriend after she got back from the meeting.  She finally got him off the phone with a promise that they would spend the whole night together on Thursday.  Friday she couldn't see him, because Johnny's (who is seven-years-old) mom was going to take her and her best friend Johnny to the Lego Movie.  They had been looking forward to seeing this movie for a long time.  She had asked her boyfriend to take her, but he didn't like the type of movies she liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finished the stuff for school, she started dinner.  While it was cooking, she got on the floor and started playing with her cars and trucks.  She started by seeing which was the fastest and then it degenerated into her pushing the cars and trucks into each other.  She had alot of fun.  While eating dinner, she watched the transformer cartoons that she had recorded on the DVR while she was at work..  After dinner she played her \"Sesame Street: Once Upon a Monster\" game on her XBox.  She was completely relaxed and happy now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe played until it was time to go to sleep.  She had wished that her boyfriend had come over and played with her.  It was so much fun to play her video games and then she could play in a more intimate way with her boyfriend after, but he thought that the games she played were silly and rarely did it.  She would insist that he play with her when he got there Thursday, but if he didn't she did have her needs too especially if she was going to be busy Friday.  With this thought in her mind she went to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Her boyfriend still didn't want to play a game with her or play hide and seek.  Rosaline decided to go down the hall and see if her friend Jimmy wanted to play.  Jimmy was eight-years-old just a year older than her students.  Rosaline decided a long time ago that even though her students liked to have fun like her, she wouldn't play with them.  It would cause too many problems at work.  But her neighbors were a different story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosaline walked down the hall and rung the doorbell.  Jimmy's mother answered the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can Jimmy come out and play,\" Rosaline said hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Jimmy isn't here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When will Jimmy be back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for a while.  He is at boy scouts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosaline always wanted to join boy scouts.  She didn't know why she hadn't already, but it seemed a good idea now.  Rosaline got all the information about boy scouts from Jimmy's mother and then drove down to the boy scout offices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went inside and talked to the nice man at the desk.  He referred her to the 'admissions' office.  There she filled out the form. She wasn't joining the Boy Scouts, she was actually joining the Cub Scouts.  She was going to be a Tiger Scout which was for boys in the first grade.  When she left, she was given the cub scout handbook and told where to buy the cub scout uniform.  She had also signed up to receive the official magazine for the cub scouts (for her age group) \"Boys Life.\"  Finally the recruiter reminded her of the cub scout motto, 'Do Your Best\" which she found out was different than the boy scout motto of 'Be Prepared'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drove directly to the closest store that supplied the uniform and other supplies she would need.  Then she drove straight home to read the entire handbook.  She looked at the cover, it had an animated tiger on the front which looked strangely like tony the tiger, a bunch of animated boys of about six or seven and a couple of scout leaders.  Everyone on the cover was smiling and looking like they were having alot of fun.  Rosaline opened it to the first page.  It asked for the name of the Tiger Cub and the Name of the Adult Partner.  She was the Tiger Cub and filled in her name, the name of the 'Adult Partner' she would leave blank for now.  The next page started with \"Dear Parents\" in big bold letters.  She read through that and then she got to the safety requirements which were called \"Bobcat Requirements\" and started off with a bunch of 'What If...' situations.  The handbook was 180 pages and she read them all.  She skimmed through it until she found what she wanted.  She started to read it out loud.  The section was called \"Tiger Cubs: How does it work.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReading out loud  \"Your Tiger Cub will be a member of a den.  Most dens  have five to nine boy\u2013adult partner<br>\r\nteams, meet twice a month in a den meeting, and have one outing a month, called a Go See It.\"  It went on and on and she got more excited the more she read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she was finished with the handbook, she couldn't wait until Friday when she could go to her first meeting.  She tried on her Cub Scout uniform a dozen times before it was time to go to her meeting.  She told Jimmy that she had joined his troop the next time she saw him and asked him a million questions about what it was like.  Se was as excited as well a school boy.</span></div></div>",

Miss Konner didn't want to play at first, but Jimmy insisted.  He said that he had answered all of her questions and that she owed him.  Soon the two playmates (no pun intended) were completely naked and looking at each other out of curiousity not lust.

He had to finish his homework before his mom would drive him to his pilates class.  He had been taking pilates class since the beginning of the year and he really liked it.  This was just one of many classes his mom had to take him to.  He had yoga several times a month and he had a dance class once a week.  All the dances he was learning were for couples.  Since he didn't join with a partner he had to dance with some of the other ladies who also didn't have a partner.  Sometimes he led and sometimes his partner would lead, either way he thought it was so much fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got back home, he ate his dinner and then he watched his favorite program, \"The Good Wife.\"  He loved dramas and romances, but he couldn't stay up to see most of the shows he liked.  He had an 8:30 bed time.  If there wasn't any thing good recorded on his DVR he would read one of his fashion magazines like Vogue or Glamour.  He couldn't read all the words, but he could look at the pictures and it usually made sense to him.  After watching his show, he loved to relax in a darkened bath with only scented candles illuminating the room.  His mom had to light the candles for him since he wasn't allowed to play with matches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was time for bedtime, his mother would come into his room and read a chapter from one of the scores of romance novels he had on his shelves.  It would take him away to exotic places and stir up romantic feelings.  His mother loved these novels too.  Greg actually had alot in common with his mother who was only a couple years older than Miss Konner.  Greg and his mother actually had alot of the same friends but he didn't like hanging out with his mom, he thought she would embarrass him with his friends.  He preferred to gossip with his friends (most of whom were in his pilates, yoga or dance class and where all women in their late twenties) over a cup of flavored coffee with a pastry (cake, pie, danish, whatever.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he actually liked tagging along when his mom went shopping.  While Greg and his mom shopped, they actually had a fun time together.  They talked about fashion, or the movie and TV that they bother liked or celebrity gossip.  He just loved looking at all the pretty things, he could spend hours shopping without ever having to buy anything.  Greg wouldn't admit that he had so much fun with his mom, but his mom knew how he felt.</span></div></div>",

Greg's mom drove him out of town insisting that he would just love it.  The miles passed and he pulled up to the \"Emerald Komono Spa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg's mom said, \"I got your the full treatment, you are going to be here all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Mom, I love it!!\" Greg gushed.  Greg's mom led him into the Spa.  They walked up to the reception area.  \"Hi,\" Greg's mom said to the receptionist, \"I phoned, I have an appointment for Greg Hearst.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist looked up up the name and said, \"Yes I see you want everything and it's the all day treatment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that is right.\"  The receptionist summoned an attendant who was wearing an outfit that was similar to scrubs.  Greg was led away and Greg's mom left the spa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Greg,\" the attendant said, \"take off all your clothes and put on this robe.\"  The attendant left to let Greg get dressed in privacy.  She also left Greg some soft slippers in a pale yellow color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Greg was ready, the attendant returned.  \"I see you are going to have the full treatment.  You are very lucky.  When we are done with you, you will feel great from the top of your head to the tips of your toes.\"  The treatment started as soon as he entered the room to put on his robe.  It started with aroma therapy.  The entire facility was bathed in an aroma which was designed to relax and lift the spirits of the clients.  The walls were painted a soft blue to heighten the relaxation effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg was first led to a room with several chairs that looked like chairs at a beauty salon.  But this room was for the Kacoh Energising Facial.  A mixture of Cocoa, Orange and Lavender extracts was applied to his face to help resist stress.  Other all natural products were added to bring vitality to the face and then other oils are used to bring forth the energizing effect.  But the application of these products are just the beginning.  Once applied a twenty minute 45-step Modellage is used to stimulate and invigorate the skin and senses.  But Greg is still not done.  A self-warming mask is then applied which works in concert with the other ingredients to revitalize his face.  The essential facial is designed to restore energy and vigor.  His skin regained its vibrancy and glow with health.  It took over an hour and Greg loved every minute of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this was just the beginning of his treatment.  The next phase of his treatment was the deep tissue full body massage.  This massage technique is aimed to relieve the deep set stress and muscle tension. The attendant started with deep rhythmic pressure massage which gave the whole body a vigorous workout. Specially blended massage oils were added during the massage.  This treatment was adjusted to suit Greg's individual needs.  This treatment also took an hour to complete.  Greg was completely naked for this treatment and he didn't mind at all even thought the treatment was administered by a pretty young woman.  He luxuriated in the treatment along with the soothing music that was specifically chosen for Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg then had what was known as the aroma stone therapy.  Warm stones were placed on key energy points of his body which evoked and aura of warmth and well-being.  The stones and fragrant essential oils were used to massage the body using traditional techniques to ease the pain and tension of aching muscles as well as deeply relaxing and rebalancing the mind and body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg then received the immaculate manicure and pedicure.  Applied to both hands and feet, the treatment begins with a massage of each digit of each hand and foot followed by a massage of the whole appendage.  His hands and feet are then left to soak in their unique mixture of natural ingredients.  Once the skin is properly softened  Greg's hands and feet were exfoliated and his nails where properly shaped and painted in a color chosen for his specific skin tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all the major massages were done, then individualize treatments were done to relax and invigorate Greg's specific problem areas.  Personal grooming and stray tanning was applied to give him a soft even skin tone from head to foot.  He was then brought into a large warm mud bath to relax any tensions that still might be left.  A refreshing shower ended the treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg had been pampered for almost six hours.  When he left he was feeling great.  This was the best gift if not the best day of his life.  Greg's mom was waiting in the reception room.  When he came out, he ran into his mom's arms and hugged her.  He loved her so much for giving him such a great gift on his birthday.  Miss Konner thought she had received the best gift on her birthday (when it came) she had received the newest XBox with four of her favorite games.</span></div></div>",

Rebecca was talking with some friends, she had probably planned it that way.  Karen had to wait, but eventually Karen drove to Rebecca's house.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren was very hard, but she tried to control herself.  At this point she didn't care about foreplay, but she knew how important it was and liked millions of men before her she went through the motions of foreplay.  Now that she had a dick with a raging hard-on foreplay didn't seem important to her anymore.  Karen did everything she could to keep it moving along.  She needed to get out of her clothes, well at least her pants (and her panties) and get Rebecca out of her panties.  Karen was still mostly a woman.  She still looked like herself which included her breasts and her rounded hips and narrow waist.  The only thing that made her a man was the raging penis between her legs.  But since Karen had takes John's 'social life' Rebecca saw Karen as her boyfriend and she loved her as much as she loved John.  Besides Karen was now a man where it counted in Rebecca's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actual sex didn't take very long, Karen was just too excited. Karen ejaculated inside Rebecca and it felt great.  But as with most boys once Karen was done the feeling passed quickly.  Karen was done and she had to go.  Now with the deed done, she could think more clearly.  She had to get her genitals (and other stuff) back from John and return home.  She wanted to see how 'Alex' did in the first grade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Karen left, she got an idea.  She took out the PAID and pointed it at Rebecca, she then swapped her libido with Rebecca.  Rebecca now has John's libido which means she is sexually attracted to herself.  Karen thought it was funny.  Rebecca was such a stuck up bitch she deserved not only to be attracted to women like a man, but it was delicious that Rebecca would be totally sexually attracted to herself.  Karen knew how intense her feelings were and now Rebecca would have them for herself.</span></div></div>",

You had to wing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mandy, did you do your homework last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you get for the forth question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know what the question was.  So you said, \"Let me look.\"  Then you opened your backpack and looked for the work.  It took some doing, but you found it.  Looking at the question (which was pretty simple to you obviously) you then looked at the answer and made sure it was right.  Then you told her what you found.  The girl was happy that she got the same answer as you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty soon the bus pulled up to the school.  You assumed that this girl was in your class.  You didn't know her name and you couldn't ask her.  But you thought it would be best to stay with this girl.  She would know where to stand or where to go to get to class.  You didn't know how this is supposed to work.  You hadn't been in first grade for almost a decade.  You seem to remember you waiting outside in some sort of line, but was that the first grade or only kindergarden.  You didn't know so staying with this girl would be a good idea.  So you followed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and this girl grouped up with a couple other girls.  You hoped they were your friends, er Amanda's friends, too.  The good thing was that these girls called the first girl by name, Michelle, so now you at least knew what this girls name was.  The three girls started talking about this and that.  They talked about toys, cartoons and kids you didn't know.  You faked it the best you could.  After a while you got into it and there was no problem.  Everything was going well, but you had just one more hurdle to overcome actually going to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the time came and you followed Michelle and entered the school.  Your heart was beating.  You didn't know what could happen to you if people knew what was really going on.  You entered the school and nothing strange happened.  Then you continued on to the classroom.  You entered the room and waited for everyone to take a seat.  Once everyone was seated you saw three seats.  You pick one and hope.  Then you take out your books like everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mandy,\" the teacher Miss Konner says but you didn't know what her name was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why aren't you in your seat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" you said.  Then you moved to another seat.  There was a fifty/fifty chance and this time you found the right seat.  In your right seat, you sat down and got to work.  Everything seemed fine.  You smiled to yourself as far as everything was concerned you belonged here.  It didn't matter that you were taller by at least two feet than every other student.  It didn't matter that even though all your friends were girls you were obviously a boy in every way.  Nothing mattered.  Amanda's life was now your life and you decided to sit back and simply enjoy it.  You made a promise to yourself not to use the PAID again.  You smiled to yourself.  Her life was a mystery to you.  You didn't know who her friends were or how to react.  You decided that living her life was going to be a wonderful adventure and thought, \"This is going to be fun.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You sit in class and everything is normal.  But it's all quite boring.  The work is easy and the interests of your friends are 'silly' to you.  You didn't know what having Amanda's 'Life' really meant.  You look at yourself and you clearly see that you are still a man (well a sixteen-year-old boy but who is quibbling)  You are still wearing the same male clothes.  The work is so easy, so your intelligence hasn't changed.  Before school your friends talked about childish, girly things and you didn't know anything about them or even cared.  But Amanda's mom wouldn't let you wait at the bus stop alone and you are in this classroom and no one is freaking out so you seem to have Amanda's 'Life'.  You are only called Mandy or Amanda because you actually had to switch 'Name's with her too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to activate the PAID to see what having Amanda's 'Life' entails.  You pull out the PAID and you see the big categories: Body, Clothing, Life, Personality, Personal Info.  You swapped 'Life' so you still have your own Body, Clothing, Personality and Personal Info.  But if not those things what did you really switch.  You follow the menu down under 'Life' and you see the subcategories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first on the list is 'Responsibilities'  That must be why you are in school.  You have her responsibilities which means you have to go to her school, that is what she is responsible for.  You probably have other responsibilities at home, but  you suppose going to school is the most important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next on the list is \"Relationships.'  You are intrigued so you follow this choice down and see you now have her 'Family', 'Friends,' 'Acquaintances.' and \"Other'.  This is why all of Amanda's friends think they are you friend even though you have nothing in common with them, not gender or age.  The Other is probably is for important people in her life such as the teacher, doctors and such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next is 'Rights.'  You could look but this is is probably the things that you are allowed to do.  But also in this category is what you are not allowed to do.  This is why your 'Mom' couldn't leave you alone at the bus stop.  You assume that it also meant that you can't be left alone without a baby sitter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Activities' is next.  These are the things that Amanda does on a daily basis.  You know that Amanda belongs to girl scouts and so now you have that activity too.  But because your personality hadn't changed you probably won't enjoy it.  Or if you do, it'll be for an entirely different reason.  You wonder if this is the real reason you are in this school, not 'Responsibilities.'   It might be a combination of both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Expectations' is last.  This isn't what you expect, but it is the expectations of others.  This is how people treat you.  When people see you, they treat you like a little girl even though you look like a teenaged boy.  This is why Amanda's friends include you as one of them.  This is why boys in the class might pick on you even though you could pick them and throw them across the room or the teacher treating you like any other student.  This is also the most insidious of all the choices.  It is because of this if you act in any way outside the expectations of the people around you there could be hell to pay.  If you get up and leave the classroom and the school, the police will be notified and they will bring you back.  If you enter a store and try and buy anything, even if you had the money they won't sell it to you, they will look for an 'adult.'  Adults will patronize you as if you are just a little kid.  They will ignore what you say and pat you on the head and say 'Good Girl.'  This is what it is to have Amanda's life and you have no choice to live it until (if you want to) you get swap your own life.  You discover that having Amanda's life has more to do with how people treat you than anything that you actually do or feel yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Cool, eh?\", she grinned and looked at the business suit from all angles. You shook your head. \"No, you're my husband.\". You then looked down at yourself and admired your mom's former skirt suit.

You've got to turn me on.\", you grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren licked her lips. \"Okay, if my beautiful wife says so.\", she said and began dancing in front of you although more like a woman than a man but oh well, she had the body to dance like that so you did not mind the this slight inaccuracy of the roleplay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren continued her erotic dance and soon was only wearing your dad's boxers. \"That's more like it.\", you said smiling and looked at her naked chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at you. \"Now it's your turn.\", she said impatiently.

It was an epoch in which women wearing pants were still seen as odd and the old pair had stuck to those view through the years. Now you and Karen have those views, making you feel out of place in the clothes you had on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think we could swap clothes with them, dear? I really feel odd in this,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes honey, I was going to suggest it as well,\u201d says Karen as you both point at the pair, bringing up the PAID\u2019s display and clicking on clothes. After the PAID had done its job you feel much more comfortable, looking down you see that you\u2019re now wearing a below-the-knees pink flower-print dress, a white shawl and white flats. You now feel oddly comforted by the feel of a brassiere wrapped around your chest and your new [to you] *granny panties*. <br>\r\n\u201cThis is much better,\u201d states Karen as she tightens the knot on the tie she now wore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would have to agree dear, this feels much more comfortable and you look very handsome. Do you think we should continue changing with them or find others altogether?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should\u2026..\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Its been too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really has, Alex.\" she says as she returns the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come into the living room, you need to meet Olivia.\" you tell her as you lead her and your mother into said room. Karen was sitting on the sofa, though the game she was watching was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Diane.\" she says as she stands up and greets them.\"And you too, Caroline. Haven't seen you since the wedding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Karen.\" your mother say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you again, too.\" Caroline says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And say hello to you little niece, Olivia.\" you say as you walk up to them with Olivia in your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shes just adorable!\" Carline says as she walks up to you and admires the baby you held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" you say as you hand the baby to her. \"Say hello to your Aunt Caroline, Olivia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shes even cuter up close.\" she says, and Olivia giggles happily. \"She definitely takes after her mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of adoring Olivia, Caroline returns her to you. \"So where are we going, mom?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how about we let Caroline choose, since she just got back.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, how about we head to my favorite place downtown, that is if its still around.\" Caroline says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that place? Yes, its still around. And that sounds good to me.\" you tell her. they then head outside, and  Caroline gets into your mother's car with her. You look into the driveway of your house, and their were two other cars. One was a blue convertable that you knew was yours, and the other was a silver one that belonged to Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Karen, we can drive, right?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe think for a bit, and then says. \"I think so. Looks like when we switched some stuff earlier, we also learned how to drive.\" she then reaches into the pocket of her pants, and pulls out a set of keys. \"I'll drive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then.\" you say as you hang your purse over your shoulder, then but Olivia into a carrier. You then head out to the silver car, and put Olivia's carrier into the seat for it, then get into the passenger's side. Karen then starts up the car, and you follow behind your mother's car to your destination.</span></div></div>",

Karen however, looks just fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt school, you begin talking to a lot of her friends, and most of them seem either disappointed in the way you neglect them for other activities, while the rest seem upset as if they believe that you owe them something in return for whatever they've given or done for you. <br>\r\nIt begins to sink into your mind. 'My girlfriend is a bad person.' With that thought you are now in the realization that you have her life, and she has yours.

You're a big fat puss!\" \"Well, there is one thing I've always been curious about.\" You shyly admit as your face blushes and your nervous heart rate increases. \"What is that?\" Said Karen. \"Women have different lives, things work different for them, they deal with different issues..\" you begin, but are cut off by Karen saying \"But you already have my life!

You then catch sight of something on the ground and see its one of Karen's skirts. You can't help but wonder how it would look on you. You shake your head. You still think like yourself for the most part, which causes a bit of conflict with your new interests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Alex,\" you say, not catching that you just called Karen by your own name, but she doesn't catch it either as she answers to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Karen?\" Karen says, now also calling you by her old name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With my intersts now, are you getting any thoughts about wearing any specific clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. I guess I'd just wear whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well, thanks to your old interest in fashion, I can't help but want to try on some of your clothes.\" you say, a bit embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren giggles a bit before saying...</span></div></div>",

The boy is obnoxious as ever and his older sister complains.  But their parents tell the girl to be the more mature one.  She wanted to hit him, but she didn't.  She wasn't afraid of his taller/bigger stature, she was just a nice girl and nice girls don't hit<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to try something else.

You discovered that even though you were now physically a little boy you were treated like the sixteen year old that you felt inside.  The family did switch a little bit.  Your sister was now your little sister and you were expected to watch over her while in the crowded mall.  You found that being part of this family wasn't much different than being part of your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were thinking of swapping something with your new little sister to see what that was like then you heard an announcement on the loud speaker, \"Will Mrs. Elizabeth Williams come to security.  We have a little guy who is looking for you.\"  Elizabeth Williams was your real mother's name.  You wondered why she had been paged.  When you swapped with the little boy, he simply wondered off distracted by something he saw in a window.  He walked the mall alone for a little while and everyone perceived him as an eight year only not the sixteen year old he looked like.  But despite that no one bothered the little boy, assuming that his mother was nearby.  Eventually the little boy himself realized that he didn't know where his mother was.  He panicked and started to cry.  Security was called and he was brought to the office.  They asked him what his mother's name was and he told them 'Elizabeth Williams' which was the truth since you had swapped families.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth Williams wasn't in the mall of course.

After ten minutes of reading, you decide that you will buy it, and then repeat the process a few more times before taking what you have decided to buy to the register, walking by holding the books to your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why I've never done much reading.\" you wonder to yourself. \"Books are just so interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the register, you hand what you have chosen to the clerk. \"Will that be all, young man?\" thhe woman st the register asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am.\" you reply softly. She tells you the price, and you pull out the funds necessarry from your bag, then place the books that you've purchased in it. After that, you head out of the store and decide to go for a walk around the mall for a bit. After a bit, you come to a bench and sit down, and decide to read one of the books you have purchased. You sit there for a long time, becoming engrossed in the book you bought, a very thick novel. After a long time, you finally set the book aside for a second, and then you notice something.</span></div></div>",

Why are you just standing there?\" Amanda asked her sister, but got no response. The two of them thn started to walk back inside while starring blankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex?

However, it was too late, and as soon as Matt touched it, the ball glowed a bit again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it started to glow, a girl older than Alex and Karen, followed by a young man walked outside. \"What are you guys doing out here?\" Stephanie asked. \"Shouldn't you all-\" she was cut off as a light shone out, and went over each of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-SCANNING SUBJECTS-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" Zack said as the mechanical voice started<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-SCANNING COMPLETE-<br>\r\n-SUBJECTS REGISTERED-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was then another flash, and they all blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho are you now?</span></div></div>",

We had our old clothes on I dont like when mommy yells at me\" She says on the verge of tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be the PAID Kate she thinks you have always dressed like a teenage boy and I a 7 year old girl. This is crazy\" The idea of you dressing like a little girl made Kate smile and stopped her from crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Alex we should get dressed like mommy said I dont want her to yell anymore\" Just then an idea popped into your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kate put on the night gown again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What no way mommy will yell at me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kate have you noticed Daddy's nice pressed suits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I like his ties and his shing belt buckle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldnt you like to dress like Dad? You could wear all of his fun ties and belt buckels.\" You see a shimering light in Kate's eye and she nodds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you could dress like mommy and wear her preety dresses it will be like a fun game of dress up\" Your not eniterly sure that Kate get the fact that no one will notice the change but she gets the general point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will be even more funny Alex\" She says while putting back on the over sized night gown. The two of you walk back down stairs dressed as you were before and when your mom turned around you activated your PAID. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a strange but yet very interesting if not comfortable experience. You couldn't deny you didn't enjoy wearing your moms soft panties, even her bra was kind of comfortable but very alien to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked over to your sister. She didn't looked any better right now than you were. There was standing a seven year old girl in khaki pants, a shirt and tie, formerly your fathers courtesy, right next to a 16 year old boy, wearing a silk blouse, black skirt and flats. It should be a very odd sight and people would break into big laughter, but due to the magical devices called PAID everyone, except those two and anyone who claims such a device his own, thinks nothing strange from this look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda creepy...\", you mumbled and your sister responded with an asking face. You just shook your head and sat down on the kitchen table. \"Never-mind.\". The little girl, dressed as a grown-up man, just shrugged her shoulders and sat down as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long and this bizarre duo was accompanied by another duo, not stranger as the others are. In came a tall man, wearing a pink skirt with a flower motive on it, pink tights, a pink unicorn shirt and a cute, small ribbon in his hair. The view was very ridiculous and it was a wonder this man even fit into such clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight behind him was a blond woman, clad simply in a boyish bathrobe and boxers. It seemed she didn't even bother being topless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you would be concerned by the clothes these people, your parents, were wearing but thanks to the PAID nearly nobody would notice anyway, so why not just take the opportunity? You couldn't deny that the two were looking rediculously funny, just as you and your sister were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced over to your sister while eating breakfast with the family and could see that she was enjoying these changes aswell. You noticed she had a very hard time not to break out in laughter as your dad, dressed as a little girl went into the kitchen, but now she was more interested in her own new clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile eating with one hand her cereals, she played with her other hand with her tie and the shiny belt buckle which were now rightfully hers. You could read easily in her face that she wouldn't want to change back very soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis thought brought you to yourself. You weren't quite sure if you wanted to change back soon as well. You really enjoyed all the air hitting against your hairy legs and the softness of your panties. You suddenly noticed that you began rubbing over your skirt covered panties while thinking about that and you must admit: You liked the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also thought about all the different dresses, skirts and shoes which were now rightfully yours. You surley weren't the crossdressing type and you hadn't even thought about this until now, but now that you got the opportunity...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slight grin after you finished breakfast, you started to making plans and thinking about what you should wear next, but suddenly remembered that you had to get to school. You were very eager in \"playing dress up\", but you couldn't afford missing more classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down at your PAID. With this you could switch jobs with your mom. She was a stay-at-home mother and so you could start little play in about half an hour when everybody else was either in school or at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be interesting to wear the clearly female outfit you were wearing right now out in public aswell. Especially at school. You were very interested at how people would react to you. You were interested in how the PAID changed reality so everyone would think it was normal for you to were women's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to...</span></div></div>",

Finally she vocalized her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to swap jobs with mom, so I can stay at home, while she goes to school.\", you explained to her while navigating through the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to stay at home?\", your sister repeated, \"That's not fair. I want to stay at home, too.\". She looked as angry as a little girl could look and you noticed that she was nearly crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed and looked at her. \"We can't both stay at home. Everyone else in here is either going to work or school. Mom is the only one of us four who can stay at home because of her job.\", you explained to her. You could see she was definetely not satisfied with this answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed again. \"You could switch with dad and go to his job. Maybe you would find this more interesting than going to school.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate thought about it for a short while and then nodded. \"Okay.\". She said with a big smile and began using her PAID on Dad while you finished the swap between you and your mom and pressed enter. Time didn't resume immedeatly because your sister was still using hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was finished time resumed and you saw how your mother stood up. \"We have to hurry.\", she said to your girlfriend. \"If we want to drop off Kate at work and then don't be late to school, we have to go now.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mrs. Williams.\", Karen said and came over to you. \"Have fun here at home. See you after school.\", she said to you while wrapping her arms around your neck and kissing you. She then followed your mom, accompanied by Stephanie and Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and winked after them. \"Have fun at school, sweetheart.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, your dad went to his car aswell, followed by Matt and Amanda. \"We're heading to school as well. Bye, Alex.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now alone. Free to do what you want and when your mom returned home you could simply switch back, so you don't have to do anything right now and can't get into trouble. After all your mom didn't do her chores afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a happy smile you walked upstairs into your room and opened the wardrobe. You were astonished by all the clothes which were in there. Your mom really had a lot of clothes... and shoes. On the bottom of your wardrobe you could find at least a dozen of shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grin you looked into your drawer and found all your moms... no wait, your panties and bras. You even found stockings and a garter belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began undressing. You let your skirt slide down your legs and drop it down on the floor. You stepped out, kicking your flats off. Lastly, you opened your blouse and throw it onto your bed. You now stood there in your room, not wearing anything than your mothers former underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took up your garter belt and fastened it around your waist. Then you took the stockings, sat down on your bed, sitting halfway on your blouse. You slid the stockings over your hairy legs and fastened them on the garter belt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sexy.\", you said while rubbing over your legs. You stood up and walked over to your wardrobe. You took out a pair of black leather pumps and throw them on your bed. You then looked for a dress to wear. You were surprised you could find some slutty clothes that you have never seen your mom wearing. You shook your head. \"Later.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then decided to wear your mothers favorite blue dress which ende just above your knee and had a split on the right side. She only wore this dress if she was going to have a \"magical night\" with your dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked inside the small mirror in your room. You really liked how the dress hugged your masculine form. It would look much better if you had a female body. You put on the pumps you had already thrown on your bed and stood up, standing unsteady on the heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a step and almost fell. \"Damn...\", you thought, \"I should have switched the ability to walk in heels as well.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you stepped over to your window and looked outside. You were very lucky, just in front of your house was a woman in a tight red dress and 2-inch heel pumps walking down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou activated the PAID and switched the ability to walk in heels and time resumed. The woman suddenly fell. You could hear her cursing and wondering why she put on heels, even though she couldn't walk in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and took a short walk around your room, standing like an expert on the heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you didn't know, the PAID glitched and did another swap with the woman. What did it swap?</span></div></div>",

You walked over to it, your heels clicking seductively on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\", you asked as you picked up the phone. \"Hey, Heather, it's me.\". You immediatly recognized the voice on the other end as the voice of your girlfriend Karens. You didn't find it strange she called you Heather and not Alex, because of the glitch swap the PAID made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there.\", you greeted back. \"Why are you calling? You have school.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We haven't arrived, yet and I remembered that I wanted to ask you if you could go over to the store and buy me some Spaghetti Bologna. You know how I love it and if you would cook it for me for dinner. It would be very cool of you and maybe I can repay it to you tonight.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou loved the idea of having a great night with your girlfriend. \"Alright, I'll go buy some for you. See you later then, I got to hurry if I want to get my work done and get you your Spaghetti Bologna.\". You both hang up and you looked at yourself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis could be your opportunity to go outside and show the world what you now wear but not what you were wearing right now. It was way to inappropriate to wear such a dress. So you got over to your wardrobe and look for something more appropriate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ruffled through your wardrobe which was full of new clothes which you expected you would never wear in your whole life. But still you stood there in a situation completely alien but still very real for you: You looked for something feminine to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you decided to wear a red blouse, a brown leather skirt, dark pantyhose and 1-inch heeled black boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked inside your mirror and decided you looked well and could go out but you had one problem: Your skirt didn't have any pockets were you could store your money and cell phone. \"If I always wear dresses or skirts which usually don't have pockets... And by the looks of it I wear make-up as well...\", you thought while looking through your room and suddenly saw all sorts of make on your desk which you hadn't noticed before, \"This could mean that... Gotcha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou picked up a small red purse which hang on your doorknob. You looked inside it and found your money, ID cards, cell phone and money in it. You took a look at your ID card and smiled. On the picture you saw yourself with a slight amount of make-up and a flowery blouse. The rest of the card was completely normal. Heather Williams, 16 years old and male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped for a second... Your first name seemed... strange... Was it really Heather? You remembered being Heather for all your life but yet... it seemed wrong. Wasn't your name something with A... Axel or something like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head must be your imagination and how could you just change your name anyway? If someone had switched something with you by using a PAID you would be asked if you would allow it, just like it was when you and your sister switched clothes this morning. And it wasn't like the PAID just switched something on its own. That would be ridiculous, wouldn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged your should and walked down and outside the house. Thanks to the ability to walk in heels you have swapped with the woman, you hadn't had any problems walking in your boots and you liked how the clicking sounded and how the boots felt on your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short walk you arrived at the local supermarket. You didn't live too far away from it so you could just walk over and get a few things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you arrived there you walked in and began looking for the Spaghetti Bologna your girlfriend wanted. It would be way easier if you hade swapped any skills with your mother regarding her work. You now found one problem in your beautiful plan: Even if you buy Spaghetti Bologna for your girlfriend... You weren't able to cook. You only intended to have your mothers job until she got home but now that you have to cook for your girlfriend for a beautiful evening with her, you weren't so sure if you girlfriend would have asked you in the first place if your job wouldn't contain making food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around. Somewhere you have to find someone who can cook. \"This couldn't be so difficult.\", you thought, \"After all, at this time most of the people who should be at the supermarket would be something to cook for their families.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spotted a woman in her mid-fourties and thought she would be a perfect victim to swap with, because she just looked like a loving mother who certainly could cook very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wanted to start the PAID instead of the usual interface you got just a clock ticking down from 6 minutes and 26 seconds. \"Strange...\", you thought, \"Maybe, it has a recharging time after a certain amount of swaps or something like that.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged your shoulders and continued your journey through the supermarket, looking for the Spaghetti Bologna. You could swap the ability to cook after the time limit anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou...</span></div></div>",

Victoria Blake was a housewife as well, like most of the wives in your neighborhood for some odd reason. The area you lived in tended to be a bit old-fashioned and apart from a couple of wives who worked from home, most of the wives there tended to be traditional homemakers. Victoria was part of \u201cThe Girls\u201d, the group of women who were basically the de facto government of the community. They organized all the activities, parties and events there and made sure everything ran perfectly according to the community guidelines. As usual, she was dressed in an impeccable and fashionable dress, a teal number with a high neckline, a slim white belt around her waist, wide hem skirt and tasteful 2\u201d heeled pumps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Heather, I haven\u2019t seen you since your sister\u2019s last birthday, how have you been?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, thank you Mrs. Blake, how about yourself?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Mrs. Blake is my mother-in-law, just call me Victoria. You\u2019re basically part of the housewife club anyways,\u201d she said, making you blush a bit. \u201cYour mom and I were talking about it the other night, she mentioned that you\u2019re often all alone during the day while everyone else is at school or work and we figured you could join the rest of The Girls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s so very kind of you,\u201d you replied, more than amazed by the power of the PAID to warp reality. Here you were, a 16-year-old boy, in your mother\u2019s clothes, playing at being a housewife, speaking to your mother\u2019s traditionalist friend who saw nothing wrong with the situation. \u201cWell, some of us are meeting in a little bit at Trish\u2019s house to discuss the next fundraiser and you\u2019re welcome to come. I\u2019m actually here to pick some ingredients for my famous Grand Marnier Souffl\u00e9, you have to try it, it\u2019s to die for.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat gave you an idea. You quickly activated the PAID, scrolled through the menu and swapped cooking skills. Reality started to flow again once you\u2019d accepted the change and Victoria looked at you pleadingly. \u201cWe would be so grateful if you\u2019d join us and bring one of your amazing dishes, you are just such an amazing cook and we\u2019ll love to have your skill in the group. I know it\u2019s short notice, but I\u2019m sure you can whip something up, what do you say?\u201d she pleads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a slight rush of confidence knowing that you\u2019d gained Victoria\u2019s cooking skills; which were not inconsiderable. As a point, you wanted to show off just how good a cook you were. \u201cSounds great Victoria, I\u2019ll make something delicious for the girls, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll see you all in a little bit.\u201d Victoria smiled, and left you to finish your shopping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter grabbing more things than you\u2019d planned when you walked into the store, you paid and headed back home to cook something before heading to meet with the The Girls.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Trish Howard was, the youngest of The Girls, bubbly and perennially upbeat. \u201cLadies, Heather is here and she brought us something delicious!\u201d Trish announced to the group inside. Instantly a small swarm of women rushed over to greet you and to enthuse over the delicacy you\u2019d brought over. You reveled in the attention as they all tried your dish and you explained how you\u2019d cooked it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria was clearly the leader of the group, but she was not quite as assertive as you remembered her being. You recognized most of the women, apart from Victoria and Trish, there were Amber, Marie, Stephanie and Cassandra. Amber was in her early 30s, with classic Irish looks, redheaded, freckled and hot tempered. Marie was a French ex-pat, in her early 40s, always dressed in the latest fashion, but she always made you feel like there was more to her below the surface. Stephanie was the definition of a trophy wife, with all the enhancements that came with the title, but her husband\u2019s wealth had endeared her with the group. Cassandra was a in her early 50s, but could have passed for a woman 10 years younger, with dark, luxurious hair, statuesque physique and razor sharp features, with glimmering blue eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all enjoy the food each one had brought and chat for a bit, but you feel out of place and out of step with the group.

Before you step out of the car, you take a moment to make sure your lip stick is touched up just right, and that all of your gear is in your tennis bag, then you walk out towards your waiting friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Elenore Hopkins was the oldest of the group, nearly fifty years old, but still in great shape. In a lot of ways, she played older sister for the whole group of your friends, always ready with a gentle piece of advice, or a ready laugh when you were feeling down. Her husband Jack Hopkins had been your father's supervisor years back, and you'd been friends ever since you met back then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Diane Conway on the other hand, was a great deal closer to your mom's age, and about an even match for her in terms of athletic ability. She wasn't obsessive like Mrs. Hopkins was about staying in shape, but then, she hadn't had any kids either, and it showed in the way she effortlessly maintained her trim figure. Her long red hair had faded, and wasn't as bright as it used to be, but she wasn't the kind to fuss on dyes or fancy styles. Of them all, you could count on Diane to be ready for whatever fun anyone had in mind, and more often than not, she was the cheerleader getting your group to go on some outing or other. You always had a great time with her, but sometimes you wonder if she'd be quite as care free if she'd had a few kids of her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last member of your group stuck out like a sore thumb. Miranda Willow had married your father's current boss barely six months ago, and while some people might say she loved him dearly, there was little doubt about where the marriage had come from. At twenty four years of age, she was less than half her husband's age, and it was clear that she'd married his money at least as much as she'd married the man. But then, spending a few hours with Martin Willow would tell you that while he might say he loved the younger woman, he loved her immense bust and trim figure more. Rumor had it that she'd been an exotic dancer before Martin found her, and that their courtship had only lasted a few months before they were wed. Still, once you got past how different she was from the rest of you, you couldn't help but admit that she really did play well with the group. In many ways, she'd been received as the younger step sister... and her bubbly personality made it hard to resent the blond bombshell for being what she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you consider forgetting about the PAID, and just losing yourself in a good game of tennis, but the temptation to trade something with one of your best friends is to great to resist....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho do you swap with?</span></div></div>",

Although it doesn't have the same inflection as Miranda's, it certainly is not the voice you are used to hearing. Not wanting to draw more undue attention to yourself, you steady yourself and thank Diane for her help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeen to check out your new body, you excuse yourself from the group while they set aside a court for your game and head to the nearest bathroom. After quickly checking that you are alone you lock the door and begin your examination. Before anything else you confirm the groups suspicions that Miranda's (now your) boobs are the product of a breast enhancement surgery. Also, although you cannot be certain without exchanging some personal information with Miranda, you are pretty sure that  the lips reflected in the mirror are filled with collagen and that your buttocks has more than just natural padding.It seemed like your new body had been under the knife more than a few times.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring that your friends have waited too long already and that you'll have time for a closer examination later, you head out of the restroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do next?</span></div></div>",

Sprinting quickly to return the serve you marveled at how much your newly enhanced breasts bounced, even within the sports bra you were wearing. Also distracting was the way your expanded rear end jiggled with each step. You returned the serve, barely, but Miranda used your old teenage body to full advantage, giving you a real run for your money as she powered ball after ball back at you, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first game she won with ease, but as you played more, the body you'd gained from her felt more and more familiar. The second game you won by a hair, and the third game became an all out death match. Elenore and Diane both stopped their own match to watch you two as you lobbed every shot back at her, the pair of you seeming very evenly matched. In the end, you won, but it was very much a close thing, and could easily have gone to the other woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to go Alex!\" Diane said as she walked out to hand you a towel. \"I didn't think you could move that fast, as much weight as you lug around up there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on now,\" Elenore teased. \"They can't weigh more than one ton each. Besides, if they weren't that big, he'd never distract poor Miranda over there enough to win!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha,\" Miranda laughed. \"Soo not my type. I've only got eyes for my snookums, and you all know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh,\" you said, not really believing it any more than the others did. \"Sure you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Alex,\" Elenore said. \"Your victory, your pick.

It\u2019s just too expensive,\u201d you moaned. \u201cOh, nonsense, what better way to celebrate your husband\u2019s promotion than by reminding him of the gorgeous wife he has and how amazing she looks in couture,\u201d chimed Miranda, unknowingly voicing how she usually rationalized her expensive purchases when she had the body to indulge in high fashion. \u201cShe\u2019s right Alex, and do you think Nicolas is going to have a chance to complain about the price when he sees you in that?\u201d added Diane, echoing how she used manipulate her former husband, albeit with a less impressive arsenal at her disposal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, alright, I see your point, now we have to move on to finding outfits for all of you \u2026 preferably before you corrupt me further,\u201d you tell them, winking as you strike yet another pose in front of the mirror.

The drapes stopped their gentle sway in the wind and sounds fell away until you were left in a perfectly still room. Around you, holographic menus sprung into being, one after another as Elizabeth quickly navigated the menus, making her selections. Moments later, a screen appeared directly in front of you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another PAID user would like to exchange \"Personal Info: Taste in Music\" with you. Do you accept: Y/N\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached out, a mix of hesitation and excitement causing your heart to race as you tapped the Yes button. \"Is it always like that?\" You ask Elizabeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not always, but when two PAID users swap anything, we both have to agree. It stops people from getting into a swap back and forth sort of tug-a-war.\" Tapping the 'Exit' button, Alex's mom returned time to normal before looking at you with a grin. \"So, who's your favorite band?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same as it was before... I know Bon Jovi isn't exactly trendy at the moment, but I still have the hugest crush.... OMG! It did work! Bon Jovi... Poison... Ozzy before the drugs really destroyed him.... they're all the bands that were popular when you were my age!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see how it works? Isn't it cool? But speaking of when I was younger, I have an idea. I would take it as a <i>huge</i> favor if you would let me set this one up, and I promise, it would only be for as long as you enjoyed it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... That's an awe full lot of preface to an idea Mrs. Williams.... Should I be scared?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. It's just that, I haven't had a great deal of time to spend with Alex lately. I mean, Zack is already off at college most of the time, and well, between school and his busy social life... I just don't get to hang out with him as much as I used to, I know he's still got a few years before college himself, but, I guess I'm empty nesting a bit. Anyway, I was thinking.... I'd really like to get a chance to spend some more time with him, maybe for a week or two. So, how would you feel about swapping spouses? Alex would be my boyfriend, and you would be married to Steven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" you say, thinking of all of the things that would change in your life. \"But... wouldn't people think that's weird?  You'd be dating your own son...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I can take care of that. We'll trade a few more things... if we trade 'jobs' then you become a stay at home mom, and I become a high school student, which will probably work for the best anyway,\" Elizabeth answered with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, isn't that basically trading lives then?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, this way, you're still related to your family, your brothers and sisters are still your brothers and sisters... it's just that <i>you're</i> the one who married Steven and had Zack,  Alex and Kate... while I'm the <i>much</i> younger sister of my own sister Carol. I just happen to still be in high school, and to have fallen for Alex. Lots of the rest of your life will still be the same. Same friends, unless you want to trade those too, same interests... just a different role and a different love interest. So, what do you think? Like I said, it'd only be for as long as you wanted it to last, I completely understand if you wanted to change back quickly. I'd like to do it for a week or two, but it's all up to you. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right... it sounds like a lot of fun. And I could use a week or two out of school. But, after we do this, if I want to use my own PAID, can I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you can, just try to keep track of things so you don't get too lost. I find it handy to keep a journal, that way, if there's something you traded away, you can go track it back down. Okay, are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready Mrs Williams....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please,\" she said pressing buttons. \"Call me Elizabeth... after all, in just a moment, you'll be Mrs. Williams!\"</span></div></div>",

Mrs. Williams typed in her PAID 'trade wardrobe' and was excited to use it for the first time. Also looking forward to get into Liz's clothes. Since the trade she didn't feel right wearing teenage clothes. It was like she felt as if she always was a mother and wife and it only felt as if it were a dream that she was once her now sons girlfriend. \" I was thinking Liz. It's kinda weird to me that I'm a teenage but a mother. What would you say that on top of switching wardrobes we also trade ages\" Mrs. Williams asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a great idea!\" Liz smiled as she thought to herself that becoming younger would only make these next few days even better. Who knows maybe Karen might want to stay like this a bit longer. After the PAID did it's work, the two woman looked down at their new bodies. Karen unbuttoned a few of the buttons of her blouse she was wearing, seeing that her breasts had grown with age. \"Wow! Alittle sagging but my tits are at least two sizes bigger\" Karen said with glee. She had gained a few pounds and her hair lost it's shine with a few gray hairs but she loved her new look as she ran her hands up her new curves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz on the other hand was even more please. Her back pains were gone. Her breasts are smaller but more perky and gone were the gray hairs. \"Mrs. Williams this is the best day ever!\" Liz said as she ran over to the wall mirror. She was amazed as she looked at her new body dressed in a tight v neck that showed off her perky breasts and short shorts that highlighted her new smooth tan legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Ok Liz off to school! My sons waiting outside for you\" Karen stated as the two hugged and Liz ran out the door. Once Liz left Karen jumped up and down with joy \"This is great no more school!\" She realized that after jumping that her joints hurt just alittle. \"I guess that's the price I pay for being older now, I think I can deal with that\" Just then she heard the house phone ringing and walked into her new kitchen. \"Hello may I ask who's speaking\" Karen stated trying to act like the mature mother she now was. \" Hi hunny it's Jake, I'll be home in a few minutes. My boss called and said he didn't need me.\" Karens new husband said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ok um dear that's great news. I'll see you soon\" Karen hung up the phone a smile came across her face. She new she was once with Alex but she had the memories of the old Mrs. Williams. She remembered how she met Jake and their wedding day. It was like it was her life all along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to have some fun with my husband when he gets home, I am now married after all\" Mrs. Williams said as she was checking out her new mature body </span></div></div>",

Sure, he might not be one of the buff high school studs, and he wasn't one of the popular guys either, but that didn't matter. The two of you really clicked, and that was exactly as it should be. You were glad you'd also traded ages with the Paid. While it could have made people think it was normal for a 40 year old to be in high school and dating a 16 year old, it was so much easier for people to think you were sixteen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing around the bus though, you began to get very self conscious. It had been a long time since you'd felt anything but pride in your figure, but next to some of the barely dressed high school girls, you were becoming more and more conscious of the soft midsection, the wide thighs and the sagging breasts. You were in great shape for forty, but not in great shape fir sixteen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen too, you realized that you'd forgotten to change your wardrobe, which might have been a blessing. Wearing Mrs. Williams' ... er, Karen's hip hugger jeans and crop top shirts would have made your flaws painfully obvious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMot that Alex minded any of it, he seemed very happy to snuggle up to you just as you were. But still, seeing some of the other girls on the bus made you think of using your Paid again to make a few changes... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky Lang for example was a very good looking brunette with a girl next door kind of face and a trim figure that was neither obsessively fit nor beach bunny sexy... she was just a well developed pretty teenage girl. The fact that she had great fashion sense and wore a short skirt that showcased her smooth legs and shapely ass so well didn't hurt, any more than the deep scoop neck of her shirt didn't do anything to impact male eyes and their inability to look her in the face for more than ten seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough if you glanced away from Becky, your eyes quickly landed on Heather Petry, a cute, bubble headed blond with long curly hair and a stunning figure. She was an absolute ditz, a second year senior in danger of flunking out of high school all together, but none of that seemed to bother her. Rumor had it that she'd gotten a boob job for her 18th birthday, and that her parent's were rich enough to not care what she did with her life. She was always dressed well in the latest designer trends, and today her white halter dress showed just how much she really did care. Every necklace, ear ring, and bracelet was carefully matched to the subtle print on the dress showing that even if she was a ditz about most things, she possessed an amazing sense of style and had an attention to detail that most didn't acquire till later in life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, who would Elizabeth use her PAID on?</span></div></div>",

When she\u2019d originally received it she had made quite a few swaps, but seeing the world frozen around her was truly amazing. A kid had thrown a crumpled ball of paper at someone else and it just hovered in place, and bird was stuck in mid-air like a floating statue. She scrolled through the menu options, tapping her finger against her chin as she thought of what she wanted to trade with Heather. Long ago she discovered that sometimes it was more fun to trade more than one thing at a time with someone. When she first got the paid she thought she had to swap things one a time, but she found out as she played with the device that she could long-press on attribute and select more than one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather\u2019s sexy, youthful and curvy body was the first thing she selected, then she settled on swapping her clothes as well. If she was going to have a bombshell body, why not have the clothes to show it off too? She confirmed the changed on the PAID\u2019s screen and it flicked for a moment. The world went back to normal, the paper ball hit a kid on the head, the bird flew away and everything moved like nothing had happened. Elizabeth looked down at her hands, noticing how perfectly manicured they were, she hadn\u2019t had time for a manicure in so long and suddenly she had perfect nails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex\u2019 hand rested on her thigh, stroking it absentmindedly as he scrolled through his social media feed on his phone with his other hand. It was amazing how she had switched bodies with one of the hottest girls in school and he didn\u2019t notice anything strange. Looking down at her new cleavage, which was barely contained by white, v-neck top and a light-pink, tailored jacket, and she had no doubt her current body was surgically enhanced. The jeans she was now wearing fit her like a second skin and she marveled at how incredible her legs looked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknown to Elizabeth the PAID had also swapped ___ with Heather.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You look up to see your own body tower over you looking concerned wearing an giant pair of girl's underwear and a nightshirt.<br>\r\n\"S-sorry Nate!\" Your voice says to you- or rather, it's the voice of your sister Emily in your body. She-He- offers a hand to you and you take it as you stand up.<br>\r\nYes... you've switched bodies. Were you really that tall? Mostly to your friends you were about average height among a group of tall guys. But from your sister's - err...your- perspective, you were quite tall. You rub your rear a little as the pain disappears.<br>\r\n\"It's ok.\" You mutter. This is all a bit weird still. Interesting though!  You accept Emily's hand up, and stand up to your new height. Strange, though it was disorienting at first, this isn't so bad.<br>\r\nSuddenly Emily in your old body turns with distraction.<br>\r\n\"Oh! That's right, I hafta hurry up to get ready for school!\" He complains.<br>\r\nHearing those words coming from your old voice is like murder to your ears. Especially with the ridiculous looking panties and nightshirt on.<br>\r\nYou point your arm at yourself again and time freezes.

What just happened?  The band on your arm is cooling off now, but you need to figure out what's going on.  You stop and think.

Error. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo....<br>\r\nYou look at your body and note you are now wearing the panties and nightshirt. It fits you rather well though. The airy boxers have been replaced with a much more snug and personal pair of panties with little peaches on them. They look a little childish you think, but at the same time...fitting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom's hand touches you on the head as she passes you. \"Come'on dear, time for you to get ready for school!\" <br>\r\n\"R-right.\" You manage to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting ready to school was...strange. You would have thought being a girl would have been quite different. But actually it wasn't. Well, you pulled on the skirt and school uniform shirt at least. It's not the prettiest thing, but you don't really have a lot of shape to show. <br>\r\n...Why was that a disappointing thought? You shake your head in frustration and walk out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing to elementary school isn't too bad actually. The building looks rather large- much larger than you remember it. But you decide that this could be interesting. After all, you still have your education and experience, so it could be fun to take today as a 'vacation' and just switch back in the evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter into the building, making sure to wave goodbye to your mom. <br>\r\nWhen you enter school though, you realize you don't remember what classroom your little sister is in.  Well, easy problem solving there! You could always just ask another student, or just walk into the first classroom you see and ask that teacher for her help. </span></div></div>",

No, you haven't partied once in your whole life. You haven't even touched a bottle of alcohol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo yeah, this is weird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to focus. Center yourself on what you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour name is MICHAEL.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rouse yourself after a few moments of thought and sit up. You immediately notice something on your left wrist - a strange band of a metal and work you've never seen. It looks a bit dinged-up, and has a single worn button. After staring for a second, you press it, and the band emits a crackle of static before clearing. It continues to crackle and glitch out as a message plays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-GREETINGS -static- USER -static.- YOU ARE NOW IN POSSESSION OF A -static- INTERCHANGING DEVICE, OR PAID FOR SHORT. THE PAID IS A TOOL THAT ALLOWS YOU TO -static- ANOTHER. USING THE PAID, YOU -static.- TO USE THE PAID, SIMPLY -static- PERSON AND PRESS THE BUTTON. ONCE PRESSED, TIME WILL -static- WHO ARE IN POSSESSION OF A PAID AS WELL, AND A -static- BE BROUGHT UP FOR YOUR USE. USING THE -static,- SELECT FROM -static- THEN SELECT \"APPLY CHANGES\".

HOWEVER, PLEASE NOTE THAT PAID WILL NOT -static- TO EITHER THE USER OR THE TARGET.-<br>\r\n-FOR DETAILS ON EACH OPTION, CONSULT THE -static- IN THE -static- AT ANY TIME.-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're... pretty sure that wasn't what was supposed to happen. It also really hurt your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, to recap, you don't know what's going on, you appear to have lost several hours of your life, and you have a weird wristband that is disturbingly vague in detail. And... okay, wait a sec... Yep, it won't come off. Wonderful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething is definitely very wrong. This thing seems outright dangerous, glitched or no. There's no telling what it truly does without some test work. And if this one exists, others might as well. Ones that aren't glitched and hold even MORE power. Ones that could very well be held by people who want to exterminate everyone else that has one. And you'd be disadvantaged, because by some stroke of terrible luck, yours doesn't work right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're getting a really bad vibe from this. It's as if... you're... huh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a strange train of thought there, but following it might give a clue of some sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a shut-in, you play a lot of games. And most of those games are retro stuff your parents had. One of your favorites had to be Knuckles Chaotix on the old, dusty SEGA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou learned a while ago that there was a hidden character, one who had been made in the alpha stages but had been scrapped. Playing as the remains of that character was always fun to do, because of the nature of the character himself; he was a glitchy mess, left behind by the last bits of deleted code. He was once meant to be played, but now... well, he wasn't. Playing as him shouldn't be a thing you could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe similarities are disturbing. Your... PAID? Is that what it's called? ...It's glitchy, and you can't remember how you got it. It's like someone selected you from a list of people to get one of these, and you were never meant to be selected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's obvious now. A normal person to get one of these would probably know all sorts of ways they could use it, and would probably even have a few friends willing to be guinea pigs. You, though... You're a shut-in. You don't know anything about this town, and no one knows anything about YOU. Not even this PAID knew your name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with all this in mind, you guess there's only one thing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're glad you played a lot of noir games, because it's time to do some sleuthing.</span></div></div>",

PERSONALITY is a weird one... and what's this about PERSONAL INFO?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou check personal info. It's a lot of minor things, and some appear to be glitched out, but within you find two things you should probably switch: NAME, and PERSONALITY: PARTIAL.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwitching just a bit of your personalities would be way better than going all in. You don't want to become a fully different person, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, to recap, you need to switch LIFE, BODY, CLOTHING, NAME, and part of your PERSONALITY.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst things first, you switch LIFE with this girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your memories of yourself fade. You can still remember core pieces of yourself, but a lot is gone. You guess that those without a PAID probably forget their past life completely. You shudder a bit at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind is flooded with the memories of this girl. Strangely enough, though, every memory of her is still you, just in her place. You guess that's where BODY comes in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou switch BODY and black out for a second. When you reawaken, panicking, you realize you're still in the same place, with time still stopped. You look down to see that you now have the girl's body as well as her life. You're amazed and freaked out at the apparent power of this weird bracelet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're still wearing your old outfit, though, and having new knowledge of the school this girl goes to lets you know that what you're wearing is definitely NOT within the dress code for schoolgirls. With a sigh, you look at CLOTHING with trepidation. You really don't want to wear girly clothes, but if you have to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou switch CLOTHING next, and in a single moment, your clothing blinks out, replaced with the girl's school outfit. You look at where the girl used to stand, and now see a spitting image of yourself, even wearing the same clothes you now know to be terrible choices for outdoor wear. Still, having the new version of you be this energetic? No, that won't do, he might do something and draw attention to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou select PERSONALITY: PARTIAL and do some tinkering. When you're done, you've given the girl your laziness and desire to stay indoors, as well as a good portion of your masculinity so \"he\" won't feel weird.. You give yourself the girl's energy and desire to do whatever she does, as well as a good bit of her feminity to help you play the part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a single rush, you feel the personality changes take place. You can already feel new energy flowing within you, and you honestly wonder how you could have ever been a shut-in to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow to seal the deal; you need the girl's NAME. You switch it and almost immediately forget yours. What was your name again...? It started with an M, right? Or... maybe an L??<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't spend much time deliberating, though, because it another few moments you are completely sure your name is Erica Martin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're 16, a casual high-schooler, and a friend to several people, notably a boy named Alex and a girl named Karen. You're also the girlfriend of Greg Parker, though for some reason that seems odd to you. You were on your way to school when something stopped you. What was it?? Oh yeah, you ran into this weird kid you've never seen before. He had a... wait a minute... what's...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink a few times. No, this isn't right. You're Michael, and you found a weird bracelet that switches things about people. You used it on a girl on her way to school to find out how to get there, because you want to know what the bracelet is and checking a centralized area seemed like a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a few breaths. That was creepy. You almost lost yourself there. You guess this is probably linked to the faulty PAID. You need to be more careful from now on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finish your changes and press the button again. Time starts back, and \"Michael\" suddenly stops running. \"He\" blinks a couple times, confused, and muses aloud. \"...What am I doing out here...? I need to get back home.\" He shakes his head and walks back to your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat takes care of that, you guess. ...\"He\" didn't even say anything, just kind of awkwardly passed you. Wow, you guess you really don't know how to talk to girls, huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, time to head to school. You recall that today is a bit of a free day, so your choices for finding people would be best limited to either...</span></div></div>",

Matt's best friend.<br>\r\nLinda Smith - A friend and co-worker of Alex's mother, Elizabeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can add other characters if you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTypes of switches:<br>\r\n-Body: You switch bodies with your target. People will still treat you as yourself. Clothing does not switch with the body and readjusts to fit the new body comfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Clothing: You switch the clothes you are wearing with the targets. Clothing will readjusts to fit you comfortably. You will also switch all other clothes you own with theirs. If you switch clothing with a person of the opposite gender, you will now be expected to dress like that gender by others. For example, if Karen switches clothing with Alex, people will find it wierd if Karen wears girl's clothes unless she switches clothing with another girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Life: You switch lives with that person. People will now treat you as that person. The person will act as if they have always had the life of the one they now had and will act like that person. You keep keep your own body, and your first name stays the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Personality: You switch personalities with that person. People will still treat you as yourself, but you will now act like that person, while still being aware that you are yourself. People will find your sudden change in personality normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Personal Info: Contain partial versions of other other switches, as well as others. Single or multiple Interests, skills, hobbies, occupations, and many others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you do a switch, reality adjusts so that everyone but those with a PAID will think things have always been like that.<br>\r\nWhile the device is in use, time will stop except for you and others who possess the PAID that are nearby. You will not be able to move from your current location though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf switching with another person with a PAID, both must agree to what will be switched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwitches are only between the user and the target.<br>\r\nAny switches that are currently applied will be switched to the target. For example, if Alex switches lives with his mother, and then his sister, his sister will have his mother's life, Alex will have his sister's life, and their mother will still have Alex life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you will be aware of changes to reality, you are not completely immune to them. Some switches come with side effects. <br>\r\nEven though you will be completely aware that the switch happened, switches that affect you mentally such as Personality and certain Personal Info options will have full effect. You will know that you have switched, but how you now act will seem perfectly normal to you.<br>\r\nWhen using the Life and Personality options together, if you switch lives with someone, and then switch personalities with that person while still in their life, you will receive their own original personality instead of the personality of their current life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe PAID only works on humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, the devices have a glitch that will occasionally activate and do a switch on you of its own choosing. Switches done this way don't need to be agreed upon if with another PAID user. After a switch done this way, the PAID must reboot and is unusable for 30 minutes. The more PAIDs present in one place increases the odds of this glitch occuring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can introduce other characters with PAIDs if you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo killing off characters<br>\r\nNo ending the story after just a few short chapters<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun!</td>",
