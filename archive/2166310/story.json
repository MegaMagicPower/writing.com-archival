Weak, meek, and easily scared, you're not exactly what could be described as an optimal human being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are, however, what a certain youkai would call a perfect <i>prey</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happened so suddenly. You were walking down this empty, but otherwise inconspicuous road, when... <i>something</i> appeared before you. It looked like a gash in the fabric of reality itself, a large gap oozing with purple mist, and filled with loads of blood-red eyes staring you down in unison. Petrified with fear, you didn't even fight back when a feminine hand came out of this gap, gripped you by your shirt, and pulled you inside. You weren't able to get a good look at your kidnapper, only noting a purple dress and long, blond hair, before she threw you deeper into the void.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't tell how long you were stuck in this nightmarish abyss, hopelessly flying through the emptiness like some asteroid, while those creepy eyes continued to observe you. It wasn't until another gap opened in your path, that you were finally able to leave this place. However, it wasn't your hometown that awaited you on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure where you ended up yet, a bit too dizzy to look around after you fell flat right on your face. The first thing you noted, however, was a pair of legs standing right in front of you. Wherever you were, you weren't here alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Your story begins now. Pick a game, and then a character from it that you want to interact with.<br>\r\nReimu Hakurei and Marisa Kirisame are available on the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil route.<br>\r\nMain games come first, then spin-offs, then literary works, then the rest.</b></span></div></div>",

You weren't sure what to say or think about this.The girl took a bunch of deep breaths,and made a plastic as hell smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what's done is done. We might as well make the best of this ordeal.\" The girl said as if she's answering your silence.The false happiness and sadness was in her voice pretty much said she's completely serious. You gulped as you slowly nodded to your new <u>wife</u>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n|Short time-skip|<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next two hours was..odd.Both of you didn't really said anything to each other.But you on the other hand,look at your wife. Her lithe body was deceptively <i>very</i> fit and musclar.Her chest...was pretty flat,but her butt is firm and suprisely plump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her legs and feet were her most impressively qualities.Her tanned legs were curvy and toned. And her big feet were definitely a size thirteen, despite her being japanese and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReimu's feet are wide,thick,and shapely.The lighter colored soles had specks of dirt,dust,grass,and other plant matter.You can subtle breads of sweat on them.But they still look feminine and beautiful in their own way. And while her feet <i>don't</i> soft at all,they don't look overly hard either. And thus giving them a great <i>natural</i> look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd plus those red and white hand-made slip-on sandals she is wearing is making her look more beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you notice your wife has caught you gawking at her! Both of your faces became fiery red,as you quickly and meekly look away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you hear some soft *slapping* sounds from behind you. You slowly turn back to Reimu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is playing with her sandals,and having them slap against her soles in a \"teasing\" manner. The deep and almost black imprints of the footwear made your stirring crotch go wild with arousal. And her butt is moving side to side in a weird manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her very <i>amauterish</i> attempts at teasing,and the fact she <i>doesn't</i> know what the hell she is doing.

You just seem so tense..Miss Hakurei.\" You politely but frightfully requested to the priestess. But you can't help but be intimidated by her.

Your blush deepened,and your pants' crotch tightened as you  look at the entire appendage. Reimu gained a small smile when she noticed you admiring her. A small giggle escapes from her as she brings her other leg in a <i>deliberately</i> slow and <u>teasing</u> way.Her eyes fluttered in a cheeky and totally fake innocent way.\"\u2026Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat back down,and proceed slowly take off her slides by grabbing the hard but flat outsole that is made of some type of dark strudy wood. You eyed at the discarded footwear. Despite them being very heavily worned,they were very well made and seem to be built to <i>last</i>. The singular and vibrant red and white straps on each sandal,are fairly thick and large. And is completely and expertly made entriely by hand. Certain people would pay some  good money sandals of this quality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReimu looked at you curiously,and wondered what so special about her sandals. Her cute husband so far is a nice,polite,and kind boy,but he also..very odd,fearful,and meek. She was about to ask you what is wrong\u2026until you start to rub her feet. Reimu's blush became like an inferno,as she bit her cheek inwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fumbly stroke and rub the large and shapely muscular soles. Feeling both the moist soft parts and hard calloused parts of her soles.You gently tug and pulled her long yet slightly chubby toes. This feet were molded by years of hard work, chores, training,...and possibly genetics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to any outsiders,you were just randomly and <b>awfully</b> caressing and rubbing her feet,and don't know what the hell you're doing. But to Reimu\u2026you are giving her a <b><u><i>elite world class massage</i></u></b>,and she was absolutely <b>loving</b> it. This is essentially the first true <i>intimate</i> moment in her life,and you are making a BIG first impression on her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<i>'That w-weird red fog can wait right now..'</i>Reimu slowly thought as she flashed him with a smile that's her awkward attempt to be alluring.She began to lazily rub her warm feet on his hands and wrists,and causing him freeze with a wild blush.<i>'I got \"wife-y\" things to right now.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that she flashed you another\u2026\"teasing\" smile as she..</span></div></div>",

But for now you figured you might as well enjoy the peacefulness of the new surroundings. There certainly didn\u2019t seem to be any dangers around. Though after about 15 minutes the air seemed a bit chillier. You were about to get up when all of a sudden you saw a strange figure standing over you. She looked fairly young given her size, but that wasn\u2019t what stood out about this girl. First off she was dressed up in an old looking blue dress. Second and certainly not least, she also had a pair of icy wing like appendages sticking out of her back. She looked like some sort of ice fairy. She just stood down at you with a smug grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s your lucky day, Human. Today I decided that you get the honor of being my own personal servant.\u201d She said in a matter-of-fact tone. You just gave her a full \u2018is this girl serious?\u2019 Look which she didn\u2019t appear to notice. \u201cYou should count yourself lucky to be personally selected by the strongest of the fairies. The strongest in all of Gensokyo.\u201d You rolled your eyes and tried to back up so you could get back up to your feet, however, Cirno did notice this one and immediately stomped her foot down right on your chest. Immediately you felt the air forced out of you as your lungs deflated like balloons. How the hell did this small thing have so much strength. The scariest part of it was that she didn\u2019t even seem to be trying very hard to pin you. And yet you were immobilized. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t act out against your supreme mistress like that, servant.\u201d She said in her high and mighty tone. All of a sudden, icy shackles formed around your arms holding you to the ground. Though they were freezing, you were mostly relieved since Cirno removed her foot finally, allowing you to breathe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou desperately tried to think of some way to spin this, to get back on her good side and maybe convince her to let you go. \u201cI... Im sorry. I just...\u201d you hesitate for a moment while she looks down curiously. \u201cI was just so intimidated when I was approached by the strongest being of all time.\u201d You immediately figured flattery would be your best bet. Her proud smile seemed to be supporting this. \u201cAnd... I figured someone like you deserves a way better servant than someone like me.\u201d You continued to twist this to praise her while hoping it would suffice.</span></div></div>",

Well, as carefully as an idiot like her could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her eyes lit up in excitement, as she apparently came to some sort of revelation, and followed it with a haughty laughter. It's as if she was trying to act like some high-tier noblewoman, only to come off as a particularly annoying brat. Not to get on her bad sides however, you've decided to laugh along with her, but she would have none of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another powerful stomp, this time aimed at your head, Cirno put a firm end to your attempts at flattery, effectively grinding them in the bud as she twisted her foot left and right. Some of that dirt and sweat she collected on her travels got rubbed directly into your features, filling you with disgust and disdain for the ice fairy who would put you through such humiliating experience. Meanwhile, Cirno found the act of literally rubbing her superiority right in your face to be highly entertaining, especially when she could also deliver one hell of a trash talk to go along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, dumb human! Of course you'd be a worthless servant to me. All humans are pathetic when they start! It takes a good mistress to turn a dumb human into a proper slave. You've got nothing to fear, though. I am pretty good, if I do say so myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got a glimpse of her smug smirk from in-between her unclenched toes. The matter-o-factly way she spoke about you becoming her slave sent shivers down your spine, so much so that even she could feel your body tremble underfoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, are you scared?\" The girl mockingly spat at you, amused by your helpless writhing. \"Well, you better get over it by the time I start your training. Otherwise I'll just cryo-freeze your body, and smash it into icy bits! Got it!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutmatched as you were, you could only manage a feeble nod of agreement. Once again the ice fairy let out a chilling laugh, very pleased with herself, and her newly acquired 'possession'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should Cirno start your training with?</span></div></div>",

Clearly the strongest being in the land couldn\u2019t ask for a better find. And he already seems to be learning his place with her. The ice fairy had expected some more resistance at the start, but clearly that problem would only exist for lesser yokai. Obviously the strongest of all of them would have no trouble getting the point across. Still she figured you might have some lingering hopes of freedom which she\u2019d have to snuff out, not that this bothered her at all. Cirno considered it fun to remind lesser beings who was at the top of the food chain in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack under her foot, you continued to shiver, partially from the cold, but mostly in fear of this girl\u2019s overwealming strength. You were utterly helpless to stop her from wiping layers upon layers of sweat and grime which coated her sole all over your face. Finally she lifted the foot away. At first you were relieved by this break, but then she gave you her first command. \u201cOpen your mouth, slave!\u201d Her tone was very authoritative towards you. You hesitated a bit, still shaking with fear as you tried to process her new order towards you. Before long, Cirno stomped back down on your head, causing you to scream in pain. \u201cYour mistress gave you an order. A slave is to obey her immediately.\u201d She grinder your head roughly as she looked at your filthy face, completely caked in grime and dirt smeared all over. \u201cNow open!\u201d Her tone seemed less patient. Remembering her threat from before you shakily opened your mouth. Almost immediately, the toes slipped inside, rubbing against your tongue and making sure you could taste all the sweat and filth on them. You wanted to gag, but you did your best not to as she assaulted your taste buds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will free your arms and let you move around, but remember, no funny business. If you try to escape or anything of the sort...\u201d She then removed the foot from your mouth and used it to shove your head to the side, giving you a clear view of a frog jumping around the pond. In an instant the frog was suddenly encased in a block of ice. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d She said in the superior tone from earlier. You quickly nodded the best you could while being pinned. \u201cY-yes mistress. I\u2019ll be an obedient slave.\u201d You spoke up with notable fear in your voice. Cirno simply smiled and just like that, the ice around your arms was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, stay put.\u201d She commanded hopong to see how fast of a learner her possession is. You obediently remained in place as she took a hard step onto your chest. With another hard step you were forced to exhale as she forced the air out of you once again. And again with another step. She started rubbing her feet on your chest as she eyed your groin area. You were afraid that she was about to stomp down there, but couldn\u2019t do anything to stop her without... your eyes shifted fearfully to the frozen frog. Thankfully Cirno decided to show some mercy. After all her pet was being good for now. But why to do next?</span></div></div>",

Gods only know how long she'd be standing there were it not for a literal flash of inspiration.<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\nKA~BOOOM</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of your eyes turned upwards, as <i>certain ordinary magician</i> blasted through the sky on her trusty broom, leaving destructive, rainbow beams of light in her wake. The ice fairy tried very hard not to appear impressed by the spectacular light show, though through her foot you could feel he body shaking in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, the sight of that witch managed to jog some memories in that icy cube Cirno has for a brain. The fairy patted at the sides of her skirt for a bit, before triumphantly reaching into one of her pockets (she had pockets?), and pulling out what appeared to some sort of a vial, filled to the brim with blue, luminescent liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, I almost forgot about this potion I nabbed from that dumb witch. Now I can finally see what it does.\" She said while looking down at you, with a sinister grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActing on instinct you clenched your mouth as tightly as you could. You clearly wanted nothing to do with the ice fairy's crazy experiment, but Cirno would have none of that. With a firm stomp to your stomach she got a pained yelp out of you, and within the small window of opportunity stuffed her other foot in your mouth, easily keeping it from closing with her mere toes. How strong was that girl!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCirno laughed cruelly at the sight of your pathetic struggling, happily wiggling her toes, and getting their foul coating of sweat and grime all over your mouth. Then, if things couldn't get any worse, Cirno carefully bent her upper body forward, and with a wicked grin dumped the vial's content on her domineering leg. You watched in terror as the fluid ran down her leg, then foot, then toes, and finally started dripping onto your tongue. It was surprisingly sweet, and although it collected some of her foot sweat and dirt along the way, it was still an overall improvement in terms of things you got a taste of today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the liquid poured into your mouth, the ice fairy stepped down from your body, and now merely stood above you, looking for any signs of the potion's effects. If she were to ask you how you felt from it (which she didn't, because why would she), she'd learn that you didn't feel any different, only a little... what's the word... Tingly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, ooooh, now you felt a lot more of that. It made you very uncomfortable, so much so that you had to close you eyes in distress. As you did, you could hear that dumb fairy laughing out lout, apparently amused by your misery. Weirdly enough, her voice got more booming, and echoey with each passing moment. Is that how the potion worked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>KA~BOOM</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother sudden explosion, probably that witch's doing again, seemed to snap you out of that potion-induced daze. Grabbing your pained head in some futile attempt at relieving it of that migraine, you tried hard at focusing on your surroundings, and locate that dumb ice fairy. Her powers could be of some use to you right about no-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>KA~BOOM</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more that loud noise shook the earth, though this time you were able to tell it wasn't that magician's work. No, it was the sound of something heavy crashing to the ground close by, enough so to push your body away with the resulting shockwave. Now with your whole body bruised, you began to frantically search around the arena for its source, only to almost go mad from revelation once you succeeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCirno was enormous. Gigantic. Larger than any of the largest skyscrapers ever built. The mere bottom of her smallest toe was the size of a football field to you, something you were able to estimate thanks to the giantess holding her foot raised above your, ready to drop you at any moment. From in-between her spread toes you could look her in the eyes, the titanic fairy flashing you a toothy, confident grin as she was somehow able to locate your dust-sized body on the ground. Waving and flexing her foot around caused many of the barely clinging sweatdrops and clumps of dirt to rain down around you, reminding you of those bombardment scenes from war movies. Surrounded by this madness, you've managed to force yourself to do the only thing you were capable of doing now: run away while screaming your lungs out. Unfortunately, your squeaky screams of panic served only to further amuse the cruel fairy, as she carefully moved her foot after you, making sure you would never leave its shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Cirno do now with your mite-sized body now?</span></div></div>",

Bits of sweat continued to drop all around you like a heavy and filthy rain storm. You tried sprinting faster, but it wasn\u2019t enough.

Despite the pressure and the gentle (to her) grinding motion, you were still perfectly intact, though in an enormous amount of pain.

She saw you covered in dirt, sweat, and tears from this whole ordeal. \u201cI think you look cute there.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After taking a couple more steps, Cirno's decided to sit down, and have a little chat with her foot slave. Upon plopping herself on the soft grass, she once again angled her leg and foot to look at you, flashing you one of those menacing grins of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, little guy, how are you liking your new 'world'~?\" She asked innocently enough, though the way she phrased 'world' sent shivers down your spine. Predictably, you immediately began begging her, pleading with her to release you. However, to the ice fairy it all came out as bunch of incomprehensible, annoying squeaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, you're a noisy little bugger, aren't ya?\" Cirno noted in dismay, before suddenly lighting up in excitement \"I think I know how to fix that, though~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith eyes wide open, you watched as the girl raised her hand towards you, and then easily plucked you off her nasty sole. For a moment, a blissful couple of seconds you thought that she yielded, and decided to let you go... Only for your fantasy to come crashing down at you, as Cirno merely turned your body around, and then rammed you face first back into the putrid bottom of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeaaaah, that's better~\" The ice fairy muttered, greatly enjoying the feel of mashing your against her sole. Her finger moved up and down, and all over your back, firmly securing you in your spot. The procedure was painful, and you screamed into her steamy, sweltering footflesh as a result, earning yourself a mouthful of the filthy, sweat-coated that grime that stained the bottom of her smelly foot. It was a nightmarish experience, and it would only get worse from here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with your freshly stuck body, Cirno quickly stood up, and gave her 'occupied' foot a couple of goods stomps, further cementing your new status as just another clump of her foot grime. Stained by it, and now filled with it, you could hardly object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile twisting her foot on top of you, the ice fairy looked around the place, thinking about what to do next, and how to involve you in it. Noting a long path going around the nearby Misty Lake, the cruel girl came up with another devious idea to torment you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, I suddenly felt like going for a run.\" Cirno spoke out loud to... No one in particular, honestly. Trapped beneath her foot as you were, you could barely hear a thing. Not that it mattered to her. \"Y'know, lose some weight, break some sweat, pound you underfoot some more. All things a proper fairy needs to do to stay in the best shape~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the ice fairy approached the path, making sure to put a bit more pressure whenever she took a step with 'your' foot. Once there, the girl took a running stance, ready to start at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try not to fall off.\" Was all she had to say to you before taking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe experience was excruciatingly unpleasant, to say the least. For reasons you couldn't possibly comprehend, the potion that shrunk you down also somehow prevented you going from 'splat' all over her foot, like 'your fellow' bugs she oh so loved to constantly compare you to. Sadly, it did not spare you even an ounce of the pain.<br>\r\nStomp after stomp, you felt your body sink deeper and deeper into the foul footflesh of your wicked tormentress, gradually losing your senses to the overwhelming nature of her sole. Your taste, smell, hearing, touch, sight, everything eventually got lost to her domineering foot.<br>\r\nIt didn't take Cirno long to start profusely sweating from her jog. At first it didn't affect you much, seeing how you were already drowning in this stuff as it was, but it had an effect on her foot as a whole. More sweat meant more lubricant, that more dirt got stuck to as the fairy continued down the beaten lake path. You could feel a new layer of grime growing on your back, serving to further submerge you within her sole, and make you as one with the foul coating that stained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe situation was dire. You tried to push back at her every time her foot rose up, but your efforts were swiftly undone with the following stomp. You went through this over and over again, until finally you couldn't fight back anymore, and gave up your fate to your gigantic fairy mistress...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will happen to you now?</span></div></div>",

With a face of smug confidence and childish pride,she levitated in mid-air. She lifts her right foot to her face.\u2026which quickly turned slightly green.She grimaced in object disgust and horror at the her feet do in fact stink to high heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly landed back on the ground,and quickly went to side.

The girl was strong enough that you couldn't pull your face back and you soon found yourself trapped as both feet proceeded to rub all over your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You feel really good down there.\" she said playfully \"I don't really get visitors that much. Especially not humans.\" She rubbed your face even harder shoving two toes over your nose to really let the smell get in. \"Big sis always tells me you guys are fragile, especially with my powers.\" You were curious what she meant by this, but her foot prevented you from speaking. \"I can make anything at all go BOOM. Just by focusing on the eye of it and making it squeeze!\" she said in a giddy tone. \"Just like that its gone for good. But don't worry. I wouldn't use that on you.\" Her gleeful description of this ability did scare you a little, but you couldn't really do much besides trust her.

Not wanting to try her patience, you immediately grabbed the sole to the left and began as careful of a massage as you could do.

This made them stop their disagreement. Remilia instantly took off her shoes and stockings,and thus revealing her <i>very</i> long shapely and long feet. Her brilliant nails was in a dark crimson. Both Scarlet sisters giggled mischievously at your flustered and aroused expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"I guess that's a yes then..\"</font> The boy quietly mused as both sisters run their feet together in a teasing way.

Come show my sister how much you love them. Flandre said with a cute smile. Don't go to hers. Come play with mine. I'm sure you'll like them more. Remilla said with a seductive smile. You didn\u2019t know what to do. If you went to one sister, the other one would probably be mad. They were already mad at each other, you didn\u2019t want them mad at you. Don\u2019t be shy, little guy. I\u2019m sure Remilla will understand you like mine more than hers. Flandre said. You sound so confident that he\u2019d pick your dogs over mine. Remilla said. I know so. Mine won\u2019t make him throw up his insides. Flandre said. Remilla\u2019s face got red after that. Let\u2019s just see what he thinks. Remilla said. She puts her feet on the side and sandwiches you between them. Hey! That\u2019s not fair! He was suppose to choose! Flandre fumed. Hehehe! What\u2019s the matter? Afraid he\u2019ll pick mine over yours? She said. Flandre was furious, but said nothing. She was confident that you\u2019d pick her. Hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were pinned between both of her feet. As firm as they were, they were completely soft. And the smell, wasn\u2019t as bad as Flandre made it seem. It wasn\u2019t roses, but your insides weren\u2019t going to be hurled out. And they were soft as a pillow. You could just lay on them as if they were a bed. Then the feet start to move and push you on your back. You were a little terrified at the sudden movement. You had no idea what was going to happen until She starts to gently rub you with her feet. You better not hurt him! Flandre said. I\u2019m just having so fun with him. And I bet he is too. Remilla said. Remilla! Flandra shouts. Calm down! I\u2019m being gentle. Remilla said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the gentle and slow movement, you relax a little. You weren\u2019t expecting it to be like this. You were about to hug her foot until it was pulled back. See. He\u2019s fine. Like I\u2019ve been saying. Remilla said. Like I was going to believe you. Flandre said. Tell her, little guy. Tell her how much you loved being against my feet. Remilla said. W\u2026.well\u2026. It was\u2026.. You said. He loved them so much, he\u2019s speechless. Remilla said. You traumatized him! And treated him as an object! Flandre said. You\u2019re just jealous he\u2019ll pick me. Remilla said. Flandre glared angrily at her sister, but looked at you with concern as she picks you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ok? She said. Yeah\u2026. Nothing hurt or anything. You said. Flandre hugged you tightly. Flandre shoots her sister with a smug look as she holds you. Remilla shot back a jealous look as her face blushed. Enough hugging. He\u2019s got a decision to make. Flandre let\u2019s go of you. So little one. You've had fun with both of our feet. Whose do you like better? Mine? Or hers? Remilla said. Both of them waited for your choice. Flandre was a little worried, but still confident you'd pick her. While Remilla had a confident smile that you'd go with her.You get the feeling that no matter what choice you make, it\u2019s going to be the wrong one. I choose\u2026..</span></div></div>",

His poor back made all sorts of creaks and cracks as he dusts off various plant matter of his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU MISCREANT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!\" A young girl\u2026with a weird cloud came out like a bat out of hell. She sprinted\u2026to a bunch of ruined hedges, mangled bushes, and obliterated flowers. Her greyish blue eyes wewaslmost to the point of crying. \"All those\u2026hard worked hours....down..the..gutter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well shit, if there anything I can do to fix this. Let me know.\" The boy genuinely felt bad for this.

So she can't challenge you to a duel..it just wouldn't feel <b><i>right</i></b>. But a bright idea came to her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she strips off her shiny black shoes, and reveal her very grey and yellow colored dingy socks. The girl made cute sighs as she flexes her overworked toes, and letting the cool air soothe them. His cheeks to start to get very warm, and he quickly readjusts his pants. He doesn't want things to get\u2026<i>awkward</i>. After a few good minutes of letting them breathe, the half-ghost finally stripes the socks and revealing her pale feet. They were\u2026honest pretty big and chubby, a solid fourteen. Her short toes were fat, and their nails are painted in a dull emerald. And due to the wear and tear...you say they are in need of a fresh coat of paint. The little and specky underside of her feet are thick and had a subtle firm hardness. A clear testament to the girl's diligence and hard work-oriented life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh\u2026you are going to be..my personal Massage Therapist and Aesthetician until I fix the garden you ruined.\" Youmu <i>attempted</i> sound friendly and even, but it clear as day that she is pissed about the garden. She waved her foot in his direction almost mockingly, unwittingly making you all bothered.\"As you see, the areas that are going to need your attention primarily are quite oblivious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shakily gulped and nodded. Damn her feet, cuteness, and legs are making this <i>hard{/} for him to say no. Youmu simply nodded as presented her neatly, waving feet in simple expectance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a heavy heart, he approaches the half-ghost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</i></span></div></div>",

You weren't sure what she meant yet, but to be honest you weren't quite sure of anything anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good look around, it appeared that you've been dropped i the middle of some traditional, Japanese household. A quite shocking revelation all on its own, since it meant you were at least a thousand miles away from your home... Yet it honestly paled in comparison to the wonder standing right in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was gorgeous. A towering beauty of a woman draped in white robes, with short, golden hair, two furry... fox-like ears... and... nine fluffy... tails?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could this be real?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognized the woman as a kitsune, a cunning monstrosity originating from Japanese folklore. Well, you could hardly describe her beautiful form as monstrous, even with all those animal-looking details, yet it was also obvious that she was not a normal human being either. No, she was something more than that, something far above humans, far above you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe apparently must've thought so as well, if the cold glare she's been giving you this whole time was anything to go by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you done gawking, whelp?\" She spat out, her sharp fangs clearly visible as she sneered at you in contempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!... S-sorry ab-\" you tried to apologize, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence. I don't need your apologies, but your obedience. You're not to say a word unless I allow it.\" The kitsune seemed angry, but you could tell she enjoyed muddling you with dirt like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the situation seemed dire, and getting worse by the seconds. You needed to de-escalate it, and quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-As you wish-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SMACK* Bad move on your part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fool! I told you to shut up!\" She roared, as you recoiled backwards from the kick she delivered to your jaw. Thankfully, it wasn't too painful. It only stung like hell, instead of leaving you spitting teeth and blood everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems I'm off to a rough start with you. Figures, it's never been easy with you hopeless lot. Thankfully, it's never been impossible either. Hear this, whelp. I'll break your free will like a twig, and make you my perfect little foot slave, or my name is not Ran Yakumo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you've gathered your composure, the first thing to catch your attention was Ran's still raised foot. The kitsune deliberately kept it hanging over your head, just so you could notice it, and consequently get lost in it. There was a lot to unpack here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feet were big, fittingly so given her larger-than-you stature. Wide, strong-looking, and meaty, those things must've seen a lot of use over the many years of Ran's life. Nine tails meant at least 900 years behind her, if your kitsune trivia was correct. Almost a millennium she spent walking on those soles, yet they seemed no worse for wear. They looked tough, firm, but not at all roughed up or calloused. Ran clearly took good care of her feet... Or had someone do it for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot all was well with her sole, however, at least not at the moment. Right now its surface was marred with dirt and sweat, most likely a result of some recent exhausting activities. Seeing how the household looked quite pristine, the lady must've just about finished cleaning it up, leaving her with no time to take care of herself, and those poor soles of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, however, she had you. The kitsune giggled devilishly, as she began to swirl her foot around over your head. Your eyes were helplessly glued to the sweltering underside of her foot, finding it strangely captivating. Where you somehow charmed by this trickster, were you under her spell? Or is that something you came to desire on your own? Did any of this even matter anymore?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Ran stopped her mild teasing, and lowered her foot a bit closer to your face, close enough in fact to let you get a good whiff of those tired things. Strong, cheesy aroma filled your nostrils, almost making you sneeze on the spot. The only thing that kept you from doing so was the fear of punishment that would've awaited you should you dare to soil her soles like this. Still, the kitsune seemed intent on making your time down there miserable, as she began to wriggle her toes around, at least tripling the foul scent's intensity. Only now that they've been put right in front of you, did your focus shifted to those plump piggies of hers, and the sharp, claw-like toenails that adorned them. You wondered if this was a side effect of being a kitsune, or if that's how she did her nails. You imagined it wouldn't do well for her socks. Strange thought to have at the moment, but any distraction seemed preferably to getting lost in that pungent smell of her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, my little human. Take a good look at it. From this point onward this is going to be the center of your attention, what your mind will revolve around. You'll be my foot slave, and you'll either grow to love it, or live in despair with it. I'd recommend the former, but I can't deny I'd personally prefer the latter. After all, you're here to pleasure me, not yourself~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your head in the smelly clouds, you weren't able to respond to Ran's chilling words. Not that you would've, you've learned that painful lesson already. It still felt wrong to just accept the fate she had for you, but knew you couldn't fight her, at least not openly. You could only hope that some help was on the way, or another miracle would happen and get you out of there. Until then, however, you were at her mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then\" Ran said, drawing her foot back a little, giving you some breathing room \"Let's start off on the right foot. As my new foot slave, your first task will be to...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>...An... Insole? What? Whatever could she mean by it? You knew what an insole was, obviously, but how could you 'serve' her as one? This made no sense, none whatsoever. What was this kitsune planning?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRan took note of your bafflement, and snickered in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, of course, you're not yet aware of what your master is capable of. Mmmm~, I think a little demonstration of my power is in order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said it, Ran extended one of her arms towards you, and opened her palm. Her hand soon began to emit bright, golden light. So bright it was, you had to shield your eyes away from it. Consecutively, you felt some strange power penetrate your body. You weren't sure what it was all about, but since you couldn't do anything at the moment anyways, you've decided to wait it out, and just hope for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRan's weird little 'ritual' of hers didn't take too long, and once the glowing stopped you were able to open your eyes again. You quickly came to regret that decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe change was immediately noticeable. Everything was bigger. The room, the furniture, everything. You've been shrunk down to the size of a tiny toy, half an inch tall at most. That kitsune must've done this, but how!? How did she do it!? How could she do it!? She's... She is... Oh gods...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw hit the floor the moment your eyes fell upon Ran's colossal form. She was simply gigantic, her size comparable now to that of the Statue of Liberty. She completely dwarfed your small, frail body, easily casting it in the vast shadow of her own, incidental making. At the moment she simply stood there, a menacing grin plastered on her face, as the kitsune was clearly pleased with herself and that 'little' shrinking curse of hers. You could hear the rhythmic drumming of her toes, as she eagerly awaited your panicked reaction to your new circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully she was prepared for disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to move, to run, to scream... but you couldn't. Your mind has been broken, shattered by the impossible predicament that's been so suddenly forced on you. This was simply way too much for a normal guy like you to handle. To the kitsune's mild chagrin, you were simply unable to 'properly' react... So you didn't. You simply stood there still, completely paralyzed. Silent. Unflinching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Ran knew exactly how to... 'help' you snap out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, the giantess slammed the heel of her right foot right in front of you, toppling you down on your back, while keeping the rest of her sole elevated over your fallen form. Dizzied and bruised from the impact, your vision cleared to the sight of the vast expanse of rippling, sweltering flesh of her dirtied foot. The kitsune swayed it up and down, constantly exerting her dominance over your pathetic self, as she threatened to crush you into a bloody stain over and over and over again with but a simple downward push of her all-encompassing sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRan's foot already looked pretty imposing back when you were normal sized, but now... It was simply terrifying to behold. Faced with the prospect of a gruesome demise underneath her fetid footstep, you started shouting at the godlike kitsune, begging her for mercy, and pleading for your life. Each whiff of the rancid stench of her sole only made your screaming louder, as did the fear of the giant globes of sweat that rained all around you, pouring from the underside of Ran's swaying footsie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cruel titaness let out a haunting cackle the second your squeaky screams reached her vulpine ears. Just like her fellow youkai, Ran draws strength from the fear she instills in humans. The more they fear her, the stronger she becomes. It is thanks to you then, that right now she felt like a goddess, your pitiable wailing more than making up for the effort she put so far into her chores. She had to admit, for a pathetic little speck, you were an astoundingly palatable little morsel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, though she greatly enjoyed 'teasing' you like this, Ran still had a lot of work ahead of her before she could take her rest. She shrunk you for a reason: to serve as her insole, and hopefully ease some of the burden she, and her feet in particular, have to carry as she goes about her daily routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as much as she enjoyed the prospect of splitting your mind between two feeble bodies, hopelessly mashed into her almighty feet, as she tramples you over and over and over again, this was far from the limit of her impressive abilities.<br>\r\nShe could just as easily turn you into a pair of comfy socks, that would shield her soles from the yet not cleaned floor, while also rubbing off some of the grime already collected on her poor feet.<br>\r\nShe could also do something a bit more devious than that, and turn your body into sentient ointment. She would rub you all over her feet to swiftly ease some of her pains, and maybe even save some of you for later use. The kitsune wiggled her toes at the thought of meticulously smearing your sentient, moist form all over and in-between her foul lil'tootsies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, choices, choices~ In the end, which one will it be?</span></div></div>",

Her green eyes lit up with great confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...What the heck is <i>cosplay</i>?\" She suddenly asked you with curiosity. She quickly shooked her head,and gained a look\u2026that reeks of such fake and unnatural haughtiness and authority that actually hurts to look at.\"It doesn't matter.

It was an freak accident.\" You softly but tiredly apologize to the youkai.\"In fact,I will do anything to make up for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWriggle stops her \"fearsome\" assaul and she began take a few deep breaths. She stops and looks at you with dulled anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\u2026You still have to be punished!!\" Wriggle angerily said with a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed in relief.

They also were long and slender,but they definitely have a little meatiness and thickiness. Her feet got to be a solid eleven or twelve. Maybe this \"punishment\" wouldn't be so bad after...and your groin wholeheartedly agrees with you\u2026<i>very</i> much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better quiver in utter fear Human!For you will know how it feels to be a poor bug!\" Wriggle said with authority as she point her right foot in your direction. Her long unpainted toes pointing directing at you in a mocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut strangely enough,he doesn't seem to..be fearful and not begging for her to reconsider at all. He is totally blank, and it very off-putting for the young youkai. And the way he look at feet is\u2026odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few minutes was...an odd duel of silence between the two.

Even with her obliviously forced maturity and sense of authority, he can't help but feel...some legitimate fear. But nonetheless, his eyes ogled the way the muscles in her feet and legs shift and flex at every single step she takes. With a sudden stop, she suddenly whips her head to him. On her face was a big grin that to ear to ear, and the immature giggles she made didn't help at all.\"\u2026you <i>LLLIIIKKKEEE</i> my feet, and therefore by extension me.~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what!? No, I don't like them in the slightest. \" He squeaked in utter surprise, he honestly didn't expect the girl to be so damn perspective. The blushing girl only gives a laugh in response, weird but warm feelings made her heart beat faster. Screw being \"fearsome\" and \"commanding\", this is so much fun being usual herself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWriggle sat back on the ground, and slowly crosses her large soles. The soles made maddening thick wrinkles as her toes went completely wild. Then they stopped, and both feet began to slowly grind against each, the sounds that are being made sent shivers down his spine. As the human teenager haplessly gawked at the show, the young youkai's mischievous grin became mocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are doing such an awesome job of showing your distaste for them right now.\" Wriggle airily \"complemented\" with a slightly higher pitched voice reeking of bemusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy made an indignant face and he made an angry huff and turns his head away if he admits that he likes her feet. Then it would only make the wimpy girl more <u><i><b>cringeworthy</b></i></u>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously, Wriggle's once wide grin became a tight smile that is on its way to becoming a frown. Something about her servant harshly diverting his attention away from her\u2026made her feel all icky and cold. She is his master, he is <i>supposed</i> to shower her with praise and affection..right? Yet he like many others is ignoring and scoffing at her. She honestly is pretty use to it\u2026but why she feels this way towards him of all people?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen here <b>shrimp</b>, you got about twenty minutes left, so you are going spend half of it showering your master's feet with words of love and praise they so rightfully deserve. Or..\" Wriggle's lip curled up into an impressive sneer, and her eyelids narrowed. The boy could feel real anger and the level of low self-esteem in every word she made. He turned to her with sweaty but neutral face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or what?\" He questioned evenly, the boy gives her an even expression. Internally, he was getting more and more worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or..or I will do some really mean..stuff\u2026yeah, stuff to you\" Wriggle's lips pursed as she gave a weak as hell response. Her right foot pointed directly towards him, and her toes wriggled. Revealing the wet dirt and bits of linty leaves that are in their crevices. Judging the way she is moving it, the girl is signaling that she expects it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy's forehead became completely drenched as he stared at the foot. With his fists balled all up. Wriggle may be a wimpy dork, but she is also very adorable and sexy. The insecure brat is obviously using him as some booster for her self-worth and such. Part of him honestly feels..sorry for the girl, another part, however, is already pretty damn angry and this chick is making it so much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I obviously don't have a choice in the matter. Therefore I have to do what she says.'</i> The bitter thought was a hard but necessary pill to take.

She had short, black hair, dark scarlet eyes, and, most curious of all, a pair of white rabbit ears. Were they fake? They sure looked kinda unnatural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer clothing consisted of a pink, frilly nightgown going all the way down to her knees, and a pair of white bloomers worn underneath it. Weirdly enough, her feet were left bare. No shoes, no socks, no nothing. This surprised you quite a bit, seeing how the two of you were apparently in the middle of some bamboo forest right now. yet she apparently had no trouble walking here barefoot. You couldn't possibly imagine it being any good for her soles. Maybe she's poor, and couldn't afford them? But the the rest of her clothes looks pretty clean, so what's up with that? So weird...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot as weird, however, as the fact that you were in the middle of a freaking bamboo forest! You don't recall one being anywhere near your hometown. Where you taken to China or something? Well, at least that girl talks in your language, so it's not all bad.<br>\r\nOh, that's right! You should probably try to get some info out of her. Maybe she could help you, like point you to the nearest phone booth or something. It was definitely worth a shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, excuse me. Wh-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bamboo Forest of the Lost. That's what we call it, anyways. Sweet, short, and to the point. Kinda like me, actually~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that creeped you out a bit. Was she a psychic or something? At any rate, she was at least willing to talk with you. Maybe she could help you...but who even was she, though?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Wh-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tewi Inaba's the name, the local rabbit chief. You're pretty lucky to have come across me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill creepy. She was answering your questions, yes, but you didn't like how she was doing it ahead of you actually freaking asking them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not reading your mind.

Did I hear that right? What do you mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you've noticed her cheery smile take on a more smug look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm hmm~ Very perceptive of you. Yes, I did say 'you humans' just now. For one, you're not the first human that's been dumped here. Heck, not even the first one to land at my feet. Secondly, I myself am not a human, but a rabbit. I did tell you that before, didn't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was... interesting. So Tewi claims that she's not a human, even though she sure looks like one, just one with rabbit ears is all. Oh, and a tail. She turned around just now to wiggle it around for show.<br>\r\nMaybe she was just screwing around with you, and this was simply a very elaborate cosplay... Did that sound more or less ridiculous than her actually being a... 'rabbit'?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, however, you were more interested in those other humans she spoke of, the ones that have been thrown in here just like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know where I could find those other humans? Could you maybe take me to them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit girl thought about it for a bit with a deeply contemplative look on her face, before once again cheerfully addressing you with her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, but I'd have to kill you. They're all dead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" You blurted out, not sure if you got that right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dead\" she happily repeated \"Those idiots thought they could brave this forest alone, when I clearly warned them that there's \"Lost\" in its name for a reason. If you don't know how this place works, you can end up trapped here for an eternity. Except you humans, you die after a while. They probably either dropped down dead from starvation, or were killed by another, less nice than me youkai that hunt here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis... Could this be true? For a moment you broke eye contact with Tewi, her joyful attitude when talking about such gruesome things was a bit too unnerving. Instead you looked deep into the forest, trying to see anything of note in-between the bamboo. Sights of a nearby civilization, or some noteworthy landmark. Nothing, just bamboo after bamboo after even more bamboo... Although, as you tried to look deeper, for a brief second you couldn't sworn you felt as if the forest 'stared' back at you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For some reason\" Tewi said, snapping your attention back to her \"None of them wanted to accept my help. I know my wayaround here, I could've led them out if they wanted to. Maybe they were too proud to rely on someone like me? I dunno. Hopefully you won't make the same mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit finished with that smug smile of hers, upsetting you a bit. You felt as if she wasn't telling you the whole truth here. However, her tales did the trick quite well, and you weren't about to take your chances with this spooky place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-OK, I think I'll take you on your offer. Please, could you help me get out of here?\"<br>\r\nTewi gave you a wide, toothy grin. She sure looked pleased with herself. That's probably or the best... Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect! You're definitely have more brains than those other fools before you~\"<br>\r\nFor a compliment, it didn't make you feel all that well. Did she have to trash talk the dead like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then... Let's discuss my reward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, what's this?\" she said, eyeing you suspicioulsy \"Don't I deserve something in return for helping you out? You didn't think I'd waste my precious time to save you for free, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh God, even in the middle of freaking nowhere, capitalism would be the death of you. Maybe those other humans weren't just dumb, and simply couldn't afford her help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please, I don't have much on me, but it's all yours if you can help me get out of-\"<br>\r\nTewi laughed out loud, once again creeping you out. You were getting more and more tired of her with each passing moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your outside money is worthless to me. No, I already know what I want from you. A favor for a favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh, that actually didn't sound too bad, depending on what she want- OH GROSS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Tewi kicked one of her legs up front, almost smashing her foot in your face. Thankfully, she stopped it just in time to give you a good look at her sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bottom of Tewi's dainty foot had to be one of the most disgusting things you've ever had the displeasure of facing. The entire surface of her sole was completely coated with an abhorrent amalgam of mashed dirt, viscous sweat, crushed leaves, and squashed bugs. Occasionally some of this foul mesh would fall off, as the rabbit girl swayed her foot around, revealing some of the surprisingly supple and soft looking skin of her sole. You were morbidly interested in the logic behind it: how could the flesh of her foot look this pristine and healthy, if it was hidden underneath multiple layers of this rancidness?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her foot so unbearably close, you had to deal not only with its ghastly image, but also the fetid fetor it gave off. Curtains matched the window on this one, and you had no choice but to recoil in disdain after just one whiff of the putrid odour her foot gave off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U...Ugh!\" you fell on your back, weakened by the mere presence of Tewi's smelly foot. The rabbit simply laughed at your shameful display, and as you tried to crawl away from here, she simply took a couple of steps forward to stand at the side of your head, and once again put her putrid sole right in your face. It did the trick well, and you were left to lay there still, as the revolting stench of her foot kept you paralyzed. You felt terrible, weak, trapped, left completely at this wicked girl's mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it, that's a good human, laying down at the feet of his master. Hopefully it won't take you long to learn your place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice still carried that childish, saccharine tone to it, but it was now marred by her haughty disposition. You weren't ashamed to admit that it sent chills down your spine, being referred to by this creature in such a degrading, demeaning manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me to list you your options, worm.\" she said, readjusting her foot a bit to give you a better look at some juicy insect that ended up squashed beneath the arch of her foot \"You can either lick my feet clean, and pray to the gods while doing so that I'll let you go once you're done...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was already really bad. Really, really bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you can refuse, giving me an excuse to thoroughly break you underfoot like the pathetic bug that you are, and leave you here to fend for yourself. I'm sure you'd make a good meal for one of my less civilized friends~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were screwed no matter what you'd pick, that much was certain. Which dreadful option should you go with then?</span></div></div>",

Fufu~ You're out of options you know, it's in your best interested to do so \u2661.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dirt and grime on the bottoms of her heel was waved around in front of your face. If you don't speak now, you'll never be able to live this one down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I bring your foot closer... If I lick your feet clean... Will you really take me back home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit girl giggled as she stood above you in a superior manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I promise hehe~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind swayed against both of you. Time had seemed to stop. In a moments notice, you brought your head to look directly Tewi, and locked your eyes with hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I refuse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTewi's face changed from one of smug dominance to one of total surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of my favorite things to do is to tell people who think they are strong... the word 'No'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTewi was still in total shock. No human had ever rejected her advances like this. Inside her mind she began contemplating what was going through this young man's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This guy! He could've knocked me down or thrown a punch in order to defend himself, but he looked directly at me and admitted I was stronger and still told me no! And to make it even more incredible, I didn't see a single shroud of fear in his eyes! This guy could stare down the devil himself and tell him he's lowlife scum without a second's hesitation! I've never met a human like this before! I took him for easy prey, but this human's demeanor is so strong willed I'd probably have to cut him into pieces before he'd bow before me!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at Tewi again, doing your best to hide the fact that you were shaking from saying such a bold statement. You don't know what came over yourself, you'd never been so outward before to someone in your life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While you may have earned my respect, a price is a price. That is why I will be taking the liberty of choosing for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could even blink, Tewi had her arms wrapped tightly around your neck in a chokehold. Is this it? Was she going to kill you? As you gasped for air, you suddenly heard Tewi whisper in your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhh... Go to sleep...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as she commanded. You no longer had any power to object her demands. What followed after this decision was a world of black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mfufufu~ Human... You should know I'm going through a lot of trouble to make this deal better for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a voice in the darkness. It seemed to pierce the blackness around you and fill you with warmth. In an instant, a light enveloped the black world, and you were conscious once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTewi looked over at you. It was at this time you noticed you were bound totally with no route of escape. Tewi began speaking in a nonchalant tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oho~, look who's finally awake~.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Tewi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit girl had a smug look plastered on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thaaaaat's right! You remembered my name after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the girl's cheery attitude, you couldn't help but wonder what was going on. Around you was a strange traditional era household with very basic furniture, but somehow managed too feel cozy in a way. A fire burned in order to warm up the room in the cold night. Tewi must've also taken the liberty of totally stripping you down, as you now wore absolutely nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid I've taken a liking to you human, and you won't be going back to your reality any time soon. It's not all so bad though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTewi stepped closer towards me in a menacing manner. She pulled up a chair and sat directly in front of my dick and stared at it with a perverted look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my dear human, I'm going to give you a very basic choice. You have two options.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTewi held up two fingers to exemplify her emphasis on the choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTewi lifted her foot up and showed you the bottom of her soles. The grim and dead insects were gone, the soft and pink soles she possessed were perfectly symmetrical and masterfully crafted by angels. Noticing your staring, she wiggled her toes to tease you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see, I took a bath and cleaned off my soles of the dead insects and grime. However, I have been walking around this house all day barefoot, so they are just a bit dirty, but considering your reaction right now, it seems as though you find this very enticing \u266a.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing and hearing Tewi's intentions, blood rushes to your dick. Tewi continues speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So here's what's going to happen human, either you're going to lick my soles and I'll let you stay here as my servant, or you can request that your master reward you by playing with your private part with my foot \u2661\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed as though Tewi had no intention of just letting you go. Right now, you have two options, and if you don't pick one, Tewi probably will for you. Which option should you pick?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Some punk who thinks she can boss you around like this, even threaten your life, just because you are in a dire need of her help. There's no way in Hell you're licking those feet, and you're definitely not gonna let her trample all over you either. No, you have to fight back. If she's not gonna help you willingly, then you're gonna make her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou focused whatever strength you had left into your right, and when you it was ready, you threw a might swing at her, hoping to grab her swinging leg, and throw her off balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, it was not meant to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched, with mouth agape, as the girl effortlessly took into the air. She was literally flying, hovering right above your face, just out of your arms' reach. You began to shiver, as Tewi poised both of her feet next to one another, giving you a good look at those two filthy terrors of hers.<br>\r\nThe girl cleared her throat, drawing your attention to her face. Where she once beamed with smug superiority, now she had nothing for you but scorn and disdain. You were a simple creature, so beneath her in terms of power and knowledge, it was only through her grace that she paid you any attention at all. Yet here you lied, having just tried your hand at besting her. Such audacity must be harshly punished.<br>\r\nYou were not gonna like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad move, idiot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit girl dropped down hard, her feet aimed perfectly to fall and stomp pathetic mug into the ground. As they came, you felt pressure and pain beyond anything you've ever experienced in your life... For just a split second or two, before you unceremoniously blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you noted once you've regained consciousness, was the giant foot pinning your face to the ground beneath its substantial girth.The damned, disgusting was large enough to fit your entire face pressed into the arch of its putrid sole. Instinctively, you tried to break free, first pushing at it from the bottom, and when that didn't work, grabbing at its sides, and trying to throw it off. Nothing seemed to work. In fact, once the foot's owner felt you struggling down there, they began applying more pressure, and dragging the entire expanse of her foot across it, until it finally relented.<br>\r\nAfter taking a few gasps of fresh air, and brushing off whatever remained of that foot grim on your face, you were no finally ready to face whoever that foot belonged to. You looked up, and screamed out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTewi was huge, at least three times bigger than you... No, that's wrong. You were small! At most a third of her height! How could this be!? How could ANY of this fucking be!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant girl giggled devilishly at the sound of your screaming. She expected you to lose your mind at the sight of her, but not this spectacularly. Then, as you tried to get up and run away, she simply pressed her toes into your chest, pushing you back down, and once again trapping your body underneath her foot with a simple step. Her toes were able to cover the bottom of your face, your lips included. You tried to keep them sealed, but Tewi was making good progress at forcing them open with her dirty digits, all while delivering her 'breaking' speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, what's the matter, little human? Are you scared of big, bad rabbit Tewi? You should've taken one of the options like every good, brave boy before you did, instead of trying to 'worm' your way out. Although I suppose a vermin like you can't play by the rules. Shame, now you're going to pay for this. Dearly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes narrowed dangerously as she said it. You felt her foot grow heavier, but not because she as exerting more pressure. No, she was simply getting bigger and heavier. Or, more correctly, you were getting smaller, and less resilient. You tried calling to her, apologizing, begging for her to stop, but she would have none of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, like you have anything to bargain with for your freedom. Your life is mine, idiot, and I'm gonna do with it whatever I please. In fact, I've already decided to make you my little, helpless foot worshipper. After all, what better way to punish you than to make you do what you so foolishly tried to get away from in the first place, hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to fight back harder the second she said, but at this point she was all for naught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, you're still too big for me. I'd rather have a tiny slave, one I could effortlessly boss around with my feet. Hmm, how small should I make you?\"<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\nPICK YOUR SIZE:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: a doll, small enough to fit your body beneath both of her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: a toy, so small you can fit under just one foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: a bug, incredibly tiny, forever stuck to her feet.</b></span></div></div>",

Your body began to diminish in size at a much faster rate now. The smaller you got, the harder it was to withstand the pressure Tewi was exerting on your body. Several times you thought you were going to break, pop, your body splattering like a bunch of juicy grapes beneath her feet, but every time Tewi would shift her body around to make sure that wouldn't happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she stood on you with just one foot, while keeping the other one in the air, a good way to 'drive' home just how hopeless you were beneath her. When that proved too unbearable for you to handle, she brought her other foot down, trampling you evenly under both of her sweaty soles. When that was too much, she dropped one of her feet to the ground, leaving the rest of you to be trample and crushed beneath just one sole. And when that was too much, your body literally disappearing underneath her giant foot, she shifted it around to land you under her toes, where she could freely mash you wiith her dirty digits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen even her big toe was large enough to cover your entire body at least five times over, did Tewi finally relent, and moved her foot aside to give you a good look at your 'brand new' surroundings... As well as her own, imposing form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were an ant to her. A lone, insignificant speck of dirt, lying helplessly at the feet of this cruel titaness. You looked up, and up, and further up still, until you were finally able to look her in those scarlet eyes. From down here she looked like the embodiment of your worst nightmares. In the dark of the night her body was almost as black as night, with only its outlines faintly illuminated by the pale moonlight above. Her watchful, red eyes seemed to pierce your very soul with their gaze, her scorn and disdain seeping into your mind, poisoning your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You are nothing to her.<br>\r\nA failure.<br>\r\nAbsolute zero.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden rumbling of the world seemed to pull you of these thought, only to put you face to face with another ghastly image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Tewi was as dark as the night, then her sole was a look into the darkest abyss itself, where the light of hope comes to die. From the tips of her toes, to the very end of her heel, not a single spot of her footflesh pierced the layer of filth that coated her sole. It was a putrid mess from beginning to end, its surface marred with a plethora of various things that met their ends underneath her uncaring steps. Everything from tattered pieces of foliage, to remnants of many no longer recognizable bugs and insects, torn petals of once fragrant flowers, all mashed with mud and sweat into a fine, revolting mesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now... It was your turn to join the fray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\"Thousands of years I walked this Earth alone, trampling any and all that would dare end up or get in my way.\"</i></b><br>\r\nHer cold, distant voice boomed from above, gripping your heart with dread<br>\r\n<i><b>\"From simple bugs and tiny critter, to failed hunters and predators, all learned to respect, fear, and revere me. All, except for the hopeless idiots like yourself. There is no cure to your ignorance and stupidity. The only thing left for me to do is to show you the error of your foolish ways. From this day forward, I shall not walk alone ever again.\"</b></i><br>\r\nHer toes wiggled in anticipation of your imminent punishment, sending down more clumps of sweat and filth to rain down around you. One actually managed to score a hit on you, pushing you to the ground.<br>\r\n<i><b><br>\r\n\"In short... Take this, my little footstain~\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, painfully so, Tewi brought her foot to the ground, ready to squash you into her foot like the legions of bugs before you. With mouth agape in shock, terror clutching your chest you watched as the word you once knew disappeared beneath the approaching darkness, ready to consume you into its folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... No! NO! Wait, please! DON'T!\" Your cries of despair fell on deaf ears, only fueling Tewi's desire to see you firmly mashed into her sole like the worthless speck that you were. Just tried to get away from her, but your efforts were for naught. With her sole poised above your crawling form, Tewi had you exactly where she wanted, trapped right underneath the ball of her oncoming foot. Even though she was able to end it at any second, she still chose to drag this moment for a little while longer, for her amusement, and your prolonged misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her sole swaying in and out your reach, you were left to wallow in your anguish, and shiver in disgust, as the pungent stench of her feet made its unbearable presence known once more. This damned smell was barely tolerable back when you were normal sized, but now.. It was enough to squeeze tears out of you. You cried, and wailed in despair, as the prevalent odour continued on with its endless onslaught. No matter how hard you'd clench your nose, it would always find its way in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeak, pained, and unspeakably miserable, you couldn't even muster the strength to beg her for mercy. You had no hope of it ever working anyways, it's not like she would suddenly listen to your pleas.<br>\r\nWith most of your senses dulled beyond repair by the cruel treatment you were subjected to, you could only barely make it out, as the last flickers of moonlight that illuminated this darkness died out, leaving you alone against the vastness that was the filthy expanse of Tewi's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a heavy, pleased sigh, the rabbit giantess mashed her foot into the ground as firmly as she could, making sure to step down on top of you with the ball of her foot. To her content, you ended up right in the middle of the heavy mass, feeling  unspeakable agony, as thousands of tons of flesh settled down right on top of you. Your body felt as if it could pop at a moment's notice, yet it never did. You screamed in pain, and got a mouthful of the revolting mess that coated her sole in return, shutting you up in an instant... When suddenly Tewi twisted her foot to the left, making you scream in pain yet again, and gulp down another mouthful of her filthy sweat.This cycle would continue for a good, long while, as the rabbit goddess twisted and turned the ball of her foot left and right, carefully ironing you to the bottom of her foot.<br>\r\nIt was hellishly painful, and did its job well. You felt, as the layer of dirt in front of you gave way to your body, leading you towards the bared, unscathed flesh of her sole, while piles of this filth covered you from behind, hiding your meager form from the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as the pristine bottom of Tewi's foot came more and more into view, the giantess commenced the final phase of her devious scheme. Grinding her foot into the ground like she never did before, Tewi intended to literally bury you in the flesh of sole. You couldn't fight it, push back against the oppressive flesh. You could only 'sit back', and sink in. Let it take you. Succumb to her soles. Become a part of something bigger. Something greater...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last finishing stomp, Tewi proudly secured her very first eternal footslave within the folds of her sole. With a bright smile on her face, the mischievous rabbit kicked her foot behind her to get a better look at her sole. She could not see nor feel your body, but she could clearly feel your 'essence', your very soul that she bound to her foot for millennia to come.<br>\r\nWith a happy yip she brought her foot down to the ground, to some mighty gratifying results. A shiver of delight went through her body, as she squashed your essence further into her foot. Each step brought her the satisfaction of snuffing a human life, your life underfoot. For every footfall, every jump, every hop, you were always there for her to take it. To be trampled, trotted over, squashed and stamped out. Over and over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTewi knew not how you actually felt down there. Whether you experienced pure joy, or constant agony, it didn't matter to her in the slightest. She would tread the world one blissful step after another, oblivious to your delight or suffering. All that mattered was the constant feeling of fulfillment she got from walking all over your essence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour soul, her insole. What a deliciously demeaning way to go~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><div align=\"center\"><i><b>~ ENJOY THE ETERNITY AT HER FEET, WORM ~</b></i></div></span></span></div></div>",

The only way to survive is to accept that fact, and willingly throw yourself at their feet like an obedient pet that you were always meant to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr you can try being a brave hero, and learn the hard way just how below those ladies you really are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe choice is yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings allowed in this story:<br>\r\n- foot worship: licking, massaging, sniffing, and anything else you can think of that could fit in that cathegory;<br>\r\n- stomping, trampling, crushing, and other forms of suffering underfoot;<br>\r\n- shrinking/giantesses and transformations are allowed, but only in service of the foot-related activities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther things to mention:<br>\r\n- the routes will be segregated based on games and characters that appear in them, rather than named locations. I think it's a less limiting option, since you can techincally meets most of those girls anywhere in Gensokyo. I leave the details of your first encounter up to you;<br>\r\n- no OCs outside of the main character, so no characters from the fanmade games, stories, etc. Canon stuff only;<br>\r\n- the main character isn't immortal, and you can off them in any foot-related way you desire;<br>\r\n- the characters who normally don't have legs (like mermaids or ghosts) will be given a pair for the purpose of this story. I don't feel like excluding those girls due to such a minor, easily rectifiable inconvenience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you're not familiar with the Touhou Project, I recommend googling it to familiarize yourself with the setting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun~</td>",
