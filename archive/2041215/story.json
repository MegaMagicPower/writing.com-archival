Having no equipment and no real protection, Rick is majorly disadvantaged in any matchup, but his ungodly endurance will more than make up for it.</span></div></div>",

He walked in with the same mild curiosity that he had every other ring, noting how it was smaller and cozier to match the simplistic nature of the contest. This was to be a head-to-head, no-funny-business, no fancy tools, good old-fashioned tickle fight. Simple in execution and design.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy still hadn't received anything more to wear other than his jockstrap, leaving everything but his dangly bits exposed for the crowd to see. He was getting used to it, but he had hoped that the crowd would be more interested in fair fights so that he might get some more protection. That wasn't turning out to be the case though: they were just as happy to see the poor sap get tickled as any real competition that might be going on at other times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing internally, Rick entered the ring regardless, showing a genuine half-smile as he waved to the crowd, which answered back with an enthusiastic cheer as they recognized their favorite punching bag.</span></div></div>",

He rushed the other man and then poked him in the side a few tomes to test the waters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided that even if this guy, Rick, didn't look very threatening he was still going to be careful about this fight.

He sped towards the other man and instead of tickling immediately, he simply grabbed his legs out from under him and left him face up on the floor. Gaius pinned him rather easily after that, holding his arms above his head with one hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over his opponent again and decided that since the sides hadn't gotten the reaction he had really hoped for, he would try somewhere else and settled for a few light touches to the man's exposed belly.</span></div></div>",

Fortunately for the outmatched Rookie, his opponent's lack of experience or perhaps simple overconfidence meant that, despite the obvious difference in strength, Rick was able to weasel his wrists out from beneath his opponent's grasp.

startled and fall back giving free access to his bare feet in which  Tony got full advantage of as he pulls them into a headlock and stated running his fingers through them \u201chehahahahahahhahahahhaha\u201d the martial artist laughed for the first time since the competition began and he could not stop \u201cnooohhhhhmyfeeheehhetttthhhhh\u201d but Tony kept the foot tickling till he opponent was weak and climbed his torso and started undoing Gaius belt and pinned his hands above his head exposing his armpits filled with blond hair and Tony felt jealous of it he did not care about not having any chest or leg hair but armpit and pubbing hair he missed them since that day Ryder shaved him and used that lotion on him to stop it from ever-growing and so he ran his fingers through the forest of hair tickling like he was punishing them for being so hairy sending the blonde into hysterics. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHAHAHAHAHAHAAOUAHHAHAHHAHAHAAHAHA\u201d Gaius scrammed as his  armpit was getting abused by the merciless fingers but his went to silent laughter when the black-haired boy put two fingers at the base of his underarm and started drilling here like his trying to find oil, he must do something before it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd not soon after that though passes the opportunity came, distracted by his pit tickling Tony loosed his grab on Gaius wrists and he manged to free himself now sending both him and the raven head into barrel roll fortunate his was the one on top and their roles were now reversed tony was the one with his arms pinned high above his head and Gaius was the vengeful one ready to get revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony felt his shirt being lifted once more but it did not come off just enough to reveal his belly button in which the younger man stated blowing Raspberry after raspberry to the muscular belly sending Tony into ticklish tears \u201cNOOOOHHHHHHOHHHOHOHHAHAHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHHANOOOHHHTMYBEEEHEHEHEHLLLYPLEAHHAH AHHASHE\u201d the blackhead knew he was In trouble now his endurance was not the best when it comes to tickling and knew he did not have much time left, that fear doublet when he saw Gaius leave his belly and leaving his hands only to go and starting undoing his sneakers  almost <br>\r\n<br>\r\n.instadly he tried to get up to stop him but the younger man was smarted and stated tickling his jean-clad thigh distracting him enough to pull out the sneaker and tickling the socked feet \u201cNONNONOHHOHHOHOHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAMYFEEHHHTSTOOOOOPEHAHHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\u201d his pits and his feet were the most ticklish parts of his body and now he was getting one of them horribly tortured his torture worsen when both shoes and socks were off and his bare feet were getting the full treatment of tickling, Tony almost jump out of his skin when Gaius started brushing his toes but just before all was over for the older man Tony managed to summon enough stretch to put his arms inside his opponents open rove and stated tickling his hip bones sending into laughing \u201cHeheehheheheheh\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hips were not normally that ticklish but all the sweating he been doing make him sensitive enough to surprise him to stop the foot tickling just enough for Tony to get back as he move up to his hyper sensitive side making him turn into a ticklish ball and the raven head to took full advantage of that  to push him off while trying to think what to do with his opponent when he suddenly knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Ryder had commanded him to always be naked when they were alone one of his favored things to do was to order him to get dressed in what ever outfit he wanted and started to wrestle him to his bed stripping him and tickling him all the way until he was only to his Chasity underwear calling him weak and pathetic all the to the removal of his clothing for not being able to keep his clothes on so he decided to do something similar he was not going to belittle the other guy he did not deserve that but he was going to strip him to his underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he thought of that he re-pinned his opponent with his arms above his head with his robe already open he only now needs to remove it but first there two spots that he hasn\u2019t tickled yet: nipples and belly. And so, he started belly first running his fingers through the firm stomach under him sending ticklish waves into poor Gaius whole body \u201cHAHAHAHAHAHAHHANOOHOHOHOHOHOHOPLEEEHEEHEHAAAHAHHASESTOOOHOHOHOHPPLEASONNNIIHI HIHIIHBEEEHEHHEGYOUHUHUHUHUHUH\u201d the younger man pleaded as his abs were getting a full tickling treatment, at one point tony put his finger at his mouth and started talking his belly button making the blonde go into silent laughter once more as his very sensitive button was tortured \u201cNOTOOHHHHHMYBEEHHHELLYBUTTOOHHNOOOHOHOHOHOHOPLEAHAHAHAHASEEHEHEHEAHHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAAHA\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony after 5 minutes stopped tickling the blondes very ticklish innie and moved his hand into his right nipple and started playing with it \u201chheheheheheheehhehe\u201d Gaius laughed as his nipple was torture he was not that ticklish here not to the right and not left and though he could use it to escape but Tony saw that and quickly finished tickling both nipples and shove his hand to the sweaty blond-haired pit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNOOHOHOHOHOHHAHAHAAHHAHAHA\u201d now that he covered all of the upper body, the rave head stared removing the martial artist robe. Gaius was so weak he could not resist and let Tony remove his clothing till he felt something of his wrists: Tony was using his black belt  to tie his hands together leaving him defenseless. After Tony finished the wrist he went down to his opponent upper thighs and digs his finger under it \u201cwhaATHAHAHAHAAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA?!!\u201d the blonde shouted in surprise as the older boy wreaked havoc  at his defenseless thighs going as far as to pinch the toes of his bare feet and with wrist tied like that he had no way of resisting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he ended tickling all over the thighs he went and remove the martial artist pants leaving him only in his underwear. For the first time since that match stated the raven-haired man took a look at his opponent and the view was totally pathetic his upper body and thighs were having red marks all over them and he was drenched in sweat for head to toe making his wild hair stick to his head and increasing his ticklishness tenfold. \u201cready to surrender yet?\u201d Tony asked, \u201c\u2019 gasp\u2019 no \u2018gasp\u201d way\u201d the sweaty blonde answered Tony only smiled and grab Gaius bound wrist and pinned above his head sitting on them and potion his fingers at the trebly sensitive underarms \u201clast chance\u201d \u201cgo fuck yourself\u201d \u201cas you wish\u201d and with that he went all out at the pits running his fingers through the sweaty forest of hair scratching piking and tickling poor Gaius with an inch of his life \u201cHAHAHANOHAHAAHAHAHAHHAPLEAHAHAHAHASEHHEHEHEHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAH AHAHI GIVE YPAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\u201d He said only 2 minutes into the pit torture  Tony let up the torture sucking in his victory happy he managed to win  because now one he could get the one thing he wanted revenge for Ryder was the next opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaybacks\u2019 going to be a bitch  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Max begins moving down towards Draken legs and sat on his thighs. Max started once again tickling Draken legs, both bare and socked, making Draken laugh and pounding his fists into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax only chuckled and stopped before saying \"Aww, who is making cute noises now.\" Draken took a deep breathe and was about to respond but Max begins tickling Draken legs and thighs again making Draken laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax still on top of Draken thighs, hears Draken is out of breath and energy, grabs Draken legs and begins moving them along with his legs. Draken still trying to recover from Max tickling feels that Max is moving his legs, making him curious about what Max is doing. Max legs are now trapping Draken legs with Draken feet facing Max.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax with a hummed grabbing Draken high tops and begins slowly untying took them. Draken knowing what is about to happened begins wiggling and moving trying to get Max off of him but it was not enough. Max grabs Draken high tops tosses them showing the soles of Draken socked galaxy thigh highs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax with a slight blush and a smile looks at Draken socked foot. Draken realizing his most ticklish spot was about to be touched, begins to fidget and move trying to move. Max begins going up, down, and zig zagging on Draken socks feet. Draken begins to do a laugh between a giggled and a cackle and begins pounding his fists on the arena. \"NhaHAhahHaHAHAHAHAhahahaoooo nHAHAHAHohahahahahhat mhehehheHEHEHEHEHeyyyy fhehehehEHEHEhehehehehHEHEeheheht!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a minute, Max continues tickling Draken socked feet. Draken went ballistic a few times, for example, when Max started tickle between Draken toes, another example is when Max's hand grabbed a foot toes and hold them back while Max other hand begins scratching up and down underneath the toes and his sole.<br>\r\nFinally Max stopped, allowing Draken to take many deep breath that he needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraken kept on fidgeting and moving around and moaning. Max hearing and feeling Draken move thought that the reason why was because of the too much tickling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax smiled and said \"Aww, poor you.\" However unknown to Max the real reason why Draken is doing it because Max crotch was rubbing against Draken leg and Draken own was rubbing the arena and he was enjoyed the foot tickling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax grabs Draken left socked foot and grabs the socked toes while his other hand grabbed the end of the sock and begins pulling the sock off. Draken face still red and some tears in his eyes begins shaking his head and moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax finally pulls the sock off and put the sock on the ground and looked at Draken now bare foot and he blushes when looking at Draken size 9 foot. Draken foot is surprisingly smooth and well taken care off. His foot has a lighter tone than his tanned skin, high arches, a round heel and medium length toes. Due to the fact that his foot was in a sock the entire time and Draken been moving a lot, it is now slightly sweaty and slightly shiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraken finally recovering his breath waits for the tickling. When not received the tickling he looked back at Max and saw him looking at his feet and was blushing. Draken thinking he knows why Max is blushing, begins scrunch and wiggle his toes and his sole, which made the boy blush more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, do you like my feet.\" said Draken with a tired smile, who wiggled and scrunch his toes and moving his sole more, making Max blush more.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In desperation, she grabbed the ropes that separated the arena from the audience. The fans erupted into cheers and boos. Some were chanting for the maid to hold on, while others wanted Silva to capture the cosplayer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! Mercy!\" The Maid pleads as she holds on. To Silva, it's obvious Madame Maid is in quite a predicament. Her rear is sticking out from all the pulling, while her dress is of a high quality, unable to be rip to shreds. Madame Maid wore it to protect her modesty, but no regretted it as Silva had a firm grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to enjoy this!\" Silva taunts while she starts to pull. </span></div></div>",

Her only clothing is a tiger skin loincloth wrapped loosely around her waist and a similarly small garment tied around her chest, leaving almost all of her skin exposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkari is extremely competitive, leading her to enter the tickle tournament despite being extremely ticklish herself. She has a cocky attitude from being a tall, strong oni. Unfortunately, her size and strength make her slow and not very maneuverable. However, once she has an opponent in her grasp, it's almost impossible to wriggle free. Because of her strength, Akari can take being tickled for a long time. Perhaps unfortunately for her, this means she has to endure a lot of tickling before finally giving in and submitting. Being tickled is also the only way to weaken her steely muscles. While not the most experienced tickler, she makes up for it with enthusiasm, tickling with zeal and intensity when she finally corners her opponent.</span></div></div>",

But the tickling and teasing was making it even harder to focus, and Silva easily managed to dodge the attempts to push her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the huntress was back, this time finding the long indentation of Akari's bellybutton.

This is what you get for exposing such a tempting tickle target like this bellybutton here. I wonder what happens if I tickle inside\u2026?\" As she asked, Silva dove in with a wiggling fingertip, causing the oni to buck and squeal with laughter.

Silva's face moved across the shaking, ticklish expanse, blowing raspberries as fingertips wriggled against those sides. Silva leaned in to nibble against Akari's right hip, a tactic that she discovered was quite effective. Akari bucked and squealed, as high pitched giggles erupted from her in rapid succession. Silva was surprised at the sounds, and how the big ogre actually sounded rather cute at the moment, brought low by a few raspberries and tummy nibbles. Silva's only regret was that she couldn't verbally tease while tickling with her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkari felt her strength slowly fading from all this tickling, her body spending its energy uselessly as she flailed instinctively from the tickling, losing her breath as she used it to laugh endlessly. She had to admit, the human woman was more talented than she looked, and if Akari didn't do something fast this tickling might actually be the end of her. She had to do something quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummoning her remaining strength and air, the giggly oni clamped her legs around Silva and flipped her, sending them spiraling on the floor. The huntress was so focused on tickling that she hadn't paid any attention to a counterattack, and after a brief tussle Akari managed to get on top of her despite her giggly demeanor. Akari's strong legs pinned Silva's arms as she kneeled over the smaller woman, panting and giggling from the lingering sensation of Silva's lips on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha\u2026hehehe\u2026 rrrr!\" Akari growled, embarrassed at her continued giddiness. \"Now I've got you! Let's see how you like it!\" Akari leaned down and began wriggling her fingers under Silva's arms. It was a simple tactic, but an effective one: Silva immediately started to snicker and squirm, tugging in vain at her pinned arms. Her armpits were stretched taut, exposing the pale hollows to Akari's eager fingers, which curled up and down repeatedly over the sensitive spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTickle tickle, you stupid woman!\" Akari taunted, now free of the giddy feelings of earlier, yet still feeling sensitively on edge from the earlier tickling. \"You can dish it out, but I bet you can't take it, huh?\" The oni's fingers moved lower, also teasing the tops of Silva's breasts, making the huntress gasp and giggle anew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilva knew if she didn't get out of this grasp, things would start to get bad for her. The big oaf would just keep tickling, and might even remove her top! Silva knew she had drained some of the stamina from the beast woman, if she could only press the attack again...</span></div></div>",

When she felt the hand start to squeeze the extremely ticklish spot on anyone's hip, hysterical laughter poured out of her mouth again as her lower body contorted desperately left and right, her legs trying to weakly kick off the ground. The constant laughter and her erratic movements however were extremely taxing on her stamina, her belly already starting to ache from the constant stream of giggles she was pouring out, her mouth unable to form anymore coherent words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?

She proceeded to wrestle the jacket off the exhausted and gasping Silva, and threw it far away to the edges of the arena. Barely able to breath a midst her giggles, Silva tried to slowly crawl away from the taunting Akari, her arms barely managing to support her up, tired from struggling a few seconds ago to the Oni's ticklish ministrations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like no top for you.

She giggled with surprisingly high pitched laughter that shook her body in quick reverberations. It also interfered with her ability to tickle the huntress beneath her. The oni's fingers slowed, ticklish Silva's breasts with a lighter and much more distracted touch, now almost caressing them lovingly as fingertips grazed the perimeter of her breasts in wide circles, then slowly rubbing her nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tickling became easier and easier to bear for Silva, as the oni slowed more and more the human could finally catch her breath. But the change in touch did nothing to stop her growing heat. If anything, the lighter strokes only inflamed them more. Silva knew the effect such a distraction could have if it went any farther, and redoubled her attack. She squeezed and kneaded at Akari's inner thighs, reaching down to tickle them with a fervor that surprised even her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe result of this locked tickle fight was an oni laughing louder and louder, and the huntress giggling and gasping with an increasingly flushed face. Nevertheless, Silva was getting the upper hand. With each squeeze to that soft skin, wriggling against the firm muscle underneath, she felt Akari's grip weakening. \u201cSuch ticklish thighs you have, you monstrous woman!

Adjusting her weight, she moved her hands down to bat away Silva's. But this was all the opportunity the huntress needed. In that moment the oni's weight wasn't pressed down on her, she pulled herself out from under with a swift motion, pulling herself up by her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stood, Silva decided to even a certain score rather than go in for another tickle attack. She quickly reached up and grabbed Akari's leopard-skin top, pulling with all her strength. The small garment was easy to rip away, and with a flourish it was thrown across the arena. Akari's large, full breasts were exposed to the open air, a seductive weapon in their own right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehehe, rrrr!\u201d Akari growled as she tried to stop giggling, showing a chink in the armor of that mighty stamina as she couldn't hide her giddiness. \u201cI'll get you for doing that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's only fair after what you did to me.\u201d Silva retorted as she plotted her next move, the oni still gaining her breath and deciding whether to try to cover herself modesty or charge in and press another attack.

This caused an immediate and explosive reaction, Akari throwing her head back in howling laughter, before collapsing into girlish giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you look at that, you big ticklish Oni!

Just give up, and I might relent in my tickles...\" Flicking her fingers over the Oni's erect nipples, all Akari could do was gasp, her body also getting quite excited as she struggled not to moan out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting desperate, Akari tried to think of a way to trick the huntress, shouting out the first thing that came to her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone can, Hahahahaaa, see your ticklish big breasts, you female human!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes widening in shock and surprise, forgetting that she didn't have a top...</span></div></div>",

Something about it was strangely pleasant to the taste, a sweet muskiness that only egged Silva on, getting somewhat drunk on the sensual power her tongue had over the other woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore too long, Akari couldn't take any more. She pushed away from Silva, freeing the huntress from the pin. Akari flailed away, giggling and snickering to herself, her chest heaving with heavy breathing. Silva could also see the darkened cheeks on Akari, as well as the pertly stiffened nipples, and could tell the licking was doing more than simply tickling the oni. As the oni laughed and tried to slowly pull herself to her feet, Silva knew she had to press the offensive. If Akari recovered her strength, Silva doubted she could get the upperhand like that again. The huntress then had an idea that would let her protect her chest from prying eyes as well as torment her opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilva got up and rushed at Akari, tackling the larger woman to the ground. The surprised and still giggling oni opened her eyes wide in surprise as her back hit the soft earth. Silva laid on top of her, the woman's breasts pressing firmly into Akari's stomach, covering them. It also positioned Silva face directly over Akari's breasts once more, and she wasted no time licking them again, flicking the tip of her tongue over a nipple and hearing the oni giggle and moan underneath her, clearly weakening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilva tried to hold Akari's arms to her sides to prevent any counterattack. If possible, Silva hoped she could even reach around behind the red woman to the small of her back, a hopefully ticklish spot as well. Silva had no time to taught as she licked and nibbled, getting increasingly enthralled by the jiggling breasts offered to her.</span></div></div>",

Silva, who was caught off guard, had no time to react as she felt the powerful hands grab at her, lifting her away and dangling her above the two red mounds in front of her, as her opponent caught her breath. Trying to get out of the Oni's hands, she tried to struggle about in the air, but couldn't find any sort of footing or leverage to propel herself against, making her efforts futile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You naughty little monkey, licking my breasts and making me laugh! I'll teach a cheeky human like you what it feels like to have you breasts licked by another person!\" Gulping, she felt Akari lowering her body, just enough so that her own breasts, which she had taken measures to hide from the crowd, were now just above the grinning Oni's own mouth, both knowing what was about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-now hold on a second, how about we talk things through, like civilized people! There's no need for us to go around licking things!\" A slight blush already reappearing on her face, Silva audibly gulped, already knowing what was going through her opponents mind. She tried to reach her hands to cover her chest, but all Akari had to do was stretch her hands to her sides, leaving the huntress' chest vulnerable and naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you were just licking my own breasts just a few minutes ago, human. If I remember correctly, your own chest was particularly ticklish as well. Enough talking! Now laugh for me, monkey!\" Giving the front of Silva's breasts one long lick with her rough tongue, the huntress' mouth formed an o-shaped ring, before bursting out into hysterical laughter, as the audience in the crowd of the arena also burst into louder cheers than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you hear that, monkey? They're cheering for me, and me only!\" Using the tip of her large tongue, she traced shapes before the laughing and giggling huntress, not relenting in her ticklish attacks. Remembering what Silva had done to her previously, she flicked her tongue across the undersides of the dangling globes, nibbling on their centers. It was all Silva could do to not burst out into silent laughter as tears of mirth started to stream down her face, moans of ecstasy mixing in with her own feminine laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems someone really likes my tongue exploring across her breasts!

The tip of her tongue flicked against the jiggling undersides, each ticklish attack causing Silva to arch her back and let out a stream of giggles. Akari wasn't content with merely tickling the alluring globes, and also alternated with gentle nibbles, using her lips to ticklishly please Silva's nipples. The dual attack was quickly wearing down Silva's resistance. Moans mixed in with giggles, and Silva was becoming more and more aroused with each moment. While she knew that she had to do something before it was too late, it was harder and harder to think of anything at all. Just Akari's lips and tongue doing devilish things to her, making her squeal and moan and writhe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilva's body was mostly moving on its own now, her hips bucking against the oni as she slowly lost the will to fight back. \"Ah, enjoying this are you?\" Akari teased between licks. \"Just surrender to me, and I'll make it feel even better!\" The idea was starting to sound acceptable to Silva, to just give in\u2026 But then Akari's tongue slipped, moving from the sides of Silva's breast right under her arm, giving a lick to that ticklish place. Silva squealed and jolted, using a reserve of energy neither realized she had. She wriggled free of Akari's grip, leaving the oni momentarily stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her haze, Silva wasn't trying to plan a careful counterattack. She just launched herself at Akari again, wrapping her hands to the oni's soft sides and wriggling, while her head landed right between Akari's sizeable breasts, returning the torment she had been given. Akari burst into laughter, still not recovered from the earlier tickling and licking done to her. Akari reached down and tried to retaliate, squeezing Silva's sides. The woman laughed easily, no longer having any resistance to the tickling. But she just laughed into Akari's chest, and even this tickled the oni, feeling the reverberations of Silva's lips still stimulating her. Not to mention the fact that Silva wasn't letting go, not letting up her tickle attack on Akari's sides. Her fingers swiftly wriggled up and down, squeezing and massaging the ticklish red skin and probing for weak points to exploit. The two wrestled in their ticklish hug, wrapped up in each other with neither willing to let go. Both were near their limits, giggling and moaning from it all.</span></div></div>",

Moving her hands downwards, the Oni started to clumsily fumble with the zipper below her that will finally strip her opponent of her leg wear, trying to grasp at the little catch to pull it down, along with everything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer feeling fingers squeezing at her own sides, along with something tugging at her waist, the giggling huntress looked down from between Akari's large bosom, curious as to what was causing it. With a large tug, she surprisingly saw her tight pants, which was just a few moments ago fitting snugly on her long legs, now falling to the ground and exposing her black bikini bottom, a pair of red hands the culprit of this deed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap, I have to gain some distance between this apparently not-so-dumb Oni, before she catches me with my pants down... Literally!\" Giving one last pinch to a laughing Akari's sides, Silva tried to retreat backwards in order to formulate another plan. However, forgetting the minor detail of her leather jeans now fallen to the ground around her ankles, constricting the movements of her feet, she tripped backwards, wincing as she fell on rear. As she tried to quickly get up, she felt herself being pushed back, as a large red object sat on her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why is she not facing towards me, if she's sitting on me? Just a few moments ago, she was like a crazed woman, going to town on my chest... Unless...\" Silva got her answer soon enough, the feeling of fingers drawling across the tops of her tender thighs, causing a wide grin to creep up on her mouth as she felt what was like electricity literally coursing through her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at you monkey, all giggling already. Don't tell me that this ticklish little monkey has... Sensitive legs?\" Hearing the cheers of the crowd now on her side, Akari grinned, grabbing and giving the squirming Huntress' thighs a hard squeeze. All Silva could do was widen her eyes in surprise, finally realizing what the Oni was up to, before she collapsed into giggles, the stream of girlish giggles soon quickly becoming full blown hysterical laughter, her fists slamming the floor of the tickling Colosseum in vain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears of mirth clouding her vision, Silva tried one desperate attempt to get the Oni to get off her, using her abdominal muscles to bring her body forward, her fingers ready to try her previous tactic, digging into Akari's exposed sides. As she was about to make contact, she felt ten tickly digits wiggle delving into the gap between her thighs, skittering across the ticklish areas that she would normally keep hidden. Throwing her head back in laughter, the weakened Huntress flopped back down to the ground, her energy finally spent as she lay underneath the Oni, giggling like a lunatic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear you giggling like a ticklish monkey, but that's not all you want to do, is it, you sensitive human?\" Scratching at the sensitive edges of the Huntress' bikini bottoms, she heard what were previously just ticklish giggles and laughter now turn into moaning and laughter, Silva no longer trying to squirm free from the ticklish ministrations of Akari as her mind started to cloud itself with ticklish and lusty thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right...

The feathery sensation stimulated her womanhood in an surprisingly pleasant way, despite Silva's best efforts to deny it even to herself. But her laughter became huskier, her hips began to writhe in a tell-tale way, and she even began to moan as the tickling was now arousing her more and more. It was sapping her will, and making the idea of submitting more appealing. She was now tempted to let the oni win, just as long as she would keep going enough to bring Silva to the height of pleasure, to overwhelm her completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Silva still had her pride, and wasn't going to go out without a fight just yet. With a herculean effort, she sat up again, tensing her ab muscles in order to sit up and position herself to strike Akari. She reached up and clamped her hands to the other woman's sides, wriggling fiercely. Akari has gotten completely distracted in her task, and was taken by surprise at this counter, having thought Silva too exhausted and overwhelmed to do anything now. The surprisingly aggressive tickling made Akari jump, and she fell off Silva as she pushed her hands away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilva knew she had to press her advantage and take the opportunity. If she let Akari recover, Silva would just get pinned again, this time for sure. She still giggled from the earlier tickling, feeling a warm tingling down below. Yes, she had to move quickly now. She jumped at Akari, who was in the process of climbing to her feet. The attack threw the big oni off balance, sending them both falling to the floor. Akari lay on her stomach, the wind momentarily knocked out of her, leaving her dazed. It was exactly the break Silva needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilva reached down underneath Akari's clothes. Her wiggling fingers moved forward\u2026 until they found their target. They stroked ticklishly against Akari's most sensitive places, retaliating for what Akari had done to her. With Silva's other hand she reached up to tickle the side of one of Akari's breasts, the bare side spilling out from under her as she pressed into the ground. Silva caressed and fondled the soft ticklish skin there, as the dual attack had its effect on the oni. She chuckled in near silent laughter, as well as letting out a whimpering moan that betrayed just how much of an effect the twin tickles had on her. The oni bucked, her body undulating in an instinctive movement that showed her lust and overstimulation. Silva grinned, doing her best to ride the bucking beast long enough to make her surrender with the devastating tactic.</span></div></div>",

As Silva got off the gasping Akari, she quickly covered her chest with one hand as she remembered the numerous onlookers, quickly putting her bra, as well as her discarded jacket back onto her upper body. As she made a move to walk away, she picked up a piece of cloth. As Akari craned open one eye to look at her opponent, her lust still unspent, she saw that the cheeky human had take loin cloth, as well as the piece of cloth she used to cover her chest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want this back, come find me. I did learn much from this battle, and I wouldn't mind going for another round of the hunt with, or against you.\" Giving Akari a small wink,  Silva finally went into the doorway leading away from the Colosseum.

No wonder your're laughing like a hyena!\" She taunts Giselle. Madame Maid had no chance of escape at the moment, captive to the smirking Akari. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahoohhnoooo!\" Giselle manages to squeaks out. She kicks her legs repeatedly, and ends up flashing her knickers to the crowd. All the males, and some females, cheer at the glimpse of her black underwear. Worse still, she feels a damp feeling between her legs, with her skin being stimulated like this. She squirms harder as her mind tries to keep sane and think of a plan when Akari...</span></div></div>",

Her skin is a charcoal gray, almost black, and her hair is a similarly dark blue-black shade, an indigo of almost-night. These features make her a master of night and shadow, although they will serve her less well under the lights of the arena. Her only colorful features are her eyes, which have a bright pink shade. She wears little clothing, reminiscent of a bellydancer: soft silks of crimson and gold trim cover her breasts and waist, easy to move around in as well as enchanted to silence her footfalls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe a confident woman, an agile thief known for slipping in and out of wealthy homes and causing untold mischief while there. Her nimble fingers have teased the combinations to safes out of hysterical countesses and dukes in their bedclothes. Now she seeks to win fame in the arena, using her long fingers to tickle and stimulate her opponents into sweet surrender. To date, everyone she has tickled has inevitably succumbed and given her exactly what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Secret Information]: Despite wearing such revealing clothing, Aphrah is quite ticklish. A feather light touch along her back makes her shudder and giggle, a finger dragging across her belly makes it suck in and quiver with laughter. And that's to say nothing of what happens if one manages to scritch the insides of her hips, the smooth hollows of her underarms, or the alluring curves of her dark breasts. Her intoxicating, beautiful laughter makes it so that her tormenters never want to stop, becoming entranced by the sound and the feel of her silky smooth skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut most secret of all- a white tattoo of a feather at her left inner thigh, just at the pantyline and covered by her clothes. Tickling this spot will absolutely short circuit her, turning her muscles to jelly and making her weak as a kitten. Teasing that spot can also arouse her terribly, so close to even tastier treasures\u2026 but Aphrah takes care not to expose this vulnerability under any circumstances, lest it be discovered.</span></div></div>",

She usually relies mostly on her nine tails to do most of the tickling and fighting for her, as well as her cunning and wit. However, if she somehow loses concentration, it becomes extremely hard for her to even control one of her many tails to do her bidding. Also, a secret she wishes to keep from many of her enemies, if they somehow make it past her defenses, she could be easily reduced to a laughing mess with just a few stroke of some feathers or fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer appearance consists of long golden hair with feline ears, reaching all the way to her rear. She dons a red kimono, wearing a lacy red bra and panties under it. Her footwear consists of a pair of geta (Japanese footwear) on her feet. She also isn't the most athletic of felines, but she is quite certain that she won't be moving about, with her tails doing most of the work after all.</span></div></div>",

She stood casually at the arena, a hand on one hip, as she waiting patiently for her opponent to arrive. The far door slowly opened, and a woman in a kimono stepped forward to join her. No, not quite a woman: she had nine fox tails bobbing behind her. Aphrah eyed them cautiously, realizing their potential as effective tickle tools. An imperceptible shiver ran down her spine as she remembered getting caught in a rather tickle grip wrapped in a mink skin rug. The dark elf imagined those tails would have a similar effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHagoromo eyed her opponent silently as well. It was a lovely looking dark elf, with deliciously exposed skin. How did she expect to win if she was going to reveal all that ticklish skin? Either the woman wasn't ticklish, or she was a fool. Hagoromo very much hoped it was the latter, almost salivating as she looked over the taut curves on that dark frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair began to silently circle each other, both acting defensively and neither wanting to make the first move. Aphrah watched the fox woman cautiously, trying to identify some kind of weakness she could exploit. The dark elven woman was also trying to identify her first tickle spot to target. The kimono was an effective covering, much better than her own. Perhaps she could go for those feet, remove her footwear? Or maybe her best strategy was to try and remove that kimono as quickly as possible before even trying to tickle her? Aphrah hesitated defensively as she tried to come up with a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Hagoromo didn't have to worry about such things as removing clothing. Aphrah was already sufficiently exposed\u2026 at least for the moment. Although the nine-tailed fox did wonder what it would be like to expose and tickle Aphrah naked breasts, how ticklish they might be\u2026 and perhaps down below as well! But she didn't have time to fantasize, the present requiring her attention. She was so close to Aphrah now, and reached out with her fingers to try and squeeze the woman's sides\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Aphrah dodged,  hopping lightly away as she continued her defensive posture. But not to be deterred, Hagoromo turned and pursued her, reaching out for another attack! Again Aphrah dodged, hopping away as her pink eyes kept tracking Hagoromo's hand movements, her footwork, analyzing it for something she could exploit. There! She saw Hagoromo put all her weight on her left foot, leaning to one side as she lost her balance for a brief moment. Aphrah turned to strike, her long fingers reaching out to grab at the hem of that kimono...</span></div></div>",

Now that we both have areas of our body uncovered, I can't wait to tickle you all over that belly... You must be quite ticklish there, am I not mistaken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegaining her composure, Hagoromo opted not to reset her clothing and gave a haughty laugh to the thief, who was quite surprised at this reaction. \"You may have taken away the protection of my upper body, but don't you think you're missing out on something?\" Glancing behind her the fox, Aphrah quickly tried to find something amiss, judging from the Fox's hint. \"One... Two... Three... Four... Five... Six... Seven... Eight... Wait! Where is her last tail!\" Now panicked, she turned her head, warily scanning around the arena for the missing tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you silly thief... While you were busy counting, you got so distracted you didn't see my tail move in closer towards you. Why don't you take a look at your feet, my dear thief?\" With a sly smile, she gestured towards the floor, Aphrah turning her head to do the same. In that instant, something long and white lashed out towards the thief from behind Hagoromo, catching the gullible thief off guard. Before she knew it, two of the kitsune's many tails had caught her wrists, pulling them up and above her head. As she looked on, she saw the last Ninth tail sneakily appear from behind the fox's back, previously hidden by the other tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lied to me! You said that your last tail was at my feet!\" Struggling, she didn't manage to break out of the tails wrapping around her wrists, their fluffy grip surprisingly tight. Covering her giggling mouth gracefully with a hand, Hagoromo walked closer towards the trapped thief. \"But if you recall, I didn't say any of my tails were at your feet, am I not wrong? I merely suggested that you looked down at your feet, which you did, leaving yourself a <i>very</i> tempting target for me. Who am I to look a gift horse in the mouth? Now enough talking. Let's see how ticklish you really are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Aphrah could protest, Hagoromo reached forward with both of her hands, and started to methodically squeeze the the trapped thief's wiggling hips. The nervous look on Aphrah's feminine face slowly turned into a small smile, before stretching into a wide grin, snickers and giggles already escaping the corner of her lips. \"Why don't you let out all those giggles out? I'm sure your laughter is quite beautiful, isn't it, my dear ticklish dark elf? How about I help that tight lipped mouth of yours a little. It seems that it has trouble opening up, doesn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMischievously, Hagoromo brought up two of her tails closer towards Aphrah's shaking head. One tail delicately traced across the elf's bare neck, while the other delicately started to stroke underneath her nose, in a ticklish attempt to make her sneeze and burst out into laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, don't be shy you ticklish elf. Just relax, and let all your laughter out. I promise I won't tickle you that much if you do. I might even be willing to let you tickle me back.\" Even Aphrah could see though Hagoromo's blatant facade of lies right now, her joyous face continuing to enjoy her opponents squirming torment and resistance. She knew she had to do something, before she burst out laughing like a fool!</span></div></div>",

Normally Aphrah would be embarrassed by the display, but under Cassie's odd spell Aphrah could only stand there in a daze, leaning against Cassie more and more as it became difficult to stand, her body weakening under the tickles. Luckily for the darked skinned elf, Cassie's tickles only traced above her waistline, exploring her midriff but not reaching down to her thighs below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, your skin is so smooth, I just can't help touching it!\" Cassie cooed, as she held Aphrah tighter in her grip, her other hand softly stroking the elf's firm rear. \"Is your skin just as soft all over your body? Now I just need to find out!\" Aphrah could only giggle in reply, her mind a haze of tickles and seductive teasing. Somewhere in the back of her mind she knew she had to do something, had to stop something\u2026 but what was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAphrah's efforts to focus were stopped short as Cassie twirled a fingertip around the dark elf's bellybutton, swirling closer and closer with each pass. Her belly sucked in instinctively, but Cassie's finger tauntingly followed, the touch always gentle enough to keep Aphrah from coming to her senses in a jolt, but ticklish enough to make Aphrah weaker and more ticklish by the second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Cassie's devious stroking finger finally teased around the rim of Aphrah's navel, the woman let out a ticklish squeal and laughed louder. Cassie's eyes opened wider as she worried that she had pushed her luck too far, too fast. But she was also happy to discover such a good tickle spot. Cassie paused for a few seconds, but Aphrah didn't come back to her senses, the same dreamy look still in her giddy face. \"Whew, almost overdid it, huh? Well, let's see what other soft spots you have on that delicious body of yours\u2026\" </span></div></div>",

Aphrah could feel herself losing her strength rapidly. Her legs buckled, and only by locking them did she prevent herself from becoming dead weight. Fire Ball knew this, and enjoyed slowly tickling the elf and holding her in her arms. Truth be told, Cassie was becoming more and more entranced herself in tickling the poor elf. She wanted to throw caution to the wind, and tickle Aphrah hard, but she knew to do that would destroy the trance she had on her captive. Fire Ball knew that the elf's nails could turn her into a ticklish mess, unable to move or even breath without giggling like a maniac. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was brought out of her musings as Aphrah started to move her lower body. She was shaking from side to side, maybe in a attempt to break free, or just from tickling. Cassie didn't know; she did, however, keep her right hand firmly on the elf's rear. As Aphrah's bottom moved, so did Cassie's hand. Her fingers kept squeezing the firm butt Aphrah had. Cassie would loved to slip her hand under the elf's silky pants, feel her bottom through her panties, then further still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>In good time Cassie, let's see how ticklish her chest is!</i> Fire Ball smiled as her right hand stopped squeezing and slowly started to spider-walk up Aphrah's side. The elf squirmed and giggled, but could do nothing. Cassie's hand stopped at the elf's chest, playing with the strands of crimson and gold that acted as the elf's top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So soft, so easy to pull away.\" Cassie teased as her hands slowly unraveled the bands until they were loose, then pulled them off easily. Aphrah made a weak attempt to grab the cloth, but missed, her sluggish hand falling limply at her side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to feel something?\" Cassie teased again by taking her left hand off Aphrah's waist for a moment to grab the hand, and place it on Cassie's left butt cheek. It was risky, but Fire Ball wanted to have some fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can feel if you like. It's really firm and my spandex is fun to feel.\" Fire Ball felt Aphrah softly caress her bottom. While she giggled, it wasn't enough to break the trance. Cassie let her right hand slowly travel over Aphrah's chest, fingers dangling over the warm mounds of flesh. \"It won't be long now.\" Cassie teased to her dark elf ticklee. </span></div></div>",

Her fingers curled, and began to softly scritch at Cassie's rear, right where her bottom met her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie yelped and began to giggle for real this time, the ticklish sensations making her wiggle her bum under Aphrah's touch and titter sweetly. She looked with concern into the dark elf's eyes, but they still had the vacant look of being in her trance. Cassie realized she hadn't lost it yet, but she had gotten too risky in letting Aphrah feel up her ass. Luckily, Cassie had already managed to take off Aphrah's top, and her hands were poised at the delicious bare mounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie decided to play along with the half-tranced Aphrah, hoping that if they were both in this game of light, teasing tickles, Cassie would still be able to win. \"Ooh-hohoho, someone's fee-heheheling playful, huh-ehehehehe?\" Cassie asked, still trying to be as flirtatious as possible as she giggled sweetly. Cassie reached out to both of the dark breasts in front of her, and began to caress the sides of them, where the soft skin merged with the firmness of her ribs and side. She tickled along that sensitive line, a couple inches below Aphrah's armpits, trying to give more tickles than she received, while still not pulling Aphrah fully out of the trance. It was a risky maneuver, but one that sent an electric thrill down Cassie's spine as she teased and tickled those seductive breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAphrah's mind was in a complete haze. She felt giddy and weak from the soft tickling being given to her sensitize breasts. At the same time, she was vaguely aware of the need to keep tickling that nice ass in her grip, and her instincts did the rest. Aphrah was leaning more and more against Cassie now as she laughed absentmindedly, getting more and more ticklish as her breasts continued to be played with. But Cassie was also starting to laugh harder now, and having a more difficult time not squirming around as Aphrah's nimble fingertips explored more and more ticklish spots along her rear.</span></div></div>",

On instinct, Aphrah slipped her fingers under the soft fabric of Cassie's shorts, and tickled her bare butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEEEeeek!\" Cassie squealed as the elf's long nails scratched and traced over her soft bottom. She squirmed to force those probing fingers, but Aphrah held firm. The elf was still giggling as her breasts were being fondled, but now the humans laughter was starting to overpower her own. Still lost in her trance, the elf could feel her senses slowly start to come back, as Cassie's fingers slowed down their assault on her chest. For the young college cheerleader, her bottom was on ticklish fire. She tried to keep up her tickling, but when Aphrah's nails raked across her skin, she lost it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHahahahahno!\" Her hands flew to her bottom to ward off the elf's tickling and to cover them. That left Aphrah with a window, and she weakly pushed herself off Fire Ball and staggered away. Both combatants were trying to recover from their ordeal. </span></div></div>",

I'm not done playing with that silky soft skin yet!\" Cassie called out lovingly, as she reached Aphrah, who was still facing away from her. Cassie wrapped Aphrah up in a hug from behind, reaching her hands around to cup both of Aphrah's now bare breasts. She fondled them tenderly, massaging the pleasantly soft orbs in a way that made Aphrah gasp. \"Mmm, these are so nice! They feel so good to touch, and I bet they like being touched too, don't they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAphrah stifled a moan, aware enough to recover her pride and not wanting to give Cassie the satisfaction of knowing what she was doing to her. \"W-what are doing?

Aphrah tried to wiggle free, but the hug was too tight, and Aphrah's strength still wasn't back entirely. It only left her open to be tickled more, something Cassie was eager to do, exploring the spots on Aphrah's breasts which got the best reactions\u2026 which turned out to be just about anywhere on that sensitive skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAphrah realized her only hope was to counterattack. Reaching behind her, her nails found Cassie's sides, and wriggled deviously against them. \"Tahahahake thahahaht! Let's see how you liihihihihihike it!\" Aphrah giggled, trying her best to act touch as she fought back, but the trance and earlier tickling had already sapped much of her willpower. Cassie burst into girlish laughter, giggling sweetly into Aphrah's long ears from behind. It was wonderfully pleasant to here, and made Aphrah grin not just from the tickles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now the two were locked in a ticklish battle, both women laughing and tickling as each struggled.

But for all her writhing, Aphrah couldn't manage to turn around to face her opponent, who kept moving with her ticklish prey. All she could do is squeal as Silva once again moved to Aphrah's sensitive underarms, scritching the soft skin with quick motions of her fingernails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, such ticklish underarms. My nails are barely touching them and I already have you laughing so much!\" Silva taunted, whispering the words into Aphrah's pointed ear from just behind her. \"I wonder how long you can take it before you're weak and helpless as a kitten? And then I'll really get to find out where else you're ticklish\u2026\" Aphrah could barely think from the soft teasing in her ear and the electrically ticklish feeling of Silva's nails under her arms. But she knew she had to act quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching behind her, Aphrah struck out with a tickle attack of her own. It was clumsy without being able to see, the position, and her own squirming. And it also momentarily opened her arms up even further, which Silva noticed with enthusiasm, taking advantage of the opportunity to tickle even more. But she failed to notice Aphrah grab Silva's hips, squeezing and kneading rapidly in a counterattack she hoped would dislodge to pesky woman. Caught off guard, Silva jumped, hopping back and giving Aphrah the space she needed to finally turn around. Still giggly, the dark elf decided not to play defensively. She wanted to get that woman back for the tickling, she wanted to feel her squirm for every tickle she gave her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAphrah jumped at Silva, knocking her to the ground as Aphrah tried to pin the woman underneath her. Without having taken the time to catch her breath, she couldn't quite manage it. Silva grabbed onto Aphrah's arms and rolled her, the two tumbling on the ground as they wrestled for the upper hand. Neither were relying purely on strength. Aphrah reached out to pinch and prod Silva's ribs, distracting the woman and making her constantly twitch and giggle, unable to fully use her body to throw Aphrah underneath her. But Silva tickled back, using her free hand to spider her fingers across Aphrah's exposed belly. The dark elf sucked in her belly, fighting the urge to burst out into laughter, but feeling the tickling slowly sap her of strength. The crowd watched eagerly as these two wrested, waiting to see who would finally end up on top.</span></div></div>",

I wonder if your hips are ticklish! Coochie Coo!\" Digging her fingers into her sides, she was rewarded with the person underneath her suddenly jerking, before loud feminine laughter was heard across the coliseum, coming from one of the two ticklish combatants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Silva continued to dig her digits into Aphrah's soft sides, so distracted by the melodious laughter of the Dark Elf that she didn't notice what was going on behind her until she felt the cold air of the arena across her bare feet. \"W-Wait, what are you-doineeehHEhehehhHAhahaa!\" Throwing her head back with laughter, Silva's hands quickly tried to reach behind her, a smirking Aphrah already taking opportunity of the momentary pause of the attack on her ticklish sides to pull of one of Silva's high heels right off her feet, throwing the foot wear as far as she could throw it, before scratching her nails all over the arches of the Huntress' foot, causing the panicking Silva to go crazy with giggles, her hands not finding their target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter? Did I manage to get a ticklish spot? I think you're a little ticklish for this tournament, wouldn't you say?\" Keeping one hand to continuously tickle Silva's wiggling foot, Aphrah used her other hand to push off the giggling Huntress, getting up and straddling Silva by sitting on her belly. \"My my, it seems the tables have turned. Let's see what <i>you're</i> hiding underneath your clothes.\" Unzipping Silva's jacket, Aphrah's fingers slowly wormed their way in, tracing across Silva's ticklish ribs, keeping the Huntress on the edge between giggling and laughing with amazing skill, sapping her strength and stamina with each passing second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh... So ticklish in here... I wonder if your <i>chest</i> is even more sensitive!\" Grinning with excitement and lust, Aphrah slowly directed her fingers towards Silva's back, teasingly trying to find the clasp of Silva's bra. Eyes widening at what her opponent was trying to do, Silva gritted her teeth, and dived her hands towards the Dark Elf's exposed belly, fingertips skittering across the smooth and silky flesh. Bursting out into laughter, Aphrah's mischievous hands retreated, trying to stop the fingers that were tickling her quivering belly. As her hands came back into the open, Silva tensed her abdominal muscles and sat up, much to the surprise of Aphrah, grabbing one of the Dark Elf's hands with one of her own, lifting both of their arms up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What are you doing, raising both of our hands won't do anything! U-Unless...!\" Smirking right back at Aphrah, Silva grinned as her opponent finally realized what the Huntress had in store. \"Tell me my dear Aphrah... Does someone have ticklish underarms?\" Fingers wiggling on her free hand, Silva lightly skittered her nails up and down Aphrah's silky exposed hollows, the Dark Elf in question already going ballistic with ticklish laughter, her whole body shaking as spasms of giggling wracked her entire frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haahahahahaa! You think you are so clever, but did you forget that you also left <b>ME</b> a tantalizing target as well? HeeehhHHEheehEHHee!\" Squinting through her mirth filled eyes, Aphrah slowly moved her free hand to Silva's exposed underarm as well, digits slowly stroking across her hollows before digging in hard. Even though Silva was able to suppress her giggles for a few seconds more than Aphrah, soon chuckles and snickers threatened to spill out of her mouth, before she finally couldn't hold it in, laughter erupting from the Huntress as well, her hair whipping from side to side as her head shook from laughter, her mind refusing to let go of Aphrah's hand, lest the Dark Elf escapes from her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't going to... HahahahaahaaHAaah, win this! Just give-HHEhehhehhhhahhaa! Just give it up!\" Her whole body shaking, Silva felt the clasp which was holding her bra underneath her now open jacket start to become undone, thanks to Aphrah's earlier fiddling. However, she also saw through the corner of her eye, the edge of the hysterical Dark Elf's satin top, temptingly close to where she was free hand was skittering about in Aphrah's underarm.</span></div></div>",

The two giggled melodiously, neither seeming to gain an upperhand on the other. Silva suspected that she might have a slight upperhand. Aphrah's laughter was a bit louder, her twitching movements more than hers. Silva suspected the dark elf was the more ticklish of the two. If she could just keep it up, she could wear the other woman down\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before that could happen, Silva's bra finally loosened enough that it fell, slipping loosely off her chest and exposing the full, round orbs of flesh. Aphrah looked down, noticing the change, and immediately her fingers slipped from under Silva's arm to caress the curve of the woman's breast. Silva tried not to react, but couldn't help arching her back and gasping at the new contact. Aphrah picked up on it, her nimble fingers tracing the perimiter of the sensitive breast, tickling and teasing. Silva did her best to keep tickling under Aphrah's arm, but it was becoming clear that this new tickle attack was having its effects on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe, such ticklish-sh-ehehehehe breasts!\" Aphrah teased through her laughter. \"Don't you like my fingers?\" Silva bucked and tried to resist, but she felt her stamina waning. Her own tickling was weakening, lightening its touch and only allowing Aphrah to focus more on tickling her. And the more her breasts were teased and tickled by the dark elf's fingers, the more giggly Silva felt. She also felt the urge to moan and writhe welling up inside her, the tickling having another effect on her as well. She had to do something before it got out of hand, or she wouldn't be able to stop Aphrah from doing even more to her!</span></div></div>",

Picking up on Silva's body language, Aphrah started to tease Silva, exploiting the fact that the Huntress was shy about showing her body to everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coochie coochie coo, huntress! I'm sure you wouldn't mind letting everyone see those... <i>exposed</i>... <i>full</i>... <i>ticklish.</i>.. breasts of yours, wouldn't you?\" Her whole face turning as red a tomato, Silva looked down, making sure that her arms covered as much of her breasts as possible from the eyes of the hollering audience. Realizing her mistake, Silva tore her eyes back to look at her opponent, only to see thin air where Aphrah was standing. Feeling soft fingers stroke the sides of her chest from behind, Silva gave a yelp, trying to jump away in shock, only for Aphrah to gracefully follow her every movement, dancing and teasing the undefended huntress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tickle tickle... I wonder how much I have to tickle to get you to lower those hands... How about here? Or here? Or maybe here?\" Dancing around the giggling and shrieking Silva, the Dark Elf grinned, tickling around Silva's neck, making her victim cringe and shake her head about in ticklish annoyance, before moving back to her upper body, using two fingers to poke into Silva's underarms. This made the huntress burst out into giggles of an even higher octave, quickly retreating her arms to her sides, attempting to clamp down on Aphrah's digits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the dancing elf quickly shied away just in time, moving to Silva's front, nails circling the fullness of Silva's chest, both quickly skittering on their undersides.

He will stop tickling a woman if it's gone too far, and cares for them after the match is won like a southern gentleman.

At 23, he stands at 5' 9'' and 160 pounds. He is in decent physical condition; not a powerhouse, but he can run and handle his own in a fight (Tickle or otherwise). He has a huge fascination with the American Civil War, having his family fight on the Confederate side, and his appearance shows. He wears a slapped together uniform of a Confederate soldier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike this:https://civilwar150pinholeproject.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/img494_4x5blo g1.jpg<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only difference is he's clean shaven, and only has a musket for when it's time for an item tournament. His musket is designed to fire cartridges that tickle his opponents rather than hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he enjoys tickling females, he can be a gentleman when the time comes. He will stop tickling a woman if it's gone too far, and cares for them after the match is won like a southern gentleman. He can also get flustered and bashful when the ladies tease or flirt with him.</span></div></div>",

Sighing at his imaginary sister remark realizing that is proboly what she would say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew the reason why his sister and his friend, who both kind of forcing him into the tournmant, was to help with his slight anxiety problem and to make more friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stepped into the ring he did a happy but also a nervous smiled and waved at the crowd who they all responded with a cheering, realizing they were about to see someone new fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe begins wondering who his opponent is.</span></div></div>",

He has gray eyes. Born to a human rogue and a mischievous halfling woman, Quint at least stands at taller than a halfling, but still noticeably shorter than your average prerson. He uses his stature to his advantage, as he is a master of sneaking through forests and fields alike unseen and is a capable gymnast despite his height. He wears a thin, foresty tunic as well as simple loose sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA newcomer to the Arena, Quint bets that his experience as a ranger as well as his passion for tickling will serve him well here. He is used to assessing a situation before diving in, which could present a problem or be a boon to him. Because he is very ticklish, he cannot take being held down and tickled in the same spot for a very long amount of time. However, he can jump, dodge, and run for a long time without tiring. Quint is not accustomed to using tickle tools, but he is a fast learner.</span></div></div>",

There were long, stiff feathers that might as well have been daggers or even swords depending on their length. An array of feather dusters of all shapes, sizes, and feather types; some with a strange powder clinging to those feather tips. Akari could easily guess what that powder could do if it stuck to someone's bare skin, making it a tempting choice. But she moved on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were other items that weren't strictly for tickling, as well. Bolos that could be thrown to wrap up an opponent, tying their limbs. A pair of handcuffs that appeared magnetic, sticking powerfully to the metal surface they were on. Near these items was also a vial of some kind of gel or goo\u2026 Akari had no idea what it would even do. But she moved past these items, deciding that she didn't need to restrain her enemy in order to grab an easy victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the oni laid eyes on the item she wanted. It was a pair of fuzzy gloves, coated with a very fine, yet somewhat stiffened fur. A note next to the gloves said that they were also magically enchanted somehow, but Akari couldn't figure out how. She put them on, noting how they fit her large hands perfectly. Was shaping to the wearer the magic trick?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkari casually put her gloved hands on her bare hips as she thought. As she did so, the fingertips of the gloves seemed to spring to life, vibrating against her skin with a buzzing motion. Akari yelped in surprise, giggling in an embarrassingly girlish manner for the proud oni before pulling her hands away from herself, marveling at them. So that was the trick! As the fingertips made contact with skin, they would wriggle with a life of their own, magnifying the tickling significantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkari grinned, happy with her choice. The gloves were a powerful item, one that would enhance her offensive capabilities. Even if it didn't improve areas of weakness: speed, dexterity, or patience, Akari felt quite confident. The only downside was that the item made her able to tickle herself! She'd have to be careful where she put her hands when in the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smug grin, the oni sauntered out into the arena, wearing the gloves. She looked around, but her opponent hadn't yet appeared. She leaned against a pillar, lazily waiting for whoever it was with lidded eyes, her hands safely resting against the marble.</span></div></div>",

He eyed several interesting felt-tip  mechanized crossbows, before trying one out and realizing how heavy the tickling tool was. He doubted he would be very accurate with one; his training had been focused on the longbow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext he eyed a dozen or so short, silver feathers tucked into a belt. He could tell what they were with a glance, so the halfling grabbed one and flicked it at the wooden wall. It stuck magically, its tip swishing back and forth. Of course, throwing feathers. Quint liked the idea, but they just seemed so...light. He had no clue who his enemy was, and wanted a steady weapon in case they were some kind of tickle-resistant tank. So he moved on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing silken nets, heavy-bristled brushes, and feathery spears, Quint settled on a table of feather dusters. Two caught his eye: one sparkling with green dust, another with purple. The tags by each said the green powder was enchanted with \"Lingering tickles\" while the purple one had an effect named \"Upgraded Tickle\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Tickles a hell of a lot more</i>\" was written gruffly on the note. The halfling picked up the intriguing duster and hefted it. It was fairly light, and it's thick feathers had a decent reach. Of course, he'd still need to get in close to his opponent to touch them, but he was confident his agility would be all he needed to do so. As he picked it up, a single feather from its tip flittered across his neck. Quint jumped two feet in the air as a sudden burst of maddening tickling hit him, like several hands scratching at his neck with long fingernails, then subsided as quickly as it had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta be careful\", he told himself, grinning at his own foolishness. Then he grabbed the feather duster and walked out into the arena to face his unknown opponent.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A halfling? A gnome? The tall oni had always gotten the little peoples mixed up, they were just about the same to her. He had an adult face, but was either an extremely short man or a particularly tall little person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Akari noticed the item the little man had chosen: a feather duster. <i>Ha!</i> Akari thought to herself, <i>does he think a tuft of feathers like that will be enough to do anything to me? </i> While it was true that Akari had been tickled quite effectively with feathers in the past, they had a delicate and rather pleasant touch to them. In a fight between unrestrained opponents, she decided her fuzzy gloves had the upper hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there, little one!\" Akari called out to the man, now standing at attention opposite her across the arena. \"Did they really send you to be my opponent? Don't expect me to go easy on you!\" She called out boastfully, a smug grin on her face. The small figure smiled simply and bowed with a tilt of his head, not bothering to reply to the boasting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nonchalant attitude annoyed the red woman, not one to be cool-headed about anything. <i>Just who does he think he is? Does he honestly expect to stand up to me? I can hold him down with one hand easily and tickle him to exhaustion with the other!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkari left her pillar and moved closer, eyeing him. The man continued to look back at her silently, returning her gaze with an analytic intensity. He watched the way she walked, her way Akari held up her hands, where her clothing protected her. Which was to say, almost nowhere. It was the one thing that put her at a disadvantage, the man having a full tunic. But that could be fixed easily enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, let's see if you can stay so coolheaded!\" Akari said as she leaned forward and charged, bull-rushing her opponent, closing the distance with bounds of her long legs. She picked up speed slowly, but soon her momentum was a force to be reckoned with as she closed in on the half-halfing.</span></div></div>",

Right as she was almost upon him, he vaulted off her crimson knee high into the air. Having done so many times, he executed a masterful flip and landed on her shoulders behind her head. The oni snarled vehemently when she realized she had been tricked, and reached back with one massive hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he barely dodged her grab, Quint saw that her hand was covered in some kind of glove, which was covered in tiny brush bristles. Unwilling to let her make a second attempt, he grabbed his feathery implement and brushed it down her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeeeee!\" the oni laughed, her squeal still sounding rather terrifying to a man of Quint's stature. He eagerly continued tickling her neck and shoulders, rapidly swishing the duster over the width of her body while still somehow holding tight as she bucked around. The purple dust seemed to be working its magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Quint saw a golden opportunity: right next to him, the skimpy strip of cloth that covered her breasts was fastened here, right under where he was hanging on. To distract her more, he swirled the feather duster in her left ear, causing the infuriated female to double over in laughter and allow him to reach down for the particular cloth strap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet as soon as he grabbed the knot, she realized what exactly he was up to and bucked him forward. Quint finally was forced to relinquish his grip on her back as she threw him forward, where he landed in a heap in front of her. Seven feet of angry ogre woman  lividly looked down at him as he sat up, dazed. Then, with a sinking feeling in his stomach, he realized that his weapon of choice was lying several yards away from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would dare to try to take off my clothing?\" Akari boomed, wiggling her gloved hands. Quint gulped: had she really recovered from the tickling already?</span></div></div>",

He had gotten the first tickle in, with the interesting tactic of going after her neck and ears. Those simple feathers had tickled incredibly, more than any feathers she'd ever encountered before. They must be magicked like her gloves were somehow, enhancing their natural ticklishness. Akari could just imagine what that duster could do if it brushed down the length of her back or across her bare stomach, and realized she'd have to use at least a little caution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Quint wasn't going to give her a moment to stop and think. He dove at his weapon, lying past the oni. With a growl, Akari leaned in and swiped at him, just a hair too slow. She missed grabbing the man, but the hairy glove raked along his side, moving across his ribs and down to his hip and to leapt past. Even through the tunic, the vibrating fingertips tickled immensely, and he let out a surprised yelp of laughter which caused him to roll into a somersault as he moved past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet it was this defensive maneuver that saved him, passing clear underneath a swipe from Akari's other arm, as he untucked and grabbed his duster in a smooth elegant motion, before turning and facing the oni. Her impotent swipes were only frustrating her more, and she glared at the little man as she plotted her next move. But then she felt something loosen: while Quint hadn't been able to tear off Akari's top, he had undone the fastener in the back. Their movements just now had been enough to wriggle it open, and her top fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkari was tempted to pick it back up and try to put it back on, or at least cover herself with one hand. But then she remembered the gloves and thought better of it. There was no way she could do either of those things without tickling herself disastrously, ending the fight on her own. Instead she turned to Quint, deciding to press the attack. \"Hmph, like what you see, little man? Go ahead and look, but I'll be the winner here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkari charged again, almost leaping at Quint as he readied himself. He had to admit, topless like this she was a distracting sight. Her large, firm breasts were exposed in full view. The tempting orbs were not only distracting, but undoubtedly an excellent tickle target as well, just above head height for the man. But these thoughts slowed his movements just enough, and he saw his dodge wouldn't make it in time! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead of grabbing Quint, Akari grabbed his tunic, gripping the front of it tightly and pulling, ripping it open in front with her massive strength. The tunic ripped down the middle, exposing Quint's chest and belly, the force of it sending Quint tumbling to the ground. Akari chased after him as he rolled on his back, duster at the ready.

The half man felt a twitch in his loins as the female flesh touched his bare body. Despite being a rampaging ogre taller than most men, Akari evidently cared for her red skin. He grinned and kept tickling, both with the duster as well as jabs to her stomach with his fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, getting her to double over proved a challenge as she reached down to the annoying imp, and clamped her hands on his ribs. Quint shrieked as he felt her large hands secure themselves. They tickled like a score of fine boat-hair scrub brushes, and she hadn't even started wiggling her fingers. Akari lifted him right off the ground,  though he managed to keep a hold on his weapon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought him up to chest level and then smiled, digging her fingers into his torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has the little man got ticklish ribbies? Cute!\" she laughed, her voice booming. Quint gasped at the influx of rubbing, poking  rough tickling. Each hand that was clamped onto his waist dug into his upper ribs right under his pits. Her thumbs brushed all over his nipples, causing further unsuccessful twists and turns as he tried to wriggle free. Though he struggled to take in breaths between heavy laughs, Quint sensed an opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enterprising little man leaned forward in her formidable grip, just enough to reach out and brush her big areolas with his duster. She shrieked and seated forward , so he leaned in to swipe his feathers all over her massive globes. It seemed that as he did so, while her grip was loosening, she was becoming more aroused. Quint decided that he would need to get to stable ground to continue his assault, before the now lecherous oni did anything rash.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And in their tussling it was becoming increasingly hard to ignore. Her kind had never been good about self-control or patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giggly growl rumbled in her throat, as if coming out of a tigress, and she leaned in farther as she picked up the smaller man. A look of surprise was on Quint's face as she brought him closer, and closer still\u2026 until her lips enveloped his, locking in a passionate kiss. Akari did nothing half-heartedly, and the kiss was lustful and aggressive as she responded animalistically to the feelings aroused in her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuint tried to resist and pull back, but he didn't have the strength. He tried to run the feather duster over her breasts, brushing the undersides in a slow and increasingly distracted motion. But this only encouraged the woman, who let out a few husky giggles, but still persisted in the lusty kiss. It was beginning to effect Quint as well, his manhood stiffening under the passionate embrace. If you didn't mind the oni's massive height, or bright red skin, she was actually a beautiful woman. Her skin was smooth and pleasing to the touch, and he could feel the firm muscle lurking just behind it. And her lips were soft yet irresistibly aggressive, it was getting harder and harder not to kiss back, returning the amorous advances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuint realized that if he didn't pull away, this battle would go in a very different direction indeed. But with each new movement of Akari's lips against his own, each additional pressing of her sizable, alluringly soft breasts against his chest, Quint felt himself getting more and more lightheaded. It was sapping his will to resist, to tickle back\u2026 and each lazy swirl of his feather duster under her breasts was only encouraging the woman.  And his manhood was now at full attention, begging to be unsheathed from its cage. Quint had to fight to keep his focus lest he lose himself to an oni's powerful lust.</span></div></div>",

Quint felt his face burn as the audience cheered for his opponent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another cute giggle that defied her size, the Ono shifted back to sit on his legs. Quint was tired out by the sudden burst of glove-enchanted tickling he had just received, so he could only shift a little and pant as the oni rubbed her covered hands together in anticipation, throwing back her golden locks and licking her lips. Though no doubt soon his metabolism would see to it that he recovered his energy, for now he was her plaything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed his short green pants and pulled not down but sideways, ripping them apart easily.

Akari leaned back for a second, a smirk on her lips when she recognized his submissive pose. \"Already? But baby, I was looking forward to slowly driving you out of your mind..\" she mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the halfling sprang forward, eliciting a shriek from Akari as he sat up and wiggled his fingers around her belly. She leapt back away from his touch, incidentally freeing him from the prison of flesh sitting on top of him. Before she could hold him down again, Quint did a back-roll and sprung to his feet. Though he was a ridiculous sight, getting into a defensive stance with his swollen cock sticking out from his body, at least he was free. The oni quickly rose to her feet too, but she had given him the breather he needed to recollect himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time when Akari charged him he was ready to absorb the impact. Angry that her toy had escaped again, she rushed headlong into him with her gloves outstretched. She was no doubt strong, he noticed as the two of them rolled around yet again on the surprisingly soft ground of the Arena, but her movements were not fine-tuned at all compared to a trained ranger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were interrupted by two hefty red breasts being shoved in his face. For a sweaty she-ogre, her body actually smelled pretty good, in a raw sort of way. As the two wrestled, his dick was rubbed against her belly and he stifled a moan. She was trying to distract him again! Quint pushed his face out of her pillowy boobs and reached out his lithe hands to her midsection area right under her cleavage. He poked lightly there, making the ticklish Akari squirm and try to push his agile hands away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuint pressed the advantage, continuing to tweak each of her ribs and then moving down to swipe at her belly as he gained the upper hand. If it could have, Akari's face would have been turning redder when she realized that a puny little half-breed man was tickling her senseless. Though she was laughing hard, Quint remembered his even more effective feather duster, which was lying only a couple of feet away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he tried to unentangle himself from her, Akari once more lustily grabbed his penis and began rubbing up and down it. She had certainly figured out this weakness by now! He felt a warming sensation from inside as the magic gloves softly stimulated him, and reached down in a panic to try to dislodge her firm grip.<br>\r\nWhile he jabbed at her armpits to coerce her into letting go, her other hand reached around his curled up form to grab the place where Quint's thigh met his butt, and started squeezing the tender flesh there. Quint and Akari both howled in tickle induced mirth as they tickled each other senseless.</span></div></div>",

In the position they were in, the oni couldn't bring her arms in to defend herself without letting go of the man, her armpits fully exposed to his desperate counterattack. His fingers scratched nimbly in the very center of each hollow, stroking and teasing in quick frantic motions. Akari was howling with laughter, each new tickle distracting her and interfering with her attempts to overwhelm her opponent. Finally it was too much, and instinct took over. Akari released her grip on Quint, and pulled her arms back protectively to her sides, clamping them tightly to her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuint took the opportunity instantly, diving away from the oni before she had a chance to grab him again. It was the break Quint needed. His cock ached from the pleasing yet ticklish touch of Akari's soft gloves. He was slowly but surely losing control, and if he had been stuck under her grip a few moments longer he knew he would've passed the point of no return. Even now his body ached with need, and a voice in the back of his mind was screaming at him to give in, to accept the pleasure at any cost. He shook his head, trying to clear the lust-driven haze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed his feather duster off the ground, finally reuniting with the needed weapon. Meanwhile, Akari had gotten over her laughing fit and was coming back to her own senses, getting up to renew her attack. But Quint also noticed signs of fatigue on the beautiful giant as well. She was panting heavily, and her cheeks were an even darker shade of crimson. Quint could also see signs of arousal on the oni's nipples, the way her chest heaved as she breathed. Just the sight of it made his cock twitch in longing, with an urge bury it between those massive mounds of soft flesh, or even inside her while he tickled her into submissive bliss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuint realized it wouldn't take much to push him over the brink now, and he needed to act carefully, before instinct took over him. Yet he had no time to plan, as the oni came at him to finish what she started. Quint readied his feather duster in one hand, his fingers wiggling in anticipation at the other as she charged.</span></div></div>",

He was only able to get in a few brushes or touches here and there, as Akari had tightened her defenses around her upper body, but it was enough to send buzzes of arousal through her body. Both opponents were panting hard, Quint slightly more with exhaustion while Akari more so with arousal. Her nipples were rock hard with excitement, a fact which was clearly visible as her massive orbs jiggled forward with each grab she made at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last lucky dodge, the halfling managed to slide under her, keeping her hands away by frantically dusting her flat, slightly soft belly, and reach up for the strip of cloth that covered the oni's lower nether regions. With one jerk, Quint pulled off the brown strip of cloth, and Akari was suddenly just as nude as he was. He saw a flash of shaved, wet pussy before darting back away from her groping reach. He couldn't resist one last swipe at her nether regions with the feather duster before he somersaulted away, which stopped the oni dead in her tracks as a soft moan escaped from her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...\" she said, facing Quint yet again and looking only sexier. \"You're <i>veeeery</i> good at teasing me. Let's see if you can go a bit harder...\" With that she shot forward, faster than Quint could have believed was possible for a being of her size, and grabbed him, not even bothering to take his feather duster. They both tumbled to the soft arena floor. The way Akari had grabbed him, her boobs were positioned right over his rock-hard penis, warmly rubbing against it. The two of them tussled, half-crazed with tickle-lust, on the ground, each sneaking in the odd tickle.</span></div></div>",

Her breasts pressed down against Quint's hard cock, enveloping it between her warm mounds. As they moved against each other, her tit-flesh rubbed up and down Quint's length, making him moan and twitch. Her breasts were now slick with sweat, further lubricating and enhancing the seductively soft feeling, and Quint knew it would be only a matter of time before he was pushed over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet Akari's wet pussy was hanging just above Quint's head, and his arms were free. He decided not to withdraw, but to press the offensive. He reached up and swirled the feather duster aggressively over Akari's womanhood, bringing an instant belt of laughter followed by an incredibly lustful moan from the oni. The sound as the oni losing control to her arousal had an equally erotic effect on the short man, his dick twitching eagerly in response to the sound. Locked like this, one had to be overwhelmed with the ticklish pleasure before long. And once that happened, they'd be helpless as a kitten before the ticklish attack, sensitized and irresistibly distracted by a powerful orgasm welling in each of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkari had to use one hand to steady herself on top of the man, and no longer had the ability to speak. She was laughing too much, moaning too much\u2026 and so lost in the sensations that she couldn't say anything coherent if she tried. She gave an errant poke and prod to the man's thighs and waist, but now her primary attention was on the tit job, feeling the warm cock twitch in her grasp and hoping to use it as her key to victory. But the feeling of it against her breast was also stimulating, to say nothing of the feather duster against her womanhood, the feathers tickling more than she thought possible\u2026 but as they stroked, they were also stoking a fire that was burning hotter and closer to the surface with each flick. Akari's hips undulated needily as she was steadily succumbing. But who would give into the pleasure first?</span></div></div>",

He had to end this, before she brought him to an exhausting orgasm. Thinking quickly, he wiggled the feather duster faster, rubbing the purple dust into her vagina lips, but Akari just wouldn't give. Her errant squeezes were starting to affect him, too, as the heightened sensitivity brought by his teased cock spread through his own body. Out of desperation, he pushed the feather tips past her womanhood's lips and swished the duster right over he sensitive clitoris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeehaaaaahahahaa! Huhuhhuhhahaaha!\" Akari finally screeched in laughter, collapsing on top of him as she was brought to ticklish orgasm. Her pussy heaved, dripping and soaking the feather duster and getting some fluid on his legs. Now awkwardly pinned underneath the shivering, grinning oni, there was nothing Quint could do but tickle her belly and sides which had been brought within his reach. His hands swirled over her smooth and slightly soft belly, then reaching out to tweak her taut sides., a bit disappointed that he wasn't to be brought over the edge by her tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... No more...\" begged the massive oni, too weak to stop his advances. \"I-I... I can't take anymore! Stop tickling meheheee!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit difficult for Quint to reply with her on top of him, but he made sure to silently keep tickling just to make sure she didn't try anything. Finally after another 20 seconds he ceased. \"Maybe you should just give up, Akari. You know that you've been beaten, now. And by a man half your size at that.\" he told her, his sense of bravado surging once he detected the notes of desperation in Akari's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...yes!

He could feel the physical effects of her orgasm, noting the fluid that had dripped onto his legs, the heavy breathing, the way her body shuddered as the lingering waves of pleasure surged through her, sensitizing her even more. Quint's hands were pressed against Akari's taut tummy, still tickling at that soft skin that concealed quivering muscle underneath, not willing to let her get away until he heard the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Akari, she was completely overwhelmed. The laughing orgasm had coursed so strongly through her body she still wasn't able to think straight, her nerve endings on fire with the twin feelings. Part of her wanted more\u2026 to give in to the man, let him tickle her as much as he wanted, if he would only give her that kind of pleasure again!

A bell sounded in the arena as it acknowledged her defeat, and Quint dropped his tickling hands to his sides. Akari rolled off the man, her chest heaving as she slowly panted and giggled breathily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The winner: Quint Silverhands! He has defeated Akari, the mighty oni!\" The crowd cheered, and Quint stood shakily to take a bow, trying not to bring any attention from his fully erect manhood, achingly close to coming yet now so far. After a long moment, Akari too stood and bowed to the arena, acknowledging her defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, little man\u2026\" Akari whispered at Quint over the din of the crowd. \"If you need some help with that thing of yours, come by my chambers later.

She had no idea who her opponent would be, and so couldn't tailor her choice. Perhaps if she had been more cunning, asking around beforehand, she might have learned some clues. Instead the oni had to play it by ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first item, or items, that she laid eyes on were a pile of little feathers. Curious, she picked one of the small, fluffy things up. What was she supposed to do with this? As she threw it, she watched in amazement as it zipped through the air like a bee or hummingbird, coming alive. It hovered in mid-air, as if searching for a target, before it turned around again towards Akari. The little feather darted toward her and started wriggling itself against her bare stomach just below her navel. Akari burst into surprised laughter and grabbed at the small feather, shocked at how effective the small thing was. \"Magical feather darts, hmm\u2026.\" she mused, \"Little too small for my taste. And it looks like they might come back at me.\" She put the offending feather down, and thankfully it obeyed, resting peacefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next item she looked at was what looked like a long spear. Only instead of a pointed metal tip at the end, it was a soft brush, as if one were to paint a gigantic picture. Next to the brush-spear were a number of jars to dip the brush in, each coated with a different colored powder. Akari looked down to read the descriptions of each: \"Sensitizing powder, make them so ticklish they can't resist!\"; \"Lingering powder, the ticklish feeling never goes away, wear down your opponent with repeated strokes!\", \"Super tickle powder, amplifies the effect of each little stroke!\"; and \"Lust powder, pleases as much as it teases, arouses the ticklee no matter where you touch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkari looked at all of these powders dubiously, also wary of any of them coming back to bite her very exposed skin. She decided to keep looking, turning away from the lust powder with a shiver down her spine. Finally, Akari found an item that suited her: a tickle cannon. It was small by cannon standards, but large enough that anyone normal sized couldn't possibly use it. But Akari could lift the weapon onto her shoulder, slowly but powerfully aiming it at her target. The tickle cannon fired a magical burst of ticklish energy at the victim, making it feel as though invisible hands were ticklishly roaming all over their skin. If Akari could aim it in time, she could win the fight in one shot. The only downside was that the weapon already slowed down the oni, making her into even more of a tank. But as long as her opponent wasn't too nimble, she was confident in her victory.</span></div></div>",

Knowing that she wasn't very athletic, unlike her feline siblings, she opted to choose a weapon to make up for that fact, scanning the walls for anything of interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScanning the walls, her eyes caught on something interesting. Reaching out for the object, she found herself holding a bow, along with a quiver of arrows which interestingly, had a stiff feather on each of their tips. Putting a finger underneath her chin, she looked over the arrows, unimpressed. \"What good are these arrows? All they have are feathers on their tips... If my opponent is wearing armor, I don't think this will be of much use. I don't think I can pull a bow quickly either in the heat of battle, so nope. Pass.\" As she was about to put the arrows back down, the tip of the feather grazed the palm of her hand, sending ticklish shocks throughout her body. \"I have to admit though, I definitely <i>wouldn't</i> want to get hit by one of those tickle projectiles...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving on, her hands wandered over to where a plain feather duster was lying on the table, not standing out from the other tickle tools in any way. \"What good can this one do... It's just a feather duster. Maybe I can dust my opponent, and whoever I'm facing will start laughing at my weapon.\" Pouting, she opened a slight gap in her kimono, curiously testing her new found weapon. Gasping out loud before bursting into a small bout of giggles, she felt as if a dozen fingers were squirming across her belly, accompanied with the feelings of arousal, judging from her own perk nipples underneath her bra. \"On second thought, this seems like it'll be quite good. Anyone I swipe this over will be left a ticklish, aroused mess for me to play with. I think I have made my selection!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grin on her face, she started to make for the door leading to the arena. As she was about to step through, a sign of an item near the doorway caught her attention. Moving to read the sign, she saw that a pair of jet-black translucent stockings were below it, along with a pair of gloves. 'Whoever dons these pairs of gloves will have their tickling skills vastly increased. However, whatever is covered by the stockings will also be twice as ticklish.' Reading the sign aloud, Hagoromo thought to herself. \"I'm already quite ticklish on my legs, so it shouldn't make that big of a difference. And no one's going to miss these pair of stockings and gloves anyway.\" With a smirk, she slipped on the stockings and gloves, admiring their smooth texture. \"Let's see who I get to have fun with today!\"</span></div></div>",

Akari decided to be on her guard, not wanting to be outwitted. But she preferred the direct approach to any kind of intrigue. \"Hah!\" The oni bellowed. \"Is this little thing supposed to beat me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes\u2026\" Hagoromo said softly, almost too low for Akari to hear. \"I was just imagining what it'll be like to tickle such a giant. You look like so much fun\u2026 I can't wait to see what you look like begging me to stop and for more at the same time\u2026\" The fox woman twirled her feather duster ominously, as if it were a mighty weapon. Her confidence made Akari pause, not used to being stood up to by someone so much weaker looking than she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rrrr, then let's get this over with!\" Akari called out impatiently, lowering to one knee as she took aim with her tickle cannon. Hagoromo's eyes widened at the sizeable weapon, taking a defensive stance as she figured out how to deal with it. Akari decided to waste no time, aiming the cannon and pulling the trigger, causing a mighty blast and a bolt of blue-white energy to emit from it and charge toward Hagoromo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Akari, she had made no effort to close the distance, and the fox woman had plenty of time to dodge. Still, the blast was sizeable, and she only just managed to get out of the way, feeling a ticklish tingling at the tips of her tails from just grazing the blast as it whizzed by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn!\" Akari cursed, and aimed again. She grinned triumphantly Hagoromo definitely didn't have time to dodge out of the way this time, having dodged closer toward Akari now. Yet Hagoromo moved even closer, wielding her feather duster at she closed the distance...</span></div></div>",

However, she miscalculated by just a few centimeters, the edge of the projectile managing to catch her sides, causing her to have to feeling of multiple fingers squeezing and prodding where the projectile had hit, making Hagoromo burst out into feline laughter, clutching her sides, just barely managing not to drop her feather duster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mustn't get hit by that thing at any costs. One more shot at me, and I'm finished. I have to somehow get closer to her to use this tickly duster of mine.\" With a sly grin on her face, Hagoromo feigned even more laughter than the tickling was causing her, dropping to one knee as she hugged her sides with both hands. Out of the corner of her eye, she could see the large Oni grin to herself, believing that her cannon had hit her dead on, enough to cause her to become immobile, and an easy target for her hands to finish the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right you ticklish Oni... Just come a little bit closer... And you'll be in range of my tails. Once I got you all wrapped and and trapped, I can't wait to hear what kind of laughter will you give me.

Akari knew she made a good choice in picking the heavy weapon. She looked at it resting on her shoulder, and it was tempting to take aim and shoot the woman again. Then she'd really be laughing! But Akari noticed the cannon was hot to the touch, and a bit of smoke emitted from the barrel. It looked like the weapon was overheating, and she didn't want to break it. Besides, it wouldn't be good to reveal the fact that her weapon was momentarily un-useable if it didn't fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, the oni set the heavy cannon on the ground, and slowly walked toward Hagoromo. The woman's laughter showed no signs of slowing down, which made Akari take her time. The oni thought that it must really be a powerful tickling to keep her like that this long! \"How does it feel to be taken down so quickly? Feeling clever now, fox?\" Akari taunted as she got closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shuhuhuhut uhuhuhup, you dumb oni-ehehehehe!\" Hagoromo pleaded, giggling hysterically as she acted her part, writhing on the ground as if she were being tickled all over. But internally, her mind was clear. \"Just a couple more steps, then I have you. You really are a dumb oni, you have no idea I'm faking!\" Hagoromo thought to herself, readying her tails and her feather duster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkari now stood over Hagoromo, leaning down over her triumphantly. \"Give up now, and I won't tickle you myself. Otherwise you'll be laughing even harder th\u2026!\" The oni trailed off as the mask was dropped. Hagoromo instantly stopped laughing and jumped up to the surprised oni. Two tails wrapped onto each wrist and pulled them away from Akari's body, stretching her out. In this pose her firm belly was stretched taut, and her smooth hairless underarms were similarly exposed. Hagoromo eyed both targets as she readied her remaining tails as well as the arousing feather duster, deciding how to begin.</span></div></div>",

Slowly but surely, the tip of her tails slowly started to stroke the Oni's underarms in slow ticklish strokes, edging closer and closer to her hollows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkari for her part did her best not to laugh, although it was getting increasingly harder to do so, her mind constantly getting distracted by the soft tickly feelings on her arms, as well as the teasingly ticklish words of the Kitsune. \"Are you ticklish on your underarms, Oni? When I first saw you, I had guessed that might be your ticklish most spot. And such a wide grin, even though I haven't started to even touch that area. Are you really that ticklish, you sensitive wittle Oni?\" With every second passing, Akari's smile only grew wider and wider, cracks starting to appear in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what was only a few seconds, but in reality was an eternity for Akari, Hagoromo's tails finally made their way into the former's hollows, tracing light circles with the tips of her fluffy tools of ticklishness. \"Is that a girlish snicker I heard? Did a chuckle just slipped out? I think I did indeed hear you giggle! Don't worry, just let it all out! I promise I'll start gently... Just kidding! Now laugh Oni! Laugh for me!\" Laughing haughtily, the nine-tailed fox clicked her fingers, and another two tails dived right into Akari's underarms, making the Oni's eyes almost pop out of their sockets in surprise, before collapsing into a stream of loud giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn you, you treacherous fox! You lying slut! When I get my hands on you, I'll make sure you'll be on the ground laughing and giggling helplessly! Ehehhhahhhaa!\" Mouth now wide in raucous laughter, Akari tried to bring her arms down in order to protect her sensitive underarms, but still finding it unable to do so, the Kitsune's tails proving to be surprisingly strong, coupled with the fact that the underarm tickling was also significantly sapping at her stamina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, you strong Oni?

Akari's underarms were stretched out taut from the tails pulling up her wrists. Despite her oni strength, the tails were surprisingly resilient, able to keep her arms up even through her tugging. And each tickle kept sapping Akari's strength, making it even easier for Hagoromo to hold her in place and tickle her at leisure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a ticklish oni\u2026\" Hagoromo cooed in a teasing voice that seemed to make the tickling even worse for Akari. \"Did I find such a good weak spot so quickly? Or are there places that are even better to tickle?\" Hagoromo mused, all the while letting her tails flutter in each armpit, sometimes tracing circles around the edges, other times zigzagging, other times diving right for the center. They were fast then slow, gentle then ruthless, and the chaotic changes were keeping Akari completely off guard, unable to steel herself to the sensations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHagoromo's eyes drifted down to Akari's top, the relatively small band of leopard skin wrapped around her full breasts that were shaking as the oni's chest heaved in laughter. With a curious, playful gaze, Hagoromo reached up and casually took off the top, grinning fiendishly all the while. \"Stahahahahap thahahat!\" Akari tried to growl through her laughter. \"Puhuhuhut thahaht bahahahack!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, is someone afraid of showing some skin?\" Hagoromo asked with a fake innocence. \"Is it possible you're covering these beautiful breasts up because you're worried I might\u2026 <i>tickle?</i>\" Hagoromo brought up her seventh and eighth tails to caress the undersides of Akari's breasts as her hands played with the top before throwing it as far away as she could. Akari gasped as the fluffy tailed brushed against the undersides of her breasts, the touch quite ticklish. And while Akari tried to deny it to herself, there was also something distinctly pleasant about the soft touch against her breasts, and a little moan escaped her lips in between her giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, is someone having fun? Do you like my tails that much?\" Hagoromo continued to tease, as her tails kept up their assault on Akari's underarms, and their playful teasing of her now exposed breasts. <i>Those tits seem <b>quite</b> sensitive.</i> Hagoromo mused to herself. <i>If my tails can already turn her on, just imagine what the feather duster would do!</i></span></div></div>",

Coochie Coo!\" Her remaining tails started to flutter down Akari's body, stroking along her belly, one tail swishing in her belly-button, as the other tails explored her quivering thighs, stroking with a delicacy that the laughing Oni had never felt feathers do to her before, a mischievous tail even stroking across her butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it you stupid fox! When I get out of here, you're going to be laughing on the floor for me-heehheeehee! Get out of my lehehhehehegs!

If your breasts were that ticklish... I wonder if you're also ticklish <b>down there</b>. How about we find out hmm? Tell me, how does...

No worries, I'm going to make you enjoy this tickling I'm about to give you before making you surrender in a ticklish mess of ecstasy.\" Retracting her hand, she reached for the string attaching the loose cloth to Akari's waist, as her tails primed, getting closer and closer to Akari's thighs and navel, ready to start the moment the cloth came off. Akari knew that she had to do something now, otherwise she might be moaning and laughing too much to do anything later on!</span></div></div>",

Still giggling, but recovering her breath as Hagoromo focused on removing clothing, Akari broke free of the grip of the tails with a roar. The oni stumbled backwards from the fox woman, who looked up in surprise at her broken grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter? You looked like you were enjoying my touch.\" Hagoromo teased with a grin. \"Hmm, it looks like my tickles didn't weaken you enough yet after all.\" Hagoromo mused, readying herself for another attack. \"I'll have to be much more thorough next time.\" Akari only growled, angry at herself at falling for the woman's tricks, as well as getting tickled so early. She had already lost her top! Akari eyed the garment behind Hagoromo, realizing it would be difficult to grab back, let alone put back on. Meanwhile, both combatants had discarded their weapons. Akari's tickle cannon lay on the ground behind her, and Hagoromo's feather duster sat next to the woman's feet. Akari debated her options: she could run back to her cannon, but it would take a moment to lift and aim, a crucial moment of vulnerability, her whole body stretched taut and available for tickling. Or she could charge in and attack with her bare fingers. It was a satisfying tickle method, but she'd have to watch out for all those tails, making close quarters tickle fighting extremely difficult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get you yet, you lying fox!\" Akari snarled, catching her breath. The insult only made Hagoromo laugh, a pleasant giggle Akari wanted to hear more of, this time from her tickling rather than the fox woman's smugness. The red oni decided the best strategy was to get back her weapon. Turning back, she charged towards the tickle cannon, moving with surprising speed. Hagoromo's eyes widened as she saw what Akari was doing, and decided she had better stop the big woman before she had a chance to use the dangerous tickle tool. Hagoromo picked up her feather duster and chased after her, coming close just as Akari was lifting the weapon up to her shoulder\u2026</span></div></div>",

Bursting into girlish giggles already, what Akari felt was not just a feather duster, but a magically <i>enchanted</i> feather duster, powered with supreme tickle sorcery from that gloves that Hagoromo was wearing. Where each swish of her feather duster should have been just a few feathers, which would have caused Akari to already go into a giggling fit, it now felt as if a thousand different feathers were swishing about her underarm, stroking with ticklish ecstasy and abandonment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats the matter Akari? One little feather duster too much for you to handle? Coochie coochie coo! Why don't you just put down that huge metal thing of yours, and just surrender to me like a good Oni?\" Giggling to herself as well, Hagoromo raised her other hand, dragging her nails about Akari's quivering belly, scratching up her sensitive sides, before skittering all across Akari's exposed red breasts, which were jiggling like jelly with every ticklish bout of laughter Akari had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gnngrrrr, HAaAHhahaaa!

The feeling was like hundreds of soft brushes stroking over every inch of her skin, finding each and every sensitive spot and exploiting it mercilessly. Hagoromo fell to the ground, rolling on the floor as she burst into loud laughter. She tried to wipe the energy off with her hands, even her tails, but it was no use.

The oni thought about shooting that tricky fox woman again just to be sure, but realized the cannon needed time to recharge before another shot.

Combined, Hagoromo felt completely at the oni's mercy, and couldn't focus enough to control her tails! Akari kept on tickling as she leered down at the other woman, wriggling her fingertips over Hagoromo's bare belly in an extremely ticklish massage, finding each and every abdominal muscle and stimulating it a way that made the fox buck and twitch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkari was having too much fun to even ask her to surrender.

By the time this is done, I'll make you laugh so much, you'll be begging me to stop!\" With a roar, Akari reached out, grabbing Hagoromo's bra, ripping it right off her chest, before throwing it away to the side, making the crowd grow wild with cheers at seeing both contenders topless. Looking down, Akari grinned as she saw Hagoromo now gritting her teeth angrily at her, as well as two large ivory white orbs just underneath her fingertips, large and still firm to the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Akari ran her fingertips lightly up and down the sides of Hagoromo's pale breasts, it was all her victim could do but to bit her lip, before snickers and chuckles fought their way through, and finally an outburst of feminine laughter took over the foxy woman, her fists uselessly pounding the ground beside her in frustration as her opponent traced circles around her jiggling chest, skittering her fingertips on their undersides and sides, before returning to their centers, one finger cheekily tickling her nipples. It didn't escape either combatant's eyes that Hagoromo's legs, which were just a few moments ago squirming together due to the ticklish energies of the cannon, were now grinding together for more... Pleasurable reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to enjoy this, Miss Fox! Then you wouldn't mind if I continued, do I!\" Dragging her digits all over Hagoromo's chest, the cunning (and hysterically laughing) fox knew she had to do something quickly, before Hagoromo exhausted her any longer, else she might actually lose this fight. Using what little concentration she had left, Hagoromo slowly directed one of her tails from behind an unsuspecting Akari to carefully slip underneath the Oni's underarm, moving the fluffy portion of her tail to stroke the undersides of Akari's own exposed red orbs in a sawing motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling something fluffy make contact with her underarm, along with her breasts, Akari exploded into giggles, seeing the lone white tail doing it's ticklish job. \"You may have gotten one of your tails working, but it looks like that's all you can do! Why don't we see who lasts longer, ticklish fox!\" As Akari sat atop Hagoromo, giggling and shrieking with every stroke of that white fluffy tail, Hagoromo lay underneath Akari, laughing hysterically as fingers continued to poke and wiggle across her bare chest. Eventually...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Akari giggled as one of Hagoromo's tails continued to sneak its way under her arm and tease the side of her breast. It made the oni want to squirm and bat the tail away, or grab it. But she knew doing that would take focus away from tickling the fox girl, and that was something she couldn't afford to do. Akari had the woman right where she wanted her, and couldn't give in to such minor teasing now. So she let the mischievous tail do its work, swirling along her smooth armpit, and swishing against the soft skin of her exposed breast. It was quite effective, sending shivers up the oni's spine and making her struggle not to protectively bring in her arms as she giggled despite herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Akari tickled on, using her fingers to pinch at the woman's ribs and stroke against her breasts. It was working, and there was still some lingering effects from the tickle cannon, but it wasn't enough, not enough to get the fox to submit\u2026 Akari needed more. Then she saw the Hagoromo's feather duster lying on the ground nearby. That was it! The duster could softly tickle those jiggling breasts in a way that the oni's large fingers couldn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkari reached out with her other hand to grab the duster. But as she did, Hagoromo had managed to get back the use of another tail. This one mimicked the first, sneaking under the outstretched arm to stroke its tip right in the hollows of her underarm before dragging down to trace the contours of her breast. Akari quickly grabbed the duster and yelped out a bark of even louder laughter, the twin tails making it even harder for the woman to focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yohohou've done it nohohohow you dahahahamn fox!\" Akari snarled through her laughter, the boast diminished by her grinning, silly face. \"I'll give you-hohooho a taste of your own medicine-ehehehehe!\" Akari gripping the feather duster and swirled it over Hagoromo's breasts, dusting each one in turn with a flick of her wrist. Hagoromo arched her back and squealed, the strong sensations of the duster immediately making themselves felt. Akari didn't realize the arousing effects the duster had, but knew having a strong effect on the fox. Hagoromo let out a loud moan as her nipples stiffened from the feathers touch, feeling a warm giddiness flow through her as tickling mixed more and more with arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHagoromo realized that if she didn't retaliate quickly, it wouldn't be long before she'd be begging the oni for more. The tickles were already starting to feel pleasant, arousing\u2026 and part of her just wanted to lie back and let the oni tickled her until she exploded. But the fox pushed those thoughts aside and concentrated. Two of her tails were already well positioned, each one teasing an underarm as well as the sides of the oni's large breasts. The fox willed a third tail to rise up, this one coming around the side to brush against the oni's bare belly. It swished and twirled, and it was definitely having an effect on the red woman, and through Hagoromo's laughter she could see Akari's grip on the duster weaken. With each flick of her tail against the smooth skin of ticklish flesh, it tickled Akari more. Hagoromo even managed to brush against the undersides of those red breasts, which she noticed got excellently ticklish results. If she could just push the oni over the edge and get her to drop it\u2026 she might be able to turn the tables yet\u2026</span></div></div>",

And using my own feather duster against me? I think you need to learn that you shouldn't take other people's toys.\" Finally grabbing both of Akari's hands and pulling them away from their ticklish ministrations, Hagoromo had a few moments to catch her breath as she finally regained her composure. However, the same couldn't be said for the red Oni sitting astride her, still trying to fight off the many tails that were cheekily stroking all across her body. It was just a simple matter for Hagoromo to reach out with one hand, plucking the feather duster from Akari's fingers and returning it to it's rightful owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You love the feeling of my tails, don't you? So soft... So fluffy... So very... <i>ticklish</i>.\" Giggling to herself, Hagoromo willed more of her tails into action, the number slowly increasing from 3 to 5, her opponent laughing as she tried to grab at the furry white appendages moving all about her body,never staying in one place long enough to be caught. Even as the two tails continued to dip inside Akari's underarms, another two started to move behind the Oni, stroking across her exposed bare soles. The fifth tail continued its work of stroking across Akari's quivering belly, not letting up in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems you <i>do</i> like them, with that gigantic smile on your face and all. Perhaps you would like to try... <i>all</i> of them.\" Before Akari could splutter anything amidst her streams of laughter, another two tails moved up to her head, one tail tickling the underside of her chin while the other playfully teased the sensitive areas around her neck, making the Oni scream with laughter as her whole body started to shake with the effort of trying to catch the many appendages stroking all about. Finally, Hagoromo delicately handed her feather duster to one of her final two tails, both of them getting to work on Akari's chest, the tail with the feather duster stroking the undersides of the crimson orbs, while the other tail teased Akari's breasts with it's furry tip. Soon, it wasn't just Hagoromo who was aroused by the enchanted tickle duster, both of Akari's nipples standing to attention as moans were more prevalent alongside her laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cocky smile began growing on Hagoromo's features, knowing it was only a matter of time before her opponent finally gave up if her tails continued up her work, the Oni facial features mixed between torture and pleasure.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Akari felt like Hagoromo had a hundred tails instead of just nine. They seemed to be everywhere: stroking devilishly under her arms, brushing along her large breasts, flittering up and down her belly, even stroking along her soles. Akari's belted out her laughter, unable to contain herself at all, and losing the ability to think. Making matters worse was that enchanted feather duster, which Hagoromo was using to brush along Akari's pert nipples. The sensation was heaven and hell, terribly ticklish, but something in the duster was also lighting an arousing fire within the oni that was getting harder and harder to ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of it resulted in the oni falling backwards like a felled tree. Unable to keep her balance on top of Hagoromo for a second longer, she toppled onto her back, laughing hysterically all the while. The nine tailed fox needed only a moment to collect herself from being pinned underneath the monstrous woman before attacking again. The tables were turned as Hagoromo straddled Akari's muscular thighs, settling herself gently atop the larger woman. While this position could be like riding a bucking bronco, for the moment Akari was laughing too hard to focus on throwing the other woman off of her, her muscles weakened by the ticklish sensations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHagoromo knew she couldn't let up the attack for a moment, or Akari would recover. Her tails went back to work, this time she focused on using all nine: two focused on holding Akari's wrists above her head, exposing her underarms for tails three and four to flitter in and out of. Tails five and six stroked along the undersides of Akari's breasts, using light fast strokes to continue to arouse and tickle the red woman. Two more tails devoted themselves to the oni's midriff, lovingly dragging the soft fur over her sides and across her belly in long lingering movements, never stopping. The ninth tail wiggled behind and softly teased Akari's inner thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe results was devastating. Akari lay on the floor, giggling and laughing constantly. Thankfully her stamina allowed her to take even this kind of tickling, but she knew in the back of her mind it would only be a matter of time unless she could retaliate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, my, such a giggly girl...\u201d Hagoromo taunted the oni underneath her. \u201cAnd I'm not even using the duster yet.\u201d Hagoromo grinned, enjoying the teasing and dragging out her fun, moving the duster over Akari's breasts. \u201cWould you like a little dusting here?\u201d The brief swish of the dusters made Akari moan loudly, to the amusement of Hagoromo. \u201cOr maybe\u2026 here?\u201d Hagoromo brushed in little circles around Akari's bellybutton, causing louder laughter and another plaintive moan from the woman, feeling strangely arousing sensation emanating from her navel and stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHagoromo looked down with pleasure, thinking of what would be the most fun way to tease the oni before going in for the kill.</span></div></div>",

Let us open the curtains for one last <i>explosive</i> encore from Miss Ticklish Oni!\" As the other tails continued to keep Akari in a perpetually giggling state, their furry touches barely making contact with the Oni's red skin, the ninth tail which was previously dancing about in the depths of Akari's large thighs now crept upwards as it wrapped itself around the thin cloth protesting Akari's last sensitive area, pulling it with a sharp tug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the loincloth flew into the air, the crowds roared in laughter as the Oni's full form was exposed for all the spectators, as well as Hagoromo, to see, the person in question roaring as a light blush was barely visible on her naturally crimson facade, her body straining itself with renewed energy to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrrrr... When I get my hands on you you slutty fox, I'm going to make you my own personal tickle slave, before making a fur coat out of you!\" Laughing haughtily at the Oni's empty threats, Hagoromo slowly waved her trump card in one hand, the enchanted feather duster still dimly shimmering in the daylight. \"Oh, is that so? My my then, be my guest. That is, <i>if</i> that sensitive mind of yours manages to survive what my little friend is about to do to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, try all you want, you won't be able to brea-aaahhaAHAahHAHAHAAA!!\" As Hagoromo begun to stroke the tip of the magical duster across Akari's vulnerable labia, the once defiant Oni was quickly reduced to frantic laughter as electric shocks of ticklishness coming from her lower body shot to her brain as she let out a ticklish snort, before collapsing back into chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooohh soooo ticklish in there, don't say I didn't warn you.\" Delving the feather duster deeper into the now hysteric Oni's clitoris, as well as speeding up the strokes of her feather duster, Akari's chuckles soon became intermixed with even more moans as she arched her back in pleasure, grunting as her previous thrashing died down to mere spasms, the tails of the Nine-tailed fox no longer just stroking for the sake of tickling, but now swishing over every inch of Akari's hypersensitive skin in order to send the Oni into more depths of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That;s it... Just make yourself comfortable, after all, we have all day. If I can't break you down with just hard tickling, perhaps all I needed was a much more... <i>softer</i> touch.\" No longer being able to form coherent sentences, all Akari could muster was a few gibberish giggles, along with another long moan as two of Hagoromo's tails took the liberty to wrap their length around the Oni's large breasts, tickling them just by being in contact with them, as well as sending Akari screaming with ecstasy when she felt the two furry tips toying with her rock-hard nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly panting underneath her own heated breath, Hagoromo's other hand reached out to stroke her own chest subversively, the Oni not being the only one turned on, Akari's moans and laughter already putting the usually refined Nine-tailed female in a lusty mode, her mind throwing caution to the wind as she inched closer, wanting to hear even more of the pleasurable sounds her own tickle tool and tails were causing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I wonder, how much do these pants actually protect you, hmmm?

Quickly, the Huntress grabbed onto the top part of Charlotte's tight leotard and pulled, ripping the top half completely away. Her giant, plush breasts sprang forward, and Silva managed to take advantage of them immediately. She reached around, pinning Charlotte's arms to her sides, and groped away at her tits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte squealed in reaction as her opponent brushed her fingernails all around her embarrassingly ticklish breasts. Silva made sure to hold her tight as Charlotte wiggled back and forth in her sitting position, but her thrashing only served to waste her energy as Huntress continued her maddening grabbing and poking of Charlotte's globes and areolas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now evilly laughing Huntress soon switched to squeezing her opponent's soft sides in a lobster claw motion, eliciting silent, belly-aching laughter from Charlotte as she fell off of Silva and tried to crawl away. \"You're not getting away that easy,\" said Silva, who grabbed Charlotte by her ankles and dragged her back towards her. She could do nothing but curl up into a fetal position as Silva squeezed her thigh and poked her belly. She even once or twice ran her nails along the escape artist's feet, eliciting weak cries of protest. She noted Charlotte's extreme sensitivity there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Charlotte was sufficiently exhausted and could no longer muster the strength to get back into a fighting position (for now), Silva grabbed Charlotte's vibrating gloves and quickly removed them from her hands. She tossed them behind her, then spotted her rope gun from earlier. Silva picked up her gun, loaded a bola into it, then fired it at the prone Charlotte. The bola wrapped itself around her ankles securely, preventing her from getting up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now Silva has regained the support of the watching crowd, who cheer as the famed Huntress kneels down by her panting and wriggling prey. Even the devious tournament officials were impressed, and, noticing that her bola gun could not actually tickle on its own, decided to give her an extra weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Silva looked down to see a large, square hairbrush lying in front of her, perfect for tickling. She picked up the tool and then looked over to Charlotte, who in her tired state was having a hard time unroping her feet. The bound gymnast panicked when she saw Silva walking closer and closer to her, wiggling her new found tickle tool and fingers evilly.</span></div></div>",

What happens if we increase the fingers, I wonder...\" As Charlotte felt the one finger suddenly become two, which suddenly became three, before finally becoming five, her lopsided grin finally couldn't grow anymore as her giggles bubbled to a boil inside of her throat, the dam finally collapsing as high-pitched giggles flowed out from her throat like a river, her feet scrunching themselves up, trying to lessen the tickling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleehehheheeease! Meehehheheeercy! Don't tickle me fee-ahahahhaaaaa!\" Mirth already forming in the corners of her eyes, Charlotte pounded the floor with one hand as her other hand was futilely outstretched towards Silva, who was having quite the fun tormenting a pair of sensitive soles such as these. Drinking in the gymnast's pleads and giggles, the audience cheered, seeing one of the contestant's weak spots being exploited, as well as her sizable chest jiggling about as she tried to squirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're already giggling like a schoolgirl that has found her new crush. I wonder if those tender feet can withstand the hairbrush, with all it's multiple, tickly bristles? Coochie Coo!\" Grabbing the brush with her free hand, Silva started to scrub the arches of Charlotte's feet clean, rubbing the ticklish part of the brush up and down rapidly. As the gymnast's giggling soon turned into full blown hysterics, Charlotte could barely plead anymore as tears of mirth streamed down her cheeks along with her red face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PleeehEHEHEEEHEeehehehease, no more!

That would that away <b>all</b> the fun.\" Turning to face the audience, Silva raised her hands to the top of her jacket. \"Fine, I don't need some of these clothes just to beat a giggling gymnast anyway.\" As she unzipped her jacket and immediately tossed it away, leaving her a black bikini top, the audience roared back to life, the sight of two semi-naked contestants sending hormones rising sky high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile behind the distracted Silva, Charlotte finally managed to catch her breath, formulating her plan to turn the tables against the overconfident Huntress...</span></div></div>",

While Silva was facing the audience chest-first, Charlotte had managed to escape from her bondage and was catching her breath. Looking for a weapon, her eyes settled on one of her vibrating tickle gloves lying on the arena ground. She picked it up and fitted it over her right hand. <i>Better one glove than no weapons at all,</i> Charlotte thought to herself. At that moment, Silva turned back to face her opponent, smirking, and picked up Charlotte's second glove. She fitted it over her right hand, too. Silva kicked her menacing hairbrush to the side, perhaps to give Charlotte a sporting chance, perhaps just saving it for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! That's my tickly glove, give it back!\" yelled Charlotte, trying to sound as menacing as possible. She was ready to start Round 2. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come and get it, widdle girl,\" said the Huntress teasingly. Charlotte obliged. Both women charged each other, tickling gloves outstretched, and grappled to land a tickling hand. Silva and Charlotte both ended up grabbing each other's bare hands with their gloved ones, and Charlotte could feel the fuzzy, soft, vibrating fibers tickling away at her palm. It was a place she never even knew could be ticklish. Quickly, before this could erode her and reduce her into yet another quivering mess, Charlotte darted her uncovered hand down to Silva's hip, squeezing the soft flesh and eliciting a soft giggle from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the woman hunched over and reached down to push Charlotte's hand away, Charlotte sprung her trap. She reached forward with her gloved hand and fully enclosed it around one of Silva's round breasts, just gently but firmly running her hand all around the globe and its erecting nipple. \"Hah, gotcha!\" she laughed triumphantly. Instantly, Silva's body seized up and she stopped fighting Charlotte. A wave of silent, heaving laughter was pouring from her mouth, which only sounded like slight heaving but Charlotte could tell Silva was in ticklish agony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved her hand back and forth, then squeezed the breast slightly, causing Silva to jerk a little and her nipples to harden. Then, the short but determined escape artist took her uncovered hand and planted it right in Silva's armpit, spidering her fingers around and around the hairless hollow. \"Pleheheheeeeese stahahap...!\" Silva begged, her voice coming out more as a whisper than a cry. Slowly, she sank to the floor, with Charlotte taunting and tickling her every step of the way.</span></div></div>",

Well, I think everyone can see that someone also has an 'O'mighty' ticklish breasts as well! Kitchie Koo!\" Flicking a vibrating finger across Silva's erect nipple, the Huntress bit back a soft moan trying to escape her lips, before descending back into silent giggles, Charlotte scratching the sides of her ample breasts like a playful kitten toying with a scratching post. It was a mere few seconds before the weakened Huntress snickered and chuckled as she fell to one knee, before her legs gave out on her, sending her falling backwards onto her rear, her teasing tickler giggling as she fell forwards as well, her hand not letting go of it's squishy ticklish prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So ticklish everywhere!

Tickle Tickle!\" Poking about Silva's upper-body with her free hand, the sensitive Huntress, who now had the tables turned on her, could barely stifle her laughter as she uncharacteristically gave a small squeal whenever a wiggling finger found itself prodding at her sides, ribs and underarms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a strained grunt of laughter, Silva watched carefully through mirth filled eyes, even as the ticklish distraction of vibrating fingers stroking the sensitive undersides of her globes proved to be quite the distraction indeed.

I think you're forgetting <i>something</i>!\" Stroking the sides of Silva's chest, the Huntress gasped, before gritting her teeth, silent laughter already streaming out from the cracks. Not one to give up so easily, the Huntress steeled herself as she reached out with her hand that had the vibrating glove on it, grabbing the back of the surprised gymnast's head and pulling her towards herself, Charlotte's head squished in between Silva's breasts as she floundered, trying to pull herself out as her arms clumsily flailed about, her vision cut off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing she needed something to break the stalemate, Silva spotted the earlier hairbrush which she had discarded on the floor, conveniently just within her grasp if she were to stretch just a little bit more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In response, Silva jerked her ankle in different directions, trying to escape her opponent's strong grip and persistent nails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she could only use one hand to tickle and one hand to hold her leg, Charlotte knew she could not hold on forever. Still, she knew that she could tire out Huntress as much as she could while she held on. She dug her fingers in between Silva's toes, using her restraining hand to pull back the flailing digits. As Silva's laughter grew higher and higher pitched, she suddenly lashed out with her other foot, knocking away Charlotte's tickling hands and letting Silva crawl away. She turned around, grabbed Charlotte's sides, and dug in, pushing her opponent to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeeeeeyaaaahahahaha!\" Charlotte shrieked, as much in surprise due to the change of roles as to the sheer tickling torment. It seemed to her an injustice that the tables could be turned so quickly, made worse by the humiliation of firm, probing hands switching from her sides to her silky thighs. She curled into a ball to protect herself, barely even stirring when Silva stopped her assault and stood up.

Huntress had slightly loosened her grip on her opponent to taunt her, giving Charlotte the opportunity she needed for an escape. Silva made a grab for her feet, but she was too late, and Charlotte jerked her feet away. She rolled backwards in a somersault, pushing off the ground to land in a fighting stance several yards away from Huntress, who was glaring in shocked indignation. It was a comforting feeling to have her feet touch solid ground rather than the scrubbing of uncaring, tickling bristles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte spotted something on the ground, two slightly crumpled hand shapes. The vibrating tickle gloves! A worthy weapon, Charlotte realized, looking at Silva's exposed breasts and skimpy abdominal clothing as she was standing up again. Charlotte pulled on the thin but soft gloves. Before Huntress could concentrate on her opponent's stance and tactics, Charlotte charged in, almost knocking Silva down when she shoved her probing fingers into Silva's armpits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nahahat there!\" Silva squealed, clenching her arms to her sides and struggling to keep from collapsing. Locking her arms only served to trap Charlotte's eager hands in there, where she was free to tickle the soft, warm skin with her vibrating gloves. Each second of vibration from the gloves multiplied the tickling sensation tenfold, chipping away at Huntress's endurance. Her arms feebly trying to push at the hands trapped in her armpits, Silva was unable to even reach the large brush she had clipped at her belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one flourish, Charlotte knocked Silva over and switched her tickling spot. With a devious giggle, she pushed her fingers underneath Silva's panties, each point on the vibrating glove both tickling and exciting Silva, whose laughs became more and more filled with tepid arousal. In her haze of laughter and moaning, Silva found that her arousal both increased her own ticklishness, but also made her want to tickle the daylights out of Charlotte even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte shifted positions sitting on top of Huntress, now with her back and feet facing Huntress's head to allow her to more freely tickle the woman's nether regions. \"Is her widdle private parts ticklwish? Goochie goo!\" Charlotte laughed, happy to be in control of the situation, as she danced her fingers in and around Huntress's ticklish vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Worst still, with each stroke of Charlotte's fingers, the Huntress could feel her sanity slowly slipping away, the tiny part of her mind which wanted to just lie there and enjoy the pleasure growing with each passing second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little-nrrghgghh!! No, gaaHAHAhaHAaha, get out of there you-teeeeheheheehee!! Don't-ahahahaahaa!\" Arching her back as her nails gripped the ground underneath her; Silva bit back a moan, one eyelid closed with the effort of enduring Charlotte\u2019s cruel fingers. Softly caressing the insides of Silva\u2019s bare thighs, the slightly larger woman of the two collapsed into another round of ticklish laughter, moans still constantly intermixed at regular intervals as even though she didn\u2019t want it, her body begged to disagree, her hips already slightly grinding themselves into the bottom of Charlotte\u2019s rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready in no shape to make any verbal threats, Silva knew she had to get Charlotte\u2019s hands out of her jeans, or at least grab her attention.  The answer came to her as her flailing fists came into contact with something soft, very much unlike the hard ground that they were used to hitting. Squinting through her tear-streaked vision, Silva knew that she had struck the jackpot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot letting up, Charlotte continued to stroke the area between the sensitive regions of Silva\u2019s thighs, one finger stroking through the Huntress\u2019 sheer thin panties, the vibrating gloves proving to be extremely effective when used correctly. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Huntress? You seem to be enjoying this! Why don\u2019t you just give in, and I\u2019ll really turn the power on these gloves to the ma-Heeeehahhahaaaa! Not my feet again! Taahahahahaa!\u201d  Forgetting in the heat of the moment that she had exposed her most ticklish spot to her nemesis, Charlotte threw her head backwards in laughter, her toes and feet trying to wriggle away from Silva\u2019s weakly scratching fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuff\u2026 Huff\u2026 Did you think\u2026 you could tickle me\u2026 and get away so easily! Ngrrhh!\u201d Trying her best to tickle the upturned soles lying before her, her mouth opened up in gasp as she felt another wave of orgasmic pleasure rock her mind, the sensation of vibrating digits now stroking ever more quickly on the insides of her undergarment sending her into another level of ticklish lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you can concentrate, if I do <i>this</i>? That\u2019s right, give in to your own desires, Huntress!\u201d Giggling herself, Charlotte still felt Silva\u2019s fingers not stopping their exploration of her bare feet, albeit much slower than her previous attempt. It was only a matter of time before\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She stood up, relinquishing her position of control over the Huntress, but figured she could find a better one. \"Let's stop that foot tickling now, if you please?\" she asked the still-moaning fighter, who laid on the floor catching her breath but still smirking. She had succeeded in leveling the playing field. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You almost had me there,\" Silva said ruefully, looking down at her rummaged pants. Realizing the zipper had been ripped out, she simply pulled her useless jeans off altogether in one quick motion, exposing her curvy butt and soft thighs completely. No longer pinned to the floor, the Huntress felt free, in control and ready to pounce. And pounce she did. Before Charlotte could re position herself on top, Silva reached out and grabbed her by the ankle, pulling sideways and throwing the shorter girl to the soft ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you really believe I would actually allow you to win?\" the Huntress taunted as she pulled in the poor stunned girl, who was grasping at the loose sand, frantically trying to loosen Silva's grip. But the Huntress was determined, and then fate turned even more in her favor: she spotted one of her nets from earlier, lying in strands on the ground. But first she had to make sure Charlotte wasn't going anywhere. Huntress sprang forward and dug her hands into the part of Char's hip where her thigh met her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"EEEEheeheek!!!\" the girl squealed, \"Don't you darehahaha- wait, nohoho- GET OHOHOHOF!!\" But her protests were in vain as Huntress tickled away at her, making sure she couldn't go anywhere. When Charlotte was temporarily too tired to get into fighting position, Silva grabbed the tough net and wound it around her opponent's wrists, triple knotted and tight enough to keep her from escaping for a good while. With poor Charlotte so restrained, the end game was near.</span></div></div>",

Letting out a surprised squeal, the latter quickly broke down into a symphony of laughter again as the horse brush got to work, raking up and down her soft arches with ticklish abandon, not letting up in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have fun with your gloves just now in my pants? Well, they can't save you now, not with all that rope binding your hands. Coochie Coochie Coo!\" Laughing along with her victim, albeit with less vigor and more haughtiness, the huntress moved the brush to where Charlotte's wiggling toes were, giving their bases a good scrub. Now practically screaming with hysterical laughter, the gymnast couldn't even think straight as her mind was filled with mostly the sound of her own voice, echoing throughout the stadium. As the audience cheered for even more to be done, Silva gave a wicked grin as she obliged, digging into the soles of one Charlotte's now pinkish arches with her nails, scratching away like a cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Charlotte's laughter slowly delved into silent pleas and giggles, tears of mirth could be seen streaming freely from the poor girl's eyes as her body weakly tried to move away, most of her energy already being sapped through her forced movements and hysterics. Remembering that she had one vibrating glove left, Silva swapped hands, her bare hand stroking along with the brush as she used the one tickle glove she had to draw shapes in the smooth skin of Charlotte's arches, the combined tickling driving the latter absolutely crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, with her last drop of strength, Charlotte...</span></div></div>",

She prefers not to say anything, and let her actions do the talking (or tickling).

She has flowing blonde hair, angelic wings, along with a white tank top holding her sizable chest, along with a black skater skirt, and sneakers. Apparently she didn't get the memo on coming well dressed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElysia is quite a carefree person, with a happy disposition. However, when she is needed, or her friend is in trouble, she gets quite serious, doing everything that she can to help them win, regardless of anything that happens to herself. Although she isn't very athletic, her feathery wings are great tickle tools, as well as allowing her to fly. She also has a select few harmless spells she can use. Perks of being an angel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[SECRET INFORMATION: Before the match, in order to boost their strength, Silva made a 'Pact' with Elysia. This pact allows them to have more endurance, stamina and speed in the coming fight. However, there are drawbacks, such as for example, if one of them were inside the arena were to get tickled, the other would feel it, on a smaller scale. This pact also makes them slightly more ticklish, increasing with proximity. For example, if both of them were in the arena at the same time, their ticklishness would increase by a {b{i}huge{/i}} amount, for the both of them, making a 2 vs 1 situation quite dangerous for them. ]</span></div></div>",

She is 5' 6'', around 120 pounds with light brown hair that falls to the base of her neck. She wears a version of a French Maid costume like this:http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eMO7YPgXovI/U1IgI7FcKHI/AAAAAAAAFdE/keuZ6GlEQP8/s 1600/frenchmaid.jpg<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only difference is that she doesn't wield the feather duster( only in item tournaments) and no high heels. She wears black panties like this:http://image.rakuten.co.jp/elle/cabinet/kok/c43bk.jpg<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand a low cut bra like this:http://images.asos-media.com/inv/S/3/17/503275/Black11/image1xl.jpg<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to her high ticklishness and low stats, she is uncomfortable taking a opponent head on. She prefers to move around, dance around her opponent and try to find a weak spot. She has the grace of a ballerina(she takes classes). Sometimes this works, and other times she gets grabbed and pulled in. Some have teased her by pulling her around the arena before tickling her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them are new to the arena. Fire Ball is confident in swooning anybody, but Madame Maid is apprehensive about the match.</span></div></div>",

Neither wear much at all, only a leather top wrapped around their chests, and a loincloth at their waists. Jaqi and Vixy are both beautiful aside from their short stature: flat, toned stomachs, elegant curves, firm legs, alluring if not busty breasts, and no more than an ounce of fat on their bodies. It's all too easy to become distracted by their bare skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo to the playful nature of their race, Jaqi and Vixy aren't very good at resisting temptation, causing them to recklessly jump in for an opportunistic tickle even when it might be a trap. They also aren't very good at resisting the sensation, bursting with laughter and squirming around after even a quick tickling. While they aren't the best at holding it in, they're gifted ticklers, having a knack for knowing exactly which spots to exploit, and just how to tease. Their only downfall is that they occasionally get too playful, taking their time and dragging out the tickling enough that the victim can get away or get them back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Secret Information]: Jaqi and Vixy love to tease, but are exceptionally bad at taking it in return. A hand slowly descending on a vulnerable tummy, or teasing words whispered in their ears, being forced to admit they're ticklish and where\u2026 all these things get to them especially badly.</span></div></div>",

She wears little clothing to make her more elusive and hard to grab. She is wearing knee high socks with tennis shoes to run fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has a bubbly and flirtatious attitude which makes her opponents fall in love with her instead of fighting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Author's Note: I have talked to ironsteel and have his permission to use his character in different branches.

She is 5' 6'', around 120 pounds with light brown hair that falls to the base of her neck. She wears a version of a French Maid costume like this:http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eMO7YPgXovI/U1IgI7FcKHI/AAAAAAAAFdE/keuZ6GlEQP8/s 1600/frenchmaid.jpg<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only difference is that she doesn't wield the feather duster( only in item tournaments) and no high heels. She wears black panties like this:http://image.rakuten.co.jp/elle/cabinet/kok/c43bk.jpg<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand a low cut bra like this:http://images.asos-media.com/inv/S/3/17/503275/Black11/image1xl.jpg<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to her high ticklishness and low stats, she is uncomfortable taking a opponent head on. She prefers to move around, dance around her opponent and try to find a weak spot. She has the grace of a ballerina(she takes classes). Sometimes this works, and other times she gets grabbed and pulled in. Some have teased her by pulling her around the arena before tickling her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them are new to the arena. Fire Ball is confident in swooning anybody, but Madame Maid is apprehensive about the match</span></div></div>",

As they get to her, they hover over her and begin to brush the feather end quickly over 's bare blue skin, darting around like insects to avoid her swatting hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehe, hey! Stahahahap it!\" Jaqi cried out, giggling quickly as the feather darts roam over her body. Vixy tries to call the darts back by waving her hands, and surprisingly the darts obey, flying back and landing in her hand again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, those might be useful\u2026\" Vixy muses, \"but what about this?\" She picks up a net tightly wound up into a ball, looking at it curiously. Turning to Jaqi, who was still brushing the feathery feeling off her skin, Vixy tossed the ball into the air. \"Hey, Jaqi\u2026 catch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" Jaqi cried out, as the ball burst open, unfurling into a net that wrapped itself around Jaqi, sending her to the floor. \"H-hey! Get this thing offa me!\" She said, her struggling getting her only more and more wound up in the net, as if it were a spider's web.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, this thing doesn't even tickle? That's no fun\u2026\" Vixy says, helping pull the annoying, strangely sticky net off of Jaqi. While it would've been easy to tickle her like this, the imps both agreed that they wanted something with a more immediate effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, this one looks good!\" Vixy said, bounding ahead to a long fluffy feather about 18 inches long. Not even bothering to read the description of the item, she picked it up by its handle and turned towards Jaqi. \"En garde!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, not again! Eeehehehehehe nohohoho!\" Jaqi said, bursting into another giggle fit as Vixy brushed the feather along her side. Grinning, Vixy moved it along Jaqi's tummy in a slow slicing motion, to excellent effect. Vixy giggled even louder, but also let out a surprising moan. \"Eheheehehee\u2026 ooohohohoho! Ooh, Vixy-ehehehehe stahahahap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why\u2026 do you liiiiike it?\" Vixy whispered in the other imp's ear as she teased, slowing down the feather's motion but continuing to press it against Jaqi's belly. Jaqi could only not as she bit her lip, the tickling strangely mixing with an arousing sensation that would've been clear had either bothered to read that the feather dagger was magically enchanted to arouse any body part it touched. Grinning, Vixy pulled away, smiling triumphantly at her panting partner. \"This one! This is the one to use!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh\u2026 hehehe\u2026 fine.\" Jaqi agreed, \"But you're going first after all that tickling you gave me. Vixy only nodded, eager to try out the weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVixy strode out into the arena, Jaqi staying on the other side of the gate, waiting to be tagged in at need. Vixy looked around, not seeing her opponent yet, whoever it was. \"Come out, come out, wherever you are!\" Vixy called out playfully, and took the time to stretch out her short body alluringly, showing off all her tickle spots in an irresistible display if anyone were to be watching.</span></div></div>",

Feathers of various sizes, nets to capture people, even a sword shaped like a feather. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha!\" Giselle squealed as a pink ribbon wraps around her waist. Cassie gives a hearty tug and pulls Giselle over to her. The maid squirms and giggles as Fire Ball grabs her hips and squeezes them. \"Hehe-Cassie I'm on your team!\" The giggling maid finally gets out. Cassie smiles and lets her go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but I wanted to try my tool! Look!\" Giselle could see it was a expanding ribbon of some sort, like what you found with a cheerleader. \"Oh, how fitting Cassie.\" She teased as Fire Ball made a series of spins and twirls with her tool of choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like it? It so fits me!\" The redhead adopted her cutest smile which caused the maid to blush heavily. Cassie's natural charm could work her magic on her teammates as well. In particular, Giselle blushed hard as Cassie pivoted around to show off her rear. Fire Ball giggled, she liked her teammate, and enjoyed teasing the older woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about this Maidy!\" Cassie put a tool into her hands. Giselle looked down; it was a feather duster, with a multitude of feathers. Cassie, curious, brushed her hand over the feathers, and burst into a sharp fit of laughter. It took a few seconds for her to calm down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess they're super ticklish.\" Fire Ball nodded with a smile, \"Those imps won't stand a chance.\" She started to lead her friend out to the arena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you worried at all? They love to tickle, and your not wearing much.\" Giselle looked at her in concern. Out of all the contenders, Cassie Baker had one of the most revealing outfits, just a pink sports bra and spandex shorts with tennis shoes and knee high socks. Cassie bragged to her before that her shorts were incredible strong. They were tight, but were also incapable of being torn off, only stretched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be ok! I can always charm them, and I'm so quick they can't catch me!\" Cassie hugged her as a gesture of friendship. \"You'll be fine too Giselle, just keep your dress on!\" Madame Maid smiled a little; even now, Fire Ball liked to tease and flirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth females entered the arena, and saw one of the imps out there already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go first!\" Cassie shouted as she hopped in. Giselle waited by the gate. She saw Fire Ball and the Imp start to move around. </span></div></div>",

Vixy couldn't tell, but decided it didn't matter, she'd find out soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna getcha!\" Vixy called out playfully, leaping at Cassie and swinging her feather dagger recklessly. Cassie jumped back, quickly dodging the attack. Vixy tried again, running after her and slashing at the air in front of her, but Cassie managed to dodge again. The pattern kept repeating again and again as Cassie took the defensive, watching Vixy leap and charge at her only to stay out of range of the dagger each time, frustrating and slowly exhausting the eager imp. \"Hey, quit running away and let me tickle you!\" Vixy yelled impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't catch me!\" Cassie teased, responding to Vixy's earlier playful call. Cassie kept running around Vixy, occasionally taking the time to pose provocatively, showing off her pert rear, her taut tummy\u2026 actions which only egged Vixy on, making her run after her even harder. Finally, Vixy managed to land an attack, if just barely. Cassie was a second too late in her dodge, and the edges of the feather dagger barely brushed against her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eehehehehe, oohohoho! Got me that time-mhmhmhm!\" Cassie giggled, sucking in her tummy as the feathery tickles lingered on her skin. She tried to brush away the tickly feeling, but noticed another warm feeling as well\u2026 that feather doing more than just tickling. But rather than make Cassie concerned, the lusty tickling feather only made Cassie want to turn on the offensive, noticing that Vixy was starting to get a little short of breath.</span></div></div>",

Nice try!\" The imp taunted as Fire Ball recovered her tool and moved around. The fast movement resumed, only this time with the Imp on the defensive as Cassie tried to wrap her up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't run forever impy! I'm gonna catch you and tickle you!\" Fire Ball was enjoying this immensely. It was like a game of cat and mouse, or tag. Whoever slowed down or got careless was in for a ticklish time. All the while, Vixy couldn't help but notice how colorful Cassie's bright pink spandex was. It made itself an inviting target. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, should I try to use my dagger on her, or go in close and grab her?\" The imp mused to herself as she kept moving back from the flying pink ribbon. As Vixy moved again, the ribbon got a little too close to her comfort, narrowly snagging her by the waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting closer!\" Cassie teased her as she continued to dance around. Between the two, the human had much greater stamina due to her height and athleticism. As she moved though, Cassie overstepped and went off balance a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now's my chance!\" Vixy rushed forward.

Unfortunately for Vixy, she had pulled too hard, and Cassie fell right into Vixy, knocking the smaller woman to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Vixy knew, she was lying on the floor of the arena flat on her back. Even worse, Cassie was lying on top of her, on her back as if Vixy was some kind of bed or blanket. \"Ooph! Hey, get off me you big jerk!\" Vixy said, trying to squirm out from under the taller woman, but unable to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I?\" Cassie asked coquettishly, also coming to her senses. \"You're pretty comfy!\" Vixy growled in a high pitched voice that wasn't exactly intimidating, but raised her feather dagger. Vixy's arm came out from under Cassie's side, the feather poised above her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you asked for it!\" Vixy retorted, and lowered the feather to Cassie's bare belly. Vixy couldn't see what she was doing from underneath Cassie, but even the clumsy attack was enough. The feather brushed along Cassie's tummy, making her gasp and begin to giggle. Cassie tried sucking in her tummy, but it wasn't enough to get away, the feather just followed her. As the tickling spread across her belly and twirled around her navel, Cassie also noticed the arousing effects the feather had, as with each stroke a familiar shiver ran thrilling down her spine, and a familiar warmth was kindled low in her belly. \"Hehehe, don't my tickles feel nice?\" Vixy teased into Cassie's ear. \"Just relax and laugh for me! The more it tickles, the more I'm sure you'll like it\u2026\" The tickling feeling made Cassie wriggle her rear into the imp behind her, grinding into the blue woman as she giggled and gasped, surprised at the extent of the feather's power. Cassie realized that if she didn't do something soon, she'd start to enjoy being tickled by the little imp.</span></div></div>",

Her stomach is a mix of ticklish feeling, and an addicting warmth that was hard to ignore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's more to that feather than meets the eye!\" Cassie wonders out loud as Vixy attack again. The spandex wearing girl dodges again, but this time it's much slower. To Cassie's horror, she realizes the feather has made her lethargic from the tickling/pleasure combination. Vixy lands several glancing blows in the next few moments. Each one fills her more with warmth and tickling. Now giggling, she squeals as the feather brushes her bottom; her pink shorts do nothing to protect her. Cassie grabs her butt as the tickling doesn't go away, performing a strange dance that makes Vixy laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying the tickling?!\" She taunts, then slides the feather between Fire Ball's thighs. The dagger rakes across her inner thighs and intimate area. Instinctively, Fire Ball moans and grabs herself. Her dance becomes slow and alluring, as she bends over and shakes her rear unknowingly at the Imp. Try as she might, Cassie feels a little moisture between her legs, courtesy of the pleasuring/tickling dagger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh...oh mmmm, I'm...not...gon..gonna...last!\" The red head knows she will have a hard time defeating the Imp in her states.

Cassie had moaned from that attack on her thighs. If the imp could just get her there again, she could just imagine what an effect it would have a second time.

Vixy knew what the dagger was capable of, but had no idea if the feather duster had any special skills of its own. Either way, the imp knew she was in trouble: in order to attack Giselle, she'd have to get in close and use her fingers, but could be attacked from a longer range. The maid's arms were longer, and the tools gave her an even bigger reach. To make matters worse, Vixy was getting tired. Running after Cassie had been exhausting work, and now she didn't even have the girl to show for it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, gimme that back!\" Vixy whined, retreating to a safe distance as the Maid advanced on her. \"That one's mine! No fair for you to have two and me zero!\" But Giselle grinned and started to chase after her, making the imp yelp and turn to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come back here, imp!\" Giselle called out to Vixy's backside. \"I'm going to get you back for what you did to Cassie!\" Vixy only tried to run harder, turning back to see if she was getting any distance. Unfortunately for Vixy, she wasn't, and turning around only slowed her down more. Giselle reached out and swiped the feather dagger up Vixy's left side, making her giggle and jump away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ooh, so that's how that feels!\"</i> Vixy thought to herself as she scrambled away from Giselle's next attack, barely dodging this time<i>. \"Now I know how Jaqi felt when I was using it on her! I gotta be careful, too much of that and I'll start to like it!\"</i> Vixy's mind raced, and she decided she needed to try and get the feather dagger back. Turning around, she made a desperate dive for Giselle, trying to grab her wrist and knock the weapon from her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiselle was caught by surprise by the counterattack, expecting Vixy to keep running away, tired as the blue woman was. Vixy reached out to her, and Giselle reached out with the dagger to get her first\u2026 and just made it! As Vixy reached out, she exposed her armpit, which Giselle attacked with a quick feathering from the dagger. Vixy's eyes bulged at the intense tickly sensation, as well as the way it also felt strangely warm and good\u2026 turning the ticklish spot into an erogenous zone. Vixy chuckled and laughed loudly, giggling in a husky way that she couldn't completely conceal. The direct hit knocked the imp off balance, and as Giselle dodged Vixy tumbled into a somersault as she rolled passed her, a hand under that arm trying to furiously rub the lingering feelings away.</span></div></div>",

She wears a version of a French Maid costume like this:http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eMO7YPgXovI/U1IgI7FcKHI/AAAAAAAAFdE/keuZ6GlEQP8/s 1600/frenchmaid.jpg<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only difference is that she doesn't wield the feather duster( only in item tournaments) and no high heels.

She prefers to move around, dance around her opponent and try to find a weak spot. She has the grace of a ballerina(she takes classes). Sometimes this works, and other times she gets grabbed and pulled in. Some have teased her by pulling her around the arena before tickling her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them are new to the arena.

In the meantime, he spend his time traveling within his Empire to gain a better understanding of it and without, to understand the world he lives in. He is a clever man with charming aura about him. He is very good at getting what he wants. His hair is black, as are his eyes and skin. His upbringing has lead him to have a relatively easy life and the softness of his skin indicates this. He is finely dressed in silk, shirt, pants and socks, with a purple cape around his shoulders and fine, leather boots on his feet. He is muscular, showing the long days learning sword play and generally being athletic, with a broad chest, and thick arms and legs, held up by big, wide feet. His constant companion and close friend is the court mage Fahim. The two grew up together while Fahim's father served Morris's as an adviser and mage.

Here, his exotic looks and talent for magic caught he eye of many, including the Prince. From then on Fahim was never alone, he was constantly at the Prince's side, aiding him in his misdeeds against the Palace servants and anyone else the Prince felt like. When Morris set out to travel, Fahim was ready with his magic books, provisions and a horse. His magic training under his father and improved upon by the childish pranks of his youth was finished by the road. Despite spending most of his life in Ravenna, Fahim has kept his people's dress. A tunic of a bright blue, with loose pants and sandals. His skin, still exotic looking with a dusty complexation, eyes of a soft gold and framed with dark hair. He is thin and average height.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She is 5' 6'', around 120 pounds with light brown hair that falls to the base of her neck. She wears a version of a French Maid costume like this:http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eMO7YPgXovI/U1IgI7FcKHI/AAAAAAAAFdE/keuZ6GlEQP8/s 1600/frenchmaid.jpg<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only difference is that she doesn't wield the feather duster( only in item tournaments) and no high heels. She wears black panties like this:http://image.rakuten.co.jp/elle/cabinet/kok/c43bk.jpg<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand a low cut bra like this:http://images.asos-media.com/inv/S/3/17/503275/Black11/image1xl.jpg<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to her high ticklishness and low stats, she is uncomfortable taking a opponent head on. She prefers to move around, dance around her opponent and try to find a weak spot. She has the grace of a ballerina(she takes classes). Sometimes this works, and other times she gets grabbed and pulled in. Some have teased her by pulling her around the arena before tickling her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them are new to the arena. Fire Ball is confident in swooning anybody, but Madame Maid is apprehensive about the match.</span></div></div>",

Oh well, she must have made it to this floor already. I just have to wait for her.

What say we end this little hunt, and you surrender peacefully to me. I might even consider letting you off easily.\" Giving a quick glance downwards, he caught a glimpse of Silva's chest almost touching his, as well as a small crossbow attached to her wrist. \"So that must be her weapon... too bad her weapon is useless at close range, while mine isn't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smirk on his face, Maxwell slowly reached into his pocket, fingers gripping the taser. \"Oh I don't know Silva. You might have caught me, but are you so sure that you aren't the prey? And by the way, did you think I was unarmed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds before the dots connected in the huntress' head, Midnight pulled out the tickle taser from his pocket, and jammed it straight into the open underarms of the huntress above him. Grinning, he could see the surprised look last on Silva's face for a moment, before she dissolved into bubbly giggles, followed by full-blown laughter, rolling off the anthro wolf, clutching her underarms in order to try and get rid of the ticklish sensations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you're not getting away that easily, huntress. After all, we both should get to enjoy the thrill of a hunt!\" Pressing his lead, he grabbed one of Silva's hands, bringing it over her head, exposing one pale hollow. \"Now Silva, how does a tickle taser feel like?\" Grinning, Midnight pressed the button, pressing the crackling tickle machine into her taut underarm, amidst her heavy breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConvulsing with hysterical laughter, the huntress was helpless to do anything, her body randomly spasming about, much like the effects a normal taser would have on a person, along with 10000 megawatts of pure ticklishness in her underarms. She could barely find room for gasps of air, let alone form words with her laughing mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now huntress, time to...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She prefers to move around, dance around her opponent and try to find a weak spot. She has the grace of a ballerina(she takes classes). Sometimes this works, and other times she gets grabbed and pulled in. Some have teased her by pulling her around the arena before tickling her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them are new to the arena.

Quietly, both women entered the tower and went upstairs. At the second floor, Cassie hugged her teammate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck!\" She then entered the floor, the door closing behind her. Giselle continued to the third floor, and after some hesitation, entered. </span></div></div>",

Pretty please.\" Her honey-like voice made Silva act on autopilot. Slowly, her firm rear wiggled back and forth as Fire Ball keeps her fingers on it. Giggling, the Huntress could feel her legs weaken from the tickling and Fire Ball's charm. Her thighs rubbed against each other and quivered. The red head did not fail to notice this. Kissing a side of Silva's neck, Fire Ball took one arm and wrapped around her waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor girl, all this tickling has made your legs weak.\" Fire Ball stopped tickling, only to wrap her other arm Silva's waist.

Your chest looks a bit constricted from here, doesn't it?

The cheers of the crowd grew even more louder, making the previous noises made by them tiny in comparison, as the huntress' large D-cup breasts were exposed to the world, even Fire Ball gave a small whistle after looking once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know you were hiding these things underneath your bra, you ticklish little thing!

Fire Ball brought her mouth closer, and breathed on Silva's neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I find your sensitive spot?\" Her answer came in the form of a soft moan as hot air washed over Silva's neck. Her legs started to quiver more and more, soon she wouldn't be able to hold herself up. Silva's fight to hold back her laughter continued as Fire Ball gently grabbed her right breast. A small squeeze sent waves of pleasure through the captive hunter. She started to feel warm inside, and her black underwear felt a little wet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if I do this.\" Fire Ball kept teasing as she took her hand and started spider-walking over Silva's chest. At that, the huntress's battle to hold her laughter failed. A stream of squeals and giggles came out of her mouth. Now, her legs buckled and gave way like blocks of cement. She would have fallen if Fire Ball didn't support her weight. \"Aren't you so cute! Don't worry, I won't let you fall.\" She smiled and slowly stroked a breast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to make you feel good. Don't you?\" Silva couldn't respond except for a half moan/half giggle.

It became a tug of war as Giselle tried to pull herself through the door, while the statue started to pull her back. The camera switched over to Sareth. The succubus was tied down on a bed, stripped of her corset, and being tickled heavily by other statues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Maidy needs my help!

Quickly, she grabbed the door jams to prevent herself falling into a hexagonal body of water. One of her feet slipped, dipping her shoe and knee high sock into the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahah!\" her foot exploded in a ticklish feeling as she fell on her butt. The feeling lasted over a minute before subsiding, leaving Fire Ball giggling on the floor. Slowly, she got off the floor. \"Ticklish water? She wasn't kidding.\" Taking a moment, Fire Ball fixed her spandex shorts, which had a slight wedgie from being pulled earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to be careful.\" Cautiously, Fire Ball opened another door, making her way slowly through the maze before she opened a door she wished she hadn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpecting to find it empty, she jumped in surprise at a large human-like monster staring at her. He was tall and strong, with a mix of demon and humanoid features. He grinned at the college girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been so long since I had a victim. I hope you like the water.\" Screaming, Fire Ball started to run away, with the monster in hot pursuit. </span></div></div>",

Stop running away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of a game of cat and mouse through the maze, Fire Ball leaned against a wall as she caught her breath, refusing to believe that she had outran the demon. \"If that person... Or thing caught me... I'm done for. I have to be even more careful now to avoid him, or what ever is inside the maze. Wait... I hear something... Voices coming from around the corner? I think I hear a female and male voice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking slowly, Fire Ball peeked her head out, curious as to where the voices were originating from. Quickly clamping her mouth shut at her misfortune/good fortune,  she saw the male demon that was previously chasing her, now preparing to square off against her original opponent, Silva, whom she had guessed stumbled upon him as she too was making her way around the maze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well look what we have here. A demon huh. All your female counter parts are so common in this areas, I guess it is a privilege for me to be able to hunt down one of you males. Now come at me, my new prey!\" Taunting the demon, Fire Ball hears a loud roar, before the demon charged towards the huntress, who quickly sidestepped him, and knocked him to the ground, both of them in a tussle of bodies, trying to gain the upper hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the perfect opportunity for me... I can help Silva and maybe get rid of that male demon. Maybe she'll be nice enough to let me go... Or I could help that male demon.

He was so set to torment me just a few minutes ago.\" While she did not like Silva for putting her in this situation, helping the Huntress was the better of the two options in the cheerleader's mind. So, while the two were distracted in their fight for dominance, Fire Ball crept up behind them. At last, the two combatants broke off and adopted opposing stances. Silva was facing Cassie's direction, while the demon had his back to her. The Huntress saw Fire Ball, but said nothing to betray her location. The demon was too full of himself, taunting Silva without noticing his former prey approaching from behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your good human, but I will tickle you senseless! No one has escaped from me before!\" The demon taunted Silva as Cassie was only a few paces away. Quietly, Fire Ball aimed her fingers at the demons exposed midsection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give up and accept your going into the-hahahaah!\" His threat died in his throat as hearty laughs filled the room. It turned out the demon was as much ticklish as the girls. He offered little resistance as Fire Ball continued his assault on his sides and ribs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep tickling him while I open the door!\" Silva took a moment to look for another water trap room. It took a minutes, all the rooms had the same design and same number of doors, but at last she found one with a pool of ticklish water. She beckoned to Fire Ball, \"Help me push in him!\" The demon regained enough resistance to cry out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No-ahah...n..not that!\" The demon had seen plenty of contestants, tough ones too, reduced to a laughing mess when tossed into the enchanted (or cursed, depending on person) water. Cassie, still tickling him, started to push him towards the open door. The demon tried to resist, but his endurance failed him. Fire Ball was able to push him in while Silva held the door open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your coming with me!\" The demon managed to shout while grabbing the Huntress's jacket. The surprised human would have gone if Fire Ball hadn't wrapped her arms around her waist and pulled back. The struggle occurred for a few more seconds, before Silva was able to slip her vest off. The demon tumbled in, and soon his curses were replaced with high pitched squeals. Both girls tumbled back and landed on their rears. Fire Ball moaned as Silva landed on top of her, grinding her bottom into her crotch. The spandex and leather did little to stop the feelings that electrified them. Both of them got back up, Cassie rubbing her sore butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you help me?\" Silva look at her curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you needed help, and I thought you could let me go and help me escape this maze.\" Cassie looked at her pleadingly. \"Please?

Then, she heard a racket in the next room. Looking through the glass window, she was shocked at seeing Sareth being chased by the \"lifeless statues.\" One of them grabbed an arm, then the rest grabbed Sareth and began dragging her to the room. It took a few minutes as Sareth was resisting, but the statues made their way to the door. At the door, one of the statues opened the door while the rest started to bring her inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let go of me you stone brutes!\" Sareth grab the door frame with her hand, allowing herself a few seconds of the statues tugging at her body. One of them finally grabbed her hand and brought her inside. Taking her past Giselle, the statues placed Sareth down on the bed. Her arms and legs were tied with the rope, making the succubus look helpless in a spread eagle position. One of the statues brought Giselle her maid outfit back, which the Frenchwoman put on with much earnest. The statues then left, leaving the two alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you were saying before? That you were going to tickle me?\" Giselle's confidence was brought up at seeing her helpless foe. Swaying over, she picked up one of the tools, a white feather. Unknown to her, it had thrice the tickle power of a normal feather. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad you won't tickle this.\" Turning around, Giselle lifted her dress and shook her panty-covered rear at Sareth. She taunted a few more minutes before coming closer. Sareth put up a brave front, but even she was nervous at being tickled. Her endurance was poor, and now she regretted her skimpy attire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, a red corest...and satin red panties? Such exquisite taste.\" Giselle slowly drew the feather across Sareth's waist, just above the panty line. She bucked and giggled at the feeling. Growing bolder, Giselle brought the feather lower and dabbled it over her panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahah...st..stop!\" Sareth prayed the French Maid didn't get her corset off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.\" Giselle thought, \"Maybe I should...\"</span></div></div>",

Perfection and beauty itself defined the globes, her breasts not slacking in any way, bring firm to Madame Maid's fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These breasts definitely do befit a succubus, Sareth.

Not my breehhehhehheasts! Stahahahahaap it, humaahhahahaan!

Oh well, I do believe I must comply with your wishes, <i>mistress</i>. Tickle tickle! Such ticklish breasts for my feather to dust all over!

All Sareth could do right now was laugh, and laugh she did, not able to think anything other over the sound of her own melodious laughter ringing throughout the room and in her head, egging Giselle to tickle her even more in a cycle of tickling and another round of teasing from the maid. Despite herself, she felt her nipples slowly hardening, moans building up behind her throat. She knew she wouldn't be able to last much longer if this kept up, what little stamina she had getting flushed away quickly by her constant hysterical laughter and struggles.</span></div></div>",

She watched your struggle for a few more minutes, marveling at how your underwear hadn't been destroyed. Finally, she walked and grabbed your arms. She easily pulled you away from the door frame. The invisible force disappears, leaving your black panties to snap into place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pulling you by your panties, how kinky.

She bent forward, her bottom rubbing into Sareth's intruding hand and panty-covered crotch. \"So sensitive.\" The succubus enjoyed this moment. Recovering, Sareth wrapped her left arm around Giselle's waist. Her right hand came up from behind, and held a vice grip on the waistband of the maid's black panties.

Having no equipment, no experience and no protection, Rick is majorly disadvantaged in any matchup, but his ungodly endurance will more than make up for it.</span></div></div>",

Against the two of us?

Never had he tried to process so much so quickly. This was literally his first day, and already he was pushed into the ring, given calm assurances that he'd be a hit and that he would do well regardless. Even when he was told that he was going up against two, he was assured that he'd do great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he didn't know, or at least didn't remember, was that this match was just as much a show as it was a competition. No one was seriously expecting him to win, which was why anything he did would be okay. Besides, gamblers always liked a risky bet with high rewards, so the naive and gullible Rick fit the bill well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least he'd been given the grace of arriving first. They made sure he was at the top of the tower in the center of the massive coliseum long before his opponents entered, so the crowd could get a good look at him. Rick gawked in awe of the massive number of people all cheering (more out of excitement than encouragement) and he was left there in a daze for a minute, but he quickly snapped out of it and thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could see where the enemy team would be coming out of. Perhaps he could catch them off guard? Being outnumbered, no one would expect him to make the first attack. Seemed like a good plan, he thought. Too bad he didn't know there were tools just one floor down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the Succubus and Huntress emerged from their stairs, Rick charged them with a gentle but loud roar as he tumbled into the vested woman's fit body. Fortunately the tower was padded so no serious injury would occur, but with the running force Rick had to at least have knocked the wind out of her. Pressing his advantage, he grabbed the woman's sides, squeezing with as much tact as he could muster in the heat of the moment, hoping to get at least a good start.</span></div></div>",

Even as she giggled on the floor, he could see her getting up and ready to return to the fight. It would take a long time, but if Rick could wear her down then he might be able to make it a one-on-one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was easier said than done, however, as the mean-looking succubus strutted towards him without delay, eyeing him hungrily in a way that made Rick's insides flutter.

Yet from his corner at the top of the tower, there weren't many ways around her, and he wasn't yet aware of the rest of the tower beneath them that he could escape to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing was for sure though: if Rick just simply waited here, he would not have a very good chance of winning at all.

With a cocky smirk Rick glanced back at the Succubus, enjoying the feeling of having caught her off guard again, but this turned out to be his downfall. As he turned  back to face his target, he was surprised to find the Huntress not where he thought she'd be, but rather off a little to the side, where she reached out and grabbed him as he passed and pull him to a straight stop, causing him to lose balance onto one foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wa-wahahaha!\" the Rookie exclaimed, not even able to get out a word before his sides fell prey to the Huntress' fingers. Though they were not many and not particularly intense just yet, Rick's lack of protection of any sort left him vulnerable to even the smallest of attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if that weren't bad enough, the Huntress had been cunning enough to grab him by the upper arm, where she could hold him close on a tight leash. Even as he was hopping about on his socked feet, laughing and giggling musically as his whole body tried to jerk away, he couldn't get out of reach of her deft fingers, which now began to work their way back and forth on his side, feeling out his terrible ribs and super sensitive hips, trying to learn the weak spots of her opponent that she could exploit in whatever way she pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot all was lost! Rick, after having recovered from the shock of the sudden turn of events, brought his own free hand to bear, spinning towards the Huntress and attacking her own side in return, his digits worming as thoroughly as they could into her vest, looking for vulnerabilities. His own hand began to roam, looking for anywhere that had a better reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't trying to overpower her - although that'd be nice - because he knew, exposed as he was, if it came down to a drawn out fight he'd probably lose.

Much like Rick had suspected, the Succubus that was holding him open and vulnerable was anxious to tickle him herself, and so her guard was down even though she was the one holding him. The Huntress was much sharper in that regard, and almost found him out - a moment that set his heart a flutter. Fortunately, the Succubus' impatience got the better of her, and the moment Rick was free he shoved the two women into each other before darting down the stairs and out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind him, he heard the two teammates giggle as they tried to untangle themselves, obviously having some amusement at each others' expense. That worked fine for Rick. While he might've been able to get some good advantages, there was no way he would be able to hold two women down, and the moment even one of them was free he was back to where he started. Better to try to hide and see if he could split them up as they searched for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the plan before he entered the tower proper. Once inside, however, he saw the vast array of tools displayed before him, entire weapon racks and display cases chock full of devices he didn't recognize, although there were some more mundane things strewn about. Even better to hide, but these would also be a great equalizer to give him an advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick ducked behind one weapon rack and quickly looked through what was nearby. He didn't have much time to make a decision, although he would've very much liked to be able to test out each device individually to see the full range of capabilities on them. What drew his eye was a particularly nasty looking crossbow, with a clip on top of its launcher as well as multiple firing modes. He gingerly lifted it off its display, taking a second to investigate before he heard footsteps echo down the stairwell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ducked down beneath the display case from which he'd taken the weapon. This would be a good opportunity to split them up, if he could land a shot.

Lowering her wing to inspect the bolt that had attached itself to it, Sareth raised one eyebrow, questioning its intent. However, as soon as she had realized what Rick had just done, she started walking towards where the bolt had been fired from, a confident smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you really think that would have been enough to stop me, Mr Rookie? I bet you didn't know that us demons have extremely good reflex as well, as well as extremely sensitive receptors. If I listen closely, I can even hear your very breath in this enclosed area. But no matter, since you were so kind to give your location away, its time to end this chase. No more running away, you ticklish boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking on, Sareth casually reached her side, in order to pull the hindrance which had been shot onto her wing. However, as she yanked the projectile out, a feeling of giddiness and lightness overtook her, the sensation of wanting to giggle rising up within her throat. Unknowing to both Rick and Sareth, the bolt which the latter had just yanked out had been one with the effect of 'Laughing Gas' upon it, activating as soon as the victim tried to pull the bolt out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClutching her head and sides with one hand, Sareth's strides slowed down to a crawl as she stood still, quietly snickering to herself as she tried her best to concentrate on finding Rick, failing miserably as the latter also wondered what was going on, hearing the chuckling of the demoness to be extremely strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Silva also strode down the steps, she saw her partner, laughing to herself like a fool in the middle of the room. Assuming the worst case scenario that Rick had already gotten a weapon and attacked Sareth with it, the Huntress ducked behind a glass case as she grabbed the nearest tickle tool she could find, throwing it towards where she had seen something moving in the darkness (which was Rick).<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rick moved back, ducking behind another weapon rack further away, trying to keep his distance from the intimidating inhuman dominatrix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as the Succubus removed that which had struck her, the weapon's effects finally seemed to kick in. With strange abnormal giggling pouring out of her throat (a sound almost as scary as the rest of her), Rick knew that he'd scored a minor victory, although he had no idea just how minor the effect would turn out to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Rick could celebrate, something landed at his feet that caused him to jump, having forgotten about the Huntress' involvement momentarily. It didn't erupt into a ball of ticklish electricity or anything of the sort, however. The small orb instead rolled forward a bit and began quickly emitting a cloud of warm white smoke, sort of like steam but without the humidity. It didn't block sight completely, perhaps being one of the cheaper or less effective models, but it did make it difficult to peer through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a moment was wasted. Rick immediately used the cover of the smoke to run deeper into the tower, moving through rooms without stopping to look, not the seating area by the window nor the large artsy studio that he dashed through. All he was focused on was putting distance between himself and his attackers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was satisfied with the amount of ground covered, he ducked behind another display case in a second weapon room, hiding from sight while looking around for anything that would be immediately useful to him. He had some time to make a plan.</span></div></div>",

After a few seconds of seeing her partner still conscious and giggling to herself, oblivious of the smoke screen that had been laid down around her, the Huntress ascertained that whatever their opponent had activated wasn't that harmful to her, unlike sleeping gas, for example.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her free hand to swipe away as much of the translucent gas as she could, Silva slowly walked towards where she had thrown whatever she had grabbed, not caring for her partner who was still giggling like a lunatic, most of her weight leaning against one side of the wall, a wide silly grin plastered on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her hands carelessly brushed against where she had taken the object which she had thrown, Silva spotted another similar object beside it, this one with a different description. As an idea slowly formed inside her mind, Silva's lips curled into a devilish grin underneath her mask, knowing how she might be able to easily catch her prey once and for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the time to catch his breath as well as slow his furiously beating heart, the Rookie, who was currently in just a few rooms down the corridor, had taken up refuge behind a rather large brief case, the entrance to the room in his full view, where he will be able to spot either of his adversaries coming, the cross-hair's of his crossbow trained on whatever might dare to enter the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a few tortuous minutes passed by, which felt like hours for the nervous Rookie, something finally happened. Eyes wide in alarm, Rick inwardly started to panic again as he saw now white smoke slowly creeping into the room from the outside. However, as soon as he remembered the ball of gas which he had used to his advantage against the Silva and Sareth just now, Rick calmed down a little, knowing that it was harmless. \"Okay, calm down, it doesn't do anything... Whew... The moment she steps into this room, I'll just shoot one bolt, and since she won't see it coming, I'll defintitely nail her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to the naive Rookie, the Huntress casually hid behind the wall on the outside of the room, having thrown the gas grenade inside mere moments ago, hefting another one in her hand. \"This tower is so useful. So much items in order to flush out people in hiding! Harmless smoke grenades, along with these little bad boys, 'Tickling Grenades'! If he thinks they're the same as the ones that got activated before, he's going to be absolutely <i>tickled pink</i> in surprise.\"</span></div></div>",

It was as thin and airy as the gas grenade that had been thrown before, with the same color and texture. The reasonable conclusion one would come to after that previous experience was that whoever was on the other side would wait until the smoke screen got a bit thicker and then use it as cover to enter the room. Although not a perfect barrier, it would make aiming in the steamy smoke rather difficult, so that was what Rick was expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't seem to register with him that, as time passed and the smoke began seeping further into the room, it didn't seem to be getting much thicker. Nor did he notice the second gas grenade that rolled slowly and quietly into the room nearby, the floor blocked from his view by his choice of cover. Not even the quiet vent of more gas alerted him to the impending danger, even as it closed in on him from all sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick waited patiently for the silhouette of either of his female opponents to pass through the open doorway, his trigger finger itchy with suspense. As more time passed and nothing happened, the cloud of smoke began to disperse as it seeped further into the room. Rather than alert the Rookie to its difference from the previous grenade, it only served to make him dismiss the gas altogether, thinking that its used had been up. He didn't realize that the gas was still there and seeping slowly into his lungs, only now without color or substance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until he felt a giggle bubble from within his chest that he realized something was wrong. The phantom assault was slow to begin and wasn't strong enough to overpower him totally, but as Rick waited for anyone to pass through the door he swore he could feel fingers beginning to crawl up and down his ribs, particularly in back where his lungs were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready he began giggling slightly, his grasp on his advanced crossbow becoming infirm and poor. Rick bit his tongue to try to stifle the rising giddiness, but as the sensation continued he found it harder and harder to fight and keep it in. A minute later he began giggling again, and this time wasn't able to stop as he grew louder and louder with time. His grasp on his crossbow was almost completely gone, as he fought with ever fiber of his being to resist the urge to cover himself with his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of footsteps came from the doorway, and Rick realized this might be his last chance to slow them down. If he failed this one, he'd likely be done in for quite a while. With the last ounce of his willpower, he pulled the trigger of his crossbow, shooting a rapid succession of three bolts toward the open doorway before the weapon clattered to the ground.</span></div></div>",

As soon as she heard boyish giggles start to emerge, a smirk crept up on her lips, knowing that the careless Rookie had fallen to her plan to flush him up. Making sure that her face-mask was sufficiently covering her nose and mouth, the Huntress took a large breath of clean air, holding it in as she turned the corner, walking into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, she saw what she was looking for. Hunching over a display case that he had been probably using for cover, Rick was now quietly chuckling to himself as he had one arm wrapped around his ribs, trying to swipe away imaginary hands. Already knowing victory was at hand, Silva let her guard down as she walked towards where Rick was, the male giggling too hard to even attempt to run away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this is too easy...\" Making sure that she was still holding her breath, Silva noticed a small movement to the right of the display. Quickly sidestepping to the right, Silva just barely managed to avoid the barrage of bolts which were Rick's last desperate attempt to stop her from advancing. Smirking inwardly, Silva raised her hand, catching one of the last bolts which Rick had fired, the Rookie's face contorted with a look of panic, disappointment and laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like that's the end. Time to wrap this up and leave.\" However, as the Huntress was about to lower her hand to drop the caught bolt, the tip of the projectile quickly opened up to reveal a feather carefully unfurling. Eyes opening wide in surprise, the Huntress barely had anytime to move as a spring loaded mechanism on the feather carried it forward, the tip of it delicately swiping against the thin fabric of her mask which was covering her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly dropping the bolt, Silva clasped her hands to her face. However, the damage had already been done as the Huntress started to feel the beginnings of a sneeze building up in her lungs, much quicker than the giggles that were building up in Rick's. Finally unable to hold the reflex action any longer, Silva let out a short sneeze, followed by the quick intake of the room's gas-filled air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That bastard... I didn't expect him to have those sort of bolts. Now its only a matter of time before I... Before I... Eeheheheee!\" Chuckling to herself out loud, Silva was already beginning to feel the effects of the Tickle Gas too, the delicate sensation of feathers dusting across the length of her legs already making her knees wobble as she struggled to stand upright, her arms too wrapped around her sides in giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just need to make it there... He's breathed this in longer than me, he's definitely in more giggles than me now!\" Gritting her teeth amidst her girlish giggling, the iron-will of the Huntress quickly took hold, her legs forcing themselves to move towards Rick as she forged on, determined to be the victor.</span></div></div>",

He wasn't going to test them out on himself after all, and the only one he'd seen in action so far was the one he'd happened to use on the Succubus. So far his almost fated fortunate ability to avoid his two opponents on these lower levels of the tower was more reliant on dumb luck than any real plan. The bolts, the smoke grenades, the dice seemed to be landing all sixes for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the bolt that had been grabbed as it ricocheted off the doorway extended its offending feather, that too was nothing more than dumb luck that once again served the Rookie's cause. As the Huntress, so confident and austere a moment ago, began to choke back the sneeze that would spell her giggly doom, the balance again seemed to tip unfavorably toward the wildly under-informed and under-equipped Rookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one thing that did not go Rick's way was the lack of doom the Huntress faced. Yes, she did indeed breathe in the same gas that she subjected him to, and yes she was beginning to giggle reluctantly as she stumbled toward him. Yet stumble forward she did, toward her opponent who was in worse shape than she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Rick's condition, he was currently trying his hardest to maintain a steady grip on his weapon, an effort that was proving fairly fruitless. The tickles on his ribs meant he was giggling and wobbling too much to keep his hands firmly pointed at the Huntress, no matter how hard he tried to regain his wits. While the effect was temporary and already he was beginning to feel the gas' hysteria subside, it would not be in time before the Huntress was on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one thing he could do. Desperately trying to drag the crossbow with him, he too began stumbling, although away from the Huntress deeper into the tower. If he could find a hidden corner to giggle himself free of the gas, he could have another shot at getting the Huntress alone before the Succubus recovered enough to interfere. So far none of the three had submitted, and though Rick's endurance was truly off the charts he did not like his chances were he to be caught by the both of them. Even taking care of one would even the playing field.</span></div></div>",

As she finally got to no more than a few feet in front of the giggling Rick, Silva finally was unable to continue on as well, her legs almost about to give way as her previous snickering and chuckling finally blossomed into full fledged giggling, one hand trying to dust away at imaginary feathers dancing across the length of her legs as she held a display case containing a mysterious staff for support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ticklish sensations continued to build up in his adversary, Rick felt the previously poking and prodding fingers dancing across his ribs start to slow down, their digits decreasing. \"Thank the gods that didn't last too long. I better get out of here while I still can, before the Huntress regains her composure!\" Weakly giggling, he quickly grabbed his crossbow with one hand, turning around as he staggered off into the opposite direction, trying to find another room to get his bearings in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hold it! Pffttt... eehehhahaha! I'm telling you to sto-aahhahahaaa!\" Dropping down to one knee as her body became imbalanced from her constant chuckling, Silva used whatever strength she had left to lunge forward, one hand wrapping around one of the Rookie's ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a persistent Huntress! Let me go!\" Trying to tug his foot out of her grasp, Silva stubbornly refused to let go, even as her giggles became one constant stream pouring out of her mouth from the tickles in her mind. Getting an idea, Rick turned back, bending down. \"If you won't let go, then tickle tickle!\" One hand preoccupied with holding his crossbow, the Rookie let loose a series of pokes into her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready feeling giggling from the effects of the gas, Silva was helpless as she squealed in response to the ticklish sensations, each prod like a current of ticklish electricity. As she tried squirm away, Rick dug a finger into the slightly exposed areas of her underarms, wiggling into the sensitive skin in her hollow. Letting out a burst of ticklish laughter, Silva immediately recoiled away, letting go of Rick's ankle in the process as she wrapped her arms around her sides, tumbling to the ground as her legs kicked the air with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready knowing that this wouldn't last forever, the Rookie moved his feet, stumbling into the next room with his trusty crossbow in one hand.</span></div></div>",

As he fought off the Huntress' dogged pursuit through the tickly gas-filled room, he managed to drag his crossbow and his own sensitive skin through the open door ahead and away from his pursuer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick considered taking advantage of the Huntress' compromising position for a moment, but not only would the gas wear off eventually but the Succubus was no doubt shaking off the effects of her predicament even now. Given that she wasn't exactly human, who knew how the gas would affect her. No, better to keep fighting them one at a time rather than risk running into both at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, an idea occurred to Rick. The moment he was out of sight of the Huntress, who was still giggling and stroking at the tickling sensations erupting in small pockets over her body, Rick clamped his mouth shut and sharply changed direction, taking a ninety-degree angle toward the interior of the tower where the bigger and grander rooms were. However, rather than stake out in these massive offerings, he doubled back again toward where he entered the tower, eventually making it back to the room filled with canvas and paints that he'd passed through to escape the Huntress in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way his line of thinking went, he figured that the Succubus would've seen which way the Huntress went, and as she would wander in that direction hear the Huntress' giggling. That would lead her inevitably through the painter's gallery. Knowing this, he could spring an ambush as she walked through, once again sending her giggling. He could then take the opportunity to pick off one or the other, tickling them to surrender, and making it a fair one-on-one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, there wasn't anywhere that screamed good cover to Rick around the gallery. He did, however, have a good angle of the door from behind one large canvas. So he set up behind it, keeping his crossbow ready and peering out from behind the far edge of it, waiting for the Succubus to come through.</span></div></div>",

Quickly firing off a volley of shots, the Rookie opened his mouth in shock, none of his trap-filled bolts landing on the succubus as she narrowly dodged all of them by mere inches, taking cover behind another large canvas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do know that my sense of hearing and smell is well above those of mortals, right? I could have heard your heavy breathing and giggling from a dozen rooms away.\" Crossbow still aimed at the thin canvas at which Sareth was hiding behind, Rick was sure that he would get the female demon the next time she came out from behind her cover. \"Oh yea, so what? As soon as I nail you with one of these bolts, its game over for the both of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we'll see about that.\" Spying a tin full of paint brushes at one side of the room, Sareth quietly mumbled an incantation as she drew out the magical power within her, granting life to the once lifeless tools. Directing them with one finger, the brushes slowly rose from their holder, floating in mid air as Rick watched, dumbfounded. Gesturing them towards the general location of where the Rookie was, Sareth giggled as her ticklish missiles flew, seeking out their intended target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking at what the demoness was trying to do even in her trapped corner, Rick had no time to react as the brushes got to work, flying across his whole body as they painted with ticklish strokes, each bristles sending the poor male into another bout of giggles.

That canvas doesn't look too thick. If I could just fire a bolt through it, it might hit that devilish succubus!\" With a plan in mind already, Rick shakily aimed his crossbow at the other canvas, taking a blind shot at wherever Sareth might be hiding behind it, hoping to hit at least one part of her body with this bolt.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was such a good plan too. Rick was perfectly hidden from the doorway from which she would enter, the Huntress was preoccupied for a good while, and the it seemed that the crossbow he was using had a large number of uses all of which were highly effective for what he was trying to achieve. Even if it somehow turned out to not be a direct-tickle bolt, no doubt it would cause something else to happen that would tip the scales in his favor again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet for all the good planning, Rick failed to account for the fact that the Succubus Sareth had senses that far exceeded any human's and magic that he didn't know of. So occupied had he been with the Huntress that the Succubus' boast a few rooms earlier had completely slipped his mind, and it would cost him dearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first step in Rick's downfall was when the Succubus sped by without so much as a sweat, knowing exactly where the attacks would be coming from and knowing just how she needed to move to avoid each and every one. Even though her speed was impressive, it was her reflexes to each shot she could hear coming that made it an impossible task to try to hit her, right up until she was blocked from his sight by another canvas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second step was something Rick couldn't have predicted even if he tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cheat-ihi, dahahahammit!\" Rick cried out in protest as he saw the paintbrushes hover out from their hidden pot behind the canvas and fly straight at him like so many ticklish torpedoes, his complaint cut short as the first one struck him right on his wide open and exposed belly. Almost doubling over instantly, Rick's situation only worsened as the rest of the half-dozen paintbrushes danced briskly across his skin, sending him into a mad giggling fit. Vainly he tried to swat as many away as he could with one hand, but each one he batted away offered no respite against the other five, and even the ones he struck returned quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing his imminent vulnerability, Rick gathered what remained of his willpower and focused it into raising the crossbow he held for one last shot. The canvases may have been good obstructions to his vision, but they were too thin to stop anything with even a moderate amount of force. He didn't have the Succubus' senses, but a lucky shot could save him once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, two things doomed his effort to failure. Not only had he forgotten about the Succubus' ability to hear so well, but as he was about to pull the trigger a brush flew up and began painting the underarm that was used to steady the crossbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a laugh, Rick dropped his arm and the trajectory of the shot plummeted, missing where the Succubus had been a moment before. She herself had dashed out from cover at the same time, further avoiding the desperate shot. Defeated, the boy's tickled arms dropped the bow, which resounded on the floor with a loud clatter. It appeared that there was little he could do to outwit his opponents in his current state, and would have to wait and hope his endurance gave him another shot.</span></div></div>",

Still rolling about on the ground in a fit of ticklish laughter, Rick could barely hold his own against the constant dipping and stroking of the un relenting bristles, laughing even more as the succubus sent the last brush back into the fray, playfully swishing against the edges of his naval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I would love to tickle you, but I wonder what happened to my dear partner. You wouldn't happen to know, would you?\" Goosing Rick's sides with her fingers, the Rookie let out a boyish yelp, before buckling back into laughter. \"Oh never mind. I'll just have to go by my ears then. Meanwhile, my lovely toys will keep you company. I wonder if that annoying woman is still laughing. Maybe I can sneak in a few 'accidental' tickles...\" Giggling evilly to herself, Sareth walked towards the door, about to find her partner. \"Try not to move away, would you? I'll just be back in a few minutes. And then I'll <b>really</b> tickle you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving Rick a sly wink as she strutted away, Rick could barely even do anything, tears welling up in the corners of his eyes as the brushes danced across his upper-body, toying around in his ticklish hollows and sensitive sides. Finally after what seemed like an eternity, the brushes slowly stopped stroking as they fell lifelessly back to the floor, rolling and clattering. Huffing and gasping for deep breaths of air, Rick slowly sat up, getting his bearings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that nasty magic wielding demoness comes back with the Huntress...\" Gulping, Rick didn't know how much time had passed since he had been giggling, so he had no way of knowing whether Sareth had been successful in rescuing her partner. Gingerly picking up his crossbow which had been accidentally dropped onto the floor due to him being tickled to tears by the painting tools, Rick quickly tried to think of a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I can hide in one of the nearby rooms... Or should I go deeper into the tower... Maybe I can find more tickle tools or equipment like this amazing crossbow inside...\" As he continued to ponder, the Rookie suddenly heard some sounds coming from the corridor...</span></div></div>",

While not nearly as relentless as either of his opponents would likely turn out to be, the brushes acted teasingly and knowingly as if they had a collective mind of their own. The way they would play with him, making him wiggle and thrash just where they wanted to and always in a way that exposed another part they wanted to play with, it was as if the Succubus' nature had somehow inhabited them for a short while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, though, they began to lose their energy, and as one by one they dropped to the ground with their magic no longer animating them, it became easier and easier for Rick to breathe and recover a little of his lost endurance. It took a bit, but he managed to get himself under control, snatching the last brush weakly trying to tickle his thighs and letting it drop lifeless to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEasing himself back onto his feet, Rick stooped and picked up the crossbow he'd dropped earlier, glad that the Succubus hadn't though to remove his only true companion in this nightmarish two-on-one scenario. After all that the weapon had seen him through, he was beginning to feel more than a little attached to it (even though he did feel a little betrayed after that last showing). He cycled through the settings on it to make sure it was still functional, and even took some time to aim down its sights so that it felt comfortable to him again. With the crossbow back in his grip, he felt a lot more confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was debating with himself whether or not he should double back again or delve deeper into the tower however, Rick heard the telltale footsteps and bickering voices of his opponents grow closer through the long corridors. Desperately looking around for somewhere to hide, he saw a perfect looking shelf of paints (edible, unbeknownst to him).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly he tiptoed over to the shelf, accidentally knocking over some supplies as he did so, before standing in front of the wooden furniture and keeping it between himself and the door. Not only was it sturdier than the flimsy canvas, but it was also something different than what the Succubus had seen him hiding behind before. Any little bit to throw off his opponents. Unfortunately, it didn't give him a good angle of the rest of the room from which he could see and fire from. The best he could do was steady his breathing as much as he could and hope that they'd move on.</span></div></div>",

And if he was found out... His endurance would surely be tested this time by the Huntress and a succubus extremely skilled in the arts of making men scream with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know he's still where I left him? For all we know, he could have ran away into the other rooms already. And my flying brushes won't work unless I am able to see the initial target, so no use finding him with those. See, theres no one here anymore!\" Something catching the corner of her eye, Silva walked over to the paint shelf where Rick was hiding, the Rookie on the other side, praying that the keen Huntress wouldn't have picked up his trail. Kneeling down the knocked-over paint cans as she dipped one finger into the spilt paint, Silva contemplated as Sareth waited impatiently behind her, one foot tapping against the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you quite done playing artist, Huntress? Or did you forget that we have a ticklish male to find.\" Bringing her finger close to her nose, Silva gave it a sniff, quickly connecting the dots. \"Oh, he's close by alright. This paint's still <i>very</i> fresh. In fact, if he's not in one of the other rooms nearby, he could very well be in this room... Judging from the freshness of the  paint, which hasn't dried up...\" Giving the shelf a hard shove, it tilted backwards, paint supplies clattering eerily as the shelf knocked against the wall. \"Hmmm... Not here...\" Unbeknownst to her, the Rookie's hard was beating furiously behind the shelf which she had just knocked, thanking the heavens that it didn't fall completely and expose him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Silva continued to think of the possible things that Rick might do, oblivious to anything else, she didn't notice that Sareth's childlike patience had almost hit it's limit. As she saw a discarded paintbrush on the floor, as well as a can of fresh red paint on a short table, Sareth suddenly had a mischievous idea. Retrieving the tool, Sareth grinned as she dipped the brush into the paint, slowly tip-toeing over to where Silva was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say... Actually, I <i>do</i> know a way to find Rick. Although if you really want to use it is another matter...\" Whipping around, Silva already wanted to know what method her partner had up her sleeves, unaware of the smirk at the corners of Sareth's mouth. \"Really, then what are you waiting for? If it helps us to find him, then by all means, go ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging her shoulders, feigning nonchalance, Sareth walked towards where Silva was. \"Sure, all I have to do is to transcribe a rune of translocation using this brush, and we'll be able to find him.\" Initially for the idea, Silva started to be a little cautious as the succubus suddenly started to unzip the front of her vest, up to where her ribs were. \"W-Wait, I thought you said we just had to write a rune down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes of course. But you see, this spell requires it to be written on someone who is an enemy of the one we are trying to find, so... Try not to move so much, would you?\" As Sareth began to draw a large red spiral onto the Huntress' bare belly, Silva instinctively sucked her tummy in, gritting her teeth against the giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, try to to move so much. If I make a single mistake, we'll have to start over.\" Struggling to nod her head in acknowledgement, Silva braced herself as she felt the bristles glide themselves across her side, belly and ribs. As the brushes dipped into her underarms, she let out a yelp. glancing at the demoness. However, as soon as she saw the grin on Sareth's face, she quickly knew that she had been fooled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Location spell my arse, you're just having fun painting me red! Well, two can play at that game!\" Grabbing a large canvas brush from a bucket of green paint, Silva quickly swiped it across Sareth's belly, sending the succubus into a flurry of giggles from the sudden attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the both of them continued to attack each other with the green and red paint-covered brushes...</span></div></div>",

He achieved quite a bit with his attempts, calming himself to a reasonable heart rate and slowing his shallow breaths to where even he couldn't hear them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that work was undone in an instant as a crashing noise resounded about every corner of the gallery. The Huntress had just knocked over the shelf of paints behind which Rick was hiding, thinking that she'd disproved a hunch she had when nothing emerged. In reality, what had happened that Rick didn't even know the shelf was falling until he opened his eyes and saw it rushing towards him. Like a deer caught in the headlights, there was nothing he could do but drop backwards, landing on his bare bum with nearly a heart attack as his crossbow clattered to the ground beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the noise had ended, Rick's breathing had been pushed completely out of control and his heart rate jumped back up to a mile a minute, and there wouldn't have been enough time for him to wrestle it back down until his body stopped panicking. Fortunately for him, he didn't have to thanks to the Succubus' impatience. Giggling could be heard on the other side of the tilted shelf, and - though still on edge - the Rookie knew what that meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering out delicately from behind the toppled cover, Rick saw the Succubus facing away from him as the Huntress' eyes were closed in fighting off the rising giggles. He saw an opportunity to escape, one he took without hesitation. He reached out to the side and picked up the crossbow he'd dropped, carefully hoisting it in his hands and gingerly stepping along the edge of the room. He made sure to remain well out of vision of the Succubus, and the Succubus made sure that the Huntress couldn't see him as he made his way around the two toward a door that led deeper into the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached the door, relieved and reassured, before quickly and quietly darting away in his socked feet, which made little noise on the floor of the rooms. Even as he dashed away, however, he made another error. The rough treatment of the tilted shelf had spilled many paints onto the floor, and Rick had accidentally stepped in a large puddle with both feet on his way out. While he couldn't feel them through his socks, the impressions they left behind were easy to track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat escaped Rick's attention as he dashed deeper into the tower, keeping his eyes open for an advantageous position or a new tool he could use to his advantage. He didn't want to push his luck, but he felt fairly confident that he could rely on his opponents being distracted long enough to give him some time to look around.</span></div></div>",

He was poring over an entire control panel of switches that was poorly labeled to the point of being illegible, perhaps intentionally. \"I shouldn't be wasting my time here,\" he said aloud, trying to convince himself that it wasn't worth it. He couldn't help but remain, though, enticed by the prospect of laying a trap for his pursuers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to regret this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other reason why Rick was so enticed by the wall panel was because, beyond that, it was just a catwalk. He could see a door at the far end of it, and beneath the catwalk was probably a whole theater's worth of ropes and wires connecting who knew what, but the door was far and the wires were an unreliable escape. So the solo contestant decided to take his chances with the panel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still standing there studying it, trying to make sense of the seemingly illogical symbols marking each lever when the pair of predators rounded the corner and caught him in their sights. Doing a quick double-take, Rick grit his teeth and turned back to the panel, resorting to playing eenie-meenie-miney-mo to make a decision. There wasn't enough time to make a run for it at this point, they were too close and he was too far from the door. So all he could do was pray as he slammed down several different levers, hoping for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA number of things happened at once. Most noticeably, the hall behind Rick began shooting feather darts from the walls in irregular patterns, making it difficult to traverse. The catwalk also retracted, leaving him trapped with the dangerous duo. Then the wires started moving about, some rising and falling while others started tightening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrozen with indecision, Rick just stared down at the wires below. It would mean leaving behind his weapon, which he was loathe to do. But there was nowhere else to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It wasn't as if his way out was a clean catwalk or a simple slide either, he would have to consciously maneuver his way down through the web of dangling ropes and wires, none of which made a simple ladder for him to climb down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention that simply standing here was a hazard, as Rick was promptly reminded as another redirected dart was flung his way, which he narrowly managed to avoid by crouching next to the wall. No, staying here was not a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was with great reluctance that the Rookie dropped his trusty crossbow, which had seen him through so much, and flipped over the lip of the balcony and began to climb down. He hung from the edge for a moment while he found purchase for his feet, which came in the form of a lateral line that his toes just manage to grab. From there, he move his grip to one of the vertical wires, one hand at a time, before wrapping that same wire around his ankle so that he wouldn't just fall. Once there, he started slowly making his way down into the abyss below, not entirely sure where it would lead him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost a minute later, as Rick reached the end of the wire and began transferring to another, he heard from above the sound of a loud clank and, more frighteningly, the absence of the buzzing darts that had filled the hallway mere moments ago. The Huntress must have found the switch that turned off the darts in the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that time was of the essence, Rick sped his descent, making sloppy movements that actually cost him precious seconds in his panic to hurry away.</span></div></div>",

The problem was with the consistency of the wire; it was simply too rough for him to slide down quickly without subjecting his bare skin to an incredibly painful amount of rope-burn. He did move away from simply inching his way down, however, positioning himself so that he could drop hand over hand and use gravity to speed his descent, rather than halt every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom above, the Rookie heard a clattering noise, drawing his attention upward. Moments later he swung himself to the side in order to avoid the crossbow falling rapidly into the abyss below, his heart pounding in his chest as he clutched the swinging rope. Any slower and he would've been brained by it, possibly losing his grip and hurtling after the discarded tool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Who's crazy enough to throw that in after me?</i> he wondered to himself as he sighed a tense breath of relief, dangling from the vertical wire and trying to calm his racing heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis resolve returned quickly. The platform from which he started wasn't too far away, and if the weapon had been thrown from there then someone must be close behind him. He had to start moving again, and quickly, although that was easier said than done on the swinging wire. It felt unstable, as if no grip would be tight enough to keep him from falling. Rather than waste precious time, though, Rick braved the swinging instability to put at least a little more distance between himself and his pursuers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, all too suddenly really, the swinging stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt jolted Rick and caught him completely off guard. His hands slipped from the wire, but thankfully there was lateral rope nearby that caught him as he fell forward, bracing against his chest as he stared into the dark abyss below. With quick reactions, he grabbed onto it and held fast, not wanting to fall and find out how well the safety precautions of the arena were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, his feet didn't fall. He could feel himself hanging from his left leg, his right dangling toward the darkness below. A quick look back revealed that the wire he had wrapped around it to keep from falling had tangled it lightly, making a complete circuit around his ankle that kept him from relying entirely on the one wire for support. It would be simple to dislodge, if not for the other thing he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick's eyes widened as more wires began drifting toward him at an alarming rate. What was going on? It must be his pursuers! Quickly he brought up his right foot to try to kick away some of the encroaching wires, but that did little other than make them swing back and forth, still growing closer. When that didn't work out, he tried to use his right foot to loosen the wire currently wrapped around his left ankle, but in his panic he just couldn't slip his toe in to loosen the loop. By the time it had fit, the wires were already beginning to entwine both his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no!\" he yelled, trying to struggle and break free, only worsening his predicament and endangering his precarious position on the lateral line. His hand slipped again, and his attention suddenly refocused as he grabbed it quickly. By the time he turned back, it was too late: his feet had disappeared in a web of wires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a pair of dainty feet landed gently on the backs of his thighs, nearly weightless.</span></div></div>",

STAHAP!\" Rick laughed loudly as he tried to turn and face the sadistic demoness, his neck struggling to bear the weight of his laughing head while turning. What he saw when he looked up made his stomach sink. Sareth didn't seem to notice, redoubling her efforts to make him laugh, but even as he did that was the least of his worries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later, Rick felt it: the impact of the Huntress, perhaps tripped or distracted, colliding with the two of them already on the ropes. Fortunately it was the Succubus that bore the brunt of the impact, not Rick's poor stretched out back. Still, things weren't looking good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe collision had sent the two women off in different directions, each then interfering with the ropes that held Rick where he was. For a brief moment there was hope, feeling the ropes loosen, but as the women's momentum kept them swinging it became apparent that it wouldn't end well. Because Rick's head was inclined to face down, he couldn't see exactly how it happened, but the result was just the same. Not only had his arms been grabbed and pulled out in front of him, leaving him dangling from ankle and wrist, but the women had been tangled up in their own mess. He could tell because he felt both of them lying on his back, one between his shoulders and the other on his thighs, and with a mess of ropes interspersed among both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great going, girls,\" the Rookie said, rolling his eyes. \"Now we're all stuck here. Should've taken my offer when you had the chance, you demon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnluckily for Rick, and unbeknownst to him, the fact that he was on the bottom of the whole pile meant that he was the load-bearer. If he could shake himself free, then all of them would fall past the ropes. It was obvious from the team's perspective, but poor Rick had yet to find out.</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile, Sareth was testing her own bonds, the male feeling the sensation of the smooth skin of her back lightly bouncing on the back of his legs. Clicking her tongue in annoyance after a few minutes, the succubus laid slack, taunting her partner. \u201cWell good going, huntress. If you had just waited a few more minutes, I would have him squirming in our fingertips.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if someone hadn\u2019t jumped down and waited for me like any sane person would, we wouldn\u2019t be in this mess.\u201d Trying to force her way out with brute strength, Silva only managed to get herself more entangled between the multitudes of ropes. \u201cInstead of blaming me, why don\u2019t you find a way to get us out of here, so we can tickle Mr Jock-strap underneath us?\u201d A shade of red on his cheeks at being called that nickname, Rick merely waited, hoping that a miracle would save him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed a miracle came, in the form of a rather annoyed and bored succubus. As the huntress was distracted with thoughts on extracting herself out of this rather \u2018sticky\u2019 situation, Sareth pulled one of her feet which had been wrapped with ropes towards her without the former\u2019s knowledge, a mischievous smile already on her lips and fingers wiggling in anticipation. \u201cSuch impatience\u2026 Impatient girls must be punished, should they not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yes, impatience is a bad thing but-eehheeheeehee!\u201d Bursting into laughter at the feeling of nails stroking along her naked arches, Silva barely craned her neck to see Sareth, giggling to herself as she laid stroke after stroke upon the huntress\u2019 bare foot. Seeing her partner struggle wildly as she tried to escape in vain, Sareth continued her ministrations, clearly amused by her reactions. \u201cNext time, you\u2019ll leave it to me, won\u2019t you? Or will these poor tootsies suffer for you to be convinced?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot one to take it lying down, the Huntress stretched out, reaching as far as she could with her free hand. Grabbing onto Sareth\u2019s pale sides with an iron-like grip, Silva proceeded to squeeze with vicious abandon to the chagrin of the surprised succubus, who let out feminine laughter of her own, wiggling about on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready feeling the annoyingly ticklish sensation of Silva\u2019s hair lightly dragging across the back of his neck, Rick now had to endure the wiggling and grinding of Sareth\u2019s hips into his own, not making for a comfortable situation at all. What\u2019s worst, it almost seemed like it had a mind of its own as he felt Sareth\u2019s own tail crawl underneath him, now dancing across his bare belly in haphazard strokes.

He had no idea what they did, but he did have the vague idea that they were meant to be used to help him fight the other contestants. From weapon rack to weapon rack he walked, looking at each one and even holding a few to see how they felt. Some were too big, others didn't feel right, and there was one that looked like a lasso that he couldn't even figure out how to use. Good thing there was so many, so Rick could afford to be picky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he eventually settled on was basically a repeater crossbow, except with bolts that seemed to have suction cups rather than points. Looking around on it, he could see that there were multiple buttons, perhaps multiple attack modes that he could use. He didn't know what each did, and he didn't want to try them on himself, but it was good to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his weapon, he began slinking around the tower, stepping quietly in his socks that made little noise on the ground. As he turned the corner in one of the stairwells, he saw a little confrontation going down between the two teams. Good! He didn't want to get involved, but he could at least get things rolling.

Available was another wide variety of tools and devices that he couldn't even guess as to their function. Some of them were more obvious, such as a grenade (or was it a mine?) and a whip (no, that wasn't a whip, it fell apart the moment he picked it up). On second thought, perhaps he should spend some more time examining these things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat plan was put on hold as he heard the announcement from below. There had been a rather noisy kerfuffle coming from the stairwell, what sounded like one of the ladies getting soundly taken care of, but once it was over Rick heard one of the scarier pair announce that she and her partner planned to follow him upstairs. Cursing that he wasn't as sneaky as he'd hoped, he grabbed quickly whatever fit on the belt of his jockstrap (which wasn't much at all) before dashing through the doorway and deeper into the tower, leaving only a pile of strewn devices to show that he'd, in fact, been there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he began to think of a new plan, perhaps laying a trap or attacking them as they moved through a doorway, he noticed in the distant corner of the room he entered another spiral staircase. Out of nowhere, a nearly fully-formed plan popped into his head, and he made a run for it. Sprinting down the stairs, he returned to where the standoff was taking place only moments prior, ready to unfold his plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls of the less scary team were decommissioned, even moreso than Rick had thought. That wasn't good, it meant he had to take on the last two himself without counting on any help from the third party. Still, his plan would work. As soon as exited the stairwell, he dropped what he hoped was a mine in the corner behind the doorway, where they would be walking through but out of sight. He bolted for the other stairwell, the first one he clambered up, and did the same. With the Tigress still laughing on the floor, he used her giggling thrashes to mask a third one he placed beneath her arm. Then, just to be sure he was out of sight, he took cover behind the Witch in her difficult restraints.</span></div></div>",

The tower loomed ahead in the arena's center, many levels tall and quite spacious looking. Charlotte had heard that in each Free-For-All the interior of the tower was changed around and restocked with new tools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom two other gates emerged her competitors. Both were across the arena from her but closer to each other. First was a man wearing only a strap covering his privates, Charlotte had heard his name was Rick. He had a couple recent battles under his belt but was still pretty new. Next came a woman, she could tell by the figure, but as she stood on the opposite side of the arena Charlotte could not tell exactly what she looked like from the distance. It must be Rose, her other competitor. What little information she was provided before the match also told her that the two had interacted a little before. However, she didn't know whether they considered each other enemies or potential team mates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe escape artist decided that her best chance was to go for the halls and rooms of the tower rather than risk it on the mostly  wide open surface of the arena. She ran towards the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",
