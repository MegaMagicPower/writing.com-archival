When Uncle Gohan found you guys he realized this and decided to give you both almost identical names.  You and Goku from a young age were very strong with a power level of 100 for Goku and 150 for you.  the only reason for you being stronger was because you started off at a slightly higher power level and you trained even more than Goku!  The forest nearby, unfortunately, never quite looked the same.  you would always practice in the forest and was taught the Kamehameha earlier.  But one night while you were 8 and while Goku was up in his room, and Uncle Gohan was sleeping, you snuck out to train.  unfortunately there was a full moon.  Goku survived only because while you were a Great Ape, you smashed the house and he turned into a Great Ape too.  Needless to say, Uncle Gohan died.  now you are 12 and looking for 7th Dragon ball so you can wish Uncle Gohan to life.</span></div></div>",

Once you\u2019re there, you see everyone surprised when they spotted you. It was all awkward silence at first before you spot a man wearing an orange and blue fighting uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou! Are you the one named Kakarot?\u201d You asked him while him and everyone looked more surprised when you said that name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, technically, yes. But it\u2019s really Goku. But how did you know that name?\u201d Goku wondered until he figured it out. \u201cWait. Are you a Saiyan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am. I\u2019m (your name).\u201d You introduced yourself as you see Prince Vegeta standing there as well. \u201cI see you\u2019re doing fine yourself, Prince Vegeta.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough with the chatter. Why are you here?\u201d Vegeta wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard of Frieza\u2019s demise being done by Kakarot, or \u201cGoku\u201d, here. I didn\u2019t believe it at first until I overheard the Frieza Force going into a panic for his death. It\u2019s a shame really.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d Goku wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was training day in and day out for a chance at revenge against Frieza for my parents were killed when Planet Vegeta exploded. That opportunity is now out the window.\u201d You said as you looked closely at Goku. \u201cNow I just wanted to face the guy that put that bastard in his place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you want to fight me?\u201d Goku figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you think you can keep up.\u201d You said cocky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then. Let\u2019s go!\u201d Goku said as you two go into battle positions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others watched from the sidelines as you and Goku took your battle stances staring at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome, Goku. Show me what you had to take Frieza down.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d Goku said with confidence as you two charged at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, it was you two throwing punches and kicks at each other. Those years of training really paid off as you\u2019re holding your own against Goku. Few of the others find you pretty good as Goku was finding it hard to land a blow on you. You then caught an opening and landed a good blow to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeems (your name) truly has some talent.\u201d The Namekian named Piccolo said looking on at the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. He gave Goku a good blow right there.\u201d A bald human named Krillin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust be the landed a good blow, doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s special. Don\u2019t get excited just yet.\u201d Vegeta said eyeing on the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotta say, you\u2019re really good with your fighting skills. You\u2019re pushing me back to wall and hardly giving me a an opening to strike.\u201d Goku said excited to fight a strong adversary like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I sure wasn\u2019t lounging around when our planet died. But that was just the warm up.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn that case, how about we crank it up a bit?\u201d Goku suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were confused at first until you felt his energy rise so fast. That was when you saw him transformed. His hair went from black to yellow and his eyes were green. Not to mention he looks a bit bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink you can take me on now?\u201d Goku said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha-What the hell is that supposed to be?!\u201d You asked in shock to see him change into this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a second! Are you telling me you can\u2019t turn into a Super Saiyan? That\u2019s just pathetic.\u201d Vegeta said in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuper Saiyan? So the legends are true?\u201d You said in awe before smirking again. \u201cSo this must be how you were able to beat Frieza. I\u2019ve always sensed a strong Saiyan\u2019s energy so far away, but never knew why until now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be getting excited now you\u2019ve seen me like this.\u201d Goku said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt has caught me by surprise, I\u2019ll give you that. Let\u2019s see what this form\u2019s really made of.\u201d You said going back into the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou charged at Goku to hit him when he sidestepped and landed a punch of his own, one that\u2019s more powerful than it was when he was normal. That Super Saiyan form really did gave Goku a huge boost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were having difficulty holding against the transformed Saiyan as he\u2019s now the one giving you a good beat down. You did managed to hit him, though it didn\u2019t have much affect on him than it did before. After going through that, you\u2019ve finally get why they call this form Super Saiyan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is something else. I bet Frieza was shaking with fear when he first saw this.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe did. Let me tell you, it\u2019s an incredible boost to me. Now I think it\u2019s time to make you a Super Saiyan.\u201d Goku said to your surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe? A Super Saiyan?\u201d You pointed at yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I can tell you have the stuff to do it. You just need to push yourself more.\u201d Goku said as you\u2019re now interested to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you say so. What do I have to do?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need to get really angry.\u201d Goku said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA Super Saiyan is awaken by raw fury. Once you did that, you\u2019ll have a great increase like I did. Try it out.\u201d Goku said as you nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think back at the deaths of your parents and the rest of your species and it definitely gets you emotionally pissed off. You can feel your power rising as this could work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was done,...</span></div></div>",
