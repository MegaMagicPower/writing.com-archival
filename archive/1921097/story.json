These tribes are based on family ties, each boy is born from the roots of a special trees that litter the planet. When a boy is born he is collected by the local tribe and raised as their own, when a boy reaches 16, he returns to a tree and is taken back into nature and a new boy is born.The boys are armed with spears, traps, bows and arrows and hunt in packs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nature of the terrain allows for a variety of predators and prey to live on this world. there exists a small species of rat that stands 1 foot tall and has a tough, almost uneatable meat which the tribes find disgusting. The tribes found that the flesh of boys was much easier to catch, and much better tasting and easier to eat thatn the rat meat, this caused the move to cannibalism in the boy population. Only the tiny boys can eat the rats, they are omnivorous, they eat mostly plants and shrubs on the forest floor, but will eat the rats if they can catch one, they are very fast. The only other top predator is the Jackel's Hawk, a massive flying reptile that catches the small rats and has developed a taste for the flesh of boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach tribe can be told apart by the color of their hair and the age of the boys in the tribe, they are fierce and fearless in their quest for food. they catch their prey with chasing it down, spearing it, shooting it with arrows, setting traps and they cooked their victims over fires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich tribe will you follow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Hair color)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Keith sat in perfect stillness. His perch, on the upper most branches of a large oak, gave him a perfect view of the pond. It was unusual for such a young boy to be the second in command. He was seven, but he\u2019d been born with a natural affinity for the bow. The first time he\u2019d knocked an arrow back and shot, he struck the target dead on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was said that the boy had never missed. Sharp, ash grey eyes studied the calm pond. He didn\u2019t fidget. That iron control was the second reason he\u2019d risen so quickly. Keith might not be able to take one of the older boys in an open fight, but he was patience personified, and boys who crossed him often suffered at a later date for their transgressions.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe underbrush swayed. Keith\u2019s eyes narrowed. His lips twitched into a fierce smile when the large, Black haired boy stepped boldly out into the field. The Blacks were brutish boys, dangerous, but only if one was stupid enough to get within their reach. Their fearless nature also made them stupid. Easy pickings for the Blonds whose long range weapons protected them from the need to engage the Blacks in close combat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith waited until the large boy, one of the largest he\u2019d ever seen, knelt next to the pond and began to drink. Bringing his lips together, Keith gave a shrill whistle. The Black\u2019s head jerked up, and his dark eyes searched for the source of the noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, the right eye exploded. A neatly feathered shaft had bloomed in its place. The large boy lurched to his feet, stumbled, and fell into the water. \u201cChe,\u201d Keith grunted before he shimmied down the tree. The water would ruin the fletching of his arrow. He prided himself on the ability to make a kill without damaging his prized arrows.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeith! Couldn\u2019t you make him fall the other way?\u201d Luke whined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deadpan answer made Luke roll his eyes. He trotted over to the pond and waded in to drag the corpse out. Water sloshed around him, and he couldn\u2019t keep his nose from wrinkling at the wet stink of the Black. With a loud groan, the gangly boy managed to drag their meal onto dry land.  A stone knife, Luke\u2019s prized possession, made short work of the Black\u2019s loin cloth. He gave a low whistle when he got a good look at the boy Keith had managed to bag.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot bad, this one\u2019ll feed us for a week!\u201d Luke crowed as he plunged the knife deep into the midsection of the dead boy. It didn\u2019t take long for him to clean out the carcass, he set the intestines aside. Sam would use those later to create more bow strings for the hunters. When he was finished preparing the body, Daniel and George tied it to a long branch and together the boys carried their prize back to camp.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke and Keith brought up the rear, with Luke carrying the offal. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you carry some of this?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I made the kill.\u201d Keith said fastidiously.  The other boy\u2019s liked to tease him about the fact that he despised handling the body after he\u2019d made a kill. He preferred dealing with it only after it had been cooked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke snorted, but didn\u2019t say anything. He knew his place, and the fact that he couldn\u2019t shoot a bow to save his life guaranteed that the little archer would always be above him in the clan. The brat made well over half the kills, and Luke wasn\u2019t stupid enough to attack the boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, the entire clan feasted. The Black had been very near his returning time, and his thick muscular body insured that all the boys had more than their fill. After they ate as much as they could, there were still several pounds of meat that was smoked for later consumption.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith full bellies, the boys stretched out on the cool grass to sleep.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob woke a few hours later, his bladder full and in need of attention. After he relieved himself, he headed back to camp, only to stop when he heard a muffled whimper. He followed the sound deeper into the woods while keeping a wary eye on the trees above. It wouldn\u2019t do to be captured by one of the Browns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bushes thrashed next to him, but the soft cry of pain assured Jacob that it wasn\u2019t a trap. He pushed the bush aside and stared in surprise at the naked white haired boy. One pale foot had been caught in a Brown snare, and the little boy hadn\u2019t been able to remove it. The child saw him and froze, huge liquid green eyes locked on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear that the boy was newly born. The Blonds had driven the White haired boys out of their territory, and so they weren\u2019t here to gather up this new arrival. Jacob was still almost painfully full from their earlier feast, so he didn\u2019t feel the urge to kill the boy for food. Instead he looked the small one over, pondering what he should do. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tiny, bead black eyes glittered with grim determination. The four man team had been assembled from the smallest of the small boys for one purpose. To strike back at the giants who routinely trapped and killed their kin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGib\u2019s grip slipped, and Niro lurched sharply to the left, trying to catch hold of his comrade before he fell.  Fingers tickled against Niro\u2019s palm, and were gone.  <i>Thump</i>, the sound was soft, unimportant.  It could have been a pine cone dropping, and not a life cut short.  Gib didn\u2019t scream.  Even in death he gave his teammates the best chance they would get by not alerting the Browns of the impending attack.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three continued upward.  They knew when they\u2019d accepted the mission that it was suicide. Even at the risk of death, all four had chosen to accept. They had all lost close friends to the Browns, and it was time to show the large boys that they weren\u2019t going just food.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJalil gritted his teeth and continued the upward climb. They had been chosen for their miniscule size.  Under the cloak of night, the Smalls climbed into forbidden territory.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoud snores drew the tiny boys. Like dark spiders they crept over branches and sleeping boys, hunting for a specific one. Dak bit his tongue hard enough to bleed when one of the boys rolled unexpectedly, pinning him under a heavy arm.  Agony ripped through the Little when his legs snapped under the pressure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark eyes locked on Dak, and he gave a sharp nod.  Blood dripped between his clenched teeth when Niro approached.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo in peace brother.\u201d The words were so faint that only the broken boy heard them.  Dak swallowed and tilted his head back, exposing his throat to Niro\u2019s rose thorn knife.  Niro\u2019s hand reached out and pressed a hand over his friend\u2019s mouth.  The blade plunged down, slashing a fatal line across Dak\u2019s neck.  He continued muffling Dak\u2019s final cries until the body stopped convulsing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJalil gave Dak an approving nod while motioning him towards one of the woven hammocks. Both tiny boys stared at the sleeping Brown for a long time.  The large boy had a scar bisecting his left cheek, one that all the Littles were familiar with.  This boy was the trap maker.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys inched forward, each untied a small pouch form their belts as they climbed stealthily onto the big boy\u2019s chest.  Slow, careful steps lead them up to the Brown\u2019s face and in unison they dumped the dust just under the large boy\u2019s nose.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain shot though Rob\u2019s sleeping mind. He woke with a shout, one hand flailing at his face.  Niro cried out when the hand swatted him right off.  Blood shot eyes opened at the sound, and with a snarl, Rob grabbed Jalil around the middle and squeezed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his dying breath, Jalil cursed the Brown.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurious pain tore into Rob\u2019s head and maddened his senses.  He smashed the Little against the trunk of the tree again and again as wild, unnatural rage pulsed behind his eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dust of the Klawakii Seeds was known to induce temporary madness.  It had taken the Littles seven seasons to gather enough seeds for this one attack.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wounded beast roar, Rob threw the broken body to the side and leapt at the boy sleeping nearest him.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While the other boys had their fancy tools, you just had your wits, your power, and your strength.

He was so cute... so soft... it made your stomach growl! \"What does it look like I'm doing? I'm hunting!\" You smile, leaning forward and giving him a lick along the cheek. \"And I think I've found a lovely little snack right here~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!

They\u2019d been forced out of their ancestral home by the Blonds, and the two Littles they\u2019d managed to catch wouldn\u2019t be enough to feed the tribe.  One of the six horses nickered, and he had to repress the urge to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, the horses were a boon, and they couldn\u2019t throw that advantage away by eating the beasts. They\u2019d come across the horses while fleeing from the relentless assault of the Blonds, and that advantage saved the few members of the tribe that survived.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Littles aren\u2019t enough, not now.  We got to carve out a new homeland, and we can\u2019t be starving while we do it.\u201d   Lee\u2019s voice cut though the chatter of the other boys easily.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can we do?  None of the other tribes live near here, and we can\u2019t go back to the plains, even with the horses.\u201d Richard said as he itched a bug bite on his chest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blood thirsty grin carved itself on Lee\u2019s face. \u201cWe\u2019re going after the Grey.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence met the declaration. No one hunted the Grey, the giant boys were as deadly to the rest of the tribes as they were to the Littles. It just wasn\u2019t the natural order of things. Leaning over, Lee pulled out a long hank of rope that he\u2019d scrounged from the body of a Brown they\u2019d eaten three days back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll use the horses, on horseback, we can outrun the Grey, when he chases us, we\u2019ll lead him into a trap of our own.  Me, Trent, and Allen will be the bait.  We\u2019ll lead the Grey we saw yesterday down the northern trail, to that spot were the trail narrows, Richard and Jack will be waiting.  Pull the rope tight just after we pass and the Grey will go down.  Then we\u2019ll all turn and attack his head.  Our spears are strong enough to pierce a Grey\u2019s eyes, and once he\u2019s blind, he\u2019s ours.\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He chomped the body reflexively, hardly noticing the juicy taste as he stared balefully at Cole\u2019s wide back. Cole was the leader, and had been for the past two years. Bone crunched between his teeth, and the large boy thought about the injustice of that fact. His left ankle twinged with remembered pain, of how the limb had been damaged when Cole took the tribe from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood trickled down his chin, and he growled low in his throat. The only reason Cole hadn\u2019t killed him back then was that Garry was still loyal to Logan, and if Cole had killed him, the large quiet boy would have sought retaliation.  Even though Logan hadn\u2019t won that battle, he\u2019d done enough damage to Cole, that Garry could have destroyed him. Perhaps the only reason that hadn\u2019t happened was Garry\u2019s silent nature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarry was the largest of the boys, and by rights would have been the leader, he simply didn\u2019t have the personality to match his brawn. He\u2019d been born a follower, and Cole knew the danger in killing such a powerful follower\u2019s leader. So Logan had been given a reprieve, and was still strong enough to maintain a grim hold on the second position, but he never forgot that he\u2019d once lead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flexed his ankle, testing its range of movement and bared his teeth in a bloody grin when it moved smoothly. The time had come for him to retake his thrown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bellow, Logan threw himself at Cole\u2019s back. The large boy twisted instantly at the warning sound, and caught Logan\u2019s doubled up fists to the top of his back, instead of the back of his head, like Logan intended. A roar of pain echoed though the plains, calling the rest of the Grey\u2019s in.  Both large boys began grappling, huge fists slammed into each other as they fought a nasty battle for supremacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n None of the other tribe members interfered, instead they watched, hooting and shouting for their preferred leader as saliva filled their mouths. This battle wouldn\u2019t end in a draw, they knew, tonight the tribe would feast. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The momentum came to a bone jarring halt with Cole on top. His massive, meaty fist slammed repeatedly into Logan\u2019s face. With a furious roar, Logan\u2019s left hand closed around one of the unbroken trees. He grunted in a mix of pain and strain as he tore the trunk free. He slammed Cole\u2019s head with the impromptu club with enough force that the tree shattered, driving the large boy off his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood gushed into Cole\u2019s eyes, blinding him and staining the ground below them in a wash of crimson. Logan took advantage of Cole\u2019s sunned state, and body slammed him into the ground. His massive foot came down like a bolt of lightning, shattering ribs with the force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole screamed, agony tore through him, and with it fear. The wound was a devastating one. He could feel his breath become strained as shards of bone pressed with lethal force against his left lung. He refused to be overthrown so easily. It was no longer a fight to maintain his position as the Leader of the Grey tribe. Now, it was simply to take the bastard down with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering the last of his strength, Cole struck in a final deadly rush. The massive boys came together in savage embrace. The sound of their collision rolled over the land like captive thunder. Cole\u2019s teeth came down, aiming for the tender flesh of Logan\u2019s neck. The challenger jerked to the side to avoid the bite, but didn\u2019t escape unscathed. Teeth locked into the thick muscle of his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan grunted, and slammed his fist into the side of Cole\u2019s head but the other boy refused to let go. He held on with grim determination, teeth gnawing at the flesh in impotent fury. With a snarl, Logan brought his hands up and drove his thumbs into Cole\u2019s eyes, popping the orbs with terrible ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teeth ripped free of Logan\u2019s flesh when Cole reared back. He crashed to the ground and squealed in mindless agony. The fight come to an end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike piranha scenting blood in the water, the tribe fell on the screaming boy.  Garry reached Cole first, and without preamble he grabbed the wailing boy\u2019s left leg and twisted. The shrieks intensified to an ear splitting pitch that was accented by the sound of shattering bone. Satisfaction colored Garry\u2019s broad face as he tore the leg free at the knee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil and Miles both took hold of Cole\u2019s arms, and played a vicious game of tug of war. A wet tearing sound marked the end of the game as the left arm gave under the pressure. Cole\u2019s screams were diminishing as blood gushed from the wounds. Before he breathed his last, Logan knelt beside him. His strong fingers began to dig into the tender flesh just under the dying boy\u2019s ribcage. Slowly, it gave way under his sharp nails. A savage grin blazed across Logan\u2019s face as his hand plunged into Cole\u2019s still living flesh, digging, searching, and finding his goal. His massive fingers closed over the still throbbing heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark satisfaction sang through his blood when he pulled the organ free. Logan held the heart above his head and gave a victorious battle cry. The rest of the tribe stopped their frenzied feasting to echo the call. Logan brought the heart to his lips and sank his teeth deeply into the ripe flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feast continued deep into the night as the huge boys gorged on the flesh of one of their own. It was rare to feel truly full, a regular boy was little more than a snack, so a feast like this was enjoyed by all. Blood, like gaudy paint, decorated the faces, arms and chests of the gathered boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that his hunger had been fulfilled, a new hunger kindled, sparked by the battle. Logan\u2019s smoldering gaze fell on Garry, and the other boy read the heated message in them. Without a word, Logan stood and headed away from the feast, deeper into the dark night. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
