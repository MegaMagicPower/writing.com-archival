This will allow you to hide your presence and move to where ever you want unnoticed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright, I guess I'll give it a shot then.\" Inumuta stated as he began to slip the uniform on over his tank-top and shorts.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The activation phrase is still the same, just stand over there and give it a go.\" Iori pointed over at a square on the lab floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With that Inumuta began the activation sequence for the Regalia. \"Three Star Goku Uniform. Probe Regalia, Mark II!\" Inumuta felt the goku uniform envelop him in data, displaying every view around him, though one minor detail seemed off to him. \"You said you updated the OS from Windows Vista, right?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, what about it?\" <br>\r\n\"What did you update it to?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Windows 8, why?\"<br>\r\nWith that Inumuta's eyes widened in horror, realizing the grievous mistake Iori made in his choice of software as a warning message came up stating \"A Critical Error Has Occured.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh Sh---- \" and in a flash of blue light Inumuta was no longer in the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere...<br>\r\n\"-it.\" Looking around Inumuta realized the Goku uniform had shorted out, and reverted back to its dormant state, in that same moment he realized that he was no longer in the lab, but more importantly he was about 2 and a half inches tall.<br>\r\nThough it appeared he was still in Honnouji Academy, it seemed as though he might still be in as he was standing on... </span></div></div>",

As usual Ryuko was getting ready to take her evening shower before bed. Mataro being a clever kid knew exactly how to play his move, cracking the door open slightly, making a slight noise, and activated the watch quickly shrinking to 3 inches tall. Not even a minute later, the door opened and a fist punched at where his head would have been at normal height. As Ryuko looks around confused as to what could have disturbed her as she conducted her evening routine, Mataro ran into the bathroom, passing Ryuko's feet on the way, and hiding under the the sink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ryuko closed the door and went back to..... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
