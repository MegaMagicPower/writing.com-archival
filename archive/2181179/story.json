This will allow you to hide your presence and move to where ever you want unnoticed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright, I guess I'll give it a shot then.\" Inumuta stated as he began to slip the uniform on over his tank-top and shorts.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The activation phrase is still the same, just stand over there and give it a go.\" Iori pointed over at a square on the lab floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With that Inumuta began the activation sequence for the Regalia. \"Three Star Goku Uniform.

Her eyes not showing any recognition of the genius hacker as she slowly raised a fork, looking unwilling to move.<br>\r\n\"What... is this?\" Inumuta stumbled, his brain crackling into attention as a giant Mako appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMako happily slapped her friends back a few times,<br>\r\n\"What's the matter Ryuko? Not hungry? I can help!\" She smiled, licking her lips. Both girls unaware of the panicing tiny starting to struggle through what he realised to be Ryuko's food.<br>\r\n\"N-no- it's fine...\" Ryuko sighed, holding her breath- shutting her eyes and plunging her fork in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInumuta constantly tried to activate his Goku suit, to bring up screens, to fly, to do anything but it was met with failure as he ran.<br>\r\n\"This is not- happeneing\" He grumbled, rushing to get through the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis focus on his suit and escaping almost cost him dearly as a fork suddenly plunged into the 'meat' in the distance. He skidded to a stop, looking up as a knife came towards him. Eyes running wild, he dove out of the way just in time as the oblivious girl cut a chunk out of the food. The tiny Inumuta shivered as he watched it quickly vanish into the sky- getting jammed into Ryuko's mouth. Her eyes screwed closed, the loud chatter around the table, the fact that she was trying to swallow the gross concoction down as fast as possible, all of these factors screamed the obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he dodged the wrong way, he would currently be in that glob of food she was currently forcing down her throat. Ryuko's grossed out face and sickly looking expression showing that she isn't even enjoying the meal.<br>\r\n\"I refuse to die such a pointless-\" He stuttered, a glob of something that would barely class as food fell down, pinning himto the plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDowning some water, the giant girl glanced down at her plate.<br>\r\n\"It's not... too bad... I can do this...\" She muttered, cutting another piece off and jamming her fork into it. Her eyes closed again as she lunged forward, taking another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow her, Inumuta was cursing the unaware giant girl with all his might. She had just created a clean path out for him but his body was pinned.<br>\r\n\"Let- me- out!\" He growled, struggling with all his might to push himself out. His back scraped against the plate as he pushed his way out. Constantly glancing up at the giant girl as she looked back with disinterest, slowly getting used to the mystery meat. Her fork slipped into view, almost giving him a heart attack as it crashed near his head- onto an empty section of the plate. He looked at it for a moment, unsure what was going on when the food he was stuck to suddenly started to roll over towards the fork. He barely had the chance to yell before the mass of food rolled ontop of him fully- the fork slipped in under him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMako felt her own stomach growl as she watched Ryuko slowly rolled mystery meat onto her fork with a knife. Mako's own stomach growled unhappily.<br>\r\n\"Mako... you can have the rest if you want\" Ryuko sighed, pushing her plate over. A feeling of disgust washing over her as she watched Mako happily start eating, thanking her between mouthfuls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo-one noticed the struggling arms trying to get leverage on the fork prongs to push itself to freedom. Inumuta's eyes widening as he saw  how high up he was, Ryoko's closed legs in the distance. Fear struck him as he felt himself move closer and closer to the giant girl- the scenery of looking down Ryoko's body slowly becoming blocked out by Ryoko's greased up bottom lip. The previous bites of mystery meat having given it a shine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paniced, pushing himself forward and kicking in one last escape attempt.</span></div></div>",

His arms weakly tried dragging him away from the danger zone before she took a sip of water or licked her lips- he didn't know where he could go, he just knew this wasn't a safe place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body, slightly flattened and slimed up in grease, soon slid from it's resting point, down the lips and onto the moving chin as it mashed up the meal some people called 'food'. His voice failed him as he slid slightly under her chin before gravity took over- yanking him away from the girl and letting his limp body fall.<br>\r\n\"R-Ryuko!\" He croaked out, watching the girl wipe her mouth with the inside of her sleeve as he tumbled. </span></div></div>",

Not even a minute later, the door opened and a fist punched at where his head would have been at normal height. As Ryuko looks around confused as to what could have disturbed her as she conducted her evening routine, Mataro ran into the bathroom, passing Ryuko's feet on the way, and hiding under the the sink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ryuko closed the door and went back to..... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
