You momentarily reflect on last night's drunken shennanigans as you rub a disturbingly large amount of crusty build-up from your deep, brown eyes. You look knowingly to the bed you inhabit and allow a satisfied grin to stretch across your 25 year old face as your vision pans over the brunette twins you seduced like so many others into having sex with you. Their nakedness shows off their radiating hotness rather well. Still, you can't sit around and wait for them to wake. You have an important adventure to go on today and Admiral Svenson wouldn't like it if'n you were late. You kiss them both on their baby-soft cheeks before hastily, but quietly, throwing on your flight-suit and slipping out the door and down to your brand-spankin' new Jetty 8000 hover car.<br>\r\n   LATER:<br>\r\n    you're sitting in the briefing room, sprawled haphazardly in one of the wheeled chairs, spinning around in it playfully and shaving with the aid of a Porto-Mirror. Admiral Svenson is droning on and on in the background, his voice inflamed with a hint of impatience, making it clear he knows, and disapproves of, your lack of full attention. But, who cares?, you think, I'm Jake Mother-fuckin' McDash. I've heard this all before. Still you let little drippets leak in. \"...the planet seems, from what we've gathered with preliminary -blah-balh-blah- Also it shows extemely high levels of carbo-yadda-yadda-Mostly like our own Earth though magnitudes larger. Parker Recommends a lateral-yammer-yammer-and wet vagina...\"You suddenly stop shaving, swivel your chair to a stationary positon facing the admiral and snap to attention, just like the Admiral wnated you to. He glowers at you, bushy white eyebrows forming an angry V as he spits angrily at you. \"DAMMIT, MCDASH! DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING I SAID?\" He is so darn cute when he's angry, you can't help but goad him more.\"Sure, i did, Cheif.\" His face softens and seems to be somewhat relieved.\"You said wet vagina.\" His face reddens anew.\"Sometimes, you really piss me off, McDash.  <br>\r\nWell, I'm not going through any of it again. it's your funeral. i swear if everyone else in the Galaactical Rangers weren't insisting on finding and finding those damned Klungoffs or whatever I'd assign them this mission.\" You just take the buffeting and grin. You're used to it. \"Go to the planet. Chart it. Study and if possible bring back specimens. And for god's sake, if its inhabited by sentients, don't go fucking their emperor's daughter and starting ANOTHER war, alright?\"    <br>\r\nYour eyebrow cocks slyly. \"Wouldn't think of it sir.\"   <br>\r\n   \"Wouldn't think of what?\" a bubbly female voice inquired. You and the admiral turn to see a saucy blonde woman dressed in a silver miniskirt, go-go boots and strappy halter top. Your seasoned eyes trace her voluptous form and appraise her, lingering on her buxom chest. She's hot. A mini-stiffy is fast forming in your cod-piece.\" Nothing, my dear lady.Ahem. This is Science Officer Moona Gemm.\" The admiral's voice drones monotonously. \"She will be joining you on this mission.\" Her full red lips formed into a fetching smile as she sauntered over to greet you.\"Pleased to meet you, Mr. McDash\" She extends a smooth, delicate hand. You take it in your own, squeeze it tightly and bring your mouth to kiss it daintilly.\"Likewise, gorgeous.\" Her cheeks flush. Admiral Svenson rolls his eyes melodramtically. \"Well if everyone is quite done flirting with each other, the launch is about to begin.\" with that you're off. Right after you take a quick potty break.  </span></div></div>",

Her face is wrinkled up in either confusion or frustration. She turns to you scratching her head thoughtfully. \"If the planet we're looking for is like...you know, uncharted and stuff...how are we like supposed to find it?\" Her bulbous breasts push on her tight top, nipples calling for you to play with them with every airy breath. \" I don't know...\" You say as you slide next to her seat. \"But don't worry...\" You put your gloved hand on her shoulder, kneading it comfortingly, \"I'm sure we'll find it...\" She lets out a puff of air; relaxed. \"Yea you're probably right.\" You look into her blue eyes and fix her with your patented smoky stare. She takes the bait, her breaths shorten, her body tenses. A week and a half trying is abou t to finally pay off...You kiss her passionately, wet and sloppy. You sit in the co-pilot's chair and swing her on to your lap, your anxious penis nearly whooping in victory as her slender legs straddle you. Before long, her top is gone and your fingers sing over her dirty pillows. All your senses save touch and taste haze as you writhe with the young science officer. She is equally caught up in the sweaty make-out session. Neither of you notice the turbulence tearing your ship to pieces. Nor do you notice the red strobe lights or the obnoxious warning beeps as you speed toward the uncharted planet of Garganticus 5. But as you roughly ease your throbbing member into her silken panties, Moona moans airily, voice still husky from arousal, \"Ohh no...\" That meant bad news, you had to act fast. \"Look... babe it's better without a condom...I'll pull out...\" \"NO!\" she cries loudly. It wasn't working. Drat. \"NO, Look!\" She points out the window. Where there should be blackness and stars there are clouds and sky. As you pull out of your euphoria the blaring sirens, danger lights and disastrous shaking of the ship set into your thick skull \"WE're gonna crash!!!\" she finally finishes, right before you do. \"Shit.\" you conclude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHERE DOES THE DUO CRASH?</span></div></div>",

Moona however just wraps her arms, and legs around you tightly as she screams and does nothing to help.  The hull is tough but you hear parts rattle, sputter, clang and break as the The Red Hot Chili Pepper,(that's what you called your ship due to it's almost-phallus shape and fiery red hue, and because you like the oldies band with a similiar name) collided with the dense carpet of the giant room.Black smoke billows from your ship but the auto-fire extinquishers are working even as you try and fight through the puffy white aribags that have deployed and filled the ship. Between them and Moona you thought sure you were gonna suffocate. But they deflate within seconds and even the incessant alarms die down and the ship shutters down. \"Fucking shit.\" you breathe as nervous sweat pours from your body.\"You okay\"You ask the quivering babe clinging to you. The frazzled blonde hair falls back from her angelic face. \"Yea.Yea I'm Okay.\" She awkwardly dismounts you and pulls her panties back into place.Sighing and cursing your bad luck you tuck your \"junk\" back into your pants, replace your cod-piece and zip up your suit. You look up to see Moona has pulled her skimpy top back on and decide it time to survey the damage. You inspect the computer console. Much to your surprise it still works,though there is some static at the bottom of the screen and it dims sporadically. You bring up the ship's diagnostics and find to your dismay that the jets are beyond repair, the gyro-stabilizers are off about25 degrees, all your weapons systems, save the minimally effective EMP emitter were busted, and the engine cooling system was running at only 32% efficiency. In short you wouldn't be leaving any time soon. You moved on to checking the radio this also still functioned. it crackled to life reassuringly when you punched the button but as you scanned throuh all the frequencies, you found the signal universally weak. It must've been this huge house, it's thick walls drowning transmissions. Sighing you reset it to homebase's frequency and sent a distress signal anyway and left the radio on in case some miracle occured and they responded. You doubted Admiral Svenson would send help even if you did manage to get the signal out. The scruffy old bastard would probably throw a party instead. You looked up to find Moona staring back at you expectantly. \"It's bad isn't it?\" She asked, pouting. \"Yes. But don't worry Sugar-pants. I've gotten out of worse.\" You crack a smile hoping it will help reassure her. It does. \"Now let's go check our supplies.\" You lead to the back of the ship past your bedrooms and into the cargo hold. it isn't pretty. this must've been where parts caught on fire. Much of your food store lay smoldering cooly before you. You had enough food and water for 2or 3 days depending on how well you both rationed it. Your survival tents had also been incinerated, along with your shovels, sleeping-pods, heavy weapons,several containment cubes, and you realized, eyes widening in terror, your toilet paper and even your large cache of pornographic holocrons. \"NOOOOO!\" You raised your arms to the sky, or Duratanium ceiling, rather, and cried in defeat, scorn and sadness.  But, seeing your mood was once more worrying Moona, you calmed yourself. All was not lost </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yes. You took some slow deep breaths and thought. While it WAS true most of your supplies had been incinerated in this fire, your suit itself was a veritable survival kit in and of itself. It was made of durable Steather, an amalgam of steel and leather. It was nearly impossible to rip or tear, and highly flame resistant.The codpiece was totally impervious to harm. Bullets, fire, ice, hell,you doubted Satan himself could hurt your balls through it. You knocked on it with a grin while you ran through the rest of the suits analysis. The suit as a whole didn't grant invinciblity but its ruggedness would significantly soften the damge from any fall you might take. The knuckles and toes were reinforced and weighted and would add power to any unarmed attacks you might make.The gloves might be very useful.The palm and lower fingers and had rubber grips that would aid in climbing. They also shot out grapples to climb and swing around with. And affixed to the back of each heel there were mini jets. The fuel supply for them was very limited, only enough for one or two short uses, but it was still useful in a bind. Besides your suit though, you thankfully remembered you had, being a boy scout at one time, always remembered to be prepared. As such, you had secured a sampling of supplies in a large footlocker beneath your bed. You went to this now, Moona following silently behind you. You dragged it out and opened it. You retrieved from it an oldfashioned survival  knife (The hollow kind with fish hooks, matches, the nifty compass on the end, etc.), an extra canteen of water, a moderately expansive medkit, multipurpose goggles (they could magnify, use night vison, or darken for bright conditions),2 tiny ear/mic walky-talkies, and last, but not least, 2 light blaster pistols complete with holsters. You strapped the survival knife to your right boot, hung your canteen on your belt,stuck one walky-talkie in your ear and handed the other to Moona who did the same with hers, wore the goggles, and realizing, with slight embarassment, you had nowhere to put the medkit you left it on your bed. The you set about strapping the guns to your belt when Moona interrupted with a tiff.\"Hey! Wait there Mr. Hotshot! What about me! I need a weapon!\" You narrowed your eyes at her. Jake McDash dual wielded. Everyone knew that. Her eyes pleaded with you angrily. Saucily, even. \"Okay,okay.\" You reached around her hips and secured one of the holsters to her belt. Jake McDash also watched out for the ladies, you reminded yourself.\"There you go little lady. Just don't go shooting yourself in the foot.\" Then, you strapped your one to your left side. You thought it looked lonely there, with its partner gone, but it might just have been your imagination.Oh well. Enough of this. it was time to formulate a plan. Thinking of a really good one you voiced it proudly. </span></div></div>",

You decide she does that too much.\"I should go with you...\" She pleads, grabbing your arm. As sweet as her voice sounds, you really don't think that would be a good idea. There could be all manner of giant beastie out there and you don't wanna see such a fox torn to shreds just yet. The ship was still pretty fortified, with the doors locked she'd be relatively safe here. \"No, babe. Stay here. You'll be safe; i have my headset. We'll be in touch. i don'yt know what's out there you'll be safer with the ship.\" Confident you're making the right decision you set out.\"Be sure to contact me if anything happens...\" You say as you step out of the exit hatch.\"Okay.\"her airy voice replies, and then,\"I love you...\" You winced alittle.What? Jeez. One make out session and near-death experience and she was probably already mulling over the idea of marriage.It wasn't that you didn't like her. You did. especially her tongue..but, still it was a little much. Ah, well. A stud was a stud. \"me too.\" You replied coolly as the hatch shut and locked behind you. You took several unsure steps, the  carpeted ground spongy beneath your booted feet. Wherever you were it was menacingly dim and the air was eerily cool. The sky above you was pitch black. But you had seen the sun on your descent and not that much time had passed. You must've been under some variety of furniture. You cautiously unholstered your shiny, silver pistol and clicked your goggles on they automatically adjusted to the brightness or dimness of your enviroment, unless you manually changed it. You didn't. You let the shadowy surrondings brighten themselves and observed. You gasped. You had previously recognized you were small, but now that you stood next to immobile monoliths the feeling of diminutiveness became somehow more real. Several monolithic pairs of women's shoes lay to your right and to your left their was a stack of giant romance novels. You read some of the titles, most written in overly-ornate pink or gold cursive: \"The Pirate's Hands\", \"The Moist Meadow\", and \"Sins of the Mother\". There were a couple more but they faced the other way their off-white pages faced him.Benath the romance novels were some magazines, promising better sex, pretty hairstyles and weight loss.  You couldn't help but smile at the apparent similiarity between earth and wherever you now were. You turned back to see what lay behind the ship but spied only a wall in which several small cracks you suspected weren't there before your crash landing radiated outward. So, you turned back around and saw a few yards before you the beginning of light, what if you were in a cave would've been known as \"the twilight zone\". You cautiously made your way towards it,your ears and eyes hyper-attentive. As you get closer toward the \"exit\" of the darkness, however, you adopt a speedier, almost excited pace. You come out from the shadow of the furniture and now that you're out in the light recognize it as an enormous bed. Suddenly you think you hear movement atop it...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>...Shit!SHIT!\"you continue, repeating and increasing volume for increased emphasis. The GArgantican sky blasts past the windsheild. Chutes of flame start sprouting all over the hull, atmospheric resistance's gift to you...it's valued customer. Moona has herself wrapped air-tight around you in what you're pretty sure is a wrestling move called the \"Sarazenian Muffler\". Every soft, sexy inch of her touches you, which would be all well and good, but you had a ship to crash land and her suffocating submission hold wasn't gonna help anything. You move your arms as best you can and try to guide the steering wheel (which you've covered in a cheesy dice-and-fire print neoprene grip)up to level the ship out, but the turbulence is too great and even using all of your strentgh (which is not too shabby, you assure yourself) you can only pull it up about a centimeter, which does, you guessed it: absolutely nothing. In ebonics: You be fucked. Your eyes widen in speechless terror as the ship heads, nose first, towards a tan stretch of land, the huge, fluffy clouds speed past you and start to thin in an increased frenzy, somehow adding to your already formidable sense of doom. Realizing arm-wrestling the steering wheel would do you no further good, you let it go and surrendered yourself to the fates and knowing the best use for free hands squeezed and groped Moona...to help reassure her, you tell yourself, though you know other wise. You were just appraisng the firmness of her cute ass when you were rudely interrupted by a cacaphonous crash. You heard and felt parts of the ship rattle off and break, and saw the windsheild crack and felt a knot form in your stomach as the ship flipped. You and Moona fell to the ceiling, but true to your heroic nature, you held on tigtly to her and took most of the fall. It hurt but only slightly, your suit was made to take such punishment and minimize it. You didn't have much time to appreciate this before the ship flipped again however and gravity mashed you once more to the floor. The windsheild cracked further and bits of sand, WAY larger than was normal, started to shoot through scratching past you and sifting into openings in your ship. Your heard the siren give one last analog crackle before dying. A vast majority of the controls and related screens did the same. the ship rattled furiously, but diminishingly so. You were coming to a stop. When you finally did you took some time to rattle your head out of panic mode with a few deep breaths...then the airbags ruined it. they blew out full and white, and pressed you and Moona into an even more uncomfortable position then you were already in, which until the very second they did, you would've thought such an act impossible. And, you realized rather furiously the bastards deployed about 12 flips too late. What brand was this thing? You raked your throbbing head but couldn't remember. Whoever it was you were sueing their collective ass off when you got back. Heh. if you got back. While you plotted against the ship's manufacturer's the air-bags let out a fart-ish wheeze and deflated themselves considerately. \"You okay?\" you ask the quivering mass of hotness clinging to you. her head lifts slowly, her frazzled hair falls back and though her eyes still hold a few lingering tears of shock and/or fear, her lips form the familiar smile; the fetching one you took note of upon your meeting. \"Yes. Yes I'm fine...\"With that she awkwardly dismounts you, pulls her panties back into place, smooths her mini-skirt down and scans the cracked floor for something, her top you figure. You leave her to her devices, zip up your uniform, replace your nearly-indestructible codpiece after retrieving it from a small hill of sand on the floor and set about assessing the damage. You look about you.It's a total mess. Miscellaneous panels have fallen from both the ceiling and the floor. Wires, pipes and other innards hang out like alcoholics' beer bellies. One pipe, towards the back of the bridge, is busted open and leaking some dark, crude-looking liquid. It drips noisily to a puddle on the floor, splashing its excess about it wantonly. You silently hope it's oil, and not the septic tank's load. Sighing you turn to the controls. Most lay still, unlit and smoking. Some more aren't still but rattle, humm and spark angrily. The screens offer no more than the controls. Most are just black. Some are cracked completely open, their glass scattered with the sand all over the ship, other's display static and scream at you unintelligibly like electronic ghosts. One, however, flasehes red, boops and warns that the ship is at 14.459% efficiency. \"Swell. Thanks for the good news buddy.\"you mutter. Well, the ship was fucked. You decided to forget appraising it's level of fucked-ness for now and try to get a bearing on  the surronding environs. neither one of you seemed to be having any adverse affects to the air; you concluded it was therefore breathable. That was always nice. You pulled a drag of it in through your nose. It was humid, almost palpabably wet. And it smelled strange...and as you mulled it over it leapt to your head. Salty. It smelled salty. You sought more clues through the windshield but could see only a semmingly endless stretch of sand. Hmmm...sand, wet, salt... could it be? Yes.\"We're at a beach...\"Moona said before you could evne think it. You turned towards her voice. \"Yes...yes we are.\"you agree, slightly angry she cut off your intense detective work. Before you could think another syllable though...a great SOMETHING happened. Ths ship began to rock gently and you became aware of a distant rumbling noise. Both increased it intesity at asteady rate utnil in several seconds, your ship shimmied and shook uncontrollably and the steady booming thuds filled the walls and echoed it menacingly.What was it? An earthquake. or...an alien menace? Either way you had to get ready...</span></div></div>",
