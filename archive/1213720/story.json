Her first Padawan also excelled. She envisioned her to become a great Jedi Knight, and masters when the time arose. She looked forward to the day when she would preside over Fe Sun's ceremony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut tragically, that day never came. just a little over a month after being knighted, Fe Sun was killed by a member of a terriost organization. Shaak-Ti was devestated when she found out, and many a masters would often recount hearing a bit of crying whenever they walked by her quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that day forward, she vowed never to take another Padawan, out of fear that they would end up like Fe Sun. But with the clone wars going on, most of the Masters were off leading the clone troops on various fronts. Many knights also were also off with them, with many of them not coming back. Mace Windu or Yoda would often suggest that she take on another Padawan, just so they could have a master. But still she refused, stating that she wouldn't like to repeat the earlier mistake. But again, with the best wishes of the other masters, they kept pestering her, asking her at least every other day, until she got tired of it and agreed to take one padawan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKi'Fa Ti was like Shaak-Ti, a Togruta. She was just as tall as Shaak, just 2 inches shorter, excluding the horns. Instead of having red skin like her master, She had cerulean blue skin, but with white patches around her eyes also. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be continued...</span></div></div>",

Once the door closes behind her, large mechanical tentacles come out of the table and pull her down onto it spread eagle. She is restrained to the point where moving seems impossible. The droids that brought Aayla in leave once she is tied down, as they leave General Grievous enters the room. Aayla watches him enter in complete fear, wondering what he will do to her now that she is tied down helpless. \" I hear rumors that you have a week spot, Aayla \" he tells her while circling the table. Aayla knows what Grievous is talking about, and is terrified of the torture that awaits her. When Grievous stops he puts his hand onto Aayla's belly, she squirms and tries to break free. Her belly is the most ticklish spot of all, and without a full shirt on her belly is completely helpless. \" Now, Aayla you will tell me everything that your Jedi Council is planing, or you will never leave this place and will be tickled forever \" Grievous tells her. Aayla is in disbelief that the Jedi would leave her here \" There will be a rescue for me any day now \" she says calmly. Grievous shakes his head and says \" Believe what you want, but you will talk \". <br>\r\nAfter that is said Grievous tickles Aayla's belly, \" Ahhaahaaha staahhaahaap that, Ahhaahaaha!!! \" she yells then he exits the room. When the door closes a large lock is heard falling into place, her hope drops at the sound.

An eye pops out of the water and stares at her then goes back underwater. The next thing Aayla sees is multiple tentacles coming from the water, once they are close enough to her skin she feels light tickling. \"Ahahaha stahahahahap that!\" she giggles. When Aayla sees the eye again followed by more tentacles she knew what it was \"No, no, no, no, no, not a Dianoga! Anything but that!\" she thinks to herself. The tentacles start to slide up and around her back, to tickle her sides as the others go right for her belly. Before Aayla knows it the tentacles are everywhere, tickling every tickle spot she has. \"Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Stop, stop, stop, stahahahahahahahahap Ahahahahahahahahahahaha!

Aayla's feet, thighs, belly, sides, and under arms are all tickles mercilessly by the Dianoga's tentacles. After a while of tickling, a smaller tentacle comes out of the water and slides into her belly button. The tentacle wiggles around and scratches the inside of her belly button, digging deeper into it and driving Aayla insane. \"Shahahahahahahahap!!! Ahahahahahahahahahahaha Ahahahahaha pleeeeeeeeaaase!

Famed across known space for their beauty, the majority frequently end up away from their harsh homeworld of Ryloth for any number of reasons. Bonus: Those lekku (head-tails) are at least as sensetive as any set of feet, and a lot bigger in scale! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogrutans? Actually quite similiar to twi'leks, but with horns instead of tails. Red/white skinned, humanoid. Have a close-knit clan-like metality on their home world. Like one big, happy, tickle-fiendish family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Chagrian? These guys have head-tails <i>and </i>horns. Well, the males do at any rate. Whole planet is basically  a giant beach- there's alot of exposed, sensetized skin. Bonus: Can breath underwater. Not particularily helpful, unless you're extremely inventive, but cool nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if you want a regular, well, there are of course no shortage of humans crawling around out there.

The light almost seems to flicker organically in the gloom, despite the still and phosphorescent nature of its source. It glitters on grim walls of polished rock, across racks and trays of ornate tools, over your desk and over the metallic work-table dominating the room, throwing into glossy relief the ominous metal pincers ready to embrace a fresh patient.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wouldn't be long now, you reflect, making up a chart of employee satisfaction for the past several weeks, a task made nigh-impossible by your roiling anticipation. You had an... 'Interview' scheduled in a few minutes, this one with a particularly fascinating customer. It had been a relatively short time since his Excellency had first asked you to improve the attitudes of the courtroom entertainers, but you had quickly come to enjoy the position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot all the courtiers agreed for their part; that one dancer, Lyn Me, had tried obstinately to get you fired, claiming that you were hardly a real torturer. What a primitive and misguided term, that word, though one of the more flattering one's she was prepared to give you after a lengthy session only the two of you were ever to be privy too. Turned out that those prim little feet of hers were unbelievably sensitive despite a lifetime of thumping against dance-floors across the Rim.   <br>\r\n          <br>\r\nRight on schedule, the door hisses open grudgingly and a corpulent, porcine being enters, vibro-axe bobbing on one hefty shoulder. Behind him follows another garmorrean, pushing a comparatively smaller but far more graceful creature. A beautiful twi'lek, all emerald skin and buxom curves, her only garment a length of dark netting wound tightly over her contours, belted haphazardly in an attempt to keep it in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExperienced with the routine by now, the two guards roughly shove her down in a hard chair in front of the desk, two metal bands neatly sliding over her delicate wrists to keep her seated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank-you, G'nort, G'nark. Please go about your business while I talk with Miss Oola.\" You say, bringing up your guest's file as the strongmen shuffle out. Your eye flick from the screen to your captive's pretty face, beauty only enhanced if anything by the angry pout of her full lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank-you for joining me today, Miss Oola.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grumbles something in Rylothian that would have been unpleasant if it were but a decibel louder.        <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then, I'm glad to hear that you're as enthused about this discussion as I am. I hope you don't mind if I get to the point immediately, but I'm sure you'll affirm that you're time is to important for pleasantries. Now, I have been informed that you've been uncooperative with his Excellency. Just going through the motions when you dance, pulling on your chain distractingly-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The collar chafes.\" She grumbles, head swaying to the other side, fleshy lekku bouncing against her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-And getting into conflicts with the other entertainers. I have some more extensive notes on this last issue. You appear to have ...stolen Rystall's dance outfit and filled the interior with feathers, which stood up when she rubbed against them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOola nods unhappily, though you can detect a phantasmic smile as she doubtless recall's the buxom redhead's predicament. You almost smile yourself at the picture of the blue-skinned dancer gyrating in her tight black body-glove, struggling to carry out the motions of a dance while countless little feathers fluttered and stroked against her soft, sensitive skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently she could hardly breath or stand up without giggling, despite managing to dance, which apparently made for a more lively performance for the Bothan delegation. You'll doubtless be pleased to note the his Excellency has edited her contract to include wearing the outfit during all of her performances, but it was still most improper of you.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitch had it coming.\" Oola scowls, lekku swaying. \"She and that slut Jess sabotaged my costume, and it just fell apart in front of the whole court the other day!\" Colour shines in her face at the memory, though you can't tell how much is anger and what measure is humiliation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I've... heard about that. It would explain why you tried a similar trick with her costume soon after as well, only to be caught and tangled in a clothing rack. Where, if I remember...\" You prompt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blush only rises at the memory, and her look slides from angry to forlorn. \"...They tickled me for hours, until I confessed what I was doing, than they sent me here so you could have your <i>fun</i> with me.\" Her hands clench in the restraints and she twists in her seat, giving off a futile gesture of resistance as she at last turns her haughty glare on you. But behind is no small trace of fear, easily discernible to experience eyes. So, it appears that she has heard of your methods and knows what she's in for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no need for that tone. Nonetheless, the other dancers work under contract and expect to be free from interference in their work. His Excellency expects me to punish you, and I'm only so good as my word. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand, gesturing at the table behind her, luxuriantly padded and shaped like a St. Andrew's Cross. Overhead, over a dozen wicked robotic arms mounted on a central hub twitch almost eagerly like they're capable of conscious sadism as the machine powers up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to do this the easy way, or the hard way?\" You ask, resting one hand on the soft surface lightly as the chair releases her. \"It'll be easier if you cooperate.\" You add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill angry but bright enough to realize that she's no where to go and no way to escape the palace, Oola walks over and hesitantly lays down on the table, stretching out her arms to mirror its shape. She flinches when you gently grab one sculpted limb and guide it into a solid metal cylinder that swallows it up past the elbow, eyes squeezing and teeth biting into her lip as your fingers brush against her skin above the elbow. Curious.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSymetrical thick metal restraints slide into place over her calves, before pulling back tightly, stretching her out immobile. She tries a few experimental pulls- everyone does- and like her predecessors, begins to look just a little less cocky when she realizes the complete lack of escapabilty inherent in her situation.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step to the end of the table, where her feet poke out of the silvery devices, only half the ankle visible at most. You're just sliding off one of her crude dance shoes, when you see her tense up out of the corner of your eyes, her own squeezing shut as you partially wriggle the shoe off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see her biting her lip harder, a pinkish glow rising in her face, and you rub the back of the shoe against her foot a few more times than necessary, scarce able to believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's something else.</i> You think. <i>It has to be something else. There's now way anyone could be <b>that</b> ticklish.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carelessly toss the shoe aside after a few more sadistic moments, flicking off its counterpart in half the time, admiring the light-green tone of her pristine soles and the large tones, wiggling back and forth as the cool air assails them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab her big toe and one hand, and are surprised when she veritably screams before getting herself under control, jerking the foot away. Smiling mildly to yourself now, you grab it firmly and force it into a little band of metal attached to the main cylinder, which tightens around the plump appendage and promptly retracts, stretching out her entire sole and immobilizing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you've carefully stockaded the other nine digits, and you look up to see a very worried looking Oola, looking down the length of her trapped body at you, sweat gleaming on her head but resolutely keeping silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou poke the arch of her left foot, lightly, just once, and giggles sputter out of her mouth, seeming to pop out from between her clenched teeth. You prod the paralyzed flesh again, harder, and again and again. Her giggles intensify, and you step it up, fingers of each hand flicking over the matching foot, tickling her ever so lightly. The effects are astonishing.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohahahha dhahahmai! Thathahat tickles! Ahahahahaha!\" She practically screams, body shaking, firm breasts bouncing even under the tight confines of her net costume. Her body shakes as much as physically possible in her restraints, hands twitching and clenching into fists spasmodically. Her lekku jerk back and forth as her head lolls back, laughing freely.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let up after just a few moments, electing to save that spot for a more properly thorough working-over later, and walk over to her midriff instead. She looks up at you, far past merely nervous, shimmying back and forth in a vain attempt at escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStretched out like this, it's obvious just how inadequate her dance outfit it. The thing nearly threatens to slide off her and give you a show at any moment. It scarce hides the swell or her breasts, and the belts at her shapely hips only serve to accentuate them. Two strips of fabric seperate from a paltry loincloth at her groin, small enough that the lines of her smooth pelvis are clearly visible, rising to cover her chests and framing her bellybutton nicely in the process. The hollows of her underarms are fully stretched out and defenceless in this position, of course, and you swear they're calling to you as you plan your next point of attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Although Carth was the only one who had voiced concern upon learning that his leader was really the former lord of the Sith, Revan was still worried that his other comrades might judge him based on a life he didn't even remember. He had to speak to them all separately before he could rest assured that they all still trusted him.<br>\r\nAnd Mission was the one he worried about the most, other than Carth. She was the youngest, even though she didn't like being treated like a kid, and furthermore, her entire homeworld had been blasted into ruins by Darth Malak's flagship. As the Sith Lord who started this war, Revan feared Mission might hold him responsible for what Malak did to Taris, and he wouldn't blame her if she did.<br>\r\nOn the other hand, it wasn't as if Revan remembered much about his former life. Ever since the Jedi wiped his memories, he'd only experienced occasional flashbacks. So far, Revan had stayed true to the light side of the Force, so maybe she would forgive him.<br>\r\nBut \"maybe\" wasn't good enough, so Revan opened the door and walked in. Mission looked up but didn't seem surprised; everyone considered it to be Revan's ship, after all, so no one rebuked him for going where he pleased.<br>\r\nA lump caught in Revan's throat as he looked back and forth between the cute blue twi'lek rogue and his boots. \"Umm... can I talk with you for a minute?\"<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Mission asked, seeing his discomfort and standing up. \"Are you worried about Bastila?\"<br>\r\nBastila... yes, there was another dilemma he would have to deal with. But first things first.<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" he replied hesitantly, \"I wanted to know how you were dealing with... well... me being Revan.\"<br>\r\nMission just rolled her eyes and put a hand on her hip. \"You're still worried about that? Look, I don't care about what Darth Revan did; your memories were erased.\"<br>\r\nRevan turned to look at the bed, the walls, anything so long as he didn't have to look Mission in the eyes and possibly see if she was lying. \"I know, but... but I started this war, and if that hadn't happened, then Taris wouldn't have been destroyed and-\"<br>\r\n\"I don't care about that,\" Mission said giving him a playful punch to try and get him to look at her. \"I was a lost, homeless rogue on Taris. My own brother abandoned me and left me on the most racist world in the Republic. And I probably would've died there if you hadn't shown up. When I look at you, I don't see Revan; I see a friend- no -a brother, and a much better one than my real brother ever was.\"<br>\r\nHer sincerity was undeniable, and Revan couldn't entirely hide a sigh of relief. After such a serious conversation, though, he needed a way to lighten the mood, and he knew just how to do it. \"A brother? Me?\" Revan laughed. \"I'm not sure if you want that. Do you know what brothers do with their little sisters?\"<br>\r\nSurprised and a bit curious, Mission cautiously asked, \"What?\"</span></div></div>",

It took her a moment to realize Revan was using the Force to restrain her. \"Hey, no fair!

Now that's what I'm doing.\"<br>\r\nMission rolled her eyes and tried to glare at him, but Revan could sense that she was having fun; she was just too mature to admit that she enjoyed this childish game.<br>\r\nNow that Mission was adequately restrained, Revan decided to tickle...</span></div></div>",

Skelly wisely hadn't let Hera out of his sight, and keeps a blaster trained on her from across the room. \"Look Skelly, pointing a blaster at someone doesn't help them see you as non threatening\" Hera holds her hands where he can see them, away from her own blaster, knowing Skelly could shoot her at any moment. Skelly nods in agreement to her statement. \"Good point young lady, but since you've lied to me as to why you came here, it's not my trust in question is it?\" Hera was about to answer when Skully looked her over. \" so here's the deal your going to do as I say for now, there's a couple pairs of binders on that shelf next to you, now, pick them up. And walk over to the chair in the next room\" Hera started in disbelief. \"You're going to tie me up? I released you from that cell and this is how you are going to repay me?\" Skelly shakes his head. \" No, you're going to tie yourself up, I'll help when the time is right. Hera couldn't believe this. \"And if I refuse to do that? What are you going to do Skelly? You won't shoot me. You have to noble a heart.\" She stood there defiantly . \"Either do as you're told, or I'll stun you, tie you up and leave you with one of my toys ticking down for company. Your choice.\" Hera could see the seriousness in his eyes. She knew better than press him now. \"Alright Skelly, you win. What do you want me to do?\" He looked at her blue jumpsuit and the blaster on her hip, then back at Hera. \"Lose the blaster belt, your boots and your jumpsuit. Hera did as she was told, and before long she stood before Skelly wearing only her underwear. Skelly pointed with his blaster to the next room after making Hera pick up the binders. She walked in front of him, seeing an old chair in the room that seemed to be bolted to the floor. \"Sit down\" Skelly said and gave her a shove to make her take her seat in the chair. Hera winced from the shove and her backside hitting the chair. \"Ouch, that wasn't needed you know.\" Skelly smiled. \" I know, but it's fun now... \" he tossed her the first set of binders. \"Lock one cuff onto your left ankle, pass the chain around the bar of the chair, then lock the other cuff on your right ankle.\" Hera did as she was told, inspecting the binders as she did so, realizing that they require three sets of codes to unlock and she knew she'd be wearing them until Skelly was done with her. \"Skelly, please, this is insane, you just can't do this, it's illegal, please let me go.\" Skelly shook his head. \"No. Now, since you seem to have a problem keeping your mouth shut, I think we best address that issue next.\" He reached over to a nearby shelf and tossed Hera a roll of tape from it. \" gag yourself, and do a damned good job of it. \" Hers stared at the roll of tape, knowing that once her voice was taken from her, there's no way she could reason with him at all. She was about to object when Skelly pointed the blaster between her eyes. She knew then she had best do as she was told, and tore a strip from the roll, which she pressed down tightly over her lips, and as Skelly indicated with his blaster she was forced to add several more strips, until her face from her chin to just below her nostrils was covered in a skin tight silvery second skin. \"Good girl, now, hands through the back of the chair please.\" Hera hesitated, knowing what Skelly was about to finish her restraints, but did as she was told, and moments later she felt the binders closing around her wrists, locking Hera down tightly. \"Now dear, what to do with you?

Star Wars is full of all kinds of Females, Methods of torture, plus Gadgets to choose from. let your mind run Wil4. don't dwell on just Padme and Leia: there are hundreds of Thousands of Females that you can literally choose from. sure they are the most well known, don't just dwell on them. expand your horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than than, Enjoy the Story!<br>\r\n</td>",
