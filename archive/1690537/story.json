You have very short brown hair, brown eyes and, light brown skin. You stand about 5'9 and 135lbs. And you are half white/half Hispanic. You are down in your basement looking for a pair of jumper cables for your car. You were supposed to meet this really hot girl in another hour to go watch a movie, but your piece of junk on wheels says otherwise. You search thru all the boxes and various junk for about 15 minutes until you discover something under a tarp that catches your attention. You walk over to it and remove the tarp, revealing a weird looking machine that is fitted with a chair and various buttons. It looks as if it hasnt been used for years. You begin to wonder if your parents knew about this. You spot the power cord hanging down the side of the machine and plug it in. Surprisingly the thing powers up and comes to life! You then have a seat and look at the display. Its confusing at first, so you decide what the hell and press a couple of random buttons. You laugh for a moment, you obviously are just really bored now. Suddenly, the machines motor starts to rev and shake. All you can think is, \"Oh shit\" and before you can even move, you disappear in a bright flash, leaving no trace of you behind whatsoever! Now you are going somewhere, which is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n((Remember where ever you end up at, you will automatically be 2cm in height there. Good luck!))</span></div></div>",

As he begins walking, he uses his arms to spread apart the thick carpet fibers, so he can move about easier. His head just barely peaks out above the carpet fibers, allowing him to see in every direction. He looks around at the massive furniture, which seems miles away, he decides to make his way towards the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As he slowly struggles through the thick carpeting, he begins to hear thunderous booms coming from another room behind him. He slowly becomes scared as he turns to see what is making those booming noises. As he turns, he sees his half asleep dad walk into the living room from the hallway. The 6'2\", average built, 44 year old is nothing more than a titan to the tiny 18 year old. He is wearing a white T-shirt and a pair of red plaid PJ pants and is barefoot, the classic dad PJ outfit. As his dad slowly walks into the living room, Chris feels butterflies in his stomach as he realizes the immense danger in his situation. He fully turned to his dad and decided to try to get his attention. He began waving his arms, which blended in with the carpet stems, and screaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAD! DAD I'M DOWN HERE!! I'M DOWN HERE!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Chris' tiny pleas for help went unheard as his massive, unaware dad slowly walked across the living room, casually scanning the room for the remote in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAD! HELP ME! HELP ME!! AAHHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CRUNCH*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As Chris screamed at his giant dad, his smelly, bare sole filled his view. The massive, meaty foot landed on Chris in a casual step, smashing him into the carpet. His dad continued slowly walking to the couch, grabbing the remote from the side table as he proceeded to sit down. He set his feet up and turned on the morning news, unaware that he just stepped on his 18 year old son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course, you could've done that before but your life was far more important than any fetish but without life in the picture, you could be squished and sat on and all sorts of things without dying. You decide to stay near the shoe rack waiting for another pair of shoes to come by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell you were at a school due to the shoe cubby and that it was either class time or before/after school, although you thought it was more likely to be class time due to a girl just taking her shoes and no one else being nearby. Thankfully, you didn't have to wait long as a black-haired girl was running into the building, seemingly right towards you. She stopped one cubby over and quickly took off her shoes, before dropping another pair of shoes right beside you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith not a moment to think, you climbed onto the shoe and hung on to the top. Not a moment later, her foot slid into the shoe and she was off.  You surprisingly held on with little effort, revealing strength was included with your mysterious shrinkage. On the way to her destination, you absently noted in your mind that her feet smelt nice. She ran into a room and started talking a language you didn't understand but you knew what it was, Japanese. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady teacher at the front talked back in an accusatory tone, before sighing and talking in a neutral tone. You assumed the conversation went something along the lines of the girl apologizing for being late, the teacher admonishing her and then telling her to go to her seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to support your argument, your current ride walked through the aisles of seats and finally got to hers at the back. She sat down and put her feet flat on the ground, giving you a chance to hop off, so you did. You looked around and saw 3 options. You could either climb the girl who had just brought you into the room, go to another girl to climb her or go all the way to the front to have some fun with the teacher.</span></div></div>",

You try and squirm free but your stuck. Movement out of the corner of your left eye has you look over. He has stuck his tongue between his lips and it's moving straight for you. The lips hold you in place and the large, wet, pink appendage slams into you. The wetness of his saliva has you stuck to the tongue. His lips open and the tongue retracts back into the mouth with you on it. Once the lips close, casting you into darkness, the tongue presses you into the roof of the mouth. It moves you around like he's sucking on you. The tongue released you to fall into a pool of saliva under the tongue. The boys tongue presses down on you as you hear a gulping sound and the saliva level drops. He had just swallowed the saliva. The tongue pushes under you and rolls you into it center on top of it.

All you remember is that machine going off and you completely blacking out. At least you're still alive anyways. As you observe the enviroment you feel something isnt right. These are the weirdest looking trees growing from the ground. You touch them and realize they are clearly not made of wood. In fact they feel a little flimsy as you can move them around with your body. A few seconds pass and it hits you, These arent trees. these are really big pieces of grass that surround you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap! Im the size of a bug and trapped in a grass lawn!\" You say to yourself! Just then you feel the ground starting to shake beneath your feet a bit. Followed by a heavy hum that seems to gradually grow louder and louder by the second. You decide to get to higher grounds and take a better look at whats going on. You grab onto what looks like a huge white pole and make your way up. The surface is a rigid design so you're able to grab onto it with ease. When you reach the top of the pole you are now above the grass and able to see where you are really at. It is much hotter up here as the sun beats down on you from the clear skys. This place appears to be a vast field that has some patches of sand and small bumps. There are several skyscraper sized poles with flags sticking out from the ground in various spots. Also in the far distance you can spot what appears to be people with golf clubs. If then occurs to you that this must be a golf course. A really big golf course. And the object you are standing on now is actually a golf tee!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man I have to be dreaming.\" You tell yourself. You then hear that loud humming noise again coming from behind you. Looking back, you see that its actually a huge black golf cart coming your way! The sound of its electric motor running was causing the noise. As it nears you fast, You shudder and think its going to run you over but instead the cart stops right beside you. Opening your eyes you notice a massive hand reaching down for the golf tee you're on! Darkness falls upon you fast as the hand clasps around the tee and rips it out of the soil. You feel yourself being lifted and placed inside of a bag. Now trapped in complete darkness, all you can do is hang on until,</span></div></div>",

It was awful but not as bad as what was to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie's socked foot enters the shoe, trapping you inside with it. The humidity that was now growing with awful smell that already existed  made you wish that you just watched TV all day instead of finding that dumb machine. You were being put through torture and tried your best to pound on the side of the foot to get the giantess golfers attention. But this only led to her wiggle or foot to lose her discomfort. Which caused you to become right under her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile in the position of walking out her front door Natalie feel's some sort of very small pebble that lodged itself under her toes. But knowing she was already pressing for time she ignored it and headed for her match that she had setup today. Her agent set up  match with Stacy Prammanasudh. They have met before in a torment that they have done. And both had made a bet that had big winnings for the winner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a while her to make it to the match and you just had to endure the whole ride. Which wasn't that bad in till Natalie arrived on a hot day to her match. The inside of the sneaker grew a smell that could be considered toxic and it didn't help being dripped on by the toes that were above you. A small crowd did come out to watch and two girls greet one another. And the match began, Natalie at first was a bit nervous especially now with have to deal with a pebble in her shoe. But with the grip of her toes tighten around you she actually scores a birdie. Afterwards the match went great it was one her best yet and she had a feeling that the pebble in her shoe was lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus it felt pretty good in there. Stacy was upset the whole game and originally thought she had this in the bag but once it ended. Stacy was forced to admit defeat. At this point you were covered in foot sweat and now just tolerate the terrible smell. Not to say that you don't ant to get away from the smell but you have learned to tolerate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the match Natalie thought about the pebble for a sec and was curious about how it looked like or even if it is a pebble.

Or maybe this is some perverted thing your doing. But we can talk about that later. I just need to put you back in my shoe while I play another round with Stacy.

Suddenly a message tone beeps from her mobile lying on her bed. Sally looks instantly at the phone. She then walks towards it, and I look in terror as Sally's feet are nearing me. I run faster to not be stepped on by those massive bare soles. Sally foot raises over me, and I see the shadow cover me. She then steps down in front of me, and proceeds to walk to the phone. I stand still for a moment, as I had just looked death in the eye. Sally is checking her phone and I am not far away from her, being this close to the bed I can't give up. I start running again, and that is when I hear Sally say something that sends chills down my spine. \"Ew what is that there on the floor? Oh gross! I think it is a bug!\" Sally says looking disgusted at me. I run faster in fear for this giantess ending my life. Sally takes one step towards me and then raises her foot she then smashes the bare foot down on me. Her shadow over me, the smooth bare sole covering my view. Then there is darkness as her foot hits the floor. I am between her toes! Alive! I then climb quickly up her foot, to get her attention. She sees me. \"EW EW EW! this is so gross the insect is on me!\" Sally screams while looking down at me. Sally's other foot then comes down to smear me out on the foot I am standing on. I jump and Sally's other foot kicks me off her foot and I fly to the floor. Sally looks down at me. Her towering view, with her disgusted look in her face, makes me feel insignificant to her. She raises her foot again. \"This time I will get you, little bug. God I hate having you in my room!\" Sally says as her foot steps down on me and smear me to a bloody stain on her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally twist her foot in disgust as she breaks every bone in your body. She then wipes the bloody stain you left on her foot of in her carpet.</span></div></div>",

I put my bag down and take off my jacket. It is weird, there always seems to be someone arriving earlier than me. I take out a chair and sit down. I look through my phone while i wait for someone to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I hear a buzzing sound next to my right ear. it must be a mosquito. I try to smack it with my hand, but I miss. The mosquito flies to my arm and pluck its trunk down my flesh. I squash it finally and it is over, but then i feel dizzy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stand up, needing some fresh air. I walk to the door, but it seems so far away. I bend down on my knees and fall over. WTF did that mosquito do to me? I lie there on the floor feeling the worst I have ever felt. The celling seems so big and the lights so bright. I pass out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wake up probably 5 minutes after, and i sit up. I still feel like shit, but i survived whatever happened to me. I try to concentrate about getting up and stand. My vision is blurry and I dont really know what is happening. I feel the floor shake. I try looking around for what could be making the earth rumble, but my vision is too blurry. I walk to the nearest wall i can seem to see. I still feel the booming from the floor, but ignore it. Then i hear a loud creaking and a voice saying: \"Hallo is anybody there? Hmm I guess I am the first one to arrive.\" I am right here i yell back, but i get no answer. I recognise the voice, it is one of my best friends Josie. She usually is the first one to be at the school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should I do? walk towards Josie and talk to her, or wait here at the wall and find out why she is not responding? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I need to get some help, maybe be taken to a hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk towards the booming, because it must be Josie, maybe she is angry and therefore stomping around. My vision must be really blurry, because it looks like the classroom is much bigger than it is. But why has she not spoken to me yet? maybe she is pranking me, probably noticing my blindness. I seem to see something move in the distance, and then the booming gets louder. It must be Josie playing with me. She probably is going to surprise me, with the stomping and then coming from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk to the booming sounds and the thing i presume is my friend is getting bigger and bigger. i rub my eyes and it seems to help a little. I see the thing in front of me, lifting up and then coming back down. It looks brown and pink. This isn't Josie, this thing has gotten 5 legs...maybe aliens have come to earth! I walk closer to the massive 5-legged beast. It moves towards me and i slowly step back, then i hear the voice again: \"Better do some homework while i still have the peace and quiet.\" The voice sounded like Josie again. This couldn't be! Is she here with that monster in front of me? What is it? I rub my eyes again and it all becomes clearer. I look up. I look at the thing. I almost faint realising what the thing is. I start running immediately, so i wont be crushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look back at my now ginormous friend! THE MOSQUITO SHRUNK ME!!<br>\r\nThe monster i saw was Josie, or to be more correct her foot. I should have stayed at the wall, cause Josie is walking towards me, and at her height i will be a stain under her sandal at any moment. I see a shadow appear over me and I run even faster. I look back and watch as the sole of the sandal is coming down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do i do? Try to dodge the sandal by running to the side or straight ahead?</span></div></div>",

She first looks with pity and then.....disgust, as she says: \"EW EW EW a disgusting bug! GOD I hate insects, at least I will spare the world for this one.

I try and get up, but my body wont let me. I take a moment to breath in and out. I look up at Josie. She is enormous! She twirls her big brown long hair around a finger, sitting there thinking about something. She is wearing a pair of brown sandals, black pants and a blue shirt. She is sitting with her back to me, doing homework on her computer. I have to get her help, there is no one else here, and I am too small to go other places, and if there is anyone i trust its Josie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get back up on my feet. I start walking. At my size a couple of meters is a long distance, and I am beginning to doubt, that I can reach her before my other classmates arrive. Hopefully i wont be trampled down. Walking here on the floor i realise something. I am so small that Josie did not even realise I was on the floor, when she walked in the classroom. I also realise another thing, I am as small as an insect, and might as well be mistaken as one. Now heart rate rises. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question now is, do I reach Josie before my other classmates arrive? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nor <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo they arrive before I get to her? </span></div></div>",

As they all start arriving I dodge giant shoes unaware of me beneath them, and all this time i try running for Josie. I almost get stepped on a couple of times, but I was lucky enough to dodge out of the way. Then I hear the bell ring, and that means everyone must be seated. I run around making sure I am in no ones path, and when everyone sits down and the teacher walks in I stop. I stop to catch my breath. I am not far from Josie's chair, but with everyone else here, maybe there would be someone better to get help from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then a thought enter my head. Its been creeping there since the beginning, but I thought it would be stupid. It is my only chance though, and who says I will ever gro big again? Maybe while trying to get someones attention, I might have some fun. I have a thing for feet and have always loved giantess-porn, so maybe I could explore that now. Maybe just play around a little. But I still need to get help!

I dont think I am going to go to a boy for help, since the girls will probably be gentler with me, and perhaps take care of me, if I go to the right one. I look for those closest to me. I see that next to Josie, Chloe is sitting. The other closest girl would be Sally sitting behind Josie. If I wanted to go a little further there would also be the choice to try getting Zoe's attention. A little further to me is next to Sally. There is also another choice that would be more risky I could go with. I am not sure it would work, but I could try going for my teacher Nellie, when she is walking around the class. She is an adult, and would probably be the best, at dealing with my situation, but probably the hardest getting to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I just have to make a choice, which of these girls will I be trying to get the attention of?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe: Light-brown long hair, flats, black skirt, red shirt with a denim jacket on top. Chloe is a good friend of yours, she can be quite goofy, but usually you enjoy her humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally:long blonde hair, white sneakers, blue jeans, tight grey turtleneck. Sally is really hot, and before you got together with your girlfriend, you had a huge crush on Sally. She can be a little snobby sometimes, but mostly she is really kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe: long curly black hair, flip flops, black jeans, blue and white checkered shirt. Zoe is popular and I dont really know her that well, she seems nice, even though I have never really spoken to her, Oh and she is also really goddamn hot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNellie: shoulder-length brown hair, high heels, black jeans, white shirt with a leather jacket on top. Nellie (my english teacher) is quite good looking for a woman in her early thirties, she always makes our classes fun, compared to some of the other teachers. Nellie freaks out every time there is a bug i the classroom, but she is very sweet otherwise.</span></div></div>",
