He might be small with only 0.3 - 0.8 meters but he can grow and enter many diffrent forms that may or may not be bigger but certanly are more of a danger than he otherwise might be. He mainly falls prey to others but he is a pred add heart which doesn't compliement his nature of kindnes and forgivnes which means that he always digests prey painfully and revives them after he is done aslong as they are intellegent enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<span class=\"cbrown\">Cy</span><span class=\"cdorange\">nd</span><span class=\"corange\">er</span>(Kanjy)(<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/view/28415908/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.furaffinity.net/view/28415908...</a>)<br>\r\nThis kitsune has some tricks up thier sleeves. As she is Night's mate she does the same. Like many of my charakters but she does have a place for someone that uses her. She isn't as forgiving as Night and that can end with someone dead even if intellegent enough. Her magic isn't bad but she knows less but always learns from here mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<span class=\"cbgreen\">Acidbreak</span> (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/view/28738348/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.furaffinity.net/view/28738348...</a>)<br>\r\nThere is the fluffy or scaly dragon. Its which ever you prefer or if its said its like that.<br>\r\nHe normaly only digests and eats willing meals but he sometimes goes for it no matter what.<br>\r\nHe revives who he seems worthy of it if he just hunts. His appetide has no end and his digestion is rather quick and painless most of the time thanks to him bieng a poison/acid/crystal dragon. He also is small but don't think he can't get stuff down or done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<span class=\"clred\">I</span><span class=\"clgrey\">m</span><span class=\"cblack\">a</span> (dragon) (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/view/28970763/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.furaffinity.net/view/28970763...</a>)<br>\r\nThis dragon is no joke. He is as big as Acidbreak but he can eat double what he can. Which is about 4.5 times his own hight. He revives whoever he seems worthy aswell. He digests only painless when directly asked to or if its not the first time that his prey is his prey. He keeps the skull of any of his prey that he digested but only the first he gets aslong as it's not broken. He almost allways digests his prey. And hands of Cynder thats no advice thats an order</span></div></div>",
