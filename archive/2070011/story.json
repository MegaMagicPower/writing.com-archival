            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After learning of his family heritage and having dealt with the threat of Kaguya Ootsutsuki, Naruto decides to take some time to wander the old ruins of the old Uzumaki Mask Shrine in search of some information of his clan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile wandering around the shrine, he looks at the masks, and one sticks out to him. He reaches out to to mask to pick it up. When his hand touches the mask he feels a pull at his chakra and the mask lights up. The room begins to shake, and a hidden door opens. Behind this door, Naruto discovers a staircase to a hidden room. He enters the room and the torches light up to reveal a scroll sitting a top an alter. Naruto goes over to scroll and attempts to open it. The scroll begins to react to his Uzumaki chakra, similar to the mask that lead to the room, and opened. He looks inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWritten in the scroll was a story of how the Uzumaki were a proud and powerful clan. It stated how they had an affinity towards different sealing and other secret techniques, as well has large amounts of chakra and longevity. As Naruto continued to read, it mention how how other clans and villages became jealous of the the Uzumaki and launched an attack on them and the village of Uzushiogakure. This caused many of the clan to go into hiding in fear of being killed due to their lineage. Unfortunately for the Uzumaki, they had a distinct feature with their unique red hair that was often a dead give away. Many tried the Transformation Jutsu, but it was merely an illusion technique that caused concentration and chakra to maintain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all seemed lost, a new jutsu was developed. It was a transformation jutsu of sorts that allowed for a complete physical transformation of the user. It used the some of the sealing techniques of the Uzumaki clan to create special masks. These masks would allow the user to transform into physically a different person, using whatever DNA or Chakra the user used as a base to create the mask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was amazing, after the user put on the mask, their chakra would be drawn to the mask and it would begin to fuse to the wearers face. The mask would then start converting the wearer's chakra to become that of the mask's base. From there it would begin physically changing its wearers body to an exact cellular double of the mask's base. It even copied the chakra (Think of White Zetsu's Substitute Technique). It seemed like a perfect solution, only it came with some problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed once the wearer first puts on the mask, they begin to take on the personality of the mask's base. It is gradual at first, but after a while the user becomes lost in the personality of the mask. They mentally started to become what they wore. It also seemed that the stronger and more influential of the personality of the mask's base, the faster the the change would happen. Unfortunately, many Uzumaki became lost in their new identities and began to forget who they were to prior to the mask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA way to remove the mask was then developed to stave off the change in personality. The Uzumaki found they were able to create a seal tag, that once applied to the forehead of a mask wearer, would reverse the bodies transformation so that way they could remove the masks. For now it seemed like a solution, until a new problem presented itself. There was a time limit to the masks. After three full days the fusion of mask and the wearer would be virtually permanent. It would take the chakra of the strongest of the Uzumaki clan being infused within a seal tag, that could ever remove a mask past the three day mark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Uzumaki found the risk of the masks, out weighted that of the reward. They sealed the knowledge of the jutsu needed to create the masks in the scroll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto finished reading the scroll and was amazed at what he found. Not only did he learn some of his clan's history, he also learned of a new clan jutsu as well. Realizing the risk of leaving such a risky jutsu around, he decides to roll the scroll back up and bring it back to the village. He knew it could be potentially dangerous if it made it into the wrong hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto exits with the shrine and begins to make his way back to village. As he makes his way back he starts to begin thinking of the mask jutsu. He knew of the risks, but thought it couldn't hurt to try and make one mask right? Before he realizes it, he's back in the gate of the village. From there, he heads straight to... </span></div></div>",

Yelling out he would be right there, Naruto ran over to door and opened to find his girlfriend Hinata Hyuga. He and Hinata had been dating for close to a year since the events on the moon with Tonrei Ootsutsuki. Smiling at the sight of her, welcomed her in to his apartment. They enter Naruto's living room and sit down on the couch. \"Hey Hinata, what brings you by? \" asked Naruto. \"Oh, I heard you had returned back from your trip to the Uzumaki Mask Shrine and I wanted to see how it went.\" Said Hinata. Excited about the events of his trip, Naruto began to tell Hinata all about the shrine, the masks, he saw, and the secret room he found. Knowing he could trust Hinata with anything, he then began to tell her of the scroll he found. He mentioned the Uzumaki clan history that was written and of the Mask Clone Transformation Jutsu it contained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say she was in awe, was an understatement. Hinata couldn't believe that such a jutsu existed. \"Do you know if the jutsu works Naruto?\" Asked Hinata. \"Ha! Thats the thing, I don't know. I haven't even created a mask yet. I only got as far as drawing the jutsu array and that's it.\" Said Naruto as he gestured to the array he wrote on the floor. \"I have supposedly have everything set, except for one thing.\" He said. \"What's the last thing you need?\" Asked Hinata curriosly. \"Well I need a piece of DNA, like a strand of hair or something. The only thing is I don't have any, nor do I know who to make one of.\" Said Naruto as be scratched the back of his head in thinking matter. He and Hinata, sat there for a moment thinking about the jutsu. After a moment, Naruto had an idea. \"Hey Hinata, what do you think of...</span></div></div>",

That way we could use it to test the mask creation part of the technique.\" Hinata thought about it for a moment. Make a mask of herself? The idea made her a little nervous. If someone got a hold it, they would be able to make themselves an exact copy of her. The idea of somebody else having access to that, left her feeling slightly vulnerable. Sure they wouldn't necessarily see herself, but it was pretty damn close. Though, as long as the mask was with Naruto, she knew it would be safe. Since they had become more physical in their relationship as of late, Naruto had become the only person to ever see all of her. This created a it was level of trust between two, especially being each others first. It was at this thought that put Hinata at ease. Though she did blush at the thought of Naruto ever using her mask. She was always a bit of a closet perv, and since being with Naruto, she's only become more forward with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto saw a myriad of expressions run across his girlfriend's face when he brought up the thought making a mask based off her. To him it was only a test to see if he could create one, he didn't think it would be a big deal. It wasn't until he saw the look of nervousness on her face that he that he began to rethink his request. Did she think it was weird? Was she self-conscious about it? Lost in his thoughts, he missed the blush appear on face and the look of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was about to say something, when Naruto said...</span></div></div>",

Jiraiya, the Gods bless his pervert memory, had been intransigent on that point: the more complex the seal, the more terrifying the results of a careless mistake would be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, he plucked a blond hair from his head, and lay it on the smooth inside of the empty mask. He could have used chakra as well, but he didn't feel too confident about an accidental activation of the array. What he - no, what they were about to belonged fo the most esoteric brand of sealing he had ever heard. And esoteric was just another word for deadly. With Hinata nearby, caution spoke all the more strongly to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here goes nothing!\" Not too strongly though. Hinata nodded at him, perched on the edge of his bed with her knees tucked under her chin. He grinned at her and winked, relishing in her cute blush, then turned around and channeled chakra in both seal arrays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLights danced and arched across his bedroom, chakra taking its blue, physical form. The air thrummed with saturation... and then it was over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" both shinobi said at the same time, and some of the tension seeped away as they chuckled at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto picked up both masks gingerly, expecting them to be excruciatingly hot, or something. What he touched was however the same, smooth surface as before. He almost groaned in frustration, when Hinata spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's chakra in there. My chakra... and yours too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if summoned, the surface of the first mask - Hinata's - grew warmed, a calm, vast presence, like the sea's, building up under Naruto's fingertips. He recognized it as hers even before je flipped it around amd the beautiful face of his Hinata stared up at him blankly, bluish kanji on her forehead spelling her name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata left the bed and he felt her pressing into his sode as she gulped at the sight of her own face, and then hesitantly picked the other mask from Naruto's band. His own mask, he realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This... this is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure of Hinata's breasts into his side was stirring the other Naruto, and while most of his concentration was delegated to keep the urge under wraps for noe, another part of the blonde remembered his early days as a prankster and his uses of the Orioke no Jutsu. It bad been years, and still he remembered the physical sensations he couldn't really care for at the time. Now though... His manhood grew rock hard as the thoughts mixed and mashed, and if the blush reddening Hinata's face was anything to go by, he was sure she was thinking along similar lines. Probably.</span></div></div>",

The mask in his hands flew onto the bed and the real Hinata followed a moment later, still clutching Naruto's mask, with a surprised help. That turned into a sexual moan as Naruto's weight pressed down on ber, his broad chest squishing her bosom, the tip of his manhood brushing, insistent and demanding, against her lips through layers of clothing she suddenly found constricting and unbearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir lovemaking was intense and wild. Hinata's nails carved crimson lines across his back as he thrust into her for all of his worth and she thrust her hip towards and up to take in more and more of him. Her legs locked around his waist and their eyes met feverishly, blue mirroring into white, as she erupted into her first orgasm. It wasn't the last, for while this kind of intimacy was still a new thing for them, Naruto's Uzumaki's vitality, a life as a jinchuriki and some sexual applications of wind chakra more than made up for relative inexperience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took her, again and again, until she couldn't distinguish up from down, or where she finished and he began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, her wandering hands left his muscles and touched the masks, which had been shoved nearly off the bed by their antics. How long it had been, Hinata didn't know how much time had passed, Naruto's grunts, moans and mumbled words of love blurring together. It wasn't like she didn't think, rather she couldn't, and so ber body moved on her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurging, she took his lips for her own, devouring them, tongue lancing and knotting in a endless duel. Then she pressed her mask, the one she knew was her mask, onto his bemused face, and lowered his on hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she'd been told before she didn't know true ecstasy after making love with Naruto time and time again, she would have probably laughed. Oh, how wrong was she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mask latched on her face like it belonged there, tendrils expanding to wrap around the rest of her head and dig softly into her skin. Naruto's chakra, thundering like an ocean, surge into her, saturating her pathways beyond capacity and when that was reached, it spilled. Her body rocked as every cell of her body reshaped, muscles lengthening, bones strengthening. Her frame thickened and became broader, rippling muscles replacing soft curves and elegant nobility with a scruffier, manlier shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere in the distance, she could hear someone gasp, then moan, then shriek, and the pounding of Naruto's manhood into her slowed, shrunk, and then disappeared. A terrible sense of longing sparked, then abated as pressure unlike any she ever experience built up in her loins, focused and aggressive. At the same time, chakra enveloped ber brain like a cocoon, pouring in more than memories. An alien sense of self was embedded deep into her thoughts and then strengthened by mannerisms, memories and behaviours that she recognized as Naruto's, but not entirely. A second voice spoke up in her head, confusing her for long moments that might as well have been an eternity, as 'Hinata' and 'Naruto' contended supremacy over her mind, coming to a stalemate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would have never been broken if the pressure in her loins wasn't suddenly engulfed by a warm, wet pressure that slowly, painstakingly slowly descended to engulf it to the root. Hinata groaned, but it wasn't her voice she heard. That she heard next, when a sensual, rapt moan reached her ears and ber eyes, which jad remained firmly screwed shut until that moment, flew open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw herself, another Hinata, writhing in her lap stark naked, perspiration giving her pale, bountiful flesh an enticing glisten. The other Hinata's head was tossed back on her nect ,her mouth half open and moaning as her hips moved seemingly of their own accord, grinding up that beautiful body, a body that screamed to be taken, up and down her... cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'Naruto' in Hinata's mind surged forward and took control as a feral growl erupted from Hinata's lips, and his hands, wide and calloused and caring, grabbed full bottocks and kneaded the firm, gravity defying breasts that bounced up and down with every motion. Hinata's hips thrust upwards, falling into a quick, demanding pace, and his efforts were awarded as the walls of the other Hinata's vagina squeezed and clamped down. The 'Naruto' in her roared, and Hinata took the woman's lips for his own, his tongue a spear, and then with a deft motion rolled them over until he was on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Hinata's legs locked around his waist as if to trap him inside her forever and the spikes of pain of her nails across his back threatened to send him over. Hinata persevered, covering the neck of the woman under him with kisses and bites as he thrust into her flooding sex as if his life depended on it. One of his hands found the small of her waist and lifted it: the other Hinata cried out in rapture as he poked her cervix, her sex clamping down impossibly tight as her body rocked and shook as she came. That finally sent him over the top and he exploded into her without stopping, until he ached and she squirmed and the both of them were gasping for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir eyes met feverishly and just a little shocked. Blue reflected into white, then Hinata took her lips as his own for one last time and they collapsed in exhaustion one in the arms of the other, their bodies still joined.</span></div></div>",

A breeze caressed her bare chest, leaving hot marks wherever it touched her bare skin. She tossed her head this way and that, trying to follow it while keeping her eyes closed, but it was like trying to catch the wind with a sieve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeightless, she didn't dare open her eyes, nor activate her Byakugan. Fear gripped her chest that it would all vanish if she did, and the warmth pooling in her belly was unlike anything she'd ever felt. Whatever happened, she didn't want it to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My love,\" the wind whispered, tickling her clit. Burning ice shot up her spine, and 'Hinata' squirmed, too late to bite on her finger to stop her moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breeze slipped further below, leaving a trail of scorching marks on the inside of her thighs. A fire blazed in her belly, quickening the rise and fall of her chest. Her inner muscles clenched and unclenched on nothing as the breeze probed at her outer folds, and 'Hinata' whimpered in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the breeze was burning against her neck, worrying at her earlobe and squishing her down against the clouds. 'Hinata' gasped and her eyes threatened to flutter open as she felt something else probe at her outer labia, like a gale on the verge of blowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm yours, and you're mine,\" the wind breathed into her hear. Then the gale surged on, and 'Hinata's' eye shot open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-</div> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething hot and hard stretched her insides wide, pushing her against the mattress; 'Hinata's' moaned and stared through half-lidded eyes at the tanned, grinning face of her lover, inches away from hers. Large, hooded cerulean eyes stared at her, and musky breaths mixed with her own as his cock pressed deeper between her legs, rubbing against hidden folds that threatened to make her eyes roll into her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNary an inch away from her cervix, his cock stopped and his grin widened. \"Hi there, 'Hinata-chan'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hinata' whimpered between frustration and contentment. As her hips tilted up and pressed further against him on their own volition, a stabbing awareness pierced the haze she was in. Uzu. The masks, and the way Hinata - the real one - looked at them. Their lovemaking, a brief moment of suffocation, and then excruciating bliss when their roles were reversed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her lover with new eyes. Or rather, not-so-old-ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're Hinata,\" Naruto said. \" The masks... how long have we -\" Her words turned into a moan as her doppleganger slid back and then pushed inside her again, harder and deeper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even ten hours,\" 'Naruto' chuckled throatily, picking up the pace slightly. \"It's still dark outside. Don't worry, 'Hinata-chan', we still have plenty of time to enjoy this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe punctuated the last word by pushing home. 'Hinata' moaned out loud and her thoughts turned to mush when 'Naruto' pressed his lips against her, his tongue darting between her teeth and dancing with hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightning flashed behind 'Hinata's' eyes as her lover picked up the pace again. Strands of violet hair flew in front of her face as 'Naruto' tried to hammer her through the bed; as she grabbed fistfuls of the soaked sheets, the small part of her brain still capable of rational thought was grateful for the sound-dampening  and privacy seals her 'Naruto' had lined his apartment with: right now, the last thing she needed was for her father and Neji-kun to see - or hear - what her 'Naruto' was doing to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked, the eerily familiar pressure in her belly and the tremble in her limbs foreshadowing the coming orgasm; it took all of her - <i>his</i> willpower to ignore the bliss and push again his doppleganger's broad shoulders, futile as it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop... stop!\" he gasped, and Hinata slowed down, giving him a quizzical look. \"The memories... they are coming too fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just thought of Neji-kun as my cousin!\" he hissed, slapping a hand against his firm chest. 'Naruto' was still buried almost to the hilt inside on her, and it made thinking clearly a struggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata frowned, moving his hips ever so slightly in a way that made Naruto want to whimper. \"And how do you know that's too fast? The scrolls say that a full merging takes three days. It hasn't been a fraction of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just... do,\" Naruto finished lamely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata cupped Naruto's cheek tenderly and kissed him on his brown, tucking strings of purple hair behind his ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, 'Hinata-chan'. The masks were made to allow the Uzumaki to flee at a moment's notice. It just makes sense that they would give access to some of the memories to establish a quick cover identity.\" A sly grin spread across Hinata's face then, one that made Naruto's stretched insides quiver in anticipation. \"Besides, the scrolls say that the chakra of a powerful Uzumaki can revert the effect even after the three days expire. And it just so happen there's a powerful Uzumaki right here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand on Naruto's cheek started kneading on of the firm, milky breasts on his chest, while the other grabbed his hips as Hinata resumed her previous minstriations. Naruto's protest died on his lips as the breeze from his half-forgotten dream blew against his rock-hard nipples and wrapped around his clit like a hot tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh gods. Yes!</i> \"Faster,\" she whimpered. \"Faster!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hinata' arched her back as 'Naruto' buried himself inside of her at a frenzied pace, clawing at the sheets and at her lover's back in turn. Her ankles locked around his hips, pulling him closer, deeper, her hips begging for more. And more she received.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world went white as her inner muscles tried to crush 'Naruto's' dick inside of her. She heard herself moan, then scream, but just as the wave started to dip, she felt her legs being pushed apart and then up by strong hands. Her knees on her lover's shoulder, she felt her hips and spine arch and fold on itself in way that would have been tortuous for someone without her years of training as a kunoichi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her 'Naruto' started pumping into her again, his hot breath seeping into her and his hands kneading her breasts as his chakra played with her clit. The wrongness of the previous thought melted in 'Hinata's' mind like snow in summer and she reached peaks of pleasure yet unexplored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you, Hinata-chan,\" 'Naruto' said as her moans turned into a scream. Bless him, he never stopped pumping into her, even as her vagina walled-up around him. \"I love you so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you, too,\" she gasped, hugging his neck and kissing him deeply. \"I love you too, Naruto-kun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch later, 'Hinata' lay with her head in the crook of 'Naruto's' neck, her hands roaming lazily and tracing the contours of his firm muscles. He played with her hair and one of her nipples, keeping the embers in her tummy stoked despite the growing exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was... wow,\" he finally said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hinata' nodded, sighing contentedly. If she'd known this was the kind of pleasure a woman could feel, maybe she would have put her Sexy no Jutsu to better use long ago... wouldn't she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked, then yelped as Hinata pinched him slightly in the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Hinata said, grinning cheekily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, we both know you liked that as much as I did! What's bothering you, dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto propped himself up on an elbow, tucking his long hair behind one ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata sighed, then caressed his face, something other than lust shining in her cerulean eyes. \"I'm sorry for springing the mask on you. I thought you wanted it to, but you needed a little push. And I was... curious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About how things are on the other side. How it feels to be you.\" She cupped his cheek; despite his annoyace, Naruto leaned into her touch. \"And I know things haven't been easy for you, lately. Even before you went on your trip. All the responsabilities the Hokage has entrusted upon you, I saw how it was weighting you down. When you told me about the masks, I saw you could use a brief break from yourself.\" She tapped a finger against her temple. \"And now I know you could definitely use one. Being Clan heir isn't nearly as much as a burden as being the future Hokage.\" She shrugged, and her smile dimmed a tad. \"Besides, your father runs everything like a well-oiled machine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gave her a flat stare, letting that last comment slip. Inside, however, he was torn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the sex has nothing to do with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata grin widened again. Naruto felt her manhood stiffen again. He swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's one hell of an unexpected bonus, don't you think, 'Hinata-chan'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata -\" Naruto sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed creaked and squeaked. Quick like a shinobi, Hinata was at the bathroom door, beckoning him on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Naruto  gingerly tested that his legs would hold his weight after the night's maraton, earning a chuckle from Hinata. He shot her a dark look as she disappeared into the bathroom. Resigned, he followed her, keenly aware of how his hips swayed, the weight of his breasts, and the pleasant soreness between is legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto joined Hinata in front of the mirror, and paused. The polished glass reflected the flushed face of Hinata back at him, her luscious body in full display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who do you see in the mirror, 'Hinata-chan'?\" Hinata asked, her voice distant.</span></div></div>",

She could copy any one in village and use it however she desired. The more she thought of it the more one person stood out. That person was Sakura Haruno. She was the object of Naruto's affection for so much during his childhood and early teenage years. He loved her, but she never saw him that way. After being teammates for so long he eventually settled on being good friends, knowing of her love for Sasuke. While her and Sakura had now become friends, how she treated Naruto growing up, was something Hinata could never forget. It was there her idea formed. With this mask jutsu, she was going to make Naruto's teenage fantasy come true and give him a night he would never forget! She looked at him and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Naruto,\" she tried to say as calm as possible to hide her growing lust, \"How about we make one of Sakura?\" This took Naruto by surprise. He knew that Hinata knew of his childhood crush on Sakura. It was something he had gotten over, especially since finding Hinata and realizing the love they shared for each other. He knew that Sakura was sometimes a tender subject with Hinata. She was getting better, but was sometimes self-conscious and would compare herself to Sakura since she caught so much of Naruto's attention growing up. Not wanting to make her feel that, Naruto says, \"Hinata, we don't have to pick Sakura, we can..\" but Hinata interjected. She had a feeling Naruto might try to be a gentleman and decline, so she had to act fast to put her plan in action. \"No Naruto, I want to. She is someone I admire for her strength, courage, and we have become really good friends as of late. I know you have you have your history as teammates, but if there was anyone I'd like to be for day, it would be her.\" Hinata said with conviction. Taken back by the determination in Hinata's voice, his face softened and he looked at her said, \"Alright then, well just know that any mask you wear, you always be the beautiful, amazing Hinata Hyuga that I fell in love with, and she is the one I will always love.\" Hinata started to tear up a bit. It was there she knew that she could use any mask with her Naruto and not compromise any part of her relationship. This settled it, the love he showed her coupled with her growing lust, she was more determined than ever. She ran over and hugged him tightly, then kissed him. \"So how should we go about this then? We are going to need a piece of hair or something to make the mask.\" said Naruto not knowing Hinata's true intentions of crafting the Sakura mask. \"You leave that to me Naruto, I have a plan..\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She gave him one more kiss, but this one was a bit deeper, and said \"You wait here Naruto, and relax.You had a long trip and only just got back. Take a nap and I'll be back later tonight with what we need.\" Naruto didn't know what had gotten into Hinata, maybe it was what he said before, but he sure wasn't complaining. He streched a bit and yawned, \"Alright Hinata, I'll leave it to you. I'll see you later tonight.\" he said as he kissed her one more time. \"Love you.\" he said with a smile. With a big smile, Hinata replied, \"Love you too Naruto.\" They hugged on more time before Hinata left and Naruto laid down on his counch for a well deserved, and a much needed nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata, ran over to Sakura's house hoping to catch the girl. Unfortunately when she got there, she found the home to be empty. Cursing her luck, she tried the hospital. When she got there she went the front desk and asked for Sakura. She was told she was clocking off from her shift and would be down in a moment. After a few minutes Sakura came out of the double doors and noticed Hinata. \"Hey Hinata, whats up? My shift just ended. What brings you here?\" asked Sakura. \"Hello Sakura, I came by to see if you wanted to a quick girls day out, and if you could help me out with something?\" she asked. \"Sure,\" replied Sakura, \"I'm free today, what did you want to do?\" They both leave the hospital and make there way into the village. \"Well I was thinking we could go to the hot springs for a quick soak and going shopping after.\" Hearing this got Sakura excited. She was soar from a long shift at the hospital and could use a soak. \"You're on!\" said Sakura excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both made there way to the hot springs. When they got there, they entered  and began to undress in the changing areas. They had there backs turned as they were left with nothing but towels. As they changed Hinata had her Byakugan active and studied Sakura's form in order to get a preview of what she would later ultimately become. She began to get turned on thinking of it. Calming herself down, they wash themselves off in the showers, before making their way to to the bathing area. They both entered the water and let out a light moans of relaxation as the warm water soothed their bodies. It was alwats nice taking trip to the hot springs here. After a little bit, Sakura decided to ask, \"Say Hinata where did you want to go shopping after?\" \"Well it has to do with later tonight. With Naruto back, I want to give him something special, so I was hoping you could help me pick out some lingerie.\" Hinata said face slightly red. Sakura was surprised to say the least. When did shy little Hinata become so bold? Must be from being with Naruto so much she mussed. With her face a little red, Sakura asked \"Uh sure Hinata, but why not ask Ino? I feel this is more her territory.\" Hinata replied, \"Well I felt we have become a lot closer in the past year and I consider you one of my best friends so I thought to ask you.\" She wasn't lying when she said that, but she didn't dare plan revealing the true reason. Touched by the sentiment, Sakura agreed. \"So Hinata, what are you planning for tonight?\" aske Sakura nudging her a bit. Hinata smiled and said, \"Sorry Sakura, a girl has to have some secrets.\" They laughed and both got out of the bath, and went back to the changing area to dry off and change. They were just about finished up and were just brushing their recently dried hair. They put their used items back in the bins and left them in the changing area to be later collected. As they were about to exit, Hinata said, \"Oh no I forgot my headband inside, I'll just be a second,\" as she ran inside. Sakura waited for Hinata to return. When she got inside, Hinata saw her target. She spoted the brush Sakura was using sitting atop her bin. She looked and was excited to see a few strands of Sakura's pink hair. Quickly bagging the strands, she ran out and met back with Sakura. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made their way over to the lingerie shop in the village, and proceeded to try on and model various pieces. Hinata suggested they pick the other out something the each would buy, saying it would be fun. Hinata picked out for Sakura a sexy black lace push up bra, and matching black lace panties, while Sakura picked out something similar but in white, for Hinata. When they went to pay, Hinata offered to pay the whole thing as thanks for coming out. Hinata went to pay, and noticed her wallet was missing, she asked Sakura if she could check the changing rooms. She agreed and ran back to check. When she was out of sight, Hinata pretended to have found her wallet at the bottom of her bag. She paid the cashier. The cashier then wrapped up each purchase and gave them to Hinata. Sakura came back and saw their purchases already wrapped and paid for. Hinata said she just found her wallet when Sakura was in the back. She apologized and handed Sakura her bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the fun day Hinata!\" said Sakura with a smile. \"Oh don't mention, Sakura. The pleasure was all mine. Thanks for coming out. I'll see you around!\" With that they hugged and went their separate ways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting dark and Hinata just made it back to Naruto's. She knocked on the door and was greeted by Naruto. \"So how'd it go and whats in the bag?\" he asked with a smile. \"Better than expected, and thats a surprise for later.\" she said smile as she walked in. She handed Naruto the bag that contained the stands of hair. Hinata ran to the bathroom and opened the package in the bag. It was the lingerie she picked out for Sakura. She had switched their bags while Sakura was in the back. She put the lingerie back in the package and left it in the bathroom. She came back out and saw Naruto already had the hair placed on the jutsu array. \"Are you ready Hinata?\" asked Naruto. Hinata gave a smile a nod in agreement. Taking that as a yes he performed the jutsu. There was a puff of smoke. When it cleared remained a Sakura mask that matched her features exactly, with pink bangs framing the sides of it. At its sight Hinata could barely contained herself. She went over and picked up admiring how smooth it felt in her hands. \"Its so pretty Naruto, should we try it out then?\" Excited that the jutsu worked Naruto replied, \"Yeah go for it!\" Hinata then turned the mask over her and brought it closer to her face. Her heart was beating out of her chest at this point. It was just about to to touch her face when...</span></div></div>",

Such a unique and vibrant coloring was known to only one person throughout the whole of the Hidden Leaf Village, his longtime teammate and former crush, Haruno Sakura. He had been in physical contact with his bubblegum haired teammate multiple times throughout the time of strife that was the Fourth Shinobi World War, so it was hardly a surprise that a strand of Sakura's exotically colored hair could've gotten snagged on of his ratty old jacket's zipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura-chan, huh...\" he mumbled to himself, leaning over and placing the hair on the meticulously drawn sealing array.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad Ero-Sennin managed to beat sealing into my head or else this'd be kinda useless,\" he mused aloud, slapping his hands together, closing his eyes, and focusing his chakra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon a deep blue glow surrounded his hands, bathing the dimly lit room in its azure light. Eyes snapping open, Naruto slammed his palms down at the edge of the array.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uzumaki Hijustu: Men no Sakusei!*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis chakra spread along the array like lightning, converging from all corners of the circular array onto the single strand of pink laying in the center. The blue light became blindingly white and for a brief moment, Naruto was afraid he'd made a mistake with the array. And as Jiraiya had beat into his hard noggin, a single, minute mistake on an array could be deadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his fears proved to be unfounded as the white light flared a bright pink, the same color as the hair, before abruptly vanishing into the array.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\"><b>POOF</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small cloud of pink smoke erupted from the center of the array, signifying the success of the jutsu. With bated breath, Naruto watched the cloud of smoke vanish, revealing the results of his efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn,\" he mumbled in sheer wonderment as he picked up the mask, \"I didn't expect it to work...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mask in his hands was relatively simple looking, but very distinctly possessing the features of his teammate. It was heart shaped, the \"skin\" colored a familiar shade  of lily white, both telltale features of his teammate. The eyeholes were large and almond shaped, framed by thick, full lashes and the mouth was a small line of pink against the fairer shade of the mask's \"skin\". But obviously, the most distinguishing feature was the long, chin length, pink bangs that were parted in the center and framed the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah,\" he whispered in awe, turning the mask over in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside of the mask was the color of dark wood, which flickered oddly in the dim light of his apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning it back around, he now wondered...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...what to do with it, now that he'd created a mask of his teammate?</span></div></div>",

She has a mission for you over in Suna to help Gaara out. They are opening a news ninja academy building and wanted the hero of the 4th Great Ninja War to be there.\" replied Hinata. \"Thats great!\" exclaimed Naruto getting excited. \"I haven't seen Gaara since the war ended. It should be great!\" he said. He invites Hinata in to gather some of his things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Hokage apologizes about sending you out on another mission so soon after coming back from your trip, he said the mission should only take a few days.\" said Hinata. \"Eh its no problem if its to help out Gaara.\" said Naruto with a laugh. \"That reminds me, how was your trip Naruto? I know you were going to see if you could find out some information about your clan.\" said Hinata. Naruto, then looks a little surprised. He almost forgot about the Kaguya mask and jutsu when Hinata came over. He only remembered when she brought up the trip. He looks over to part of the room and saw the mask still sitting on top of the jutsu array. He then starts to think if he should tell Hinata about the mask and jutsu. If the mask really contained Kaguya's power, it could be potentially dangerous to leave around in his apartment. He then began to come up with an idea, he could leave it in Hinata's care until he could figure out what to do with it when he came back. He and Hinata had grown closer after the war, and there was no one he trusted more than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was so lost in his thoughts, it was only until Hinata tapped him on the shoulder that he snapped out of it. \"Oh, sorry Hinata, I was just thinking of something.\" He then began to tell her of the shrine, the scroll containing the jutsu, and the accidental mask he created. Hinata was shocked from what she heard. She couldn't believe such a jutsu existed. It was then Naruto asked her to keep the Kaguya mask safe until he returned. He mentioned that it held a great power, and was afraid of it falling into the wrong hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto picked the mask up and gave it to Hinata. The minute she touched it, she could've sworn she felt a slight pulse come from the mask. Hinata thought she was imagining it, and figured it was just her nerves. After Naruto finished packing they both said their good byes and headed there separate ways. Naruto to see Hokage so he could start his mission, and Hinata headed home so she could keep the mask safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been about a day since Naruto left, and Hinata hadn't left the mask out of her sight. Her Naruto tasked her with this request, and she wouldn't let anything get in her way. Hinata was currently in her room looking at the mask. Her mind began to wonder about the mask. Could it really contain the power that Kaguya wielded? She didn't realize it, but she had been staring at the mask for a while now. Her eyes began to have hazed look like she was in a trance. She began reaching for the mask. It was almost like it was calling out for a wearer. She unconsciously had picked up the mask. She felt that familiar pulse again, when all of a sudden...  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Realizing that anyone could find the mask in her house, Hinata decided that keeping the mask on her person would be the best way to keep it safe. With that, she put the mask in a back pack that she could keep close with her. Making sure she had all her gear and the mask were secure, Hinata made her way out of the clan compound an over to where the village was under attack. She saw smoke coming from the gate and began to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata ran to the gate and was shocked at what she saw. Many of her fellow Leaf ninja were scattered about, some injured, others knocked unconscious. At the center of it all Hinata could make out what appeared to be their current Hokage Kakashi, fighting with a man in a white cloak, slivery white hair, and what appeared to have small horns from his head. Kakashi and the man were caught in a virtual stalemate. Hinata was amazed that there was someone that could match Kakashi in strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi couldn't believe his luck. After the Forth Great Ninja War, the leaf village was low on new ninja recruits and had to spread its forces a little thin. Luckily it was a time of relative peace, so need ninja weren't exactly great. Recently there had been a strange number of attacks happening around the elemental nations, and many villages were low on forces, so Kakashi had sent out a lot of their current Leaf ninja to assist. Unfortunately, this left the village understaffed and left him in the predicament he was currently in with many of the Leaf's stronger and more prominent ninja out of the village on missions and it left both Sakura and Tsunade to attend to the injured. Throughout the fight, Kakashi had learned that his opponent was a failed clone experiment of Orochimaru to create someone based on that of the Ootsutsuki clan. Once the clone had realized its power though, it quickly abandoned Orochimaru and began to go on a rampage due to his power making him mentally unstable. He was strong, and had no control over his power. He eventually made is way to the Leaf village in search of Naruto or Sasuke, wanting to kill them to prove he was strongest being around. Now the clone was attacking the village trying to find out their whereabouts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi knew the Ootsutsuki were strong, but this man was on another level. Kakashi was barely able to keep up with him and knew he would reach his limit soon. In the corner of his eye, Kakashi saw Hinata arrive to the fight. Hinata saw the man engaged with Kakashi, and activated her Byakugan. She saw the man had an enormous amount of chakra and strange chakra network. Thinking he was distracted, Hinata charged in with idea of disabling his chakra points. She noticed he was building chakra up in his body and realized he was about to let off something powerful. Just as she was about to land a blow, he released a powerful chakra based shock-wave (Similar to the Shinra Tensei that Pein used). This knocked both Hinata and Kakashi back hard into some of the surrounding buildings. Hinata was bruised and in pain. She had her leg pinned under some rubble as well leaving her immobilized. She looked over and saw Kakashi was barely conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll seemed bleak. If Kakashi couldn't defeat this monster, and both Naruto and Sasuke were away from the village, who would be strong enough to defeat him? It would take someone of similar power to defeat him. It was then something dawned upon Hinata. It would take a power similar to Kaguya to defeat him. She thought about the mask. It it really did grant the wearer its power, maybe she could use it to defend the village. She knew of the terrible power it possessed, and she told Naruto she would keep it safe, but there wouldn't be any point if there was no village left when he returned. She was torn on what to do. She saw the man making his way towards Kakashi with what looked like a make shift blade in his hand. Realizing there wasn't any time to fret over it, Hinata made up her mind. She would wear the mask and become Kaguya to save the village. She thought as long as she could remove it after she would be fine and able to return to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith new resolve Hinata went to grab the mask from her backpack...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Having come to grips with what she would have to do, Hinata opened he backpack to see the mask of Kaguya still in there without a scratch. Taking the mask in her hands she began to feel that familiar pulse again, and the desire to wear the mask. She could almost feel a power resonating from. It began to make her a mix of fear and excitement. Well it was all of or nothing, and in one swift motion Hinata closed her eyes,and brought the mask up and put it to her face. What happened next was something she could never expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe result was instantaneous as the Kaguya mask slapped violently, latching onto Hinata's face as she let out a low loud groan. Stumbling backwards she recoiled from the impact. The once ornate mask clamped firmly around her head as it shuddered and creaked. Small tendrils launched out of it latching onto her head. Moaning Hinata could feel her chakra being violently and forcefully drawn from within her body. As the mask softened taking on a more flesh like feeling it pressed roughly onto Hinata's face, kneading and moulding at her soft facial features. Hinata winced uncomfortably as it continued to writhe atop her face. Kaguya's bangs began to shift and distort violently forcing their way into Hinata's scalp as Hinata cried out as they distressingly ripped into her dark blue locks. She groaned as it smothered and sharply tugging at her silky long hair. Hinata winced, her hair lengthening and transitioning to shimmering silver white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Hinata frantically clamped her hands firmly around her head, trembling intensely as two small bulges erupted from the side of her head. Forcing their way through the mass of shifting silky hair to form two distinct appendages atop her head. Continuing to clasp her head Hinata grunted a few low groans as loud sick snaps signalled her jaw dislocating. Letting out another pained grunt as it cracked back into place. Hinata staggered forward slightly as her eyes agony as she felt the immense weight and terrifying power of Kaguya's omnipotent chakra being forcefully funneled into Hinata's young adult frame. She let out an audible scream, her body began to burn furiously from Kaguya's foreign chakra as it contorted her body. Her fair tone shifted swiftly becoming a pale snow white. Rosy lips dimmed to a deep dark red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata groaned aloud gritting her teeth as she trembled slightly, aware of a building pressure in her hips. Suddenly the distressing sound of bones cracking and snapping profoundly apart echoed around the battlefield, moaning as her hips flared outwards pressing against her shorts. She let out a few soft pleasurable moans as her rump swelled to more womanly proportions, a slight blush barely visible on the twisting surface of the mask. Letting out a gentle groan her spine snapped into a somewhat more refined curve. Grabbing her torso Hinata jutted her chest forward as she felt a sensation welling with her. Hinata panted and moaned pleasurably as her bosoms swelled briskly, straining and pressing tightly against her torn outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed, sweating and panting loudly from the enjoyable and revealing modifications. Her adult body now obviously more matured. However before Hinata could enjoy her new-found endowment she shook vividly. Again firmly trying to steady her head as the squirming mask settled atop her face. Abruptly Hinata convulsed thrashing about violently, screaming out a low distressed tone. Her eyes glazed over and her irises vanished. Her veins protruded prominently as her eyes twitched. A tickle of blood ran don her face as she was consumed by a vast surge of raw energy. Burning away her tattered clothes exposing her hidden voluptuous adult form underneath. Hinata screamed out as snapping open her Rinne Sharingan activated, throwing her slightly into the air as Kaguya's high-collared hime-kimono formed around her covering up her exposed body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFading away and growing dim the vast surge dissipated revealing in it's place the transformed Hinata. Slowly Hinata opened her Byakugan eyes surveying the area around her, as her Rinne sharingan eye glow ominously. She glared at herself in the reflection of a damaged store front window. She marvelled at her altered form. Hinata felt amazing, almost intoxicated by the exciting and somewhat foreboding power. As she continued to inspect herself giggling gleefully, she failed to realize the eyes of everyone looking upon her in disbelief. Eventually upon realizing it she grinned widely, turning to meet their gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe first stared down the clone that had brought such terror to her village, and in a voice that wasn't her own decided to address him. \"You! Whoever you are. You made a great mistake by attacking our village!\" Yelled Hinata. The clone was intrigued and began to feel something he had never felt, fear. \"You've injured our own and for that you pay the ultimate price! As Hinata, I might have been powerless to stop you, but now you will fear the power of Kaguya!\" She screamed in rage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if acting on autopilot, she felt her body slip through a dimensional whole that she opened and was suddenly behind the deranged clone. Taken by surprise the clone didn't expect for Hinata to use her hair to ensnare him. Hinata wrapped her hair around his arms and legs, immobilizing him. For some reason Hinata felt like toying with her prey and began to slam the clone around. Smashing him into the ground and through the building. She felt she had to make him suffer for what he did. The clone continued to struggle, but the hair was stronger than steal. Having toyed around enough, Hinata then put her hand up as a long sharpened bone began to protrude from it, forming a make shift sword. Hinata then looked him dead in the eyes and spoke, \"You poor creature, you made the mistake of your life coming here threatening our friends, family, and especially for wanting to hunt Naruto. For this I cannot forgive. Remember this power as you take it with you to your grave. My new power. The power of Kaguya!\" She yelled , and then stabbed him with the bone sword. \"All-Killing Ash Bones.\" Was the last thing he heard as his body began to dissolve and rot away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was happy, she had defeated the enemy and still felt the unlimited power that flowed through her body, but then began to frown as she looked at all the destruction the clone had created. She wished there was something she could do with this power to fix it. It was then she felt her body begin to go on autopilot. She put both of her hand together and orbs of yin chakra and yang chakra formed in each. In one hand an orb of darkness and the other light. She then collided both orbs together forming a great power in her hands before slamming it the newly formed orb of energy into the ground. The ground began to light up, and soon engulfed the whole village in a bright light. After a moment the light subsided and left standing was the leaf village as if nothing happened to it. All the injuries accrued were healed, as if they had never received them. It was almost like Hinata reset everything to prior the clones arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata, along with everyone else marveled and celebrated. Who knew Kaguya contained such a power to create, and not just destroy. Hinata was still admiring what happened when Kakashi appeared before her. \"You did a brave thing using that mask Hinata, but it was also reckless.\" stated Kakashi. \"How did you know of the mask?\" asked Hinata. \"Naruto briefed me before his mission, he told me he left it in your care, that there was no one he trusted more. He told me how it works as well. Now that the village is safe Hinata, you need to remove the mask. For your safety and everyone's in the village.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Safety?! I protected the village! Even better than you Hokage!\" She snapped. \"Hinata this isn't you, Naruto warned us both of the personality taking over the user. Kaguya's power is strong and will exert its will on you. I've fought once and its not something I want to see again. So I will ask you again Hinata. Please remove the mask.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata thought about what Kakashi said and decided..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Updated 01/26/16.

Today you proved you are too weak to protect this village without the assistance of Naruto or even Sasuke. If it were not for me and this power, there would be no village left to protect.\" Kakashi was taken back. He never expected this from someone as sweet as Hinata. He knew the it had to be the mask that was doing this her. Kakashi then stared her down and said, \"Hinata for your own good, I'll tell you one more time, remove the mask or I will do it for you.\" \"And I'll tell you for the last time Kakashi, the answer is no. Now back down before you incur my wrath,\" she replied. Kakashi had just about enough, he charged chakra to his hands like Naruto explained to him and rushed at Hinata with as much speed as possible. In the blink of an eye, he was in front of Hinata, his hands were glowing blue with chakra and almost at the sides of her face. As he was about to make a grab at the mask he made the mistake at looking at Hinata in the eyes. He noticed her smirk and felt a pulse of chakra come from her Rinne Sharingan. He cursed knowing he was done for. He felt himself blacking out as he was caught in a genjutsu similar to a limited Tsukuyomi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata watch as Kakashi appeared in front of her in the blink of an eye, she felt her body go on autopilot again. As Kakashi raised his hands to try and remove the mask from her, she felt a pulse come from her third eye and with knowledge she never originally had, placed Kakashi under one of her now strongest genjutsus. She watched as Kakashi drop to the ground, his mind locked away in an endless dream that only she could wake him up from. She heard everyone gasp at the sight of their fallen Hokage. Realizing she had everyone exactly where she wanted them, Hinata then began to hover above the ground so that all in the area could see, she said, \"Our mighty Hokage has fallen to my power. As you saw, it my power that protected you from the intruder, it was I who rebuilt the village and healed your injured. It was all through my new power that the village is safe, not Kakashi. I am the only one that can protect this village from here on out. I shall be the new Hokage, and as long as you follow my word as law, you shall have nothing to fear!\" Hinata finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe villagers and the the leaf ninja were paralyzed in fear. Hinata had taken out the Hokage without so much as lifting a finger. What could they do against a power like that. One by one the citizens of the leaf began to bow their heads to the newly proclaimed Hokage. That was until a voice called in opposition. That person was... </span></div></div>",

To take out Kakashi-sensei as Hokage and to declare yourself though the fear of others? Thats not what a true Hokage would do, and its certainly not what the real Hinata would do!\" yelled Sakura. Hinata then gave her an amused look. She then created a portal next to her and appeared right behind Sakura. \"Kakashi was weak and could never protect the village as well as I can. This power is,\" said Hinata as she was cut off by Sakura. \"Not yours! Its Kaguya's and its messing with your mind Hinata. \" Hinata looked at her with anger, \"This is my power, together with it I am Kaguya and I won't let you or anyone else in this village say different.\" Hinata then looked and saw some of the other ninja's and villagers start to rally behind Sakura. Losing the fear she had instilled in them prior, Hinata decided she would make Sakura an example to all who opposed her. Using gravity manipulation, she surprised Sakura by raising her hand and casting Sakura up into the air. While  Sakura hovered for all to see, she struggled for all to see as Hinata then raised her other hand and launched a sphere of pitch black chakra. The orb engulfed Sakura as she let out a scream. In mere moments the sphere then shrank down into nothing leaving behind no trace of Sakura. Everyone gasped at the demise of Sakura. To some some it shocked, to others it enraged. For Hinata, it created the opposite effect than what she was expecting. Everyone was now in an uproar of the public execution of one of their own. Realizing fear would no longer work, another idea crept into her head. She launched a small dark orb above the village, beginning the Chibaku Tensei jutsu. It began to create a miniature moon-like object hovering above the village. This caused everyone to stop and notice the the object became large enough to eclipse the sun casting a shadow on the village. Hinata then turned towards the miniature moon and opened her Rinne Sharingan. She then cast a massive genjutsu that reflected off the moon and affected everyone person in the village leaving them in a trance like state. It was then that Hinata turned back to the village and spoke, \"People of the village, from this day forward you obey my every command with out question, and in return I will keep you safe. With this decree I will no longer be the weak Hinata you originally remembered. From this day forward, I will be your new as Kaguya, your new Hokage!\" Everyone in the village began to come to, as they saw their new Hokage and began to cheer and chant her name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased with the turn out, The new Kaguya, warped to the Hokage building where she went to the top of it. Using her powers she began to warp the building into a new palace. Pleased she warped into her new room in the palace. She looked down at her bed and placed out her hand, a black sphere again appeared and from it the unconcious body of Sakura dropped on to the bed. The new Kaguya looked at her and spoke, \"Well Sakura, when I was Hinata we had actually become pretty good friends. You helped me out then, so I couldn't actually kill you. You are still a good friend and will be useful in the future.\" With that Kaguya leaves the unconscious Sakura on the bed an opens a portal. She enters it, only to appear...</span></div></div>",

Hoping that it might be close by. She activated her Byakugan and began to search for it. Scanning quickly through battle field she found the mask, but the sight of it left her with a worse feeling of dread. She found the mask, except it had broken into two pieces. She found the right half was relatively close to her and luckily within arms reach. It looked like it was split cleanly down the middle. Hinata felt any sense of hole for the mask draining fast. She began to think to herself. Hinata wondered would the mask be able to put back together, or would only half the mask work if she couldn't obtain the other half? She had so many thoughts and questions were flying around in her head as she continued to scan the field for the other half. After a moment of searching, she was luckily able to locate the left half. It was on of the battlefield near some fallen building rubble. Hinata tried to get up, but noticed she was still injured with her leg still pinned under a crumbled building. Hoping someone might be around that could help, she at least was able to stretch and just reach the right half of the mask.

She knew she could always have Sakura throw her the other half of the mask, but she would then risk alerting the enemy and him possibly destroying it, or there was another option Hinata thought. She had no idea if it would work, but what if just each of the one halves of the mask could be worn by two different wearers? The scroll made no mention of such a thing ever being done, nor what said consequences of such actions would be. Hinata could just wear her half and yell out to Sakura do the same. She was someone both Hinata and Naruto trusted.

Realizing that time was almost up, Hinata made up her mind. She looked over and yelled out to Sakura grabbing both her and the intruder\u2019s attention. He casually dropped Kakashi\u2019s body as he stared curiously at her. Hinata gulped as a wave of intruder\u2019s killing intent rolled over her. Steeling her resolve Hinata continued, \u201cSakura! Quickly, one foot to left of you is the other half of this mask, I need you to grab it!\u201d she yelled while holding up her piece. Sakura was shocked by the half faced appearance of Kaguya\u2019s face in Hinata\u2019s hand. She then looked down and saw the half Hinata mentioned. Questions began racing through Sakura\u2019s head. Why did Hinata have a mask of Kaguya, and why would she bring it to a war zone like this? What purpose did it have. The only thing she did know was if it involved Kaguya, it was probably bad. Seeing the look on Sakura\u2019s face, Hinata could already tell what she was thinking. She then yelled out to her, \u201cSakura! I need you to wear your half of the mask. I know you have seen Kaguya\u2019s power personally, but you have to trust me. In our hands hold the pieces to possibly help save the village and Kakashi. Please listen to me!\u201d Realizing Hinata wouldn\u2019t be asking this of she didn\u2019t have some plan or idea of it these pieces worked, Sakura bent over and took the other piece of the mask. As soon as her hand made contact with the other half, she felt a light pulse emanate from it. Hinata felt her half pulse again as well. They both looked down at the halves in their hands when they felt the halves pulse again, but it was a stronger feeling this time. Both sets of eyes started to haze over as their hearts started pounding in their chests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ootsutsuki clone\u2019s mood changed from being curious of the two girls girls standing in the rubble, to that of his normal, insane and murderous rage. He then went sprinting towards Hinata with makeshift sword in hand. This snapped both girls out of their trance. Realizing no other way to save her, Sakura yelled out as she held her half to her face, \u201cAh screw it! Hinata I\u2019ll do it!\u201d Hearing that was all Hinata needed she quickly put her half up to her face as well. Just as the clone got in front of Hinata, she and Sakura yelled, \u201cNow!\u201d simultaneously and they each both put on their respective halves. A burst of energy and chakra exploded from both girls, blowing back the clone through several buildings, as a vortex dense malevolent chakra began to encircle and envelop the each of them. The vortexes began to shroud their form showing nothing but that of their silhouettes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kaguya mask halves latched on slapping violently onto Hinata\u2019s and Sakura\u2019s faces, they both let out a loud low groan. Stumbling backwards in the vortexes they recoiled from the impact, as the once ornate mask halves clamped firmly around the single side of their heads. Each one shuddered and creaked launching small tendrils that clamped around their heads, beginning to writhe and knead into their facial features. Loud moans echoed from the vortexes as they could feel their chakra being violently and forcefully drawn from within their bodies. The Mask halves began to soften taking on a more elastic flesh like feeling as it pressed harshly into their faces, kneading and mould at their soft facial features. Hinata and Sakura winced uncomfortably as the pieces continued to writhe atop their faces, creaking and cracking as it slowly slivered across the uncovered portions of their faces. Hinata and Sakura again moaned loudly, feeling their own drawn chakra swirling and mixing with the stored chakra in the halves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat begins to happen now? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(All credit for writing out the transformation scenes in this story goes to Mwander [Username: maskedwander] for the huge assist in this collaborative effort.

Suddenly the small tendrils snapped inward digging into their skin, Sakura grunted wincing in discomfort as Hinata cried out acutely. From the root of the injection points their skin tones began to shift along their veins like a fire rapidly spreading, shifting their fair skin tones snow white. As the tones changed the shifting warping mask formed the pulsating mass into symmetrical replicas of the missing sections. Abruptly these new form sections\u2019 bangs began to shift and distort intensely, immediately and violently forcing their way into Hinata\u2019s and Sakura\u2019s scalps. The young women cried out as they distressingly ripping into their locks. Sakura\u2019s bring pink locks disappeared under a flood of white, while Hinata\u2019s dark blue locks were smothered. They both winced as the bangs tugged sharply and consumed their hair, lengthening and transitioning their tones to a shimmer shade of silver white. The hairs retaining a subtle pink and dark blue-ish lustre keeping their original hair styles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden the two shinobi frantically leaned over forward clamping their hands firmly around their heads, trembling fiercely as two small bulges sprouted from either side of their heads. Forcing their way through the mass of developing hairs forming two sharp appendages atop each of their heads, one more sizable than the other relative to their original mask halves. Continuing to clasp their heads they grunted a few groans as a loud series of sick snaps signaled their jaws dislocating, another dual pained grunts escaped as they snapped back into place. These echoed outwards of the raging vortexes. The resulting outlines resembling more matured dimensions to their faces, but retained essences of their primary facial features. Hinata and Sakura both trying to recover staggered forward slightly, their eyes in agony as their could feel half of Kaguya\u2019s omnipotent chakra that was mixed with their own being forcefully funnelled into their young adult forms. They screamed out as their bodies burned furiously from the foreign chakra as it contorted their grown-up bodies. Sakura\u2019s lips shifting to a light pink while Hinata\u2019s brightened to a lighter lavender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaggering around the vortex Sakura and Hinata groaned aloud gritting their teeth as they trembled slightly, aware of a building pressuring in their bodies around their hips. Sakura realizing what was about to happen braced herself quickly, while Hinata oblivious to what was about to happen continued to groan and shudder. Suddenly the vortexes filled with loud whipping cracks of thunder as the dual distressing sound of bones cracking and snapping profoundly apart reverberated outwards, audible to those looking at the whirlwinds. Moaning their hips flared outwards pressing tightly against Hinata\u2019s loose grey blue shorts, while firmly against Sakura\u2019s skin tight and form fitting under-shorts. In tandem they both let slip several soft pleasurable moans as their rumps swelled to womanly proportions, soft blushes barely visible atop their writhing faces. Sakura\u2019s rump became well rounded dangerously stretching her pliable shorts as they began to tear nearly revealing her nude body underneath. While Hinata\u2019s became taut against the fabric, straining the seams and adding to her already bulbous behind as tiny tears emerged. Hinata let out a gentle groan as her spine cracked into a more refined curve, while Sakura yelped noisily as he back snapped vigorously from her tomboy curve to a more elegant befitting arch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloundering forward knocked off balance by her shifting spine Sakura perceived a vast warming feeling in her bust, comprehending what this likely signaled she jutted her chest outwards in preparation. She panted and moaned pleasurably as her meagre bosoms briskly swelled forth, rapidly filling her sleeveless dress. Straining the frayed fabric as it tore ripping open exposing her undergarments. Across in the other vortex Hinata also felt a sensation welling in her bust, the warm feeling spreading promptly as she panted lightly. Moaning aloud in pure pleasure Hinata\u2019s already sizable bosom developed even further, her blouse unable to cope with the stress busting open as well exposing her. Both ladies convulsed as their bones grinded against each other their heights slowly altering to match Kaguya\u2019s. Their waist snapped in sending a sicking sound rippling outwards. Their nails creaked as they elongated taking light painted tones that matched their hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chakra vortex around them continuing to rip, tear and gash at what little was left of their gear. Reducing them to an almost completely bare nude state, their only remaining modesty preserved by the tattered shreds of their grabs. Hinata and Sakura blushed, sweating and panting profusely from the yet warn off pleasurable surge of their enlarged bosoms. Their adult bodies now more matured and voluptuous. However unable to long appreciate their current endowment as they shook viciously. The swirling whirlwind of chakra surrounded them, ascending them upwards hovering a few feet into the savage vortex. Firmly clamping their heads again trying to steady themselves the squirming mask settled atop their anguished expressions. Abruptly Hinata and Sakura thrashed about intensely, howling in a low resounding tone. Hinata\u2019s Byakugan eyes glazed over, her veins bulged prominently. Sakura\u2019s irises dissipated as the natural veins around her eyes forcefully bulged out hastily, her emerald eyes glazing over as a powerful pulse burst emanated from them. The sudden adaptation and adoption of the Byakugan Kekkei Genkai provoked blood to slightly rupture from Sakura\u2019s eyes, unaccustomed to such powerful sensory input. Both their eyes twitched excessively as if something was trying to break to the surface from inside their skulls. A trickle of blood unevenly ran down their foreheads. Consumed by a great upsurge of chakra their remaining battered underwear burned away, exposing their concealed voluptuous sensuous physique underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreeching out together Sakura\u2019s and Hinata Rinne Sharingan eyes snapped wide. Their new wicked wayward chakra oozed out of their forms. Embracing them in a thick cloud like cloak the chakra grew more solid, materialising around them into unfamiliar garments. Sakura\u2019s outfit consisted of a kimono that was short and stopped perilously short down her thighs. revealing much of her sensual legs. A large bow wrapped tightly around her waist modestly holding the outfit together. Her long sleeves ended at thin delicate formal gloves that stretched out gracefully. Hinata\u2019s outfit consisted of a much more form fitting Kimono than Sakura\u2019s, displaying immodestly all her provocative curves. The front of the kimono ample and wide open flaunting much of her bosom and embellish cleavage. Contrasting to Sakura her Kimono swept long down past her thighs and exaggerated amplifying her contours. All of a sudden a bright radiance burned from their Rinne Sharingans. A brilliant dazzling light erupted from the centre of the whirlwinds, shattering the vortexes sending dust flying high into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the start of the two young shinobi donning the strange mysterious half masks, vanishing into thick obscured cyclones of erratic chakra nobody had seen too much of them. The people followed and watched as the figures within the vortexes writhed, throbbing about their hands grappling with their heads as what looks like their hair shifted and inexplicable appendages formed. Throughout the crisis sadistic snapping, sickening scream, ghastly groans and appalling creaking echoed outwards past them. The silhouettes of the young women dislocating and adjusting, as if being shaped by a large unseen hand. Transforming into unrecognisable shapes and enamouring contours. However that all changed as the cyclones dissipated suddenly with two roaring banshee like screams as dust filled the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing away the dust settled on the ground forming a thin layer which covered everything like ash. Descending down from shimmering sunlit sky arose two equivalent figures clad in graceful snow kimonos, floating tenderly in the air. Touching down quietly the two figures just stood their, ominously casting their presence around everyone. They felt as if two Goddesses had just swooped down from Heaven. Hinata and Sakura raised their hands up out in front of them, admiring the absolute feeling of strength and power that followed throughout their bodies. They realized quickly it wasn\u2019t the complete capability of Kaguya, but amounted to far more than the single meagre efforts of Hagoromo and Hamura Ootsutsuki.on their own. However this admiration of their new abilities would have to be short lived for the moment as crashing down in front of them appear the cloned Ootsutsuki, slightly grazed from his earlier trip through several building. In perfect complete synchronization Hinata and Sakura trod one leg forward, steadying themselves and extending in front of them their arms stretching out their hands they commanded.<br>\r\n\u201cBegone from our sight you beast!\u201d in an echoed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden a blinding flash of light consumed the clone, obscuring him in a funnel of light as his body crumbled. Turning to ash burned by the sheer intensity of the combined force of Sakura and Hinata\u2019s combined strength. As the cinders dissipated and fluttered away on the light breeze that swept through the two women lowered their arms and looked at each other. They grinned, giggling cheerfully as they realized they were victorious. The threat was vanquished and everyone saved. Or was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(All credit for this chapter goes to Mwander [Username: maskedwander]. Once again, a huge thanks to him for his help in this collaborative story.)</span></div></div>",

Hanabi had just recently come back from a mission late last night and had been sleeping all day in her room. When the rumble and explosion went off she had awoken, only to find an empty house. Assuming something might have happened she went to check on her sister to make sure she was alright. She approached Hinata's room and knocked on her door and heard nothing. Wanting to make sure everything was okay, she entered Hinata's room to see if she was there. She found an empty room upon entry, but was greeted with the sight of a mask sitting on top her sister's bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi looked at the mask and tried to determine what it was, and why Hinata had it. She inspected the mask. It had delicate facial features and what looked like white bangs that framed its face. It had empty eyes hole, like most masks, and a slit on its forehead that looked like it belong to a closed third eye. The mask looked strange to Hanabi, but oddly familiar. The pale skin and white hair reminded her of that Tonrei Ootsutsuki that kidnapped her and brought her to the moon. It was at that moment something clicked and she remembered the story Hinata told her, that she heard from Naruto. It was about the clash with Kaguya, and what happened when everyone was caught in the Infinite Tsukuyomi. No one other than the members of Team 7 had actually saw Kaguya, but based on the description and this mask, Hanabi now had a pretty good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi began to wonder why her sister had such a mask, and where it came from. She began to stare at the mask and marvel at it. It seemed so delicate, yet strangely beautiful. She was having a hard time imagining such a face to be that of what many believed to be a \"demon.\" Hanabi began to become infatuated with the mask, her eyes began to haze a bit and she almost seemed to be in a trance. She began to reach for the mask. It seemed to nice, it couldn't hurt to try it on and look at it in the mirror she thought. Hinata wasn't around, and she could put it back on the bed without her even knowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she realized it Hanabi had already picked up the mask and she could have sworn she had felt what felt like a pulse from the mask when she picked it up. She slowly began to bring the mask up to her face, when...</span></div></div>",

Her eyes glazed over entirely as she was completely entranced and infatuated by the mask. It ominously pulsed in her hands as she drew it closer still. Hanabi's breathing grew slow and heavy. She could feel her breath bouncing off the back of the Mask and at her face. Her hands shook frantically as the pulse became simply overwhelming, slamming the mask into her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly the Kaguya Mask slapped violently onto Hanabi's face as she let out a loud low groan, stumbling backwards as she recoiled. Clamping firmly around her head, the once cold and lifeless delicate mask began creak and shudder. Hanabi began to moan loudly as the mask began to rapidly draw chakra from within her body and softened, taking on a more elastic fleshy feeling. Pressing down forcibly against her face it began to knead, moulding into her delicate facial features causing Hanabi to wince in discomfort. Kaguya's bangs began to shift and buckle, violently forcing their way into Hanabi's scalp. She groaned as the mask encroached upon her hair line. The white ribbon holding her ponytail together slipping loose, with her two forward bangs following suit. Wincing as her own long locks lengthened and transitioned to a shimmering white. Abruptly Hanabi frantically grabbed her head clamping her hands tightly. She shook strongly. Two small bulges began to protrude from the sides of her head, forcing their way parting the mass of shifting white locks to form edged appendages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi maintained clutching her head as the Mask writhed, distorting profoundly atop of her distressed face. Cringeworthy cracking echoed throughout Hinata's room as Hanabi's jaw dislocated rearranging into Kaguya's mature chiselled outline. Hanabi's eyes shuddered in torment as she began to feel the immense burden and terrifying power of Kaguya's omnipotent chakra being forcefully funnelled into her petite frame. Crying out aloud as tears welt in her eyes Hanabi extremely regretted donning this mask. She let out a deep roar of anguish as her body burned furiously as the foreign chakra contorted her body. Her fair tone shifted rapidly becoming a pale white. Light pale pinkish lips flushed a deep dark red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaggering heavily around Hinata's bed she grappled against the mask, failing to remove it. Hanabi groaned, gritted her teeth as the chakra began altering her form. Letting out tiny articulated grunts she shuddered viciously, collapsing onto her knees. Her eyes rolled up slightly as she continued to grit her teeth aware of the pressure building around her hips. The sudden sound of bones cracking violently apart distressingly echoed around Hinata's room as Hanabi's rump became more pronounced as her hips flared out to matured proportions. Hanabi let out a wailed cry as her back snapped, lengthening and caved in more showing off a defined curve. Even though she was in complete unadulterated distress the pain didn't stop for Hanabi. Her limbs clicked and crackled making sickening sounds grinding against each other, as her small frame was violently forced into that of a full mature adult's height and size. Among her distress Hanabi let out a few moans. Being forced to jut her chest forward as her bosoms began to swell, stretching her already torn and strained kimono.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chakra had radically and forcibly forged Hanabi's young proportions into that which resembled Kaguya's mature adult form, all while coursing through her granting her unimaginable power. Still not finished being transformed she continued to hold firmly, trying to steady the writhing mask as it settled atop her face. Abruptly Hanabi convulsed violently, shrieking out a deep blood-curdling cry in a tone not her own. Her eyes glazed over, her irises vanished, her veins protruded prominently as her eyes twitched frantically. Blood trickled down the middle of her face from her forehead. A vast surge of raw energy erupted consuming Hanabi as the Rinne Sharingan eye snapped open. Her tattered, broken and strained kimono evaporated revealing  Hanabi's now matured ultimate form, as she was surrounded by Kaguya's high-collared hime-kimono.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light grew dim and soon faded away, revealing it it's place a radically changed and altered Hanabi. No longer resembling the younger prodigal sister of Hinata Hyuga instead stood in her place a much large, menacing and developed form of Kaguya Ootsutsuki. Hanabi let out small moan trying to understand what was had just transpired. However all of a sudden she was forced to brace her head firmly with her hands, her head throbbing in agony as she could feel an overwhelming presence encroaching upon her own personality.</span></div></div>",

Her hot breath reflecting back at her from the surface of the mask. The pulse was overwhelming. Finally it contacted with her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe result was unexpected! The Kaguya Mask slapped violently, latching onto Hinata face forcing her to stumble backwards recoiling. The once cold and lifeless mask clamped firmly onto Hinata's head.

She has a mission for you over in Suna to help Gaara out. They are opening a new ninja academy building and wanted the hero of the 4th Great Ninja War to be there.\" replied Sakura. \"That's great!\" exclaimed Naruto getting excited. \"I haven't seen Gaara since the war ended. It should be great!\" he said. He invites Sakura in to gather some of his things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kakashi-sensei apologizes about sending you out on another mission so soon after coming back from your trip, he said the mission should only take a few days.\" said Sakura. \"Eh its no problem if its to help out Gaara.\" said Naruto with a laugh. \"That reminds me, how was your trip Naruto? I know you were going to see if you could find out some information about your clan.\" said Sakura. Naruto, then looks a little surprised. He almost forgot about the Kaguya mask and jutsu when Sakura came over. He only remembered when she brought up the trip. He looks over to part of the room and saw the mask still sitting on top of the jutsu array. He then starts to think if he should tell Sakura about the mask and jutsu. If the mask really contained Kaguya's power, it could be potentially dangerous to leave around in his apartment. He then began to come up with an idea, he could leave it in Sakura's care until he could figure out what to do with it when he came back. He and Sakura were teammates, close friends, and had fought Kaguya together. If anyone knew the terrible power it contained, it was her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was so lost in his thoughts, it was only until Sakura knocked him on the shoulder that he snapped out of it. \"Oh, sorry Sakura, I was just thinking of something.\" He then began to tell her of the shrine, the scroll containing the jutsu, and the accidental mask he created. Sakura was shocked from what she heard. She couldn't believe such a jutsu existed. It was then Naruto asked her to keep the Kaguya mask safe until he returned. He mentioned that it held a great power, and was afraid of it falling into the wrong hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto picked the mask up and gave it to Sakura. The minute she touched it, she could've sworn she felt a slight pulse come from the mask. Sakura thought she was imagining it, and figured it was just some nerves at the thought of Kaguya. After Naruto finished packing they both said their good byes and headed there separate ways. Naruto to see Hokage so he could start his mission, and Sakura headed home so she could keep the mask safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been about a day since Naruto left, and Sakura hadn't let the mask out of her sight. Sakura was currently in her room looking at the mask. Her mind began to wonder about the mask. Could it really contain the power that Kaguya wielded? She didn't realize it, but she had been staring at the mask for a while now. Her eyes began to have hazed look like she was in a trance. She began reaching for the mask. It was almost like it was calling out for a wearer. She unconsciously had picked up the mask. She felt that familiar pulse again, when all of a sudden...</span></div></div>",

In doorway, Sarada Uchiha enters the hidden room. She had recently discovered the Shrine when she exploring the Uchiha district of the Leaf Village. She wanted to find details of her Uchiha lineage and ended up at the ruins of the once proud Naka Shrine. Exploring the rubble of what was left, she a displaced Tatami mat on the floor.

She made her way to the door, and with all her strength was able to force the door open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a rumble, the door opens to room and the torches begin to illuminate the darkness.

Walking over, she glanced at the tablet and saw it was in language she couldn't make out. Deciding that it could be looked into another day, she went over to the scroll and picked it up. She unravels the scroll and begins to read its contents. She learns of the Uzumaki history that it contained and of a mask jutsu that could physically change the body to become a complete clone of who it was based off of. This seemed to interest Sarada. Could such a jutsu really work? The more she thought about it, the more she became curious to try it for herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarada began to wonder who to make mask of, when she looked up at the wall and saw the mask again.

Small tendrils launched out of the mask latching onto her head. Moaning loudly Sarada could feel chakra being forcefully and  rapidly being drawn from within her body. The Mask softened too on a more elastic flesh like feeling. It pressed down roughly on her face, kneading and moulding into her soft facial features. Sarada winced in discomfort as it continued to writhe. Kaguya's bangs began to change and distort. Violently they forced their way into Sarada's scalp, letting out a cry as she distressingly felt them rip into her dark onyx hair. She groaned as the mask's 'hair' progressed and smothered her own, sharply pulling and tugging at her shoulder length hair. Wincing as her own dark onyx hair lengthened, converting to a shimmering silver shade. Sarada suddenly felt a tearing throb. She frantically clamped her hands onto her head tightly, shaking intensely as two small bulges began to protrude from the sides of her head. Unnerving creaking filled the room as the two shifting masses forced their way through the eruption of white hair. The stopped sharply forming two distinct brown appendages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarada continued to clamp her hands firmly around her head as the mask writhed. Distorting deeply atop her distraught expression. Cringeworthly crackling proceeded by sick snapping echoed throughout the shrine's small hidden room as Sarada's jaw violently dislocated. She let out an articulated grunt as it lashed back into place forming into Kaguya's sculpted jawline. Sarada's eyes shuddered in agony as she sensed the immense burden and terrifying force of Kaguya's omnipotent chakra being forcefully funnelled into her adolescent form. She let out an ear-splitting scream , weeping as she regretted donning the mask. Continuing to scream her body burned furiously as the unnatural god-like chakra twisted her. Skin quickly shifted tone from her fair complexion, becoming a soft pale colour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeginning to staggering around the tiny hidden room Sarada wrestled against the Kaguya mask, trying to frantically remove it. Her bruised hands pulling madly against the shifting mass that smothered her features. Try as she might it didn't budge. Her tears dripping down the warping surface and onto the matted floor. Sarada's knees let off a nauseating snap causing her to screech in anguish, collapsing to knees. She groaned aloud clenching her teeth as the malevolent chakra adjusted her form. Small grunts escaped her as she trembled, her strained eyes rolling slightly upwards. Aware of the building pressure around her hips she gritted her teeth and braced for the worst. Sarada cried out. The sudden sound of bones crackling and snapping violently apart profoundly reverberated around the cramped hidden chamber. She wept as her hips flared outwards pressing  firmly against her light shorts. Soft moans echoed as her rump ballooned to Kaguya's matured proportions pressuring the fabric of her slim shorts. Sarada wailed as her waist fractured disturbingly inwards. Trembling her spine cracked savagely lengthened, snapping her back excruciatingly inwards revealing a refined curve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarada trembled, trying to compel herself to her feet. Dragging herself up she staggered to her feet. Taking a few steps slowly forward, the mask still writhing and changing her. She slowed further as her thighs throbbed, burning as they flesh out. Sarada panted as a loud crunch resounded from her knees, toppling her over harshly onto the matted floor. Hitting the floor with a thud she rolled over onto her back. Her limbs clicked and cracked making sickening grinding sounds as they grated together, her petite frame violently unwillingly transformed into mature dimensions. Agonised she moaned forcibly arching her back to jut her chest forward as she could feel a sensation welling within her. Her bosoms swelled briskly, stretching and straining the sleeved qipao dress's material the outfit becoming smaller and similar an ill-fitting t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarada panted loudly sweat dripping down her  unsteady body as Kaguya's chakra had forged her into resembling Kaguya's developed appearance. Continuing to course throughout her body Sarada flinched as the changes had not yet concluded., again grabbing her pounding head as the writhing mask settled atop her face. Abruptly Sarada thrashed violently, shrieking out a deep unidentified outcry. Her eyes frantically zipped around in their sockets promptly changing to sharingan tomoe, which quickly burnt away into blank irises. Her veins surrounding them protruded prominently as her eyes twitched. Blood trickled down her face. A vast surge of raw energy spewed out consuming Sarada as snapping open the Rinne sharingan took hold. Her tattered dress and strained shorts evaporated, exposing Sarada extremely briefly. Kaguya's high-collared hime-kimono formed concealing her from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFading away and growing dim the beam of light dissipated revealing in it's place a prominent silhouette. No longer stood Sarada in the hidden Naka shrine room. Rather the imposing and menacing figure of Kaguya Ootsutsuki. Sarada slowly raised her hands to her face panting lightly as she in a state of shock glared at herself. Letting out a soft sigh trying to realise what had just happened to her. She stumbled forward slightly, collapsing onto her knees. Her face contorted with horror as she could feel Kaguya's almighty chakra empowering her, but encroaching upon her psyche was the overwhelming foreboding force of Kaguya whispering over her shoulder.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While the mask did look beautiful to her, she had no idea who it was of and why it was down here with the scroll in the first place. Thinking that maybe if she wanted to test this jutsu, that maybe creating a mask of someone she knew first would be a better choice. With that idea in place, Sarada rolled the scroll back up and placed it in her bag she brought with her. She left the mask in the secret room, thinking that if her first test was successful, that maybe she would come back one day for it. She then exited the room and sealed the stone door shut again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarada made her way back to her house. She went in and saw a note on the counter from her mother Sakura. It said she had to head out on a mission away from the village for a couple of days with Ino and Hinata, and would be back soon. It said she was sorry, and that she pre-made some dinners for Sarada to heat up. She was a little sad her Mama wouldn't be around for a bit saddened her, but realizing that this was a perfect chance to try the jutsu out knowing she had the house to herself. Sarada ran up to her room and shut her door. She opened the scroll again and setup the jutsu array needed to create a mask.

For a moment the image of their 7th Hokage Naruto Uzumaki popped in her head and she blushed. Ever since the incident with the Shin Uchiha clones and the events from the chunnin exams, Sarada developed a bit of a crush on their Hokage. She always knew it was a kids crush and that nothing could ever come of it, but it never stopped her from fantasizing. She knew he was almost three times her age, and would always just see her as his best friend's daughter, plus he had his beautiful wife Hinata at his side. Why would he want her. She became jealous of Hinata for a moment. If only he could look at me like he does her. Even for one day, that's all I would need. Feeling a bit saddened she looked back at the array and instantly an idea popped into her head. If I could be Hinata for that day, maybe I could still get my day just yet! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Sarada put her plan in action. She knew where Hinata lived from being teammates with Boruto. She made it to the house in no time flat and without being seen. Luckily the house was empty at the time giving Sarada the opportunity to sneak in. She found her way to Hinata's and Naruto's bedroom. She entered and made her way to a dresser in the room. She looked around and found a brush that she assumed Hinata always used. She inspected the brush and was excited to find a piece of hair needed to create the mask. She was about to leave when she thought she might need to steal one of Hinata's outfits as to not draw suspicion when she transformed. She went through some more drawers until she found the outfit she usually saw Hinata in (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/d/dd/Hinata_Boruto_Movie.png/revision/latest?cb=20150825081617\" target=\"_blank\">http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/naru...</a>). She grabbed the clothes and some underwear that would fit. She sweat dropped a bit when she questioned how she would fill out these proportions. Not wanting to waste anymore time, she packed everything up and left the room exactly as she found it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarada ran back home as quick as possible. The thrill of breaking into Naruto's house for materials and making the mask was really pumping her up. She got home and ran straight to the room. She placed the piece of Hinata's hair and activated the jutsu. In a puff a smoke, gone was the hair and in its place was a mask exactly in the likeness of Hinata. It had fair skin, empty eye holes, and dark blue hair framed the sides. Her excitement was at all time high looking at the mask. She then picked it up in her hands and... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarada picked up the Hinata mask in her hands. She could feel it's warm weight in her hands. It emanating an affectionate pulse as she flipped the mask over, gripping it tightly. Staring at the smooth inner surface she began to raise it towards her face. Her breathing grew slow and heavy. As she drew it closer still she could feel her hot breath rebound back at her. Sarada's hands shook lightly as the caring pulse became stronger. Hovering the mask above her face Sarada yelled at the top of her voice. \u201cOh I can't take this any more!\u201d Slamming the mask harshly into her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly the Hinata mask violently latched onto Sarada's face as she let out a low groan. Staggering backwards she winced from the force of the mask slapping into her. Clamping firmly onto her head the formerly ornate mask throbbed, creaking loudly throughout Sarada's room. Small tendrils launched out of the mask latching and grabbing coarsely onto strands of hair. Moaning softly Sarada could feel her chakra being gently but rapidly drawn from with her body. The mask softened to a more spongy flesh like feeling as it pressed down forcibly onto her face. Kneading and moulding at her soft facial features Sarada winced in discomfort, Hinata's features forcefully contorting her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG-gah!\u201d Sarada cried out, clamping her hands firmly around her head. \u201cThis isn't as enjoyable as I expected it to be!\u201d Suddenly Hinata's mask's bangs warped and distorted propelling themselves violently into Sarada's scalp. \u201cA-argh!\u201d she screamed letting out a cry as she felt them distressingly tunnel into her scalp, ripping away at her own dark onyx hair. Sarada groaned as the mask's 'hair' smothered her own locks, sharply pulling and tugging at her shoulder length hair. Whining as her hair lengthened ever so slightly level with her shoulders, taking on a slightly darker blue shade becoming much more refined and silky smooth. While still grasping her head the mask distorted deeply atop her somewhat anguish expression. Cringeworthy cracks echoed around Sarada's room as sick snapping signalled her jaw forcibly dislocating. She let out an muffled grunt as it snapped back into place, showing off Hinata's delicate jawline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarada shuddered as she could feel Hinata's invigorating chakra being funnelled into her adolescent form, warming and filling her with strength. Her body began to burn slightly as she could feel Hinata's chakra flooding throughout her body, shifting her fair complexion to a lighter tinge. Unexpectedly Sarada's eyes shuddered in agony. Her strained, bloodshot eyes speedily warped into sharingan tomoe only to dissipate instantly. Veins bulged vividly as Hinata's Byakugan briefly activated for a split second, Sarada shrieked out as her head was overloaded with information. It had taken Hinata years to fully master and develop her Byakugan, however Sarada lacked that training. Tears rolled down her face as she was overwhelmed with the sensory input, dropping to her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily Sarada panted, \u201cW-wha... what was that intense feeling, was that the Hyuga Kekkei Genkai!?\u201d She didn't have time to find answers to her question as she groaned, gritting her teeth as a sizeable pressure built up around her hips. Realising what was happening Sarada quickly closed her eyes and braced herself. Leaning over onto the floor she wrapped her arms around her chest. The sudden sound of bones cracking and snapping apart profoundly reverberated around the bedroom. She cried out as her hips flared outwards pressuring hard against her small shorts, filling them out and straining the fabric. \u201cU-uhh ahhhh!\u201d Sarada moaned as her rump ballooned to Hinata's motherly proportions, beginning to tear the slim shorts apart. Sarada howled as her waist fractured distressful inwards. Shaking her spine cracked savagely lengthening, snapping her back excruciatingly inwards revealing a refined curve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling over onto her back Sarada could still feel the mask writhing and transforming her, clamping down even more firmly and tightly. She shook as her thighs throbbed fleshing out, her knees popping. Her limbs clicked and cracked producing sickening grinding sounds as they ground together, her petite frame violently convulsed transforming into matured motherly dimensions. Letting out a strained moan she arched her back jutting her torso forward as a warming feeling welled in her chest. Her bosoms swelled briskly, quickly straining the sleeved qipao dress. \u201cI-it's getting rather tight and un-uncomfortable!\u201d Sarada panted as her chest continued to press and tear  her dress. Stopping expanding just before the material gave way the top resembled an ill-fitting crop-top, barely just able to hold Hinata's well developed bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGradually picking herself up off the bedroom floor, Sarada stumbled towards her mirror. Her feet tripping up on themselves not used to being this tall. Her balance unsteady from Hinata's sizeable rump and bosom. Clumsily Sarada collapsed on top of her drawer, Hinata's voluptuous bosom cushioning them impact. Blushing a little she braced herself up with her arms and gazed into the mirror. The mask slowly finally finished writhing into place and clamped firmly settling on Sarada's face. She felt awash with Hinata's memories and feelings as they compiled atop and partly replaced her own. \u201cIs this really me?\u201d Sarada questioned, gingerly grabbing the soft blushed cheeks. \u201cI never realised how gorgeous Mrs Uzumaki was, she looks so calm and gentle.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed loudly \u201cThat idiot Boruto and Hinawari are so lucky!\u201d Backing off slightly from the desktop mirror Sarada could begin to feel her former tattered clothes slip down Hinata's body slightly. Remembering she 'borrowed' a pair of Hinata's clothes she scuttled carefully over to her bed, not wanting to experience an extremely embarrassing wardrobe malfunction. On her bed she noticed laying in a pile next to it were her stashed folded up copy of Hinata's outfit, as well as the delicate white mask she had found with the scroll. She leant forward picking up gently the Kaguya mask in her hands. An ominous pulse emanated from the pale yet strangely graceful mask. Sarada flipped the Mask around in her hands stare into the smooth inside contours.</span></div></div>",

After years of the mask being in storage in the shrine, Naruto decided to move it back to his new place of residence with his family. Considering the jutsu scroll was a precious Uzumaki family heirloom and piece of history, Naruto decided to move it to his new place for safe keeping. He had thanked Sasuke for taking on the burden of its safe keeping and brought back the mask and scroll to his new home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Naruto brought it home, he went straight to the storage room of its house. Sitting in the room was a chest that he had constructed of strong chakra infused wood. Sitting on top of the chest was a special sealing tag of his design. He had done all of this in preparation of today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto quickly removed the seal tag and opened the wooden chest. No one was currently home but to Naruto, having around the scroll and the Kaguya mask in open was a little unnerving. As he was about to put the scroll and mask in the chest, he looked down and stared down at the items he held. In his left hand was the scroll with the knowledge to create masks, in his right was the mask of the mother of all chakra and the most fearsome opponent he had ever faced. He could've sworn he felt a pulse like sensation come from the Kaguya mask, as he continued to stare at the items. His eyes starting to haze over. To an outside observer it looked like he was standing in trance like state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's mind started to wander. His thoughts flooding with the idea of using the mask. He began to think back to when he first created the mask, he had never really tested to see if the transformation even worked. Plus even if it did work, he was the Hokage now, if anyone in the village could control the masks awesome power, it was him. Plus all it would take was a reversal seal tag and he would be back to normal. He would be lying if he wasn't the least bit curious to see what having the body of another person would be like. What could possibly go wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea that once would've seemed crazy, seemed now so enticing. In most cases Naruto would've never even thought to try on the mask, but little to his knowledge, the mask had other plans. While not sentient, the masks still held the desire to worn. From the moment Naruto first touched the mask at the shrine, it began its work. It released a minute amount of chakra into Naruto, that was sent directly to his subconscious. Like a subtle genjutsu, it secretly was planting the idea and curiosities of using the mask. To wear it and experience the transformation into another being. After directly holding it for the long, the mask finally sent out a pulse to activation it's subtle suggestion and have Naruto become it's wearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto couldn't get the thought of using the mask out of his, he just couldn't deal with it anymore. It was with that final though he decided to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was only just holding the thing, god forbid he actually wore it. Naruto let out a shudder. He didn't even want to imagine it. With the events of the mask behind them, Naruto just realized how much time had passed since he went to shrine. He had an meeting with Gaara, who had come to visit, in ten minutes.

With that he bolted out of the room, closing the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto rushed out of his and sped back to work.

Still curious to see if the mask worked though, Naruto came up with a new idea. Maybe he could convince his girlfriend Hinata to try it on. If there was anyone he trusted with knowledge of the mask, it was her. Plus, yhey were both female, so perhaps it might be more compatible. With his mind made up, Naruto packed the Uzumaki mask scroll, along with the Tsunade mask up in a back pack and decided to head over to Hinata's to see if he can find her.

I can send her home and no one it happened!\" It was the perfect idea, he thought. He was about to issue his command when another idea popped in his head. \"Well while I have Sakura here, it would be a nice opportunity to add another mask to my new collection.\" Naruto said aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Naruto went over to Sakura and plucked a hair from her head and brought it over to the seal array. He placed it on the seal and performed the jutsu. In a poof a smoke the jutsu activated and when all cleared, a Sakura mask was left in its place. Naruto took a second to marvel at the mask. He looked at it and at Sakura. Its features looked identical, even the diamond seal on its forehead was there. Naruto picke up the mask and brought it over to his bed and left it there, then walked back over to Sakura with his sharingan still active. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at her and told to forget everything she saw here. He told her to return home and make sure no see her leave his apartment. Sakura blankly nodded with half lidded eyes. She turned to the door with out a word, opened it, and made her way back to her home. Once there she snapped out of her trance. \"Wow!\" exclaimed Sakura, \"What was I going to do again? I seemed to have zoned out and lost track of time.\" Yawning a little and stretching, the drowsiness being an after affect from the sharingan genjutsu, Sakura thought to herself, 'Maybe a should take some time off from the extra rounds at the hospital.' and with that Sakura went about her day like nothing happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had watched Sakura leave and breathed out a sign of relief. \"Well thats one problem solved, lets take off this mask off, so I don't cause any other problems.\" With that Naruto looked at the scroll on how to remove a mask. He read over the notes again, and began to channel chakra to his hands. He brought his fingers to where he felt the mask would be. Naruto could briefly feel the edges of a mask and began to pull. As he did, felt the mask beginning to come loose. He felt his eyes returning to normal, saw his hair shifting back to blond, and his body shifting back towards his own. He felt the chakra of Sasuke receding back into the mask and the familiar feel of his own chakra flooding his body. His clothes also shifted back into that of his own as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the transformation back, Naruto looked into a mirror and saw himself looking back and the Sasuke mask in his hand. 'Wow!' he thought. \"That was wild!\" he couldn't believe the jutsu worked, and how well it did. He looked back down at the Sasuke mask in amazement, he then noticed the Sakura mask on his bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If the Sasuke mask worked, then so would the Sakura mask.' he thought. 'Sasuke is a guy though, would the Sakura mask even work with him?' he wondered. It never mention in the scroll. Becoming curious, Naruto began to come up with a plan to test out the new Sakura mask.

Naruto thought to himself, if there was anyone in this world he loved and trusted most, it was Hinata. He know she would be willing to try it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Naruto stopped by, the Hyuga Clan Residence to look for her. He gets to house, and knocks on the door. After a moment it opens revealing Hanabi, Hinata's younger sister. She was in the middle of combing her hair her with brush when she looked up to see Naruto standing there. \"Oh hey Naruto, you looking for Hinata?\" Hanabi asked. \"Yeah,\" he replied, \"Is she home? I wanted to talk to her.\" \"Sure,\" said Hanabi, \"I'll go grab her, give me one second.\" Hanabi turned and ran back into the house. As she ran back in a couple of loose strands of her brown hair fell from the comb that was in her hand. Noticing this, Naruto quickly picked them up and stored it in pocket. He could always add another mask to his collection in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, he saw Hinata come out of the house. \"Naruto, I wasn't expecting to see you today. Did you just come back from your trip to the Uzumaki Mask Shrine?\" Hinata asked. \"Yeah, I did earlier today. I stopped back at my apartment first to drop off some stuff. I was hoping if you weren't busy, you could come by and I could show you what I found!\" Said Naruto excitedly. Blushing a little, even after dating for almost year, the prospect of being alone with Naruto always made her flustered. Especially, since as of late, they had begun to have a more physical relationship. \"Sure!\" she replied. Hinata strapped on her sandals and left with Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey make it back to his apartment and he begins to tell Hinata of his trip. He mentions the scroll and tells her of his family history. He then brings up the mask jutsu and tells her all about it. To say she was amazed, was an understatement. Hinata couldn't believe that such a technique existed. She knew in the wrong hands it could be a dangerous technique, especially the risks that came with it. Hinata then asked if he created any masks yet, and Naruto showed her the Sasuke and Sakura mask. Telling her what had happened earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" said Hinata, \"That's some story Naruto.\" \"You're telling me,\" he said. \"It was weird, but kind of cool transforming into someone else. Kind of an out-of-body experience you know.\" Hinata began to blush when a thought came to her head. She then asked Naruto, \"Wait if you tried the Sasuke mask, have you tried the mask of Sakura?\" \"No!\" said Naruto. \"I haven't. I was nervous about doing something like that. Being physically transformed into girl is whole lot different than imitating one through an illusion. I was actually hoping maybe you might want to try it out, since you are already a girl.\" Hinata was a little saddened, did Naruto not like her appearance and still preferred Sakura? Seeing the look on her face, realized what was on her mind and went to reassure her. \"Hinata, I don't want you to think I prefer Sakura, over you or anything. I think you are and will always be the most beautiful girl out there. No one could compare, I just thought it was a cool jutsu and that could share it with you. If it's too weird, we can forget about it.\" Said Naruto. Realizing Naruto would always love her, and was just excited over a new jutsu, Hinata smiled as she felt relieved. She always knew he would love her, just as she loved him. She was about to say she would try the mask when Naruto said, \"If you want I'll try the Sasuke mask on again, that way we can try it together.\" Touched by the sentiment, Hinata replies..  </span></div></div>",

They had what looked like obvious wear and tear on them, but upon closer inspection saw strands of blond and red hair on the various items. At first Naruto was a little freaked out. It wasn't until he noticed the jutsu array still set up, that an idea had formed. If the hair was still intact, could he still create masks from it? The scroll never mentioned any limit. Deciding to test his theory, Naruto took the different colored strands over to the jutsu array and began to perform the hands signs. In a poof of smoke the jutsu activated. Once the smoke dissipated, what was left were to masks on the floor. What Naruto saw were the mask forms of the two people he could never forget, his parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcited that the jutsu had appeared to work, Naruto went to reach for one of the masks... </span></div></div>",

I was wondering if Hinata was currently home?\" Hanabi smiled, and replied, \"I'm doing well Naruto, and I'm sorry but Hinata isn't home right now.\" Her smile started to turn to a frown. \"Unfortunately while you were away, she was assigned a month long mission about a week ago from the Hokage. She told me to tell you she apologizes for not being here when you got back,\" said Hanabi. Hanabi and Hinata were pretty close, so the not seeing her sister for weeks, bummed her out.

He was really hoping to see her today, and now finds out he would have to wait another three weeks to see her. A bit crestfallen, Naruto decided to head back to his apartment. He still had to unpack from his trip, and possibly shower as well. Hanabi saw that Naruto was a bit sullen with the news and was about to offer Naruto some tea, but was cut off by Naruto bidding her adieu and thanking her for the information. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto made his way home to his apartment. Once there, he entered and went to his room and threw his stuff from his trip on the floor next to his bed. He then headed to his shower and started to get washed up from the all the grime and dirt of his trip. He then decided to get changed into a loose fitting t shirt and pair shorts. It was more casual than is usual ninja gear. The whole time Hinata was still on his mind as he flopped on his bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked at the wall and saw a picture recently taken of them. He had Hinata in his arms and they were both smiling. He wished he could hold her in arms right now. Her gentle smile, feeling of her soft skin. Naruto then let out a groan, as another thought entered his head. He and Hinata had recently began to become more intimate in their relationship recently. They had done just about everything shy of going all the way. It was this thought alone that made Hinata's absence that much worse. Now he couldn't get her out of his mind and it left him frustrated. Deciding to try get his mind off of her, Naruto went to put his stuff away from the trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went over and emptied the contents of his bag. He began putting away his usual ninja equipment, when he stumbled upon the scroll he brought back from the mask shrine. With his thoughts focused solely on Hinata, he had completely forgotten about it. Grabbing the scroll, Naruto brought it up onto his bed and unrolled it as he reread the contents of it again. He mostly spent time focusing on the mask jutsu. It did seem interesting, the idea of being able to physically transform oneself into that of another person. Naruto then started to think if the jutsu would still work and better yet, if it did, who he would want to make a mask of? Naruto pondered these thoughts as his eye made contact of the same picture of him and Hinata. Naruto continued to stare until a perverse plan started to formulate in his head. What about a mask of Hinata? What could it hurt right? It seemed fool proof. He would get the benefit of trying out the jutsu, as well at least seeing Hinata in some form. The scroll never mentioned how the transformation process felt to the user, but in his head he thought, what did he have to lose? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow excited to try it out, Naruto jumped off his bed and sprinted over to his bathroom and began rummaging around. He let out a loud, \"Yes!\" as he found the brush that Hinata left there. He inspected it, and found exactly what he needed. A dark blue strand of her hair. He then plucked it from the brush and ran into his room and over to the scroll. He then opened it up and copied the jutsu array on to the floor of his room. Naruto place the hair from Hinata on the array and activates the technique. There is poof of smoke. After a moment the smoke clears and in place of the hair strand was a perfect smooth porcelain mask of Hinata's face. Naruto had a grin from ear to ear. The mask's features matched Hinata's one for one. It even had her bangs that framed her face. The only thing that seemed off about it, were the eye holes of the mask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto now really excited, went to pick up the mask..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto picked up the Hinata mask from the ground in his hands. He could feel the warming weight of Hinata's chakra emanating in an affectionate pulse as he slowly flipped the mask over. Gripping it tightly he stared at the smooth inner surface. The Mask resembled Hinata perfectly on the outside, every detail reminded him painfully of not being able to see her for another long three weeks. He grinned a wide perverted smile as he slowly drew the mask closer to his face. He would try on her mask in her absence and nobody would be none the wiser about it. Naruto's breathing grew slow and heavy. As he drew Hinata's inner smooth mask surface closer to his face he felt his hot breath rebound off it's surface. Naruto increasing became more eager to know how the transformation felt. His hands shook lightly as the caring pulse grew unbearable. Hovering the mask above his head Naruto succumbed to the temptation.<br>\r\n\u201cHinata baby here I come!\u201d he cried out with a perverse blush on his face, slamming the mask harshly into his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Hinata's mask touched the surface of Naruto skin is slapped violently, latching onto Naruto's face as he let out a low groan. As he staggered backwards the once ornate mask clamped firmly onto his head, throbbing and creaking loudly throughout his room. Small tendrils launched out of the mask and latched on coarsely grabbing at the short stubby strands of Naruto's blonde hair. Moaning Naruto could feel his chakra being forcefully and rapidly drawn out of his body. The Mask pressed  took on a more spongy appearance as it pressed down forcibly onto his face. Kneading and molding at his rugged facial features Naruto winced in extreme discomfort as Hinata's forcefully contorted his own. Naruto suddenly grasped his head as the mask distorted deeply atop his anguished expression. Loud cringeworthy cracks echoed around his room as sick snaps signalled Naruto's broader jaw forcibly dislocating. He let out a low groan as it snapped back into place restructuring to Hinata's softer more delicate features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Hinata's Mask's bangs warped and distorted propelling themselves violently into Naruto's scalp. He let out a low cry as he felt them ripping into his short blond hair, groaning as he felt them smothering his own strands of hair. Whining  Naruto felt his hair lengthening to be level with his shoulders, taking on a slightly darker blue shade becoming much more refined and silky smooth. As his hair grew the mask continued to writhe on his face, small spindly needle like tendrils protruded from the surface of the twisting mass on his head. Abruptly the small tendrils snapped inwards digging into his skin, Naruto grunted in discomfort as from the root of the injection points his skin tone began to shift along his veins like a fire. Rapidly it spread around his body shifting his tone matched Hinata's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shuddered as he could feel Hinata's invigorating chakra being funnelled into his matured male body, filling him with a warming and gentle strength. However it didn't last for long as he could feel her chakra flooding into him flowing and burning throughout his body. His Adam\u2019s apple disappeared rapidly His eyes shuddered in agony. His strained bloodshot eyes warped rapidly around his head as they glazed over into Hinata's lavender pupils. His veins bulged vividly as Hinata's  Byakugan briefly activated for a split second, Naruto shrieked out in a tone not his own as his head was overloaded with information. It had taken Hinata years to fully master and develop her Byakugan, however Naruto regardless of his Six Sage prowess he lacked that training. Blood  trickled down his face as he was overwhelmed with the sensory input from the sudden activation of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing Heavily Naruto regained his composure as the overload wore off, however his relief was short lived as the worst was yet to come. Groaning and gritting his teeth as a sizeable pressure speedily built up around his groin. As his eyes began to water from the force upon his groin Naruto suddenly realised what was occurring.<br>\r\n\u201cN-No no no! I forgot that Hinata was fema-!\u201d he stuttered in a panic as she caught his leg on the bed's corner post, sending him flying face first into his bed. Slamming into the covers Naruto thrashed about, fighting against the fabric trying to get in a position to do something. However the pressure on his groin had reached it's peak. In desperation all Naruto could do is roll over onto his back, gripping the sheets tightly in his hands , thrusting his hips hastily into the air. Letting out a orgasmic scream his eyes rolled into the back of his head, his hips intensely in a spasm as his genitalia burrowed deep into his hips. Ferociously tearing at his insides they vigorously wrenched away remodelling. Mindless to the searing hot pain as he climaxed from the transformation induced high Naruto's groin settled down once it matched Hinata's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering his hips back down upon the bed Naruto panted heavily, feeling apprehensive about the vacant space between his thighs. As his breathing gradually became normal he looked towards his snug shorts and the creases that gave away   his- no Hinata's genitalia. He outstretched his hand and gingerly drew his hand towards the creases. Hesitantly he drew closer as his curiosity got the better of him. His breath becoming drawn out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden Naruto stopped. His hand hoovering in place began to tremble and shake. The mask's transformation hadn't finished. Catching Naruto off guard a sizible pressure built quickly on Naruto's hip, Naruto panic-stricken as he wasn't expecting this. The sharp sound of of bones snapping and cracking apart reverberating around the room profoundly. \u201cG-gah!\u201d Naruto screamed as his hips flared outwards, pressing firmly against his shorts stretching them to their breaking point. The sudden jarring motion of his hips flaring outwards toppled Naruto off balance, throwing him to the rugged flooring below. Landing harshly on his front using his hands to reduce his impact Naruto groaned, the Hinata mask still writhing away on his face. With his backside raised into the air Naruto moaned as his rump ballooned to Hinata's developed proportions, tearing the shorts wide open in multiple places. He howled as his waist fractured distressingly inwards. Naruto shook violently as his spine cracked savagely inwards revealing a refined curve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to recompose himself Naruto rolled over onto his back unable to get his bearings. He could still feel the mask writhing and reconstructing him, as it clamped down more firmly and tight. With his eyes trembling in excruciating agony  Naruto watched as his thighs throbbed and fleshed out, harsh clicks could be heard as his knees popped out of place. His limbs clicked and cracked producing sickening grinding sounds as the bones ground together, his bulky male frame convulsed together shrinking down to Hinata's adult dimensions. Letting out a strained euphoric moan he arched his back, jutting out his torso as his chest burned furiously. Naruto's now softer front began to form two small budding mounds that pressed lightly against his loose-fitting shirt. Gradually they filled out, developing and straining against the once baggy shirt. Stopping before his bosom burst the material his chest revealed Naruto's now softer smooth stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto slowly picked himself off the floor, continuing to pant and moan blissfully as he could feel oestrogen coursing through out his body. His balance sent ajar as Hinata's generous proportions swayed around freely Naruto careened forward. Off balance his feet slipped sending him staggering and stumbling into the bed. Hinata's voluptuous bosom cushioning his crash landing into his scrunched up sheets. Lifting up his head from the soft covers he groaned as the mask settled securely on his face, he flopped his sore body limply across the mattress.Panting lightly as he lay across the mattress Naruto decided....</span></div></div>",

He found her fun to hang out with whenever she would tag along with him and Hinata, and figured he would see how she was doing. They started to chat a bit, before Hanabi offered to Naruto to come inside for tea. Not wanting to be rude, Naruto accepted and followed her inside. Hanabi put some tea on, as they continued to chat about things going on in the village. After a few minutes Hanabi had left to grab the tea, and reentered the room moments later, with two cups of tea in hand. As she was sitting back down, she noticed the wound up scroll next to Naruto. Curious, Hanabi asked him about it. \"So Naruto, how was your trip, and whats with the scroll you have there?\" Naruto had completely forgotten of the scroll that he had found at the mask shrine. He knew the it could potentially be dangerous jutsu in the wrong hands, but this was Hanabi. She basically family to him, he knew he could trust her. Naruto then decides to unravel the scroll and tell Hanabi of his trip to the mask shrine, the Uzumaki history, and of the jutsu they had sealed away. Hanabi was amazed when she heard of the jutsu. It seemed interesting, she wondered if Naruto had tried it out yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So have you tried the jutsu out yet?\" Hanabi asked him. \"Not yet,\" stated Naruto, \"You are the first person I've talked to since returning to the village, so I haven't had much of a chance to.\" This left Hanabi even more curious to see the jutsu and its results. Deciding to take initiative, Hanabi then asked, \"Could I try to mask jutsu?\" Naruto was surprised he didn't Hanabi would be interested in something like that, but to be honest he was curious himself to see the results.\" Alright, I don't see any harm. So who would you want to make a mask of?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi thought about it for a moment. If she could physically be someone else in the village, who would it be?

If there's anyone I could be, it would definitely be her!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was an interesting idea to Naruto. He did want to see the jutsu in action, and Hanabi was offering to try it out. Couple with the fact he would in sense be able to see Hinata, at least in some form, left Naruto being completely on board with the plan. \"Okay Hanabi, that sounds like a plan.We will make a mask of Hinata, and I'll let you try it on. After that though, you'll have to remove it. Do we have a deal?\" stated Naruto extending out his hand. She shook it. \"Deal!\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lead Naruto to Hinata's room. They shut the door behind them and went to work. Naruto began to draw out the jutsu array on the floor of the room, while Hanabi searched for Hinata's hair brush. As Naruto finished drawing the array just as the scroll stated, Hanabi came over with Hinata's brush and plucked a strand of dark blue hair. Naruto instructed to place the strand of hair on the array and to step back. He then did the hands signs and activated the jutsu. There was a puff of smoke. As the smoke faded, gone was the strand of Hinata's hair, and in its place was a mask in her exact image. It looked to made of smooth porcelain. Its features matched Hinata's one for one. It even had her bangs that framed her face. The only thing amiss were the eye holes of the mask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi picked up the mask and felt a warm pulse emanate from it. It felt warm and somehow distinctly Hinata's. The mask seemed to entrance Hanabi as her fingers traced the contours of the mask. Hanabi turned the mask over, and began to bring the mask to her face. Her breathing back to quicken the closer the mask came to her face. She felt her heart pounding, the mask was mere inches from her face before...</span></div></div>",

She nearly dropped the mask as she tried to stop herself at laughing at the situation. She turned to see Naruto with an embarrassed look on his face. \"Sorry Hanabi, I guess since I was so interested in the mask and such, that I forgot to eat lunch. If you haven't eaten yet, I'll run out and grab us some Ichiraku. My treat!\" exclaimed Naruto. Thinking about it, Hanabi hadn't had lunch yet and was a little hungry. Deciding to take Naruto up on his offer, Hanabi said, \"Sure Naruto, I'll take some ramen.\" With a smile and ramen on the brain, Naruto got up excitedly and ran to the door. He turned around and said, \"I'll be back in about 30 minutes with lunch Hanabi, be back soon!\" and then shut the door as he ran to his favorite ramen stand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi sat there mask in hand, lost in thought. To her, Naruto was a weird guy, but someone she respected and treated her sister well. Hanabi let a sigh, slightly jealous of Hinata. She found a good guy in Naruto, and hoped she could experience the same when she grew up. She then looked down and saw the mask of her sister still in hand. It was then an idea formed in Hanabi head. What if she explore the possibility of having a guy like Naruto when she grew up right now? She had Hinata's mask. If she put it on, she could surprise Naruto with a lunch date with his \"Hinata,\" when he got back. Hanabi had to admit, she did have a slight crush on Naruto, ever since he and Hinata saved her from be captured on the moon by Tonrei. The more she thought about it, the better and better it seemed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there Hanabi began to bring the mask closer to her face again. She always idolized her sister growing up and the idea of being her, for even a day seemed amazing. Hanabi felt a familiar warm pulse emanate from the mask. The mask began to entrance Hanabi again, as her eyes hazed over. Only the thought of being her older sister was present in her mind as she brought it mere inches to her face. Her breathing hastened. \"This is it!\" she said as...  </span></div></div>",

She would be stuck here and back in school again. that would be funny.\" Hanabi though. Okay after lunch she would need to have naruto make a mask of her and then try the Hinata mask out. Since she was in Hinata's room Hanabi got out a nice set of clothing that Hinata would likely were on a date with Naruto and set them aside for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto appeared in the door and had two bowls of ramen in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Naruto before we start lunch can I ask you to make on more of those masked for me\" Hanabi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure but who will it be of\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your going to make a mask of me.

Odd may not have been the word it warm and gentle like begin held by her mother that one time. The mask fit in place and the changes started. She felt her face merge with  the mask and then her face started to burn with so much pain she though she would pass out. But the pain stop and Hanabi looked around the ground seemed to be moving a little bit further from her. She looked at her hand and found that her nails and finger had gotten longer. But her arms as well grew. She turned to look in the mirror that Hinata kept  in her closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked in the mirror she saw herself change little by little to match Hinata. Her breast started to grow so they where full d cup like Hinata and they hung out of the now over full kimono. The kimono also just barely covered thighs going down to what seemed to be about a quarter ways down. Her shoes had become so tight it felt like the blood was going to stop flowing to them. she pulled them off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hips and butt expanded so that the underwear was ripped about half way down. Well it was a good thing they were in Hinata's Room right now. she could use all her stuff. But first she needed to get out of this out fit. throwing the small outfit on the floor she grabbed the shorts and top that Hinata always wore now a days. (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/weissdrum/art/Hinata-Hyuga-The-Last-Render-606237678\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.deviantart.com/weissdrum/art...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith herself fully clothed she called in Naruto to ask how she looked and to get him to show her how the mask comes off. Naruto comes in and see the girl he has been dating and was amazed by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay so how do I get this off me now\" Hanabi asked. Naruto was so stunned that he just point at the scroll. Hanabi read the final bite of information. It seemed that the only way to remove the mask was to have the person who put it on gad it and pull it off. Hanabi ushered Naruto out of the room and then started to remove the mask. Again there was a bit of pain but she could live with it right now. Now that her clothing was in ruins all she could do was put the Hinata mask back on and try to make it to her room with out begin seen. So back on the mask went this time the pain was barely even there it felt like pin pricks on her body now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to the scroll one more time in her new Hinata form and continued to read the last of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I am able to take the mask off. But if left on for more then a day the mask will be permanent it seems. This is kind of what I always want. To be the older sister and have the freedom that I always wanted. Well I do have the mask of me and if I place it on Hinata she will become me for good. I am really looking forward to this now\" Hanabi spoke to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi decided she would have lunch with Naruto as herself and and leave Hinata's clothing and the mask in her room till Hinata came back.</span></div></div>",

Of course she snuck more of Hinata's outfits into her room as well. Soon she relies ed that Hinata would see the clothing missing and wonder where it had gone to . So she did the only thing she could really think of at the time and replaced them with a few of her own. This would work out perfect for her. That way when Hinata did get the mask put on her she would have something that fit her right there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi smiled and went back to her room to grab a few more outfits to put in Hinata's Closet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing that Hanabi though how she would get hinata to wear the mask. She could always force it onto her and leave it at that but that was no fun. Hanabi wanted Hinata to ask for her to put the mask on her face. Yes that what Hanabi wanted to happen. Now that it was set she  just needed Hinata to come home and that would be in a day or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Two Days later. </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata arrived home happy to see both her father and sister. She need to take a bath and get changed after that long mission. So she went to her room and grab one of the outfits out of the closet not realizing it was Hanabi kimono.

She placed her thing in the basket and put her used clothing in a bin to be washed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go Hinata I will take those clothes to the wash room and then join you' Hanabi said. Hinata smile and handed Hanabi the used clothing. Hinata though it was funny that Hanabi was doing all this but she really need this bath.

He asked me to look after it for him till he got back\" Hanabi said. Hinata remembered that Naruto was on a quick solo mission for the hokage and would be away for a few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well can i see it please\" Hinata asked. Hanabi though this would happen and she now had a way to get Hinata to try on the mask. But she would need to be the one that put it on her face so that after leaving it on for 24 hours Hinata would be a new and permanent Hanabi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay but you need to do something for me first only i can touch it he said no one else\" Hanabi told her. Hinata though it was a little strange but she know how naruto could be some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay that is fine. How about right after we get out you can show it to me\" Hinata said. Hanabi smiled and started to get out. She dried off and put on the clothing she had brought with her. She grabbed the case and left . But not before saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay meet me in my room so i know it is safe there\" Hanabi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata yelled okay and started to drain the water from the tube. She made sure to clean up what she could and then head over to grab her clothes. Well what she though were her clothing. her underwear and bra went on just fine but when it came to the kimono it was small and did not even come close to covering her up. the top half of her breast and nipple where hanging out. it was then that she realized who outfit this was. Hanabi out fit must have been mixed in her laundry on one of the day's she was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer room was down the hall and to the left and she would need to run. She did and just missed the maids come into the bathroom to finish cleaning. She ducked into her room and took of the kimono and place it on her bed. then went to the closet to find and outfit that actually fit her. After a quick search of her closest all she found were Hanabi's outfits. So where were all of hers. She place the kimono back on and headed for Hanabi's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knock quick and asked to come in. Hanabi let her in quickly and then locked the door. Hinata did not even look at Hanabi and just went to her closet to see if any of her clothing was there. Hanabi know this would happen and hide all the outfits she had taken and made sure only her's where in the closet at this time. Hinata finding none of her clothing turn to face Hanabi. What she saw shocked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi was wearing on of her outfits. (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/marcinha20/art/PNG-Hyuga-Hinata-The-Last-508907784\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.deviantart.com/marcinha20/ar...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sis I say that outfit looks good on you. But it would fit better if you were smaller\" Hanabi said well lightly laughing. Hinata sat down on the be embarrassed and only after relaxing with a few deep breaths asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hanabi what are you doing with my clothing\" Hinata said. Once again Hanabi just smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i Always like this outfit and the maid put it in my closet so I though you would not mind. but enough about the clothing this is what you wanted to see right\" Hanabi pulled out the case and opened it up then pulled out the mask. Hinata noticed that there was what looked like a second one in there as well. But she remained focused on the one in Hanabi's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi had it so the mask was facing up and you could see what was on it. Hinata noticed it looked like Hanabi face just a bit and wondered why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what do you think dear sister is it not nice\" Hanabi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is very nice and it looks a little bit like you. So why did Naruto-kun ask you to look after it\" Hinata asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well can you keep a secret Hinata if you try it on you will understand why he did that\" Hanabi said. Hinata looked and now really wanted to know what that meant. So she got up off the bed and walk the very short distance to her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just relax and i will put the mask on you. So dont move\" Hanabi said. Hinata leaned down to make it easier for Hanabi to put it on and Hanabi slowly pushed it onto Hinata's face. Hinata felt pain in her whole body she turned and saw a mirror that Hanabi uses to get dress and saw the mask start to meld with her face. She watch as she started to shrink and lose her body figure. Her hair started to turn to a shade of brown rather then the dark purple it was. She watched as Hanabi walked up beside her and they were made to look like twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well is this not nice this is why Naruto-kun asked me to look after this mask so that someone does not use it. From what he told me it can only be remove after 26 hours are up\" Hanabi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata could on look on as the mirror image of her self and hanabi move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Naruto did leave another one with me as well. See this one looks like you though and if Hinata goes missing for a day everyone will be all over it. So i will wear this if that is okay with you\" Hanabi said. Hinata though about what she said and it made sense to her. She would need to be Hanabi for at least 26 hours. So it should be okay for one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright if it is just one day everything will be fine then so go ahead and wear it\" Hinata said. Hanabi was happy she was about to become Hinata and get everything she wanted. From her body to her boyfriend it would all be her's now and forever. She placed the mask on her face and the transformation was underway. Hinata got to watch as Hanabi's hair changed from brown to the dark purple that she had. She also say Hanabi start to grow and fill the outfit that she was wearing. That got her think maybe Hanabi wanted this to happen and planned it all out. Well at least her outfit was properly fit to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do next Hanabi though.......</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">After learning of his family heritage and having dealt with the threat of Kaguya Ootsutsuki, Naruto decides to take some time to wander the old ruins of the old Uzumaki Mask Shrine in search of some information of his clan. While wandering around the shrine, Naruto discovers a new Jutsu that allows for him to create special clone transformation masks of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(The time setting is that of after Manga Chapter 699, but can also be after the events of Naruto the Movie: The Last. If you want to jump to after the Boruto movie, go for it as well.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe discovers that as long as he is able to gather some form of their DNA (Hair, blood, etc) or chakra, he can create special masks that allow the wearer of said mask to physically transform into an exact clone of who ever the mask was modeled after. (Think of the masks from Majora's Mask for an idea of what the style of the transformation masks would look like).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wearer of the mask can only return to normal by applying a special seal tag to the forehead of the mask wearer. From here the transformation of the wearer's body would be reversed, allowing for the mask to then be removed from the wearer. The transformation has a trade off though, the wearer will gradually take on the personality of the mask, and after three full days of wearing the mask, the transformation will become virtually permanent with the wearer becoming an exact clone of the mask. Most wearers end up becoming lost in their new personality and only those with a strong sense of will can remember their lives prior to mask at that point. The only hope of returning to their an original body at that point is if a powerful Uzumaki is able to infuse their potent chakra into the seal tag and separate the mask from the user. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(I was really inspired by the mask transformation sequences from Majora's Mask when it came to the jutsu. I was thinking it would look similar in style to the Majora's mask transformation, but with the body visibly changing physically. As to how it feels during the change, I just put some thought into that. To the outside observer, it might appear as a painful process, but to the wearer it would actually be that of a pleasurable one. Knowing that a physical change of their bodies would be painful, the Uzumaki implemented in the jutsu a way for the wearer's pain receptors in the brain to be dulled and for the pleasure sensors to be triggered to help ease through the transformation. Sure once the wearer first puts the mask on and the transformation begins, it might be painful in the beginning as they feel their body begin to shift to it's new form, but it soon transitions to that of pleasure. I'd imagine it to be the same way with either a transformation of the same gender or that of one to another. I was thinking thats one way in some users become addicted to the use of the masks and not only the feeling of having a new body and being a different person, but also the feeling from the transformation itself. This can lead the story into some situations that might be a little NSFW, but hey that's for however the contributor wants to go with it.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho will Naruto create masks of? Who will wear those masks? What fun, or disaster will come from this new technique? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel free to add to the story. Additions are always welcome.</td>",
