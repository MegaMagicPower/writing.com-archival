I'll list the characters here. You can think of specifics yourself, if you'd like! Though of course, I'll give some options below to start you off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProtagonist (whose perspective you're writing from): <b>Grant Leonard</b><br>\r\nAge: 20<br>\r\nAppearance: Brown hair, light tan skin, hazel eyes, athletic build.<br>\r\nPersonality: Jokes around at bad times, bad at following directions, likes to roughhouse. He is usually content and nice, but he also likes to cause trouble. He plays baseball. He is actually pretty observant.<br>\r\n???: He loves to explore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacter 1: <b>Liam Harley</b><br>\r\nAge: 19<br>\r\nAppearance: Blond hair, light skin, blue eyes, his weight is in \"all the right areas\".<br>\r\nPersonality: Quiet, a bit shy. Likes to be given directions, becomes a bit frantic without any. Likes to stay home and tweet about anything that comes to mind, he takes a lot of selfies. Usually walks around with a neutral expression. Secretly, he doesn't like to share his belongings with others. He is in Grant's Psychology Class and both of them eat at the cafeteria together after class ends.<br>\r\n???: He eats a lot of junk food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacter 2: <b>Mason Kowalski</b><br>\r\nAge: 18<br>\r\nAppearance: Black hair, pale skin, many freckles, green eyes. He has a thinner build.<br>\r\nPersonality: Loves to make fun of people for no real reason. He is very stubborn and difficult to convince to do something. He plays tennis. He's cocky and arrogant, though if he's told to shut up he will quickly silence himself. Walks around with a smirk, usually. He and Grant are next door neighbors.<br>\r\n???: He loves his \"lucky\" articles of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacter 3: <b>Ethan Buccho</b><br>\r\nAge: 20<br>\r\nAppearance: Dark brown hair, tan skin, brown eyes. Has a chubby build, he's more of a cub than twink.<br>\r\nPersonality: Likes to play around but can get carried away. Is usually more on the gentle side until you get to know him. Very affectionate and kind, easy to make friends with. He plays the piano for the school band. He sometimes underestimates his bodily size and how much space he takes up. Grant plays the bass guitar in the school band, which is how they know each other.<br>\r\n???: He likes to pretend he doesn't know things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacter 4: <b>Dustin Lugo-Madera</b><br>\r\nAge: 19<br>\r\nAppearance: Buzz cut hair, usually wears a backwards cap. Tan skin, dark brown eyes, and an athletic build. He's a muscle twink.<br>\r\nPersonality: A member of Grant's baseball team. He's good at telling jokes, and loves to show off his muscles. He's a hard worker and very confident in his abilities, he has no trouble standing up for himself. He dislikes being told what to do unless it's mutually beneficial. Dustin and Grant are close friends.<br>\r\n???: He isn't afraid of doing gross things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you know which characters are available, which route will Grant start? <br>\r\n(I'll write a brief start to each one, just so each choice can branch off 5 times.)</span></div></div>",

Maybe we're better off not knowing.\" He commented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckled. \"Maybe. Wanna grab a bite?\" I offered, gesturing my thumb behind me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it.\" He beamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of us began to walk toward the cafeteria, side by side, now talking about the dreaded exam next week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was our bi-weekly thing. We got dinner together at the cafeteria after class, an hour before it closed. At first, I invited him just to be nice, since we were talking after class. As we ate, we found out we had some things in common, like how we both played some of the same games. I played much less than him, since I focused more on my studies, though I could hardly imagine how much he played to be as good as he is. He was actually famous in the online community for the game, I could hardly believe I was talking to someone who had that reputation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we walked down the hall, I felt myself get dizzy. The hall seemed to stretch and blur, the door we were headed towards seemed to shoot five hundred feet away. My stomach lurched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I don't feel so hot.\" I uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Liam asked, an excitement in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stumbled to the side, spotting a water fountain nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I drank, I closed my eyes, but I didn't feel them open, nor did I feel the water on my face anymore. A hollow feeling overcame me, and a wave of calmness quickly soothed my dizziness and hollow feeling. Yet, I couldn't move, and I felt myself quickly lose consciousness.</span></div></div>",

It was a moment before my eyes adjusted and what met my eyes caused my head to thump even harder.

Well this\u201d you finish halfheartedly still trying to process the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the platform shake as Liam shifted what you now realised was his hand, bringing you close to his chest. He flicked his head back and forth as if expecting the culprit to leap out at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat should I do\u201d he muttered to himself clearly unnerved by the situation at hand. Liam\u2019s eyes dart between you, his pocket and the various exits to the hallway. Before you can speak up a deep rumbling interrupts both your and Liam\u2019s thoughts as his belly gurgles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you still hungry\u201d you say exasperated, the funny sound temporarily diffusing the strangeness of the situation.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Grant!!\"<br>\r\nThis is so annoying, you can hear Liam but he cant hear you, but you continue to climb towards the top of the counter, you run towards the basin in the sink and jumps right in, making a cannonball, and to your luck this was enough for Liam to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are! wow how did you manage to get here in your condition??\" Liam asks curiously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"wasn't that hard, but how did i get in this situation to begin with?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" i am not sure about that myself, al of a sudden you just collapsed and begin to shrink so i acted fast and put you in my pocket and brought you home with me, who knows what could have happen if i just left you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thank you, you probably saved my life there, but, now how to figure out how to get me back to normal size again.  </span></div></div>",

Liam begin to buck his hips up and down, mouth fucking Dustin, that gets taken by surprise and begins to cough around his cock, a mix of saliva and cum drips down from Dustin's mouth.

I never would've guessed the boy giving me a ride home would be behind me.\" I replied, bitterly, looking down at the figure before me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shucks, Grant! Sharp as a nail!\" He goaded, shoving his face in mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't flinch, since this was typical behavior of my next door neighbor, Mason. He always did his best to be intimidating, but it's not as though a cheery face could ever make someone be afraid. In fact, I became so immune to it, that at times, we would butt heads or our noses would collide. I couldn't help but wonder at times how he would feel if our mouths collided instead. Not that I wanted that, I only vaguely liked him, but those kind of invasive thoughts tend to appear without warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you thinking about, genius?\" He inquired, tilting his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realized I was still looking at him. \"Going to the car.\" I lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a step back and pouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just gonna fall asleep, I bet.\" He huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet I am, too.\" I chuckled, trying to walk past him, but he stepping in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave him a quizzical look, and this reaction seemed to satisfy him greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could tell he needed some attention, that's why he was doing this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can just <i>ask</i> to hang out. You don't need to make me think that you want to, then have me ask if you want to.\" I complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you'd never ask! Why don't we go to McDonald's? We haven't had it together in a while.\" He beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy brain quickly reminded me that we used to play baseball together as kids, and our parents would take us to McDonald's after each game. I felt guilty, somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, we can go to McDonald's.\" I said, caving in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cheered, and quickly ran out into the parking lot, leaving hand prints on the glass doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. So much for getting home in a timely manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I strode across the parking lot, he ran up to me and grabbed my wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, <i>grandpa</i>! It'll close before you get to the car!\" He protested, now sprinting, and me stumbling to match his pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was reluctantly sat in the passenger's seat, Mason quickly performed the most horrific reverse pull-out I'd ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm awake <i>now</i>.\" I laughed. Mason scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive was quiet. I wondered if that comment actually hurt his feelings, but then I felt my eyelids close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI told myself he'd be mad if I fell asleep, though part of me said he expected it anyway, so he wouldn't be. We weren't even talking. He would just wake me up and drag me inside once we got there, for sure.</span></div></div>",

He was on everybody's good side, no one had anything bad to say about him. I saw him hug a lot of his friends nearly every time he saw them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan had been playing Piano for a decade, though I had begun Guitar in sophomore year of high school. I was initially alarmed by his request to practice with me, in fact--I thought he was going to criticize my playing. Not that he would, but it just seemed so strange for him to suddenly ask to practice with me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough I had just been jamming, playing along random chords and notes, I began to hear quiet responses on the piano. I intentionally began to leave silences for him to fill. I snuck a peek at his face, and he had on a thrilled grin. I myself picked up a smirk, and began to strum wildly, he began to hammer about randomly on the piano before finally, from right to left, slid a finger across the keyboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both looked at each other and laughed, though we were quickly silenced by our conductor barging in. With a hint of amusement in his voice, he asked us to practice more seriously. We nodded and got to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe practiced for hours, though oddly, it didn't get boring. Had I practiced with a Sax or Trumpet, I would've lost my mind a while ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan checked his phone and was alarmed by the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shoot! I missed it!\" He gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I--\" I began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not your fault. I should've set a time for how long we should've practiced.\" He sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you miss?\" I asked, hoping it was a TV show that I could direct him to find online.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was in an online auction. A good way to win is to place a high bid last second, though I forgot to check on my first bid to see if anyone outbid me. The bid ended already though, I don't think I won.\" He mumbled, tapping away at his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was kind of silenced, that sort of thing wasn't typically talked about in casual conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you bid on?\" I questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe instantly flustered. \"I plead the fifth!\" He stammered, comically. That was a famous catchphrase of his, apparently, though it didn't quiet my curiosity any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it porn or something?\" I teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, not at all!\" He frantically stumbled. \"Just forget about it.\" He mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at my phone, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ought to be going, actually. It is kinda late. My friend drives me home, I'd hate to keep him waiting.\" I explained, turning to put my guitar in its case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can take you home today...\" Ethan shyly offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blinked at him in confusion. Why would he offer to take me home when I said I already had a ride? This also felt strange, in addition to him wanting to practice with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you want to practice with me today for a specific reason?\" I inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed to freeze up a bit at the question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, not really. It's just that I don't know you very well. Can I ask a favor?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah?\" I responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me take you home.\" He insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI scratched the back of my head. This felt really weird all of the sudden. \"I...guess I can. Let me text my friend.\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I sent the message, I looked over at Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded. \"Thanks. Now...go to sleep!\" He demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith great shock I realized that I was, in fact, falling unconscious...</span></div></div>",
