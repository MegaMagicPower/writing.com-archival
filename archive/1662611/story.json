Then you start messaging the toes, getting your fingers in between them. You then start rubbing the claw sheaths, hours pass after finally finishing the right foot as you move to the left one rubbing his sweaty sole \"hang on a second Tyler!\" hawkmon says \"I've got other plans for you!\" he said with an evil smirk \"what now?\" you say nervous.</span></div></div>",

I just tell you what to do because I want the best for you!\" Tyler exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well guess what, you are going to listen to ME now! Or else...\" Hawkmon said as he raised his rough clawed foot on top of Tyler reminding him about the stomp warning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO WAIT I'LL DO IT, I'LL DO IT!\". Tyler shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler approached Hawkmon's smooth yellow feet carefully, not wanting to anger his \"friend\" by any reason. He hesitated for a while, until he finally stuck his tongue out of his mouth to drag it up and down his digimon's nasty feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it Tyler, I want you to get every drop of sweat from my feet. I wanna see my face in them!\" Hawkmon ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler slid his tongue along Hawkmon's soles with all his strength, getting every inch of sweat and dirt from them while Hawkmon enjoyed his new position in his house. Every now and then, he wiggled his toes and moved his feet from side to side, making it harder for Tyler to clean his sore feet. By that evil smirk in his face, he could tell that Hawkmon was enjoying every second of Tyler's humiliation in front of his giant digimon feet. After a good half an hour, Hawkmon told Tyler to stop, making him fall down completely exhausted due to this long worshipping session...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been a very good servant, but I'm not done yet...\" Hawkmon said.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You will now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm a human being, not your pet or slave,\" you say, clenching your fists tight. \"Go ahead and 'punish' me as you see fit, but I'm not going to do what you tell me to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFury rose up in Hawkmon. He'd spent his entire time here doing what you told him to do. Now, he finally has control over you, and you aren't even going to listen to him! It's just ridiculous! \"...aw, you're no fun,\" Hawkmon frowns, drooping down in sadness. \"I'd never intentionally hurt you...I just wanted to be the bigger bird for once. You're always telling me what to do, and I just wanted to see what it feels like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but feel sorry for the bird, so you give his talon a light hug. \"I only tell you what to do because I'm looking out for you. Staying up late will make you sleep in, and you'll be tired tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHawkmon thinks for a moment, then smiles weakly. \"I...guess that makes sense. So...now what?\"</span></div></div>",

You kneel before his soles, looking up at his eyes which changed from sad to curious.  \"Tyler, what are you...?\" he is interrupted as you then start to message the rough-skinned feet by pressing your hands against them as hard as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wink at your \"master\" as you rub the digimon's feet.  \"Ohhh I get it.....ok then, *ahem* puny human, as your ruler, I demand that you message my sore feet!\" Hawkmon says making his voice deeper with an obviously fake look of impatience.  \"Yes my lord, I will do my duty as a worthless human slave!\"  You say trying your best to sooth the aches on the digimon's soles.
