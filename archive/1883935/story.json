Her name is Akuha Bloodriver, the Eclipse.

Your mother, Satsuki, was the leader of a very powerful clan. So powerful that it was tied with the Seiryu clan. making them the two most powerful clans in the entire world. And your father, Rihito, was the leader of the Seiryu clan. When they united to be together, so did the clans. Making the Seiryu the clan that possessed the strongest and most powerful warriors and spellcasters (wizards, witches, mages, etc...) in the world. Not a year after their marriage, they had their first two descendants, your older sister, Momoko and your older brother, Saito. One year later, your older sister, Yuki, was born. And, two years later, you were born, however, your power was, by far, bigger and stronger than those of anyone else on the clan, even though you were a baby. In fact, your power was so much, that your parents had to make 6 seals to contain it. Otherwise, your body would have been destroyed. You were that powerful for many factors, they being that you were born with the power of Chaos, that is, the power to control the elements of <span class=\"cred\">Fire</span>, <span class=\"clblue\">Water</span>, <span class=\"cbrown\">Earth</span>, <span class=\"clgrey\">Wind</span>, <span class=\"cbyellow\">Lightning</span>, <span class=\"clteal\">Ice</span>, <span class=\"cgreen\">Nature</span>, <span class=\"cgrey\">Metal</span>, Light and <span class=\"cgrape\">Darkness</span>. You loved your family, and, even though your clan was a warriors and spellcasters one, you lived in relative peace. However, one day, on your fifth birthday to precise, your clan was murdered by an extremely powerful woman who called herself Akuha Bloodriver or Sailor Eclipse, and her minions. The most powerful ones being Naraku and Galaxia, also, it was clear that both, Naraku and Galaxia were Bloodriver's second and third in command respectively, since they had their own underlings. The three of them attacked your clan's village and destroyed everything and everyone that came into their view. But your clan did fought back and caused many casualties on Eclipse's side. But, differently from your family, that had a heart, those three had none, thus, it didn't mattered to them if one of their own fell. Eventually, the trio reached the house of the main family, your family. They killed everyone, but not before doing horrible things to them, like torturing them, among other things. They only left you live because Akuha thought it would be amusing to see how you struggled to live. And, to make it harder, they sent you to another world. The world of Felarya. However, they forgot to check if you had anything on you when they threw you into the portal. Thus, you were able to take your clan's sword with you. At first, you thought that it was the most beautiful place you had ever seen. That left you confused. Why would they transport you to a place like this? However, on the very first day, you got your answer, after being chased by a giant female fairy. What left you more surprised was that she was naked. But, thanks to your powers (even though you didn't knew how to use most of them), you managed to escape. Now, 13 years later (meaning that you had 18 years), you had learned how to use some of your power, since most remained sealed. That helped you to survive and avoid being eaten by beautiful, yet hungry and deadly predators. You also learned many things about Felarya, like, the fact that, thanks to how much magic there was here, your powers were even stronger than on Earth. However, there was one thing that never changed. Your desire of revenge. Revenge on Bloodriver and her minions. But, you didn't looked for them. You knew that, eventually, they would come for you, thus, you focused on training to get stronger and surviving, while you wandered around Felarya, without a certain course. You just went where the wind took you. You had been in several towns, but you restrained from making friends. One, because you had trouble trusting others. But ,the main reason was that, when the time for you to face Bloodriver came, you didn't wanted anyone to be harmed for something that concerned your clan only. That, however, made you feel very lonely. Eventually, your trips took you to a place that was, simply the most beautiful place you ever saw. If your memory served you well, it was called \"The Chordoni Waterfalls\" and it looked like this: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://karbo.deviantart.com/art/Chordoni-waterfalls-251782444?q=gallery%3AKarbo%2F36723459&amp;qo=7.\" target=\"_blank\">http://karbo.deviantart.com/art/Chordoni...</a> You heard many times about this place and about it's residents. Today, you were wearing your usual clothing, which consisted in black and a bit elastic pants, black t-shirt, black track shooes, black legitimate leather jacket, black sun-glasses, a black stetson hat and a black belt with a buckle that had a silver skull in the center of a silver made iron cross that was crimson-red colored. On your belt, was your clan's sword, securely atached. You walked through the grass, admiring how beautiful this place was. Also, you found this place somewhat, nostalgic. Although you never were here before, thus, you didn't knew why you felt like that. You searched for a couple of hours before you found the reason. And it was a field of flowers. These specific flowers were called, \"The Nocturnal Keepers\". They were called like that for two reasons. One, they only bloomed at night. Specificly, when the moon was full and at it's climax. And second, because, with certain types of magic, one could see what had transpired on the past. The more powerful the magic usesd was, the farther into the past one could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"These flowers, are just like the ones my family had.\"</span>, you said, thinking aloud and letting a tear roll down your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to you, you were being watched by something. You didn't noticed at all. You just kneeled there and smelled the flowers. You felt so nostalgic that you couldn't help it and laid down on them, leaning on a nearby tree. Within a couple minutes, you were asleep, with a genuine smile on your face and with your sword on your left hand. It was odd. Because, ever since that tragic day, while you smiled once in a while, none were genuine. The creature that was watching you, on the other hand, took this chance and got closer to your location. The creature was non other than Vivian, the Sorceress of the Waterfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"My, my. What a delectable looking young man. Hmm... I could eat him now. But I'm not that hungry. And I'd like to chat and maybe \"play\" with him a little, before I eat him. Also, that sword of his could possibly be a problem if I'm careless. And he looks so cute, sleeping like this... Curious though, no one ever slept while being here, on this flowers. I wonder why he did. Oh well, I'll find out the reason when he wakes up. *yawn*. Hmm, it's seems I'm bit sleepy, myself, I think I'll lay here, with him.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did exactly that. She laid her human body on the flowers, coiled her tail around the two of you and used the tip of her tail as a pillow. Soon, she was asleep, as well.</span></div></div>",

While still a bit sleepy, I opened my eyes, streched and yawned. Then, I looked to my right and saw the little man I had found last night still there, sleeping peacefully. So, while being careful not to wake him up, I removed my tail and went to the stream to wash my face, so that I could fully wake up. As usual, the water was just cold enough. Afterwards, I found myself debating wether I should or not wake him up. However, before I could give it thought for long. I heard tiny footsteps. Which meant that more tinies were on their way here. I decided to hide myself, and wait. Then, I realized something. I had left the boy behind! But, before I could get him, the new arraivals had appeared. To my delight, they were a group of 11 little snacks. Six men, four women, and lastly, there was a little girl, who probably had 5 or 6 years, also in chains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cviolet\">*Slave traders. Hmph! Still, a feast is a feast.*</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, I felt a hand on my shoulder. I turned and saw my friends, Crisis and Lea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\"Hi, Vi-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(whispering)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Shh! Be quiet!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Why? What's wrong?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Okay, here's the situation. Last night I found that boy over there, sleeping in those flowers.\"</span>, I said, signaling the boy and the flowers respectively. <span class=\"cviolet\">\"I wasn't hungry and I was sleepy. So, I decided to sleep and curled myself around him. A few moments ago, I woke up, but he was still sleeping, then I heard someone coming. I hid myself to avaliate the situation. Then, this guys came around. From what I can see, the three men at the front and the three men at the back are slave traders. And here we are.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"I see. Can we stay and watch with you?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\"And then feast on those mean people?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cviolet\">*sigh There goes my feast*</span></i> <span class=\"cviolet\">\"Sure thing, girls. But stay away from that boy. He's mine.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(no whispering)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slave trader's group had stoped to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Alright worms! We'll rest here for ten minutes! So, if you need to do number 1, 2, drink or refil your canteens, do so now!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss, can't we rest a bit longer. We've been walking for two days!\", whined one of the bulky men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Absolutely not! You should know about the filthy reptile witch that lives here! And I don't want to give that slut a chance to catch us!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cviolet\">*Hmph! How rude! But, don't worry about being tired or being rude. Soon enough I'll take some of you to \"Hotel Vivian\" and you'll be able to rest as much as you want!*</span></i>, I thought, while licking my lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, one of the bulky men spotted my earlier found prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Boss! There's a boy sleeping!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Sleeping?! Ha! Either, he's dead or he's stupid! Ha, ha, ha!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the boy woke up and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"I'm neither, dead or stupid, you rude fool. And, by the way, even if the Sorcerer, which is different than a witch, eats humans and other sentinent beings and is, *ahem* less modest, even for Felaryan standards\"</span>, he said while blushing a bit, <span class=\"cred\">\"that dosen't give you the right to insult her like that.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cviolet\">*My. A strong and powereful voice he has. And he's deffending me. Odd, but appreciated non the less. And what beautiful eyes.*</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes were of different tones of red. The bottom was a very light ruby red. The middle were blood red. And the top was a very dark red. Almost black. They were so rare and beautiful...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"And exactly why I don't have that right?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Because she, as well as the other predators, are following their instincts. Not to mention that that is the nature of Felarya. Save for a few exceptions.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Hmph! If that's the Felaryan law, then all of this cursed world should disapear! Along with all of it's monsters!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Oh? Then, let me ask you a question. Felaryans eat humans, Neko, etc... We, humans, eat other animals to survive. How does that makes us ANY different than them?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"At least we don't eat other SENTIENT beings! Not to mention they eat them ALIVE for them to suffer a painful death in their stomachs being digested!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"True. But like us, the animals that we eat also have families. Also, don't give me that crap. The likes of you don't care about others except themselves. The proof of that is your \"job\". If it can be called that.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Enough!!! Who are you and what are you doing here?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Who I am dosen't concern you. As for me being here, well, as you see, I'm just resting a bit.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Look, fool. Normally, I would beat you and make you a slave like these maggots here for your insolence! However, consider yourself lucky that we're in a hurry, cause otherwise, there would be hell to pay!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"As if a cowardly fool like you knew anythink about hell. As for the \"beating\" you claim you would give to me, well, it can't be worse that the sound of your voice.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cviolet\">**chuckle* Cocky and confident. Or at least, it seems that way. But, he's still serious.*</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like I wasn't the only one who foud that remark funny. Crisis, Lea, the slaves and even the slaver's thugs were chuckling and giggling a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Shut up you all! As for you, boy. I don't know who you are and I don't give a fucking damn about it! But you just singed your slavery terms.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"We'll see about that.\"</span>, he said, while standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth headed to the river that flowed from the waterfall and met a few maters away from the main stream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Ready, boy?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"I'm just waiting for you to stop talking.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Grr!! Say your prayers!!!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of them drew their swords. And, for the first time, I could take an actual look at his sword. It was astonishing! I was curious, however to the simbols on said sword. The grip had a blue full moon on it. And there was a symbol on the part between the grip and the blade that I didn't recognized. It seemed familiar, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"A nice sword you have there. I'll take it as a trophy after I beat you!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trader charged. But the boy just stood there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"What? Are you so scared you can't move?\"</span>, he said while slashing at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy simply raised his sword and easily parried the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"What? No way!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Was that your best attack?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Not even close!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trader launched slash after slash. But the blows never even grazed his clothes. It was clear to me that this boy was only letting him get tired. He seemed calm and serene. Bored even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"*pant*Bastard.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Are you done yet?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Shut up and die!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trader then jumped and came down with his sword ready to cut the boy in half. The boy then steped to the the left and the traders sword hit the grass, destroying said grass along with some ground. Then, the boy made a vertical downwards slash and to my surprise, along with the girls and, of course, the trader, the traders sword broke in half! Now, it was very clear to me that this boy and that sword were not ordinary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"I-impossible!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"A blade is as strong as it's weilder and the weilder's will. Your will was weak and thus, so was your sword.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Why you!!!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trader launched an assault at the boy, but he simply made a downward vertical slash and cut the trader deeply, killing him. Needless to say that, the calmness and coldness with witch he did it were shocking and, admittedly, a bit frightening. He then glanced at the thugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Remove the chains of this people! Now!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did so without a second to waste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From now on, you are to protect these women and the child, am I clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The thugs nodded. He then aproached the former slaves. Who backed a little, fearfullly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Don't worry. I won't harm you. Are you all alright?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice now was diferent. It carried kindness and it was caring, as were his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Thank you.\", answered the woman with the kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Here, come closer and give me your hands.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile hesitating a bit, they did so. And then, a white energy started spreading trough his arms and covered the women's and the child's bodies for a few seconds. Once the light vanished, their bodies were healed. Not a single scar was left!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Also, please take this.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed a map from his pants pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"It will gide you through the least dangerous parts on this forest.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, kind sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the child approched him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, mister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Yes?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here. Your hat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Oh! Thanks. I must have dropped it on the fight.\"</span>, he then patted the child on the head, earning a giggle. \"Now go. And be good to your mama, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Thank you Mr. Hero!\", then the child and the women left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then smiled sadly and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"I'm far from being a hero.\"</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Leon's POV)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thugs had gone and would, hopefully, follow my orders and find a place for the women and the child to live in relative peace. After all, this IS Felarya. And for humans like myself and other creatures of our size, there is never absolute peace. The chances of a predator being waiting around the corner is always there. After the group had gone, I walked to the main stream that flowed from the waterfall and began washing my sword. I did so everyday and after each fight. One reason was that if the blood was left on the blade, it would eventually rust. And the second, and most important, predators could smell blood from a large distance. And the last thing I wanted was a to leave a trail that the predators could follow to chase me. Especially because, while I've been studing the races and specias of Fauna and Flora that live in Felarya, there was always the posibility of something new happening or appearing. What, with those interdimensional portal that open mostly at random and all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Vivian's POV)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thugs complied with the boy's orders and left in haste. Too bad really. Because now, Crisis and I had lost our breakfast. I looked to my left and saw that Crisis was disapointed that she wouldn't get anything to eat. A feeling that I was experiencing as well. Then, she looked at the boy and licked her lips hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(whisper)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"<i>*Oh no, Crisis.*</i> Crisis, don't even THINK about eating that one.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\"Awww. Please, Viv? Can I eat this one? Please?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"NO! I told you before! This one is MINE. Besides, I'm not sure if I will eat him.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"What do you mean, Vivian?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Well, I find this boy interesting. And from the way he dealt with the leader of that despicable group, I'd say that he has had quite an interesting life. So, I'd like to know him better.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"You mean you want have sex with him?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"No! Well... Not yet. Maybe in the future, if the situation presents itself. But, right now, I would like to ACTUALLY get to know him better.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth, Crisis' and Lea's jaws dropped. I could understand that they were confused, After all, I had never taken an interest in a tiny, except for sex and food. Still, there was someething about this little man that interested me. Something that made me want to not eat him. At least not right now. If that would happen later or not, it would deppend of how things turned out. Still, it seemed that we hadn't been as sutile as we thought. Because, suddenly, I heard him talking to us. Meaning that he knew we where here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(no whisper)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-(General POV)-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"You know, it's quite rude to spy on others where I come from.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Well, it's simple common sense here. After all, if we didn't do this and presented ourselves, we would lose many preys and the element of surprise.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Touch\u00e9. Still, seeing that you are not planning to eat me, otherwise you would already had used a spell to charm me or something, I say we introduse ourselves to each other. Ladies first, if you don't mind. And I do mean all three of you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"How do you know if there are three of us?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"When the fight was going on and while I was washing my sword, I could hear you. I couldn't tell what you were saying. But I heard two loud whispers and a lower one. The lower one, I assume it's from a human. After all, because of the diference in size, creatures as big as your can't imitate the low tone of a human's whisper.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"<i>*Clever and attentive. Good combination in my book.*</i> You're right. We are indeed three. Well then, let us introduce ourselves.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, two giant nagas appeared. The younger one was the infamous Crisis. She had fair skin colour, blond hair, bluish-teal eyes, teal colored top scales, yellow belly scales and was wearing a belt with a pouch attached to it. The human you had identified was her best friend L\u00e9a. She appeared to be in her mid tweenties, had white skin, long brown hair and, oddly, grey colored eyes. The color and the deepness of those eyes told you that she had a rough life. However, the one that cught your attention the most, was precisely Vivian, the seductress. Just by her looks, you could already tell that she made justice to her fame as \"seductress\". Her skin was a light purple color, her hair was light blue, almost white, her eyes were a deep captivating shade of purple, her top scales were a bluish tone of white and gray and her belly scales being a couple of shades lighter than the top ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I'm Vivian. This are Crisis and her best friend L\u00e9a.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Ah, yes. All three of you have quite the reputations, you know? And, for one, the bad tounges were right.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Oh? And what rumors would those be?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Introductions first. My name is Leon Midnight Seiryu.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of the Seiryu name, Vivian's and L\u00e9a's eyes went wide, in shock and surprise. Crisis didn't. That told you that Vivian and L\u00e9a had, at the very least, heard of the clan, while Crisis hadn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cviolet\">*A living Seiryu?! But I had heard that they had been killed! He looks quite serious so I doubt he's lying. But, is it true?*</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cmagenta\">*Wasn't the Seiryu clan killed? That's what I had heard from Temi.*</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cyellow\">*Seiryu? Who are they? I heard Temi mention them once or twice but I never paid attention. L\u00e9a and Viv look quite shocked. Then they must be quite famous.*</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"As for your reputations, well, Vivian is know as the Waterfall's seductress, Crisis as the most voracious naga in Felarya and L\u00e9a as the predators tamer. Seeing as you managed to befriend plenty of predators. Now, I know you have many questions and doubts. Want me to clear them for you?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Indeed, we have. If you would be so kind?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Very well.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went to the place where had slept on sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"First, yes I'm from the Seiryu clan. The clan was indeed ALMOST completely destroyed. One more member and myself were the only survivors. We were indeed a clan with powerful sorcerers and warriors. But, with that being said, there's always someone better, even if only for a short time or for a handicap. Any other questions?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"You say you are from the Seiryu. I need to see a proof of it. I mean no offense but, you could have stolen the sword, read their techniques, etc...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"No offense taken. I can understand that it's hard to belive. Tell me, do you know what the clan's mark was like, miss Vivian?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"<i>*My my, he sure is polite.*</i> Hmmm. If I'm not mistaken, it began with a thin black circle. Inside, a larger crimson-red circle was located and that circle contained six great symbol that had a black-white color sequence, with many ancient smaller symbols between the bigger ones. Then came a blue full moon with a silver shield in the center. And in the center of the shield, there was a Yin-Yang circle represented by two dragons.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Correct down to the minimum detail. You are quite knowledgeable, aren't you, miss Vivian.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Thank you. But please, stop calling me miss, will you? I'm not offended my it but, I don't like being called like that all the time.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"As you wish. Now, I asked about the clan's mark because of this.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up and rose his jacket and t-shirt. And you the girl's surprise, there were many scars on your back. But in the middle of your back, was your clan's mark, burnt in your skin. As it was done with every clan member went they were born. However, your mark had a very deep scar in the shape of an X.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I see. But, why-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"-is it scarred like that?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"*sigh*The only reason as to why I survived my clan's masacre,\"</span>, The girls flinched a bit, for your voice's tone had darkened a bit. They could tellt hat this wasn't something that you liked to discuss. <span class=\"cred\">\"was because the leader of the enemy group thought amusing to see me struggle to survive. So, they threw me here, in Felarya. Bout not before doing this scar. It was meant to pass a message. A message that said that the Seiryu clan was no more.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I- I see.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\"How horrible. To throw a child into a world as dangerous as ours for their own fun!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"It is indeed a terrible thing.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let go of your clothes but remained standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"It didn't mattered to them. They were cruel and had no hearts. So it's no surprise that they would be capable of doing the most horrible things without even blinking.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls nodded in aknolwledgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Any way. I should get going and continue my way.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Eh? Already?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\"Can't you stay some more?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Sorry. But if I stay more, my enemies may think that you were helping me. And they have a tendence to kill anyone who even tries to do so.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to leave and jumped from branch to branch on the trees until you were, more or less, at Vivian's height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Wait!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Yes?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I- I enjoyed chatting with you. Do you think we can meet again? I would love to chat more with you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"><i>*Is this naga getting interested in me?*</i> \"Maybe. I can't promess anything.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then jumped from tree to tree until you were gone from thir sight. Leaving the girls a bit disapointed. What surprised Crisis and L\u00e9a, was that Vivian seemed more that just a bit disapointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow then, reader. Who do we follow? Leon or Vivian?</span></div></div>",

Still, something inside of me told me that I hadn't seen the last of Leon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"What now Vivian?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\"Yeah? What are we gonna do?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"*sigh* I suppose we could go and talk with Temi, I want to know more about the Seiryu. And I want to ask a few other things.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Okay then. Let's go.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, two loud rumbling noises could be heard coming from both Naga's bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\"Can we eat on the way, please?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Sure. After all, we all skipped breakfast.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, we departed the Chrdoni Watterfalls and began to travel our way through the Forest of Whispers. Even tough it was early in the morning, the forest could still be creepy for those who weren't familiar with this part of Felarya. The trip only took two or three hours. It would have taken less time normally, but, luckily for us, we found a few preys during our trip, ranging from wild Nekos, Crisis' favorites, tiny explorers and a few slug girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, we finally reached the border line between the Forest of Whispers and the Fairy Kingdom. From then, it was a short half an hour trip to the eastern side of the kingdom, where our friend Temi usualy is. Crisis couldn't help but be excited. She became like this everytime she visited Temi. Which was natural. After all, Temi raised Crisis since she was a little child. So, altough they weren't related my blood, in everything else, Temi was Crisis' mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, we spoted Temi doing one of her many jobs. Which was being a dentist in this case. She was tending to another friend of ours. Melany, the traper fairy. She was a good friend of ours, altough she could be a little annoying at times. But, when she needed, she could be a great support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cyellow\">\"HI MOM!!!\"</span></b>, said Crisis as she run and tackle hugged Temi. Thank goodness she was at her giant size, otehrwise, Crisis would have crushed her. Poor L\u00e9a, however, had been focibly launched and was currently between Temi's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"*OOF!* *chuckle* Hello Crisis!\"</span>, said Temi while dislodging L\u00e9a from her boobs. <span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Hello L\u00e9a. Vivian.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Good morning Temi. To you as well Melany.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Morning Melany.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Hi L\u00e9a. Hi Vivian.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"How have you been my child?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\"I've been great, thanks mom. Hi there Mel.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Hi Crisis. How's Anna?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\"Crafty and Grumpy, as always.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"*chuckles*\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Please, all of you sit down. I'll finish with Melany here and then I will prepare some t\u00e9a for us.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrisis, L\u00e9a, who had a special chair designed for her size made by Melany, and I sat down and waited. A few minutes later, Melani came out and took a seat by Crisis left. It could have been my impression, but I think that Melany had a thing for Crisis. She always sat down near her when they were together. I think Temi thinks that too. Because she soon came back with a tray containing a big teapot along with four cups of tea and a smaller teapot and cup for L\u00e9a. And she was glaring a bit at Melany. She most likely felt it too, because, as soon as Temi glared at her, she went a little rigid. That was normal. After all, despite not being her biologial mother,Temi was VERY protective of Crisis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"So?\"</span> said Temi, while sitting down and using her magic to pass the cups to everyone and then pouring tea in each cup. <span class=\"cmaroon\">\"What brings you here? I mean, I love that you visit me. And I get visists from Crisis all the time. But I usually get a notice or something. What's this sudden visit about?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Well...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Yes?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"*sigh* Temi, you know a lot about the Seiryu clan, don't you?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemi almost chocked on her tea. Her eyes were then a bit cast down. As if this topic saddened her. But, why would she be saddened by that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"W-well, I wouldn't say \"a lot\", but yes, I know a few things about them. Why do you ask?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"The texts said that they had been all killed,right?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Y-yes.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"The texts are wrong.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelany did a spit take at that. And Temi's eyes looked a bit brighter than before. They showed hope. She was acting weird today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"What?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"What do you mean?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Vivian means that there are still living memebers of the clan.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\"Yeah.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"But, that's impossible! And even if there are, how would you know?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"We know, because we met a Seiryu today. It was a few hours ago.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemi was frozen in place. It was clear that she was shocked. But, her eyes were bright. And she was tearing up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"A-are you certain that this person was a Seiryu?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Yes. He was a young boy. Probably in his late teens. And he had the Seiryu clan sword. As well as the clan's mark burnt on his back. He also said that there is another survivor but, he didn't say who it was.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"So? He could have stolen the sword. And many people do crazy things to incrase their status and fame.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to answer but Temi beat me to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"The part about the fame is correct. However, the clan's sword could never have been stolen.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\"And why is that mom?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Because the sword not only had countless wards and protections against outsiders, but it was also rumored that the clan's sword, as well as the clan's armor were reforged each time they were passed on to the next heirs. And while being reforged, some of the blood of the new owners was used in the process. Thus, the sword and the armor would recognize the owners of the blood used as their one true master and would accept no one else.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"So that means...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"That this boy is a true Seiryu. Can you tell me exactly what happened?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Yes. I had found him last night. Apparently, we was traveling and decided to stop on a specific patch of flowers. It was odd because, while others had laid on flower patches before, none had done so on that specific patch. And he seemed content there.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"What flowers were those?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"The Nocturnal Keepers.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"The Nocturnal Keepers? Hmm... I think I know why he chose those.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Why then?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"In the ancient scrolls, there is a story that shows a few humans with the mark of the Seiryu and one of the previous fairy queens trading and, on occasions, having fun together. One one of those occasions, they had given the queen the seeds of the Nocturnal Keeper. They were very rare at the time. And it was done so as a way to show friendship and trust. The boy probably felt nostalgic and decided to lay down there because he felt some sort of closeness to his home. There are also a few scrolls that show that some Seiryu and fairies had relationships. Including one of the Seiryu leaders and one of the fairy queens. Some of those couples had decendants.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"So, you mean that there maybe fairies out there that have Seiryu blood?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Yes. And not just Fairies. Along the centuries, there were several mixes of the Seiryu blood with other species. Angels, Succubi, Mermaids and many others. If they live in Felarya or not I don't know. But, I doubt they are aware of their acendece.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"And what makes you so certain that there are such decendants here, in Felarya?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"*chuckles* Hadn't you ever wondered why I had such strong magical powers?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"So, your saying that-!!!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"*nods* I am one of those decendants. My grandmother was a fairy. But my grandfather was a member of the Seiryu clan.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo think that we had been so close to a decendant of the Seiryu! Altough that explained how she knew so much about the Seiryu clan and why she was acting all strange before. We all couldn't help but being happy for her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><span class=\"cmagenta\">\"So... Your that boy's relative then?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"I guess so. After all, my grandfather was part of the main branch of the Seiryu clan. He was one of the, at that time, heir's brothers. So, I guess I would be sort of like a grandmother to this child. Anyway, what happened next?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Well, I wasn't hungry. And it was late so, I decided to curl around him and sleep too. When morning came, he was still there, sleeping peacefully. So I carefully uncurled myself and took a bath on the waterfall, as usual. Then came a group of Slave traders. I hid myself behind the trees to avaliate the situation. But I had left the boy behind in my haste. It was a group of 11. Six traders and five slaves. One of them being a small child.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemi frowned heavily at that last part. She loved kids and if she could help the little ones, she would. Also, when she hunted, she never atacked families. Not even the parents. For she knew that the children needed thier parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Then, one of the traders noticed the boy sleeping and their leader said that he was either, dead or stupid to fall asleep on my territory. Unpleasant comments about me aside. Those comments however, woke him up. And he defended me.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemi smiled at that. And Melany was shocked. It was understandable. After all, it was very rare for a human to stand up for a predator, like us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"He said that we, predators, weren't much diferent than the humans. Being that we have similar habits. Such as them feeding on animals and us feeding on them. He also said that it's the law of this world, with a few exceptions.\", I glanced at Crisis and L\u00e9a when I said that. \"The leader of the group got pissed and challenged the boy. Stating that, if the boy lost, he would become a slave like all of the women and the child. They went to the main river's coast and the fight, if it can be called that, begun.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"What do you mean with \"if it can be called like that\"?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Well, the \"fight\" was over very quickly. It only lasted 5 to 10 minutes. The diference in power and skill was so clear than anyone would have seen it from far. The leader didn't got to even scratch the boy's clothes. Not even once. The boy avioded and parried the leader's attacks with extreme ease. Then, when the leader jumped and brought his sword down, intending to cut Leon-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Leon? Is that my grandson's name?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Yes. His name is Leon Midnight Seiryu.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Hmm... I see. Midnight. I like it!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemi was giddy. Probably because now she had one more member on her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Leon then steped aside and the leader's sword hit the ground, destroying a bit of grass. Then Leon made a left downward horizontal slash and broke the leader's sword in half.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Y-your kidding, right?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\"No. We all saw it.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Continuing, the leader charged one last time at Leon, in a desperate attempt to kill him. But, with a right downward horizontal slash, Leon cut the leader right on the chest area and killed him. What was surprising and, a bit scary, was that he killed the leader in cold blood. He didn't even blinked. His eyes did seemed a bit sad for a fraction of a second tough. That means that he's killed before, right?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Usualy yes. Are you sure that he was saddened?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I'm possitive.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Then, that means that, while he kills when necessary, he dosen't like it.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"What happened next?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"He ordered for the remaining slave traders that they released the women and the child. They obeyed at once and wothout question. He then healed the injuries and scars of the former slaves and ordered for the slavers to escort them to the closest village. He even gave them a map that shoewd the less dangerous roads and common location of predators like us. Also, unlike before, when he adressed the former slaves his eyes and his voice were kind and warm. His beautiful and deep multi-toned red eyes...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Oh? \"Beautiful and deep multi-toned red eyes\"? *giggles*\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Eh? D-did I say that last part out loud?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Why yes you did!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cviolet\">\"*blushes*\"</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Hah! I see it but I don't believe it! Vivian, the waterfall seductress, blushing in embarrasement!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I don't know why this happens! Ever since I saw him, I felt a little tug on my chest. And it only got stronger when we talked. Also, I felt more than a little bit disapointed when he left. I also felt a slight urge to go after him.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"*chuckles* Those, my dear Vivian, are the first signs that you're in love.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"EH?! B-but, I always saw humans and other tinies as food and only had sex witht them for fun! So how-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"When you find that special someone, what you did and felt before towards their species is irrelevant. Love is a very powerful thing, capable of overcoming any obstacle, if the love is strong enough. So? Where is my grandson now, future grand-daughter-in-law?\"</span>, she said the last part with a teasing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"T-Temi!!!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"*chuckles*\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"We don't know. After talking with us for a couple of minutes, he depareted, saying that if he stayed with us, we would become his enemie's targets. I asked him if we could meet again and he said that he couldn't promess anything.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"I see. That means that he probable dosen't want to get innocents involved and that those enemies are very powerful. I'll see in my books what else I can gather about the Seiryu. In the meantime, I suggest you go on about your normal daily life. Here, take this with you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemi handed some sort of amulet to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"This will let you contact me if anything happens. And, if you meet Leon again...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Yes Temi?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Please tell him that Granny Temi said hi. Also tell him that I would like to talk to him, if possible.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelany, Crisis, L\u00e9a and I smiled. We knew that Temi was looking forward to see her grandson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Alright. I will.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Thank you Vivian.\"</span>, she said, while hugging me and tearing up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"He, he. Don't worry about it Temi.\"</span> I said, patting her back. <span class=\"cviolet\">\"Well, let's go girls.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\"Actually, we're going to stay a bit longer. You go on ahead Viv.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Alright then. See you later.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Bye.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Bye Vivian.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\"Bye, bye Viv!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Take care.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I went back to my home on the waterfalls. The trip back was uneventful. Altough during the whole trip, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinued...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This Interactive story is based on Snakehead222's (a.k.a Venom and Anti-Venom) stories.<br>\r\nBut they have their differences.<br>\r\nAlso, Felarya belongs to Karbo, as do some of it's characters.<br>\r\nBut many other characters were created by other people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you don't know who I'm talking about or what Felarya is, then follow this link: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.felarya.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.felarya.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's get to the rules, shall we?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1-There MUST be a chaos option;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2-In the chaos option, the character's name MUST be Leon Seiryu. To know about him, send me an insite e-mail and I'll tell you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3-In the \"normal\" branch, do whatever you want. Just make sure you use proper grammar, make a good story and no one line chapters, except for choices;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4-I'll allow sex, just don't go overboard (example: don't write about sex every two or five chapters)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.1- These are types of sex allowed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-M/F (the male being the main character);<br>\r\n-F/M;<br>\r\n-F/F;<br>\r\n-Threesomes;<br>\r\nand<br>\r\n-Foursomes (sex with four persons).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5-Things like Yuri (a.k.a lesbianism) and threesomes are allowed (tough it's not a requirment).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7-Please write a warning chapter (or at least on top of the sex chapter or the bottom of the chapter prior) when you're going to write about anything that is sex related and say what it contains. Example: Say if the chapter will contain threesomes, yuri, normal sex, etc...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8-The following types of Vore and fetishes are allowed:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Oral Soft Vore (encouraged);<br>\r\n-Anal Vore (encouraged, except Nagas, since Nagas usually don't have butts);<br>\r\n-Unbirthing;<br>\r\n-Breast Vore;<br>\r\n-Cleavage Vore;<br>\r\n-Nipple Vore;<br>\r\n-Nudity (as nearly all of the females in Felarya don't wear clothes (if not ALL of them));<br>\r\n-Mouth Play;<br>\r\n-Scat;<br>\r\n-Absorption;<br>\r\n-Digestion (if the MC (main character) is digested, he/she MUST reform after);<br>\r\n-Full Tour;<br>\r\nand<br>\r\n-Insertion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9- On the Chaos storylines, the main character can be vored in any of the ways listed above, but he is Immune to stomach acids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10-Swearing allowed, to a degree. You can make the characters swear. But don't overdo it. If I find a chapter that, in my opinion, overdoes it, I'll either, edit or delete it, depeinding on how much swearing there is and the quality of the chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOT Allowed:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1-Hard vore;<br>\r\n2-Feet/Paw fetish;<br>\r\n3-Farting;<br>\r\n4-No male predator; <br>\r\n5-No m/m;<br>\r\n6-Blood (unless it's from fights);<br>\r\n7-Gore;<br>\r\n8-Watersports.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOTE: Please remember that most of the creatures of Felarya are giant size. Here goes a size comparation chart: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.felarya.com/wiki/images/f/f7/Sizechartwiki.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.felarya.com/wiki/images/f/f7/Sizechartwiki.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUPDATE 03/05/2013: If you're going to add chapters, you MUST follow the following rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1-Don't add chapter \"just for the sake of it\" or \"just to fill space\".<br>\r\n2-If you have ideas but don't want to write them for some reason (embarrassment, fear, etc...), send them to me and I'll see if they fit in the story. And, if needed, I'll make some minor changes and corrections.<br>\r\n3-Watch you grammar, PLEASE!!!<br>\r\n4-No internet or chat like writing (a.k.a: U R N00b, etc...).</td>",
