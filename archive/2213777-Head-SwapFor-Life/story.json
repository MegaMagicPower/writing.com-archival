I need a ride home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking behind him, Robert saw his little sister Greta come running up to him from the direction of the School Gym.  \u201cYeah, I\u2019m heading home now.  What are you still doing here? I thought Basketball didn\u2019t start until next month.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing to a stop a foot away from her brother, Greta said, \u201cTrue, but I still wanted to get some practice in with some of the other Varsity players.  So, I can improve my game.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good. Hop in.  I just need to stop at the store for a few things, okay?\u201d said Robert as he opened the front driver side door of the minivan that his parents got him; threw his gym bag in the back and got in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine,\u201d said Greta as she got into the front seat next to her brother.  Putting down her gym bag down at her feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert drove 10 minutes down the road to the local Safeway store and parked near the front of the parking lot.  \u201cOk, so are you going to wait for me here or going to come in with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNa, I\u2019ll step into that shop over there. Mystic Worlds.  I always get a kick out of looking around those type of places.  You never know, I might find something I\u2019m into that I didn\u2019t know I was into,\u201d said Greta, getting out of the car and heading to the shop next to the grocery store.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee ya in a few minutes out here Greta.  Fifteen minutes max.  I\u2019ve got homework to do,\u201d said Robert as he got out of the car walked towards the Grocery store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta walked into \u2018Mystic Worlds\u2019 and started to browse.  The store itself was a basic type of store of its\u2019 kind, filled with figurines of Dragons and fairies and castles to go along with shelves of books from Wiccan to ghost sightings to \u201cNatural\u201d healing.  Nothing caught Greta\u2019s interest.  Making her way back towards the door, Greta passed a table near the corner of the store, when something caught her eye on the table.  Stopping in her tracks, Greta looked down at the table.  Browsing the tabletop she saw many different nick-knacks sitting on the table, but one in particular caught her eye.  It was a white marble shaped item only bigger.   Greta picked it up, it fit snugly in her right hand.  Holding it up to her face Greta saw that there was a neon white glow to it that started to get brighter and brighter.  <br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a special one you have there.  One of a kind actually,\u2019 said a female voice behind Greta.  \u2018Very powerful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping, and almost dropping the marble, Greta turned around to see the store owner standing behind the cash register.  \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry.  I didn\u2019t see you there Mrs. Maple.  I was just looking that\u2019s all\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Greta? Are you still in here? It\u2019s time to go,\u201d said Robert as he walked in through the front door of the store.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Surprised by her brothers arrival, Greta momentarily lost hold of the smooth marble in her hands. With a shriek, she dropped the priceless artifact, much to Mrs. Maple horror. Using his athletic skills and reflexes, Robert made an attempt to catch the orb and almost in sync with his sisters hand, they missed the fragile item by fractions of a section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, get away!\", a panicked Mrs. Maple shouted out to the siblings, but it was already too late for them to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glass shattered on the floor and bright flash of light blinded everybody inside the store. Smoke and electricity was in the air, causing all three bystanders to cough. Mrs. Maple managed to hold onto a shelf next to her, despite her temporary blindness, while Robert and Greta both fell down to the floor. Slowly, their vision returned, as they where coughing from the smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile slowly recovering from his coughing fit, Robert noticed how he was facing in a direction, opposite from what he expected. He could have sworn, that he should see the wall at the back of the store, and not the entrance, from where he came. He coughed a last few times, when a slight breeze swept through the room and over his exposed shoulders and bare legs. Confused, he was about to check what happened to his t-shirt, when he suddenly noticed the fist he had coughed into the whole time. The hand was smaller, you could call it almost petite. His fingernails where painted in yellow nail polish, which had already started to wear off. He followed along his now slender and hairless arm, over to shoulders way to slim for young man of his age. A yellow strip that belonged to a striped spaghetti top and another that was connected to a training bra lay over each of his slim shoulders. With a gulp, Robert looked down at himself and saw the rest of what used to be his sisters outfit. The top went far enough to cover the cleavage, a pair of b-cup breasts would be producing, from his perspective though he could see it anyway. Coughing one last time, the weight he was aware of now started to shift. Cold sweat started to collect on his forehead, as his eyes went further down to his jeans shorts, that ended halfway above his smooth knees and the unprotected, hairless legs which where connected to them. His small feet where covered by a pair of beige sandals, inside he could see his cute toes, painted in the same color, his nails where. Still in disbelieve about what he was seeing, he wiggled them inside his new footwear, somewhat amazed by seeing them move. His heartbeat started to rise, and he prepared for his final test. Spreading his legs a little bit further apart, he could already feel the material of his jeans shorts press tighter against his crotch, causing him some unfamiliar sensations. Carefully, he ran his slim fingers along the rough material, confirming his worst fears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic began to take hold in him, as Robert looked around for his sister. He was not surprised, when he found her in a quite similar condition as himself, but what shocked him was her head. She may have had his body, but her head was still the same! Shoulder length brown hair, blue eyes and a feminine face. Grabbing for his own hair, he felt his regular short hairstyle. Tracing his face, he got the sensation of soft feminine hands gracing his slight stubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell just happened?\", he asked, while trying to stand up on his unfamiliar appendages. The slight shifting of weight on his chest made him cringe internally.<br>\r\n\"I- I don't know...\", Greta replied while exploring her hairy arms and flat chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my dear children, I'm afraid the orb has swapped your bodies around. These once where very valuable, magical artifacts, made by cruel rulers to extend their own lives. I'm afraid the process is quite irreversible.\", Mrs. Maple explained in a sad voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Greta managed to stand up as well. Robert wasn't that much taller than her, but from his new body, he still had to look up a little bit. Seeing his sister, with his athletic, manly body from the neck down and then looking down at himself, made his new girly legs weak. His breath got a little more shallow and his heart rate did rise once more. Only it wasn't his heart, it was Greta's. It also were her lungs, he not used to get oxygen from the air. Suddenly he became aware of every minute aspect of his new body. Strange sensations, unfamiliar clothes, his stomach turned upside down, as he thought about all those foreign organs inside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do now? How can we even go to school like this?\", he asked in a scared tone, while Greta looked down at the floor, feeling like this was all her fault.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Having to look up at Mrs. Maple, accenting the surrealness he was already feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means, once you two walk out of the front door to this shop.  The world, and everyone in it, will think you are each other.  Robert, that means that you are now Greta to the world.  Greta, that means you're now Robert to the world.  And once you two walk out that door you will be each other even to me.  The only people who will realize that you two swapped heads will be each other,\" explained Mrs. Maple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears started to come from Greta's eyes, as she continued to embarrassingly look at the ground.  Robert just stared at Mrs. Maple agape, too stunned to say or do anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took several minutes before either sibling could do or say anything.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...I'm....I'm So Sorry Robert!  I shouldn't of come in here. I've stolen your life.  Will you ever forgive me!?\" whimpered Greta as she turned to face Robert, tears still flowing down her cheeks.  </span></div></div>",

There is no magic left in my shop to rival that of the orb and not much is known about it anyway.\", Mrs. Maple told Robert and Greta.<br>\r\n\"It's not so bad, you know. Your sister is pretty big for a girl, I'm sure you will get your strength back in no time! And you Greta, you are on the basketball team, yes? Just think about what you could do with that height boost you just got!\", she tried to cheer them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she had a point, Robert thought, ignoring the greater picture in his shocked state. He was way lighter and slimmer than anybody on his team. Combined with his skills an a firm training routine, this could prove to be an advantage! Greta was also kind of blinded by the idea, that she would now tower over bitch Brittany from her team. They both almost forgot for a second, that they swapped genders and everything that was implicated by that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-maybe you are right. There might be something good about this mess.\", Robert said, unsure of his own words. He felt like he was just sold a broken pickup truck by some sleazy used car salesman. His words made Greta feel visibly less worse about dropping the marble, so he took at least comfort in that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both leave Mrs. Maples store and returned back to Roberts car. Both siblings had a weird feeling of helplessness. Not knowing what to do, they decided to drive home. Robert took seat on the driver's side and Greta returned to the passenger seat. Luckily, Robert didn't really need to adjust his mirrors, since he has only lost a few inches in the swap. Subconsciously, he closed the door and grabbed the seat-belt, like he always did. Without thinking too much about it, he buckled himself on, and suddenly found himself with the strap between his sister's former boobs. Really not expecting the sensations, he looked down at himself once again and took the reality of his situation in. Slender, girly body, hairless legs, tiny feet, flat crotch, boobs. His face got red from embarrassment, while he started the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.\", Greta told her brother.<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter, it wasn't really your fault.\", he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they drove, Greta inspected her sports back. To her surprise, it still contained a basketball uniform, only now it was the boy's version. It still had her name stitched on it, so she deducted, that something in reality must have changed. This gave her an idea. Without saying a word, she grabbed her brother's wallet inside the glove compartment. It still had his name and previous body's sex! Looking at the picture, it still had his face, but below that was something similar eery to the sight now sitting beside her. His shoulders were bare and looked slimmer than they should. She could see the beginning of a especially girly dress she used to own a few years back and had to picture her brother wearing it. Not to upset him anymore, since he did seem to take this whole thing in a lot worse than she did, Greta stifled a laughter with all her power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What would people say? What would my friends say? Heck, what would mom and dad say about this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy body?

Closing her eyes, Greta held her now teenaged boy hand up to her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoaning in pain, Greta memories started to flash before her eyes.  Her memories of being a toddler flowed as easily as water. Memories of being a child and into her preteen years followed.  Suddenly, with a sharp jolt to her mind, a second set of memories came flooding into her mind.  As before it was her toddler years, followed by her childhood years and straight into her preteen years and early teen years up until that particular moment.  The difference, they were memories of her head attached to her brother\u2019s body and how no one seemed to notice the difference. She was still Greta, 14-year-old female, but with a male body.  Those memories continued to flow in like a wave.  Her other memories of being Greta, the 14-year-old girl with a girl\u2019s body seemed to start to melt away.    The new memories washed over her in a matter of seconds.  Then suddenly her migraine stops.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her eyes, Greta looked around. Looking at Robert Greta thought\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I will be up there in a minute.\" She gazed back white smoke-like substance that danced around within the orb. It reminder her of a crystal ball, but it was smaller and not completely see-through. She turned her attention back to the store owner. \"Mrs. Maple, what is this orb?\" She cupped it with both hands as she walked toward the front of the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old lady smiled, \"That is a very precious artifact. If you ever wanted to know what it was like to 'be in another's shoes', this is what you would want to buy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greta... you're buying that old thing.\" Robert shakes his head as he approaches his sister. \"It looks like a faulty crystal ball. Let me see it.\" He reached out and palmed the topside of the orb. Instantaneously, the orb glowed brightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta felt the marble buzzing with power in the palm of her hands. Her fingers began to glow with the same white light as the orb. The glow, the energy seemed to travel through her hands and into the rest of her body, causing her whole form to glow purple. She noticed that the same seemed to be happening to her brother, who now glowed like a sparkling, silver ghost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mist within the orb began to spin faster, and faster. As the cloudy substance rotated with great speed, Greta felt herself being pulled into the orb. No, her light was being pulled into the orb. She was not sure how, but she felt herself, as the glow, being sucked into the orb. Greta began to panic, but her body was paralyzed, unable to move. Inside the orb, she felt her brother's presence. He was also inside. \"What's going on!\" each spoke to the other, without mouths. They spoke with thoughts, a strange concept. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Greta felt herself being pushed, forced out of the orb. She wondered if toothpaste felt like this, being squeezed outward. Her 'light' flowed outward from the orb, and then all at once the glow faded. Greta was breathing heavily as she stared at the orb, her hand gripping the top of it. She blinked, her brain slow to process what had happened to her. But she knew that something was off. She looked past the orb, and saw herself. \"What?\" She spoke, but her voice was not hers. She let go of the orb, and looked at her hands. They were larger and harrier, with short, trimmed nails. Greta knew immediately that these were her brother's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back at her body. She recognized the same panicked, confused look on herself. \"Robert... is that you?\" She asked in her brother's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert, inside her body, screamed, dropping the orb. Something told Greta, to not let the orb break. With reflexes, quicker than she remembered, she caught the orb, just before it would hit the hard tile floor. Cautiously, she cupped it with both hands and turned to store owner. \"What did you do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did nothing, dear.\" Mrs. Maple commented. \"The orb did all the work, just like I said it would. You are now in each other's shoes... literally.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is this possible?\" Robert, in Greta's body, asked. She was staring at her hands. \"How do we undo this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well dear, if the orb had fallen onto the floor... there would be no undoing this.\" Mrs. Maple scolded. \"But since your... sister,\" She paused seemingly unsure if that was the correct noun to use. \"...your previous sister... caught the orb, switching back is easy enough. Both of you need to simply hold onto the orb again. Be careful not to drop it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the old store keeper's directions, Greta, in Robert's body, cupped the orb while Robert, in Greta's body, touched the top. The contents within the orb immediately began to spin. Now that Greta knew what to expect, the process seemed to happen faster. She was pulled back into the orb and then pushed out. She now stood, looking at her brother's body. Her hands were over the top half of the orb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert pulled the orb away, cupping it with both hands carefully. \"Wow, that was... crazy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like freaky.\" Greta smiled. \"And its not even Friday.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that things are back to how they were... do you plan on purchasing something? The orb perhaps?\" Mrs. Maple asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta looked towards her brother, and an understanding seemed to pass between them. She then turned to the store owner. \"So the orb can switch people's bodies? Is there anything else about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Maple smiled, \"No dear. The purpose of the orb is for two people to experience the other's life. I will restate though, this is one of kind. All of the other orbs were lost to time. If it breaks, nothing else can reverse a switch.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so we need to be really careful, like holding the orb only over carpet or the sofa.\" Robert smirked. He then peaked at the orb between his fingers. \"We should get it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Greta and her brother left the Mystic Worlds store with the orb, and a soft interior, clam-like case to contain it. Neither knew of the store owner had purposefully overcharged, or undercharged it, since this was the first magical object they had purchased. But in either case, both had to cough up quite a bit of their saved funds to buy it. Robert parked his car in front of their house, and they eagerly walked inside the house.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Robert smiled as he closed the front door, his sister having entered the house a head of him. His parents typically parked in the driveway, as the garage was cluttered with boxes, and only one car was parked in the drive way. He checked his phone, which notified him of one new message. \"Date night tonight!\" Robert read the text aloud for his sister. \"Will be back late. Leftovers are in the fridge. Smiley-face. Heart.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That couldn't have worked out any better.\" Greta grinned. \"Gives us plenty of time to experiment with the Switcheroo Orb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you call it?\" Robert asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Switheroo Orb. Mrs. Maple never said what it was called, so I named it.\" She explained cheerfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that works.\" Robert pondered the name for a moment but decided that he like it. He then commented abruptly, \"We should invite Hansel over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why?\" Hansel questioned as she turned her head slightly away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert smiled as his sister's cheeks turned a slight shade of red. Hansel was a mutual friend of theirs and a 10th grade student at their high school, the grade in between his and his sister's. Robert had met Hansel back in elementary school, and they became fast friends despite the slight difference in their grade level. Back then, the three of them often rode dirt bikes, played video games, or other activities together. As they grew up, Hansel continued to be close friends with both of the siblings, but more recently, he knew his sister had formed an infatuation with their good friend, hence the rosy red cheeks when he mentioned inviting Hansel over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to include some others in this. It won't be anything interesting if it is just us two.\" Robert reasoned. His sister acknowledged his point, and he quickly pulled out his phone again to call their friend. After not-so-patiently waiting for Hansel to arrive, he and his sister enthusiastically greeted him as he opened the front door. Hansel was slightly taller than him, roughly an inch or two. But, he also had a lean build, having spent the last two years in the high school's swim team. He smelled faintly of chlorine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, this is incredible.\" Robert began as he lead Hansel and Greta into the living room. The room was spacious, with a soft white carpet, two couches, and an dark oak coffee table. The carpet was soft, perfect in case the orb accidentally fell from someone's hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is so incredible that I had to rush over here?\" Hansel questioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This.\" Greta slowly opened the case containing the Switcheroo orb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That looks like a... foggy crystal ball?\" Hansel guessed. \"Are we having a seance? I'm down.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite.\" Robert said as he carefully removed the orb from the clam-like chest, cradling it in his hands. \"Touch the top of the orb, and tell me what you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel had a puzzled look on his face as he stared from one sibling to the other. \"Okay...\" He said as he placed a hand over the orb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the smoke-like substance in the orb began to spin. Robert smiled as his soul, or essence, began to glow in a silver light, and as he looked at his friend, Hansel seemed to glow in a strange steel grey color. He wondered for a moment, why he and his friend both glowed in similar colors, and why his sister was a purple. He lost his train of thought when he felt himself, his soul, being pulled into the orb. He rotated around, feeling the presence of his scare friend. A moment later, he was expelled. He blinked a couple of times, watching as his original body, currently being inhabited by Hansel, fearfully looked at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orb fell from his original, Hansel's, hands. Greta was quick to catch it, having been prepared for the orb to fall. \"Its such a strange feeling, right?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell just happened?\" Hansel, in Robert's body questioned. \"Am I... Did we switch bodies?\" He looked at his original body, currently being occupied by Robert.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Yeah! The orb actually swaps people's bodies.\" Robert exclaimed, though the sound of his voice, Hansel's voice, made him pause. Even though he knew what the orb was going to do, switching into his best friend's body was still surreal. He looked at his hands, his friend's body's hands, turning them around slowly. \"Its pretty freak, right?\" He walked over to the mirror hung on the far wall of the living room. His reflection was that of Hansel's body. Then, Hansel walked up beside him. Standing beside his original body, and seeing someone else 'drive' it made chills run down Robert's spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert watched as Hansel pressed a hand on the mirror, as if it were some elaborate prank. \"We really are in each other's bodies. Where did you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From Mystic Worlds\" Robert answered, knowing his friend knew of the little shop by the grocery store. Mrs. Maple had set up shop a year ago, but Robert never understood why. It had the appearance of an antique store, and he did not understand who in their small town would actually shop there. Obviously, she had more to sell than simple old trinkets. \"Greta is actually the one you can thank. She found the orb, and nearly scared the shit out of us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel turned around quickly to look at Greta. \"You and him... me, no... his body.\" he stammered, seemingly having difficulty coming up with the right words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, my brother and I switched bodies by accident.\" Greta clarified. \"Trust me, it was very awkward experience, but it is easily fixed. All you have to do is touch the orb again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like this...\" He reached for the orb in Hansel's hand, but Greta, quick on her feet, stepped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wanted to switch bodies with me, then yeah. But, I'd prefer not to be in his body again.\" She stated, matter of factly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, because I am sure you would want to 'experience' this one.\" Robert teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta immediately turned red, \"No...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel looked between them, clearly clueless of Greta's crush on him. \"Um... do you want to fill me in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you guys just switch back? I would like to have my brother, as my brother.\" Greta stated, having difficulty looking at either Robert or Hansel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why, we just switched places?\" Hansel questioned. \"You guys wanted to experiment right? There must be more that the orb can do than just switch people's bodies. What if there was only one body touching the orb after both people were pulled inside?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, I wonder what would happen.\" Robert thought about the swirling cloud within the orb. For a few moments with each switch, he was inside the orb, not inside any body. \"Lets do it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Greta's complaining, she agreed to help with their little experiment. It was decided that Hansel, in Robert's body, would hold the orb while Robert, in Hansel's body, would touch the orb with one hand. Greta would then push Hansel's body's hand off of the orb once both were pulled inside of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everyone in agreement, they started the process. Robert felt himself being pulled into the orb, immediately after placing a hand on top. Separated from Hansel's body, he watched from inside as Greta grabbed their friend's arm, yanking it away from the orb.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was on this day that Robert, Greta, and Hansel all learned never to experiment with magical artifacts, for the result is rarely beneficial for the individuals involved. Magical objects, like the orb, are created for one purpose in mind, and unexpected consequences can occur when the magic is interrupted. Robert and Hansel were going to learn this lesson first hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert's hands continued to cup the orb while Hansel's arm was pulled away. Robert felt his soul being expelled from the orb and into his body, and not unexpectedly, he sensed friend also being pushed into his body as well. He figured that since only his body was in contact with the relic, it only made since that it would try to put both of them into one body. 'Guess Hansel and I are going to be closer friends for a bit.' he thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the orb pushed himself and his friend into his body, he felt a growing resistance of sorts. The only way he could describe it was being cramped. His body felt cramped. Robert realized with dread that his body, perhaps all bodies, could only house one soul. Despite the uncomfortable resistance, the orb seemed to push harder, forcing his and Hansel's souls into the too small confines of his body. His body begin to convulse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robert... Hansel...\" He heard his sister call their names, her voice in a panic. \"What is happening?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert tried to speak, but only garbled noises came out. He realized that Hansel was also trying to talk, and his mouth could not form the words that either was trying to convey. Sweat began to drip from his forehead and from his armpits. His palms grew clammy. The veins in his arm began to grow dark, as if suddenly filled with lead. \"Am I dying!' Robert panicked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to answer, the contents within the orb began to spin and glow brighter than before. Robert felt himself and Hansel being pulled back into the safety of the orb. But his body continued to to be wracked with some unknown symptoms. Steam began to lift from his shoulders. His skin seemed to vibrate and move like individual grains of sand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta, probably in a panic as well, placed Hansel's hand back onto the orb. Robert felt himself and Hansel being pushed, expelled like toothpaste from a tube, into Hansel's body. But the same thing began to occur. Hansel's body began to convulse, and then his veins became dark. Robert and his friend found their souls back inside the orb and watched in horror as their bodies began to disintegrate before their very eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orb not levitated into the air, no longer being held aloft by Robert's hands. Like a small sun, the particles that made up Robert's and Hansel's bodies began to orbit around the relic, creating a thick ring of sorts. Whatever magic was occurring, seemed to be taking its toll on the orb. Robert panicked from within the relic as cracks began to appear over the surface. If the orb shattered, Robert did not want to find out what would happen to himself or Hansel if they were still contained within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiraculously as if the sand had a mind of its own, it began to take shape. The particles, in a stream, left orbit around the orb and began to form, legs, arms, a torso. Robert realized that they were forming into a body. He smiled, though he had not face yet. He and Hansel would not die within their current prison. It was forming them bodies. Robert did not care what his body looked like, so long as he and Hansel were able to escape for the orb broke into pieces. As if reading his mind, Robert felt himself being expelled from the orb. The world became dark as his soul passed into the still forming body. But just before he lost all sense of what was going on in the outside world, he knew the orb had shattered. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Robert... Hansel... Robert...\" a voice called, sounding a lot like his sister. Her tone indicated concern about something, but Robert's foggy brain could not reason why. At the sound of his name being repeated, he slowly awoke. He tried to sit up, but an unusual weight to his left kept him pinned down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greta...\" he whispered groggily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Are you Robert or Hansel?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course its me.\" The questions sounded preposterous to him, until the events that had just occurred began to flood his mind. He remembered being in the orb, his body and Hansel's body disintegrating, and the orb forming something new. He assumed that the orb remade their bodies, but they may not have been placed back into the correct ones. \"Right... its Robert.\" he answered, though he became aware that the sound of his voice was off. It did not sound like himself, and he wondered if he was placed into Hansel's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the strangeness of his voice for now, he focused his eyes ahead of himself, realizing that he was lying on the carpet of his living room and staring at the ceiling. His bare ass was touching the carpet, and he had a blanket over himself, probably from Greta. He reasoned that his new body must have been naked, and his sister hastily covered him up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta walked into his view, concern clearly etched on her face. \"I'm glad your okay Robert.\" Her tone of voice seemed to indicate that he did not look okay though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... is okay too. Thanks for asking.\" an unfamiliar voice spoke up beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert rotated his head to the left and was surprised to see another boy, lying close beside him, looking upwards at his sister. He did not recognize him, but he figured that it must be his friend. \"Hansel?\" he asked, to confirm his suspicion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other boy turned at the sound of his name. \"Robert? Is that you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" He answered, his cloudy mind working to process what had occurred. Hansel clearly did not recognize him, and he did not recognize his friend's face. But as he looked at his friend's confused face, Robert felt like he should know that face. His friend's new face seemed familiar and not at the same time. \"So... I guess we got two totally new bodies from the little accident.\" Robert reasoned aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed his sister make a pained expression after he spoke, which concerned him. \"What?\" he and Hansel asked in eerie tandem. He and Hansel turned to look at each other, seemingly studying each other's face. \"Are we twins now?\" They asked in tandem again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the situation, Robert smiled. He found the idea of having Hansel as a twin, or himself being Hansel's twin, interesting. Why Hansel looked familiar, and yet not would make since if the orb mixed up their features. It was defiantly not the worst thing that could have happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, something nagged at his brain, that he and Hansel were not just identical in appearance. His skeptical side asked, 'Why were they under the same blanket?' He would answer himself, 'Because they fell beside each other after the orb created them new bodies.' His skeptical side followed up, 'Why were you having difficulty sitting up then?' He would answer himself, 'Because Hansel must have fallen on top of him.' His answer seemed reasonable enough, and it would account for why his left arm and leg felt numb. The weight of his friend's body was slowing the circulation to his limbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert looked at his friend again. He realized that Hansel's head was not positioned in a way for him to be lying on top of him. It was more like he was lying directly beside him, flat on the carpet. Robert pressed his right hand and foot into the carpet and pulled. He felt like he was dragging his half-limp body, but Hanel's head seemed to move with him, staying just as near to him. His friend was uncomfortably close, about half a shoulder length away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you dragging me?\" Hansel complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not dragging you, I'm dragging me.\" Robert replied. A moment later, he felt himself being jerked to the left, but it felt different than someone simply pulling his arm. It was like his torso was being pulled from the inside, as if half of his muscles tried to pull him in the opposite direction. He knew that something was very wrong, and his friend's expression mirrored how he felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert pressed his elbow into the carpet and tried to raise his torso off of the carpet again. This time, the extra weight to his left was lessoned, as if some other force was pushing his torso up as well. As his torso rose, the blanket fell off his chest, and Robert had to stifle a scream. There was only one body under the blanket. With his gaze, he followed the outline of two legs from under the blanket, to his unfamiliar, toned stomach. His gaze continued upward to his chest, to a second neck, and then to his friend's head. The orb had not given them their own bodies, only one. \"No... way...\" he whispered. He and Hansel were sharing a single, combined body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly raised his hand into his view, examining it. His arm was different, unfamiliar, but it was his. As he looked toward what should have been his left arm, he had no feeling of it. Despite the left arm being attached to the same body as him, he could not control it. He realized that the sensations of his body seemed to stop half-way across his chest. He watched as what should have been his left arm clench and unclench the fingers. Hansel was moving it, not himself. Robert looked at Hansel, just has his friend turned to look at him. They stared at each other for a few long moments. Unceremoniously, he and his friend stated in tandem, \"Shit!\"</span></div></div>",

He tried to pull away, to get more room between himself and his friend, and seemingly, Hansel had the same idea in mind. He felt the muscles in his chest and abdomen be pulled uncomfortably taught, like the center of their chest was the rope in a game of tug of war. He moved no further away from his friend. Robert stopped his attempt, nearly as soon as he started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes gaze back at his unfamiliar chest. \"What the hell happened to us?\" His brain was having a difficult time processing what he saw, what he felt. It was a strange experience being within someone else\u2019s body, but this was something else entirely. He felt his chest, or at least his half of it, raise from an unsteady breathe by his friend. He could feel the air enter his lungs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of his eye, he saw Hansel look towards Greta. His friend's voice came out, like a whimper, \"How do we fix this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta looked teary-eyed, and Robert knew his sister felt shameful, as if this was all her fault. \"I... I... I don't know. Mrs. Maple...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel looked at Robert, his eyes seemed to plead with him. \"I...\" Robert swallowed hard, trying to keep his voice steady. He clenched his fist tightly, his knuckles becoming white. \"We'll figure something out.\" His words sounded empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll figure what out?\" Hansel questioned, sweeping his arm over them. Panic and fear emanated in his voice, but Robert did not need to hear his friend's words, to understand his alarm. Beside his own terry, he could almost feel his friend's fear, on top of his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't panic. That's not going to help us.\" Robert tried to keep his voice calm. His words were far easier to say than to practice. His mind raced with questions. \u2018Was this permanent? How to they separate into two bodies? Why did the orb only make one body?\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel took a deep breathe, seemingly trying to quell his own emotions. \"And what will?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Maple...\" Greta offered. \"She may know... something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert realized that his sister was holding something. It took him a moment to see that it was the open box that they had purchased along with the crystal ball. Inside were the fragments of the once whole orb. Greta seemed to have hastily picked up the pieces while he and Hansel were unconscious.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go... maybe she knows of something.\" Robert urged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sister abruptly turned to walk towards the front door, but stopped just outside the living room threshold. She set the box down on shelving in the hallway and walked back to Robert and Hansel with her phone out. \"Pictures are sometimes greater than words...\" Greta stated, her voice sounded more controlled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert looked toward Hansel, sharing a knowing look. He imagined that Mrs. Maple may need a photo of them, at least just to see the extent of what the orb had done to them. They both nodded their heads in approval. Greta took a picture of them, with half of their body still underneath the blanket. She picked up the box as she left the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert almost called out to ask her how she was going to get to Mrs. Maple's shop, since she did not know how to drive, but he decided against saying anything. His sister would think of something, even if it just meant that she bicycled the few miles to the shop. Their hometown was small, easy to traverse from one side to the other in less than an hour on bike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert turned towards Hansel, his friend already looking at him from the corner of his eyes. He knew that they would be alone together for one or two hours while his sister was gone. He hoped that this was the only time they would have alone together, in their current state.  They were best friends, but he could not imagine, did not want to imagine, being forced to live his life side-by-side with Hansel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel sighed heavily beside him. \"How does an orb that switches people's bodies make us into... this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert shrugged his shoulder in response, and he felt the muscles between his and Hansel's necks flex. \"That felt weird.\" Robert stated to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel turned his face toward him again. \"I felt you... shrugging here.\" He touched the space between their necks, and Robert flinched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't expect to feel that.\" Robert stated as he placed his hand beside Hansel's. He traced this common center, down the length of their chest and abdomen, and Hansel shuddered in response. \"Looks like there is some overlap where we can... both feel.\" It was an odd experience to feel his hand touch his stomach, but also know that his best friend could also feel him touching his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert\u2019s eyes shifted downward to the blanket that hid the bottom half of their body. He stared for several long moments at the space between their two legs. Curiosity getting the better of him, he grabbed the side of the blanket around their hips and tossed it aside, revealing their lower half. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude!\" Hansel complained, but did not reach to grab the blanket. He seemed just as curious as Robert was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both stared at the single, unfamiliar penis nestled between their individual legs. \"That doesn't look like mine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel frowned. \"Its not mine either.\" After a few moments, he stated. \"The orb didn't just slap us together, it completely blended us into one person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're still two separate people.\" Robert stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where?\" Hansel argued. \"Please, show me where you end and I begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert had to concede that Hansel had a point. Not only were their two heads on top of the same body, but their body seemed to be some combination of their previous forms. The only parts that were not completely blended together were their heads. \u201cGranted, we share\u2026 most of this body, but we each seem to only have control over our half...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA lot of good that does.\u201d Hansel scoffed. \u201cWe get to retain half of the body each, but we have to move together just to go anywhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert had not thought that far ahead, but clearly his friend had. He was not sure how they were going to move their joint body. \u201cLet\u2019s take this one step at a time. Greta is going to get help. We can\u2026\u201d He paused, feeling a familiar pressure build in his bladder, their bladder.  \u201c\u2026relieve ourselves\u2026\u201d Robert\u2019s cheeks flushed red as he spoke. Hansel seemed to have a similar reaction as his friend\u2019s cheeks turned ruby red as well. Robert could feel the heat leaving his friend\u2019s face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen get dressed.\u201d Hansel supplied. \u201cNo use running around in the nude.\u201d </span></div></div>",

She lives next door and she likes hanging out with the both of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds Fun.  Maybe she\u2019ll swap with one of us to prove to her that it really works.  But the only concern I have is that mom and dad are home or will be home soon,\u2019 said Robert, giving a worried look around the living room.  \u2018They may get angry or upset with us over it. And I don\u2019t want this to end so soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Robert, it\u2019s only like 5:30 pm.  Mom doesn\u2019t get off of work until nearly 7 pm and dad is working late tonight.  We\u2019ll have a couple of hours before Mom is even home.  Plenty of time to have a little bit of fun.  What else do you have to do? Watch TV,\u201d said Greta with pleading, almost begging facial expression on her face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOkay, fine.  Let\u2019s do this,\u2019 said Robert.  \u2018Go Call Velma.  I\u2019m sure she\u2019s home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d yelped Greta as she took out her cellphone and called Velma.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin 5 minutes, Velma came knocking at the front door.  Opening the front door, Robert saw a 5\u2019 4\u201d raven black haired, green eyed girl that very much looked like a skinny 14-year-old girl that she was.  Robert smiled, he said, \u201cHey Velma. Come on in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelma stepped by Robert.  \u201cSo, what was so important that I \u2018had to come over immediately\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s to show you this,\u2019 said Greta, hold up the marble like object.  \u2018It\u2019s called the Switcheroo Orb.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, you called me over here to see an oversized marble?  Tell me that it\u2019s worth a lot of money or something,\u201d said Velma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it is a, unique marble to say the least,\u201d said Robert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt has magical powers Velma.  It allows people to switch bodies.  Robert and I accidently switched bodies at The Magic Dragon earlier,\u201d said Greta with an excited smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelma gave an unbelieving look towards Robert to see his reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t\u2019 look at me.  She\u2019s telling you the truth Velma.  We DID switch bodies earlier,\u201d said Robert.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute.  You two actually are telling the truth, aren\u2019t you?\u201d said Velma.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u2019 said Greta.  \u2018I can prove it to you.  I\u2019ll switch bodies with you if you are willing to be in my body for a few moments.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, yeah.  I switch with you,\u201d agreed Velma.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!  Now all you have to do is touch the top of the orb.  I just have to continue to hold to bottom of the orb,\u201d said Greta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelma touched the orb with her palm, laying her fingers down slowly over the rest of the orb.  The milky white mist within the orb began to spin faster, and faster. Velma\u2019s eyes widen at seeing this. As the cloudy substance rotated with great speed, Velma felt herself being pulled away from herself, like one would feel when they felt their very being is being conducted through their arm.  It was a surreal feeling, exciting yet scary.  Velma was fascinated by this feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral seconds went by as Velma continued to feel the pulling sensation when suddenly she felt herself enter the orb.  She felt like she was on a rollercoaster ride, being twirled around in the chair.  Then suddenly, she could see again, blinking, she realized she was looking directly at herself.  With a surprised yelp, Velma pulled back the arm that was holding onto the orb and covered her mouth, allowing the orb to drop to the floor. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He walked towards them, as he got closer, he saw that Greta was holding what looked like a large milky white marble, as he got up to her he said, \u201cWhatta you got there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.  It just seemed like a really cool Marble,\u201d said Greta, holding it up to Robert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool,\u2019 said Robert.  \u2018What does it do? Do you play marble games with it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, actually, I was about to explain to your sister that the marble she is holding contains magical powers.  It can bend and change reality in ways that one only dreams about,\u201d said Mrs. Maple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike how? You mean like a good luck charm,\u201d said Robert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo some it can be a good luck charm.  To others, it can be a negative change.  Just depends on your perspective,\u201d said Mrs. Maple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s cryptic,\u201d said Robert sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a moment to look Robert up and down, it looked like Mrs. Maple was trying to make up her mind about something.  \u201cTell you what Robert.  How about you and your sister here take that marble home, free of charge.  All you have to do is both touch it at the same time and say, \u2018We two ask for this mighty marble to change reality as it seems fit.\u2019 And it will change reality in some way, although to give fair warning the marble itself changes reality as it sees fit.  Sometimes it changes something meaningless and other times it changes something major.  It\u2019s crap shoot to be honest.  Even if you don\u2019t believe me what do you have to lose?  Some time?  Think of it this way, you two, at worst, would get a toy out of it right,\u201d said Mrs. Marble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert thought about it for a moment.  Greta, looked at Robert, feeling half excited about the possibility of the marble and half afraid that Robert wouldn\u2019t want to have any fun with it, even if it wasn\u2019t really magical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll take it then.  I guess it can come to no harm,\u201d said Robert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat,\u201d said Mrs. Maple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome!\u201d said Greta, giving a little jump of excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll hold onto it,\u201d said Robert as he held out his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPouting, Greta handed over the marble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Mrs. Maple,\u201d said Robert with a smile and headed out the door to the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta said, \u201cBye Mrs. Maple.  I\u2019ll see you in a few days.\u201d  As she followed her brother out of the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBye you two!\u201d said Mrs. Maple, watching the two siblings leave with a knowing smile.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
