How tragic\u2019 the prisoner thought, shrugging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh you\u2019re not getting any where you\u2019re going\u201d the guard on the passenger side of the car gloated wickedly as the car came to an immediate and sudden stop causing the prisoner inside to slam headfirst into the metal floor of the armored car\u2019s right sight (he was on the left side and the stop sent him forward into the opposite wall)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw\u201d the prisoner groaned, rubbing his head as a small trace of blood began to seep out of a newly formed cut on the top of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry my foot slipped\u201d the driver apologized sincerely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m okay. Oh and where am I going exactly, if you don\u2019t mind me asking Mr. Secret-keeping-guard-of-secrets?\u201d the prisoner asked in an antagonizing yet devious tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what? S-shut up! Stop putting words in my mouth\u201d the passenger guard quickly snapped back as he walked to the back of the truck and began to open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sorry, maybe there\u2019s something in the air. I guess that or maybe it\u2019s these shackles which are a bit tight on the ankles by the way. Honestly did you people really have to bind my legs? I mean where do I have to go exactly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust shut the hell up and get out of there!\u201d the now very annoyed guard barked as the bright sunlight of the afternoon sun pierced the inside of the truck like a hail of bullets. The prisoner tried to stand and came very close to walking and hoping out of the armored car when suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoops\u201d suddenly the guard stuck his foot out, causing the prisoner to trip and tumble out of the armored car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw, what was that for\u201d the prisoner wined rubbing his head once more, the cut on his head opening even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope it did you damn annoying son of a bitch!\u201d the guard growled vengefully as he began to stomp on the wounded prisoner before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral painful and bloody minutes pass as the guard continues his curve stomp of a beat down on the prisoner before suddenly stopping at the sound of a female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough Takada\u201d a female voice called from behind the guard. Immediately the torturer of the prisoner stopped his assault. The guard quickly saluted and a woman stepped forward, followed behind her was another women though she was smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWarden  Makina\u201d the guard gasped in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat were you doing to that prisoner just now\u201d asked the smaller women besides Makina whose name was a mystery right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026well\u2026 you see I was\u2026it\u2019s this prisoner\u2019s fault! He attacked me\u201d the guard gasped in a hurry. It almost seemed like he was falling to pieces at the mere sight of this Warden Makina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-that\u2019s a lie\u201d the prisoner coughed, some of it normal saliva while the other parts was blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet this prisoner to Doctor Takashima\u201d Warden Makina explained walking forward towards the guard named Takada \u201cI\u2019ll see you in my office later Takada.\u201d The guard gulped hard, he knew he was in for it and god help him that he\u2019d be alive tomorrow. The guard took one last look at the prisoner and growled a warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext time I see you, you\u2019re not gonna have her to save you\u201d the guard growled as the women beside Makina walked past the Takada and helped the prisoner up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry we\u2019ll have you to the infirmary soon\u201d her voice sounded sincere and the prisoner nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you\u201d the prisoner said as he stood up with help from the woman beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was because I wanted to help you, it was because I didn\u2019t want to see one of my guards break a rule\u201d Makina quickly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay but still thanks\u201d the prison said bowing before finally leaving for the infirmary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Takada\u2026\u201d Makina began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018*Gulp* I\u2019m gonna die\u2019</i> Takada\u2019s last thoughts before the prisoner vanished from view.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Quick! Give me a hug before somebody sees\u201d the prison explains strangely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what?\u201d the boy\u2019s response was the same as the women besides the prisoner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh. Kid. Ding\u201d the prisoner explained wagging his finger in front of the boy\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh okay\u2026\u201d the boy was about to leave but the prisoner stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey now before you go I recommend you take this seeing as how you had to put up with me.\u201d The prison quickly reaches into his bag, having already grabbed the standard prison uniform, which was basically khaki green overalls, and a bag consisting of what you\u2019d expect, some water, a little food, some bandages, ext\u2026 \u201cNow reach out your hand, come on don\u2019t be shy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy was smart enough to play along and hesitantly stuck out his hand. The prisoner quickly fished through his pocket and then held out his fist before carefully placing something in the boy\u2019s hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow don\u2019t open your hand until you get back to your cell, okay\u201d the prisoner explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy quickly nods and took his leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018What a strange guy\u2019 the boy thought and after walking out of eye sight he decided to take a peak at what the strange man had placed in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d the boy exclaimed in shock causing every prisoner and guard around him to look in his direction. \u201cOh I umm stepped on a bug\u201d immediately everyone turned back to what they were doing and the boy quickly hurried back to his cell.  \u2018Why did that guy give his piece of candy? Doesn\u2019t he know he needs it\u2019 the boy made his way back to his cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with the prisoner and the woman, they had just arrived at the infirmary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoctor Takashima I was sent by warden Makina to bring this prisoner here.\u201d The women explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, you can leave now\u201d a woman with short light-brown hair who was garbed in a white lab coat that covered part of her violet colored dress, explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am\u201d the women explained. The prisoner waved goodbye to the women and in a somewhat strange twist the women waved back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBye bye Kasuga, treat yourself to some cotton candy later, I\u2019m sure you deserve it\u201d the prisoner explained before the women named Kasuga finally took her leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere take a seat\u201d Doctor Takashima explained as she sat down in her comfortable black colored leather chair. The prisoner quickly looked around and soon took a seat on a small metal stool in front of the doctor. \u201cNow tell me, what did you do to get sent down here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell there\u2019s a cut on my head I think you should look at\u2026\u201d the prisoner began, slowly moving his hand to show the doctor the cut he got from the armored car. Doctor Takashima quickly slipped on a pair of rubber gloves and the began to examine the prisoner\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026well I don\u2019t see anything serious, just some bleeding but-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw\u201d the prisoner groans as Doctor Takashima sticks her finger into the prisoner\u2019s now reopened wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god so much blood, I love it\u201d she quips sounding insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop\u201d the prisoner pleads but the doctor continues to prod her finger even deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh I think I can see part of your sku-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said STOP\u201d immediately Doctor Takashima stopped in place, her finger gently removing itself from the prisoner\u2019s head almost as if it had a mind of its own!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what the hell\u201d Doctor Takashima gasped in shock \u201cwhy can\u2019t I move? What did you do to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said stop and you stopped, plain and simple! Now if you would kindly back several steps away\u201d just as the prisoner spoke those words Doctor Takashima backed a few feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it I-I can\u2019t control my b-body\u201d she stuttered trying to resist with every fiber of her being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to kill you, far from it. I\u2019m not some sick whack job that get\u2019s off on causing pain.  No I\u2019m more of a candy man, which speaking of candy, I believe you have at least three pieces in your coat pocket. Confiscated them from some poor prisoners perhaps?\u201d the prisoner explained standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-damn you\u201d Doc Takashima groaned as she uncontrollably reached her hand into her pocket and pulled out three pieces of candy that were wrapped in a very similar wrapper as the one the prisoner had given the boy from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHand them over\u2026\u201d the prisoner explained and like the puppet she now was, Doctor Takashima did so, showing as much resistance as she could, which wasn\u2019t much due to the prisoner having complete control of her muscles at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-here\u201d the words came out stuttered and almost a shout, luckily no one was around to hear her, as she dropped the three pieces of candy into the prisoner\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere now was that really so hard? You know what? I think I\u2019ll give you a little treat seeing as you\u2019ve been such a good puppet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll kill you-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHush, here I\u2019m sure you want one of these. Here have one. I\u2019ll even unwrap it for you\u201d the prisoner explained unwrapping one of the three pieces of candy in his hand. Now these candies were used to nullify the poison that were in the collars that death row inmates wore, even the prisoner wore one which didn\u2019t bother him that much, but\u2026what would happen if you fed one of these candies to someone who wasn\u2019t poisoned? He held out the piece of candy, it was a horrible dark color, maybe because it was so bitter, maybe not? Oh well. \u201cNow open your mouth\u2026\u201d the prisoner asked holding up the piece of candy to the doctor\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019ll A-AH\u201d the doctor was cut off as the prisoner pushed the small piece of candy into her mouth. Instantly the taste hit the doctor, so bitter and disgust, however even though she swallowed it whole it left a disgusting after taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere now for mine\u2026wait you know what I\u2019ll save it for late. Thanks doc it\u2019s been fun\u201d the prisoner said waving goodbye as he walked out of the room, a happy-go-lucky smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes pasted before suddenly Doctor Takashima was released. At first she gasped for breath, trying to sort through a mix of pure hatred and admiration. However soon she arrived at the conclusion that she needed to report this, but not to the warden, it was someone else entirely she needed to contact! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly reached for the phone, punched in a number and after several rings, a young man on the other line spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello\u201d said the young man on the other side of the line \u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s me\u201d Doctor Takashima explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes what do you want? I am in the middle of a Carnival Corpse at the moment can\u2019t this wait?\u201d the young man sounded a bit irritated, or was that annoyed? The women couldn\u2019t tell nor did she care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have another one, a deadman\u201d suddenly the man on the other end of the line fell dead silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm is that so\u2026? Well that\u2019s just fantastic we\u2019ll have him moved into G-block immediately and his first match\u2019ll be tomorrow! Yay this is going to be so much fun, Carnival Corpse, two days in a row! The fans will love it!\u201d the young man exclaimed in a bit of childish whimsy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, right away\u201d Doctor Takashima explained, nodding her head before hanging up. She stood there for a moment, just letting everything sink in before she smiled wickedly at the thought of getting to cut open that foolish deadman who crossed her. Oh how\u2026naughty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay what next?<br>\r\n(Ps: That last tid bit is a reference; if you get it uh\u2026here have an invisible cookie)</span></div></div>",

Slowly one cage containing a young man with dirty blond hair was lowered onto the battle area floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow this young man is the whole reason why we\u2019re all here today folks! The manipulative man that burned down and entire highschool, kids and faculty included! The one, the only, Sparrow!\u201d several gasps were heard as the young man climbed out of his container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHim? He doesn\u2019t look like much\u201d one voice exclaimed in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come now Dog, give the guy a chance. He had to have a good reason\u201d explained another voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah he\u2019s nuts!\u201d chirped another voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY!\u201d suddenly all fell quiet as the young man with dirty blond hair spoke up. \u201cLet\u2019s just get this thing overwith, I don\u2019t really enjoy fighting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t enjoy it?\u201d one shocked voice gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I wasn\u2019t expecting that\u201d another voice explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s got to be joking! How else could this \u2018pacifist\u2019 have managed to burn down an entire high school?\u201d another voice, this one a bit of a loud mouthed one, screamed annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow now ladies and gentlemen, calm down. We haven\u2019t even started yet\u201d the announcer explained, trying to regain control of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u201d everyone quickly settled back down and the announcer continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow onto our next competitor, he\u2019s the deadman with those savage claws, the one, the only, Falcon!\u201d suddenly another cage, similar in appearance to the one that the young man had been in before, was quickly lowered onto the battle area floor. Inside it was that of a small child, well at first glance it looked like a small child. In actuality it was that of a small man, no taller than 3ft but clearly showed signed of aging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it time for me to fight again?\u201d the small man asked? He had jet black hair that ran down to his shoulders. He was wearing a normal prisoner\u2019s outfit though it seemed to be a bit big on him as the sleeves clearly were longer than his arms. The man hesitantly climbed out of his cage, only to stumble and fall on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Poor guy\u2019 the young man with the dirty blond hair thought as he watched the small get back up. \u2018Maybe I can forfeit or something, save him-\u2018the young man\u2019s thoughts were cut short as a sheering pain shot up in his shoulder. The young man quickly glanced to his left to see a large gash running the length of his entire upper arm!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the h-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFalcon Claw!\u201d shouted the voice of the small man and out of nowhere another gash appeared on the young man\u2019s body, this time his lower back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGah!\u201d the young man gasped in pain, gripping his chest as soon another slash and another gash appeared on the young man\u2019s body causing him to fall to the ground in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of fight is this?\u201d one of the on lookers spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes this does seem a bit one sided\u201d another explained, expressing his annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Tamaki I thought you said this would be a great fight! Not some one-sided slaughter house\u201d growled the angry voiced onlooker from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey now I think it\u2019s about to get. Look!\u201d another voice replied, presumably Tamaki\u2019s voice. It was true something was about to happen and this fight was about to be rebalanced! In fact deep inside the man his blood was beginning to boil over, sick of getting hit, sick of people laughing at him, sick of hearing those stupid on looker\u2019s voices! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cENOUGH!\u201d</span> screamed the young man. The young man got to one knee but another slash appeared on his leg, slicing up his pant leg as well as part of his lower leg. The young man continued to try and stand, even though he was losing more and more blood. Soon a small puddle of blood began to form underneath the young man, his skin grew exceptionally pale, in fact the man showed signs of almost total blood loss!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFalcon-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cSHUT UP!\u201d </span>the young man shouted, quickly whirling around and, to the surprise of everyone, grabbed the small man\u2019s arm, stopping his onslaught dead in its tracks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha-\u201cthe small man could barely speak a word before the young man before him suddenly flashed a sadistic smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cPayback!\u201d</span> The young man exclaimed in an almost satanic tone of voice as he quickly flashed his other hand forward, grabbing the man by the neck and lifting him into the air. The young man looked at his attacker turned victim; his sleeves had become ripped and slashed up only to reveal that of the small man\u2019s hands. His fingers were covered in blood, forming several long sickle like blades that the small man had used to create all those gashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cSo these are the claws you used on me? Heh a nice weapon but a bit fragile, especially if I do this</span> *snap* \u201d the young man quickly raised his leg and then with a mighty axe kick he snapped the small man\u2019s arm in half, utterly crushing the man\u2019s bone inside the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGAH!\u201d the small man screamed in agony before the young man quickly drove the small man\u2019s face into the ground, silencing him immediately! However this wasn\u2019t the end as the young man did it again and again, slamming the small man\u2019s head into the ground until it was nothing but a bloody pool on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s it. The former punching bag-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cSHUT UP!\u201d</span> the young man screamed throwing the body of the small man at the loud speaker above him. The loud speaker quickly fell to the ground with a loud slam, however it still remained together, though the insides would beg to differ. The young man slowly walked forward, towards the loud speaker and placed a bent leg on the broken loud speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cNow listen up you bastards! I better not see any of you sob\u2019s in person or I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d</span> suddenly the young man passed out, leaving the audience speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I guess that wraps that up. Thank you all for watching. Umm\u2026tune in next time for the next Carnival Corpse!\u201d the announcer\u2019s voice rang out from a second hidden speaker. Satisfied everyone quickly left and the cleanup crew entered to take care of the mess left by the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater in the cell of the young man, the young man had finally awoken. In fact he had just awoke in time to see the replay of the fight, however before the video broadcast was over the young man switch the television off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cHey why\u2019d you do that? It was getting to the good part\u201d</span> an annoyed yet happy-go-lucky voice whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cYeah they were about to show the part where I smash that fucker\u2019s face into the ground\u201d</span> another voice, this one a wicked and sinister voice, laughed.<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><br>\r\n\u201cHey now, don\u2019t patronize him. After all he\u2019s been through a lot. Just look at all those bandages. He\u2019s lucky just to be alive\u201d</span> explained a caring and loving voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cYeah whatever\u201d</span> groaned the wicked voice before finally shutting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cAw, I guess I\u2019ll just go play with Mama then\"</span> the happy-go-lucky voice from before explained before finally fading away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u201d the young man let out a small breath of air before the caring voice from before spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cAre you okay sweetie?\u201d</span> ask the caring voice from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I\u2019m alright\u201d the young man answered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cAre you sure? That was a bit of a bad fight you were in\u201d</span> the kind hearted voice explained, expressing her concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Thanks for your concern, Mom\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a few days later before anything really relevant happened. Alex had spent most of his in his cell, only making a trip to the vending machine every once in awhile or to the bathroom for rather natural reasons. However today was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Gah I can't take it! I need some action\"</span> growled an angered yet anxious voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, I'm not scheduled for another Carnival corpse. Not one that I'm aware of at least\" Alex explained saying the last part with a small sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\"Do they even tell you when you're going to be in one? Like some advanced notice\"</span> asked a curious voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm maybe but I doubt it\" Alex explained as he turned the corner to see the vending machines which he was lookign for. \"Oh look the vending machines. Alright guys what'll it be this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Something spice and hot\"</span> the angry voice demanded!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\"How's about some sweats, wait do we have any more of that cotton candy from earlier\" </span>asked the curious voice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"Now now we had sweets yesterday. How's about something else, maybe something smooth? I think you may be getting a sore throat, sweetie\u201d</span> ask a concern voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cGah! Come on spice!\u201d </span>growled the angry voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cNo, sweets! Sweets!\u201d</span> chirped the curious turned anxious voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cCome on, he needs something smooth and cool\u201d</span> explained the concerned voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cSpice!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cSweet\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cSmooth\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSHUT UP ALL OF YOU\u201d Alex shouted silencing the three voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm are you okay\u201d asked a concerned voice, though this one was different from the other voice that Alex had been hearing. Alex turned around to see that of a girl, she was a little taller than 4ft but not nearly as tall as Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026yeah I\u2019m alright\u201d Alex stuttered out like an idiot. He quickly turned around to try and hide his face; he was blushing, either due to being embarrassed that someone saw him talking to himself, or because of the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh come on. She\u2019s probably half your age\u2019 Alex thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026excuse me\u201d the girl began \u201cyou\u2019re blocking the vending machine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh um sorry\u201d Alex apologized as he backed away. The girl quickly approached the vending machine, inserting her card into vending machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa 10,000 cash points?!\u201d Alex gasped out in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah it\u2019s a lot but not nearly as much as before when I won my first carnival corpse.\u201d The girl explained flicking her long dark brown hair in the air in order to get it out of her line of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait you were in Carnival Corpse? But you\u2019re so young?\u201d Alex exclaimed a bit shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually I\u2019m fifteen\u201d she explained as a cup of coffee popped out of the machine, smoking hot as if it had just been brewed.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cDrink too much coffee\u201d Alex asked only to have the girl glare at him. \u201cS-sorry it\u2019s just my mom told me that if you drink too much coffee it\u2019ll stunt you growth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey just because I\u2019m short now doesn\u2019t mean I will later! I\u2019m still in the middle of puberty. Who knows I might even be bigger than you when I turn eighteen\u201d the girl growled annoyed by the annoying older boy before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook I\u2019m sorry-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it Mama\u2019s boy!\u201d the now fully angered girl growled \u201cYou are just like my stupid father! And GAH!\u201d the girl quickly walked off before she could say anymore, leaving Alex a bit dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWhat a strange girl\u201d</span> began the caring voice that Alex had thought he had silence along with the rest of the other voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cYeah, who does she think she is? The next time you see her-\u201c</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201c-give her a piece of you candy\u201d</span> the happy-go-lucky chimed in interrupting the angered voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGah! Would you guys shut up and leave me alone for once in my life!\u201d Alex growled annoyed and yet also angry that he really had no one else to talk to, well someone other than the voices inside his head. Yes he knew they weren\u2019t real but they were the only things he could talk to. Alex had always had a habit of talking to himself but after that earthquake, yes after that earthquake with mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cYes?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot you! The real one, my mom! Not some stupid copy I thought up\u201d Alex growled angrily at the voice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cB-but-\u201c</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up! You\u2019re not real! None of you are. You\u2019re just a thought! And I can get rid of you just as easily!\u201d Alex growled threatening the not only the caring voice but the entire trio!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to die\u201d</span> the happy-go-lucky voice who now began to cry for once in its life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHey its okay, he doesn\u2019t mean it\u201d</span> the caring voice explained trying to sooth the other personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I do mean it! I want you all gone! I wish I never thought of you! I wish-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cAnd then what? You\u2019ll be alone\u201d</span> growled the angry yet now vengeful voice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up! I hate you\u201d Alex growled slamming his hands over his ears as if to block out the sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cThat\u2019s not going to work and you know it\u201d</span> the vengeful voice warned and in a strange way it only made his voice louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Alex cried now feeling actual pain inside his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cOr what?\u201d </span>the voice mocked <span class=\"cred\">\u201cIf you lose us you\u2019ll go insane like those other crazy fucks in here. Yeah good luck surviving without us\u201d</span> the voice yelled now screaming at the top of his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up\u201d Alex screamed slamming his head against the vending machine causing the display glass to crack and shatter, this caused a large cut to appear on the young man\u2019s forehead. On the floor laid several shattered pieces. Alex collapsed to his knees and looked down at the pieces of shatter glass, suddenly the images of three beings appeared on the pieces of shattered glass. One was that of a young woman, her hair dirty blond like Alex\u2019s and eyes the color of green. The other two were a bit different, well one still human the other was far from it. The second being was that of a small child, somewhat like a child version of Alex only with regular bright blond colored hair. Now the last being, he was something completely different! If one word could describe the being then that word would be, red! This \u2018Red\u2019 being had horns and eyes of pure hatred! It had jet black hair and two bloody horns coming out of its forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cHow dare you, you insolent fool\u201d</span> growled the red skin being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cPlease stop, you\u2019re hurting yourself\u201d</span> the image of the women pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cNo don\u2019t fight! Stop! Please!\u201d</span> the young child image cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up! Shut up! Shut up\u201d Alex repeated clawing at his head as if trying to grasp some last bit of sanity he had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cInsolent fool\u201d</span> *smash* Alex slammed his fist into the image of the red being trying to shut him up, however this did quite the opposite as the red being only multiplied, his figure now fractured in the multiple pieces of glass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cCome on stop it\u201d</span> pleaded the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\u201cPlease big brother, stop it\u201d</span> cried another voice, this one of a small little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u201d Alex couldn\u2019t speak; his eyes began to sting as tears began to flood out of his eyes. Soon he could do nothing more then get into a fetal position and just let the tears come.</span></div></div>",

Ganta didn\u2019t know what to do as he tried to calm his companion down when suddenly \u201cHey Ganta\u201d Shiro began stopping her comedic antics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Ganta began. He had indeed heard something but it was faint, like some sort of soft crying. \u201cIs that\u2026crying?\u201d Shiro imminently bolted forward only to stop a moment later and wave for Ganta to follow her. \u201cHey, Shiro, wait a minute\u201d Ganta called only for Shiro to bolt for it causing Ganta to have to play catch up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed someone was crying but no one around had decided to ask the prisoner why he was crying. Actually no one had even bothered to acknowledge the prisoner and stayed about as far away from the crying prisoner as possible. Well that is until one pure white hair girl arrived on the scene, followed somewhat closely by her black and spiky haired companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Shiro wait up\u201d cried the voice of the white haired girl\u2019s companion as he finally managed to round the corner only to see that of the crying prisoner, crying right besides the vending machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGanta\u2026\u201d the white haired girl began; her voice was of an unusually saddened tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShiro\u2026\u201d the boy with the spiky black hair began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShush\u2026\u201d the white haired girl warned, putting a gloved finger to her mouth, as she walked closer to the crying prisoner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShush, Ganta\u201d the white haired girl named Shiro said, shushing her companion as she slowly moved closer to crying prisoner. The crying prisoner did not respond to her advancement, in fact he was too busy crying to even notice the two\u2019s appearance. His mind was in shambles, a single memory had returned and with it brought great pain to the prisoner. \u201cHey\u2026\u201d Shiro began; her voice now of very a hushed and gentle tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u201d the prisoner didn\u2019t respond and just continued crying. However Shiro continued to try and coax some sort of answer out of the prisoner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute I know this guy\u201d the boy named Ganta began \u201cHe was the weird guy who gave me this piece of candy when I first saw him.\u201d Ganta quickly pulled out a small piece of candy that he had saved since the day he received it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-that voice\u2026\u201d the crying prisoner sniffled out, turning his head and finally acknowledging the two\u2019s appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026hey\u201d Ganta gasped out, he was trying to sound friendly but not really. He had seen plenty of crazy people here and knowing said crazy people were unstable he didn\u2019t want to get attacked which is why he tried to get Shiro to back away from him but she wouldn\u2019t budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re that kid I gave my candy to\u2026\u201d the prisoner began as he tried to sit up, his muscles were stiff from not moving and it showed with all the sounds of cracking bones that were moving back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm you can have it back, here\u201d Ganta hesitantly reached out the hand that held the prisoner\u2019s candy but the prisoner simply looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou kept it?\u201d the prisoner asked while trying to stand up only to fall right back down. \u201cGod why am I so weak? How long was I crying for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know but I remember hearing about someone who had broken down by a vending machine about two days ago\u201d Ganta explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo days?!\u201d the prisoner gasped out in shock \u2018Had it really been that long? I don\u2019t remember it. All I remember was hearing my\u2026\u2019 it was then that the prisoner\u2019s thought broke into verbal speech. \u201cM-my sister, oh my god the earthquake, mom, sis, where are you?\u201d the prisoner began to freak out just like some war vet having an episode!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSNAP OUT OF IT\u201d *SMACK!* the prisoner was sent flying into the vending machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShiro!\u201d Ganta shouted, quickly rushing to the prisoner\u2019s side and began to help remove him out of the broken vending machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after removing the prisoner from the broken machine, Ganta realized just how much of a messed up state the prisoner was in. He was soaked in a mix of blood and bodily fluid; he had a large cut mark on his head that by now was surly infected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-take me\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? What did you say\u201d Ganta asked leaning in closer to the prisoner than he normally would, then again this prisoner was far from normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake me\u2026to my room\u201d the prisoner groaned though barely loud enough to be heard, even with Ganta so close as he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha? You\u2019re room? But I don\u2019t even know where-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Ganta over here\u201d called the voice of Shiro! Ganta instinctively whirled around to see that his female companion had found a room with its door wide open a few feet down the hall. Ganta nodded and turned back to the prisoner \u201cHold on I\u2019ll get you to your room, just hold out till then, okay?\u201d The prisoner gave a weak nod as Ganta tried to help him stand, only to realize that he was too heavy for him to lift alone. \u201cCome on! You\u2019ve got to help too\u201d Ganta groaned and, as if on autopilot, the prisoner immediately bolted upward! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa\u201d Ganta exclaimed in shock as the prisoner suddenly picked up Ganta and threw him onto his back! \u201cPut me down! Hey, put me down damn it!\u201d Ganta yelled but the prisoner didn\u2019t respond, again it seemed like the prisoner was on autopilot, this was even more reinforced by the prisoner\u2019s zoned out expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the prisoner bolted forward and in a matter of milliseconds he came to a stop right in front of Shiro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, go in here\u201d Shiro coaxed, directing the zombie man into the room. (Why a zombie man you may ask? Well because he is! Just look at those cuts and scrapes, he\u2019ll look at all the blood\u2026wait this isn\u2019t a visual medium\u2026 crap &gt;_&lt;)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless the zombie like man quickly entered the room, sat Ganta down in a nearby wooden chair, and then collapsed onto the bed, outcold!</span></div></div>",

Y ou step down off the bus and ook around the guards are up towards the front of the line fiting somesort of collar around the other guys necks as they file off into the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the guy behind you shove you again and you lose you're balance and sprawl to the ground. Looking up you see the guy about to bring his boot down on you're head. Rolling to the side you manage to avoid hid boot slamming down on you're head. Rolling sideways you lash out and knock his legs out from under him sending him crashing to the ground. Taking the chance to get to back to you're feet you back up several steps and allow him th climb to his feet. As he climbs to his feet you start to size him up he is to put it bluntly a mountain. He had to be close to 6 foot 5 and basically a wall of muscle. Well this should be fun you think to you're self as he charges at you you shift slightly to the side and stick out youre foot tripping him up and sending him crashing once more to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time the guards have noticed the little grudge match you have going on and come running to break it up. When they attaempt to restrain the idiot you are fighting he tries to fight back slugging the first guard to reach him square on the jaw. The punch lays the guard out flat on his back and makes the others slightly more cautiouse in approaching him. Instead of waiting for the gaurds to come to him the guy who up to a momment ago you had been fighting charges into the group of guards punching and kicking. This apparently was not a good idea as first one then two guards pull what appear to be nightsticks out and lay into him. When they make contackt with the fool though you hear a crackle and smell a burning sceant. Appreantly the sticks as electrocuted a fact made more apparent by the way the igit writhes on the floor screaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cant help but grin at obviouse torment he is in after all he had started a fight with you for no reason what so ever. Making a mental note to avoid being hit with those sticks you quickly back up and raise you're hands as far as you can as the guards come up to you. They quickly push you to the ground and clamp one of those stange collars to you're neck.  What the hell is going on here you hear a femminine voice ask. Looking up you you what has to be one of the scariest looking woman you had ever seen. She also had to have the largedt breast you had ever seen coming in at somthing you guesses to be close to G cup. Theses two got into a argument warden nothing seriouse one of the guards tells the women giving her a quick salute.</span></div></div>",

Looking at you you see her frown and her head moves slightly up and down a subtle tell that she does in fact know what you did to be sentenced to this prison. At least thats what you take the mans question to mean since you had done nothing to provoke this kind of wrath since you had you're little run in with that rival gang. As the man rants and raves pointing to you and nearly foaming at the mouth in his anger you cant help but grin as the memories of that night come back to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had started out well enough for you you had left the orphangae to go to the small school you attended sitting quietly through the boring classes. Whne they finaly released you you had heded over to the hang  out the group you were assoiciated with kept. The group was known as the grims refering to the large tatto of what appears to be the grim reaper grinning while licking a large blood coated serated knife. Everyone in the gang had at least part of the tatto signaling rank applied to them. Begginers would have a arm or part of the skull drawn first then added to up until they managed tog et the full tatto and become a full memmber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had started with the full tatto having been a founding memmber of the group. You had started it it with a group of casual friends who were tired of being pushed around by the other gangs and from there had slowly ganed notierity among the others as a group not to be messed with. At the time of you're downfall you were numbering near 70 memmbers when you had come from scholl to find the hangout painted with the blood of you're friends and the floor covered with the spent rounds that had killed them. You remmber clearly seeing the image of a large snake holding a diamond card in it's mouth having been painted on the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that it gets a little fuzzy for you you can remmber being vaguely angry but to be honest it was like you were watching a movie more then you were the person doing the action. You had rode you're bike over to the diamond backs hideout and bangged on the door screaming at them to let you in. You can remmber seeing there suprised looks at seeing you just walk to them though they had gotten over that quickly. They had dragged you to there boss and thrown you at his feet. Looking up you saw one of you're friends from the grims nanaly you remmber. She was tied to a block next to the dimond backs boss bruised and battered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt here that you remmber coming back into you're body here when you realize that you had walked straight into the group who had just destroyed you're whole gang with no weapons or any sort of plan. Instead of dread or even fear you remmber being calm it was almost like even though you were in a situation that meant certain death you could sense you would be fine. This sensation kept the fear back and allowed you to stand before this gang who had taken you;re friends from you and comfront them. And when they refused to listen to you're please that they release nanaly and explain there reasons for the deaths of you're friends it allowed you to take you're revenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remmber standing in that old run down wearhouse standing in front of the pepole who had destroyed the world you knew and for the first time since going into that hideout you remmber actually feeling somthing more then a small far away twinge. As you had stood before these vermin who had dared to take what was you're you had felt a rage so dark and bleak well up you had thought you were going to pass out. They had laughed as you stumbled and cut you're hand they had laughed as you trembled on the gorund. They had laughed becuse they had not seen what you had the blood that had welled from the cut on you're hand had insteda of running down you're hand into the dirt had come out flexing and whipping back and forth almost like a living entity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they had laughed at you trembling in the dirt not from fear or sadness but with anger you had been unable to think of anythinbg but the destruction of these pepole around you. Youre blood almost as if it could hear you had flexed towards you moving and weaving in that serpentine manner. Curiouse as to what was going on you had wondered if you could control it and as you thought of this you're mind wondered as to what kind of weapon it could be. When the thought of the blood being a weapon crystallized in youre mind so did it becoming a 3 inch blade of what appaered to be crystal. And still you could feel it moving not just in you're hand but through you're whole body as if it to longed to destroy these pepole who would cause you harm, mock you, and take from you what was you'res. It has to be said that though you were angry at the death of the pepole in you're gang it was not becuse they were friends but becuse you viewed them as belonging to you as indeed you had the school you went to and the hideout they had wrecked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had stumbled to there hideout numb becuse you had no idea as what else you should do confused as to what had happened to you're cherished possesion and unable to think of a way to continue the gloriouse game you had started in creating the gang. For you had made it not to stand up to tohers not for protection but to pit you're mind against others to test you're ability to manipulate the world with it's infinate variables around you. You had been numb becuse you had been unable to belive you're game would end with you're defeat while you had not been there to fight the pepole who opposed you. It had taken untill you had seen nanaly another of you're possesion abused by the rival player before you. It had taken him and his pwns laughing at you to galvanize you're mind back into action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had taken the awkening of you're bloodlust of you're ablility to kill those who stood before you not with you're pawns but with you're own to hands to show you that you had not in fact lost. No while the gang had been wiped out and you had lost a few pawns and you're hideout you had gained the ability to kill not with th drude weapons of man but with the essence of you're own body. You could know go forward witht he knowledge that you had in fact been born to not just win but kill for why else would it be that the very blood in you're vains had become a weapon? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remmber clearly sending it in a stream at the group closest to you how only a few drops had hit them and there jeers and torments had turned first to cries of disgust then to pain as the blood had saoked through there clothes and skin steaming and eaating it's way into there own bloodvessels and mixing with it turning it agianst thgem ripping out of them as wounderouse crystal. Had turned it on the group farthes from you biting throguht the skin of you're other hand so as to add to the deadly rain. The fool who had dared to mock and ridicule you and destroy you're poseesions had stared at you in absolute fear as you had apporached him crytstal errupting from the guards and friends he thought gurranteed his sfety you had stood there with blood soaking you and grinned at him for awhile waiting for him to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually he had when he spoke it was not words of defiance or pleads for pity no he countinued to ridicule you albeit not malicilusly but fearfully asking what kind of a freak you were and recititng half remmbered prayers for salvation. You had grinnned as you apporached him shoving the crystal shiv jutting form you're hand into his windpipe and draggin it through his juggler vain freeezing the blood as it gushed from his throat. And you had anwsered thusly that you were neither a frak nor a demon that the divine could vanquish you weere but a better payer of the game of life the he himself had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are pulled from you're musings by a shout from the guard near you and looking up you see the warden bring the blade she carried at her side slashing down on the man who had follishly started a fight with you. As you smell the fammiliar scent of blood you again fell that coursing in you're veins you felt that night and find you're face again contorting into that same demmented grin you had worn as you slaughtered the 100 gang memmbers who had opposed you. I think i shall like this place for my stay here you cannot help but think to you'reself yes truly this is where a person sucha s youreself can thrive and build for the future. </span></div></div>",

You must be the new guy. The name\u2019s Mitch\u201d explained a man grabbed in a bar tender\u2019s get up. The man named Mitch was standing behind that of a bar with many different assortments of items ranging from simple bags of chips to high class saki to cheap chocolates all around the counter and behind the counter. The tall man in the black long coat quickly took a seat and the man named Mitch spoke again. \u201cSo what\u2019ll it be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlcohol, strongest you got\u201d replied the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s your poison, eh? Well here you go a glass of Strong Armed Devil; if it doesn\u2019t knock you on your ass then you\u2019ll find yourself with a massive hang over. Either way it\u2019s the strongest stuff we got, alcohol wise\u201d Mitch explained setting down a tall glass of deep crimson liquid onto the counter before sliding it down the counter to the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks...\u201d the man replies a bit annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that tone. Something you wanna talk about it?\u201d immediately the man in the long coat gave Mitch a death stare. \u201cSorry, didn\u2019t mean to make you mad.\u201d The long coat man simply looked back at his glass and took a large sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several drinks the long coated man decided to remove his long coat, revealing several slash marks that had turned into scars. By the look of it, a kitchen knife had been used against the man, although very clumsily as none of the slashes looked very deep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy my, you must have been through a lot. I\u2019ve only seen one other person with scars like that and I believe that was-\u201cthe former long coated man cut Mitch off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t really care.\u201d The man exclaimed in a groan of annoyance as he began to rub the two temples on above his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry\u2026\u201d Mitch apologized as he grabbed another bottle of Strong Arm only for the former long coated man to stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough Alcohol for now. I\u2019d like something to eat, maybe something sweet.\u201d The man explained sliding his glass two inches from where it originally sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComing right up, do you want anything special?\u201d Mitch asked to which the man gave a small shrug along with a joking smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurprise me\u201d the man said in a sincere almost sarcastic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot\u2019cha, one sweat surprise coming up\u201d Mitch explained turning around and crouching down to face a hidden mini-fridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Mitch stands back up and in his hand was that of a cherry topped vanilla sundae.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhelp here you go, bon app\u00e9tit\u201d Mitch explains, placing the sundae in front of the man and then hands him a spoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh you don\u2019t disappoint.\u201d The man exclaimed with a small chuckle as he took the spoon in hand only to be stopped moments before he could dig into his sundae.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore you eat, answer me this. What\u2019s your name?\u201d Mitch asked politely?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrr\u2026fine\u201d the man groaned reluctant to talk about himself. \u201cMy name is Alex.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlexander?\u201d Mitch asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCall me Alex!\u201d the man growled as if he were a vicious animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Alex. Enjoy your sundae\u201d Mitch explained, taking Alex\u2019s empty glass in hand, and he walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later the man named Alex had already finished his sundae and was about to dig into another when someone new entered the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYo! It\u2019s me and the boys! Get us some drinks bartender \u201ccalled a very loud voice as three large and very strongly built men entered the bar. Two of the men were just normal prisoners; the only difference was a different skin tone. However the other man even more built than other two, and he seemed the type to be more muscle than brawn. However the man named Alex didn\u2019t acknowledge their approach as the three man took a seat at the bar, the largest and bulkiest man sitting directly beside Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYo what the fuck is that shit? Yo bartender who the hell told you to serve this shit\u201d the man screamed, intentionally screaming in the man named Alex\u2019s face. Alex simply ignored the annoying man and continued to eat his sundae only for the annoying man to knock the spoonful of ice cream out of his hand. \u201cYo nigga I\u2019m talkin to ya!\u201dThe man screamed as if he was the blackest gangster from the boondocks where in actuality the man was quiet white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u201d Alex didn\u2019t reply and simply stood up to retrieve his spoon which had fallen to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it fucker don\u2019t ignore me!\u201d screamed the man before he suddenly grabbed Alex by the head and slammed him into the counter. \u201cNow look at me! Look me in the eye nigga!\u201d The man turned Alex\u2019s head so that he could face him only to see Alex with a look that terrified the man \u201cYou son of a bitch! Don\u2019t look at me like that!\u201d the man screamed before throw a huge punch only for Alex to catch him mid-punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u201d Alex stood up, his hand gripping the man\u2019s arm like a vice, as he stared the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGAH! Let me go nigga! Let go\u201d the man screamed only for Alex to increase his grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*snap*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAHHHH\u201d the man screamed as the joint in his arm where his arm met his hand snapped way out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNigger? Is that what you called me?\u201d Alex finally spoke, his tone so threatening that it made the other two men at the counter besides the bar tender, run away in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet back here you god damn f-\u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SLAM!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at me! Do I even look even the slightest bit tan or dark skinned?\u201d Alex growled his voice growing even angrier as he pulled the man\u2019s face back up from the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat you talkin bout-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSHUT UP!\u201d Alex screamed slamming the man\u2019s face once more into the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*slam!* *SLAM!* *SLAM!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnswer the question you piece of white trash!\u201d Alex demanded, placing a death grip on the man\u2019s throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no nig\u2026uh I mean man.\u201d The man screamed and suddenly was released, falling on his backside. \u201c*cough, cough* you *cough* crazy son of a *cough* bitch\u201d the man coughed trying to regain his balance as Alex walk back towards where he put his long coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Vroom, vroom* the sound of a chainsaw entered the man\u2019s ears and he immediately pissed his pants in response. Alex quickly turned around; in his hand were what appeared to be two overly wide swords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me ask you a question White Trash\u2026\u201d Alex began walking forward, swords in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStay away from me man!\u201d the man pleaded. \u201cHelp me!\u201d he pleaded to the bartender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*VROOM! VROOM!* the sound again and it was coming from Alex\u2019s wide swords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shit! You\u2019re that fucker who killed his entire family with a chainsaw! Oh shit man! Look I\u2019m sorry! Spare me please. I\u2019m begging you\u201d the man pleaded, tears streaming down his face, hands in a praying position as Alex came closer with his mini-chainsaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026did you ever have any siblings?\u201d Alex asked looking like the grim fucking reaper in the man\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god please, I don\u2019t want to die\u201d the man prayed while trying to crawl away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is no such thing as god or the devil! Now answer the question\u201d Alex demanded grabbing the man by the leg. \u201cDid you or do you not have any siblings?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes man yes! A little brother and two sisters\u201d the man exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s about a mother, a father\u201d Alex asked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy mom but my dad left us when she gave birth to me\u201d the man cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA pity, I can sympathize\u201d Alex explained in a moment of sympathy before revving his blades one more time. The man\u2019s eyes darted all around the room, looking for some way out, some hope of escape when he spied the bartender once more who was simply cleaning a cup with a rag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBartender! Help me! Call the guards! Call the warden! Call anyone!\u201d the man pleaded. The bartender continued to clean the glass in his hand but did not look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy should I help someone who doesn\u2019t even know my name\u201d and with that the man\u2019s last thread of hope was severed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm Mike, Micheal, Barry, Rick\u201d the man pleaded but the bartender continued to clean the glass like nothing was happening as Alex brought his blades even closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u201d Alex didn\u2019t speak but mouthed something over the sound of his chainsaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTell my sister I said hello\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then that was it! Alex drove his two chainsaws into the man\u2019s two arms. The man screamed in pure agony as his two arms fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-mitch. You\u2019re name\u2019s Mitch\u201d the man yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo late\u201d the bartender explained holding up the glass to the light, allowing it to show the man his demented reflection just before Alex carved into the man\u2019s throat, splattering blood all over him and part of the carpet that the two men\u2026well one man and a soon to be corpse, were standing on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026and dead\u201d Alex gasped as the man\u2019s horribly severed head and body fell to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood riddance\u201d Mitch exclaimed with emotionless tone of voice.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After turning back towards the bartender Alex took out his wallet only for the bartender to shake his head and tell him it was all on the house. Alex let a small smile escape and left to return to his room in order to both clean up and relax. He had worked up a sweat from killing that White Trash guy and wanted something besides food to take his mind off the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater after one long shower, a bit of mouthwash and some Q tips, Alex exited the washroom and walked past several prisoners, one of them a man with spiky hair who would look good with a eye patch if he ever lost an eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026never mind\u201d Alex explained walking away from the man who simply gave a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I wonder what that was about\u2019 the man asked as he continued on his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Alex arrived at his room; however it wasn\u2019t like one of the other normal prisoner\u2019s cells. This looked almost like a small apartment; there was a fridge along with an electric stove right beside it in the far corner of the roof. Besides those was a chrome sink with several dishes inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like I have to do the dishes...\u201dAlex groaned walking up to the sink and putting on some rubber gloves that were a dull red color. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Alex finally had the chance to sit down in what appeared to be a black lounge chair. Alex quickly removed his long coat and sat it on a coat rack that was next to the chair. He then took out his two chainsaw swords and, after pulling out a somewhat large folding table, sat the two blades down. Alex quickly turned to his left and reached besides the lounge chair before pulling out a medium size tool box. He quickly sat the tool box onto the table, a few inches from the blades but close enough so he could reach without having to strain himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex slowly reached for the tool box and gently opened it, as if tending to some sort of fragile glass sculpture that would break if he used too much force. And then, with a small clang, the tool box was opened, revealing an assortment of tools, ranging from your basic screw drives and hammers to what seemed like handmade tools of some sort. Only Alex knew what those \u2018special\u2019 tools were used for and he wasn\u2019t about to show and tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless Alex removed a screw driver from the box and grabbed one of the chainsaw blades before then proceeding to unscrew and remove the covering that held the inner blade of the chainsaw in check. However before Alex could do anymore the door suddenly opened and a man garbed in a grey business suit walked in followed by two identical looking twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, Mr. Reaper, I\u2019m glad I caught you\u201d explained the man as he walked forward towards Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u201d Alex ignored the man as he continued the maintenance on his swords. The man took this as a sign to continue talking and so he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see Reaper, today there was supposed to be a match between you and a deadman named Eagle. Yet here I find that not only did you ignore the call for your fight but you also went to a bar and chainsawed an innocent convict in half. Now what was our arrangement again, hmm?\u201d the man wanted an answer and Alex reluctantly replied. He didn\u2019t like speaking with this man, in fact if he could Alex would\u2019ve carved up this bastard long ago but their \u2018arrangement\u2019 put an end to any thoughts like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do matches for you and you keep me from the firing squad\u201d Alex explained looking the man dead in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood now I expect a great make up fight from you tomorrow, this time instead of just one deadman there will be two. Oh the viewers will be happy with this line up. The Grim Reaper vs. The Eagle and The Hawk, two titans of speed versus the man with the glare of utter death! Ooh how fun\u201d the man laughed taking far too much pleasure in the thought of Alex killing or being killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow if you\u2019ll excuse me I have to finish maintenance on my blades. Or else do you want to see me lose?\u201d Alex\u2019s question made the man named Tamaki smile wickedly adding even more too why Alex hated the man, his smile! It gave him the creeps which is why he quickly got up and pushed him out of outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember 8 sharp\u201d Tamaki explained before finally exiting the room along with the two twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this Alex was alone once more\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u201d Alex suddenly gripped his fist and promptly slammed it into the wall, creating a large hole that was about twice the size of his fist. \u201cDamn you Tamaki! Damn you\u201d Alex cursed slamming his other fist into the wall, creating another large hole in the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night Alex made sure that his blades were in complete working order before climbing into his bed which was nothing more than a black futon only without the frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn Tamaki!\u201d Alex groaned rolling around on the futon mattress, trying in a futile attempt to get comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGAH, FUCK I CAN\u2019T SLEEP\u201d Alex screamed out as he tossed and turned. He had been trying to sleep for several hours and by his internal clock he could tell that it was either late at night or early morning. Alex\u2019s room had no windows after all so he could only guesstimate. Still his body clock usually wasn\u2019t wrong however tonight was different. For some reason he couldn\u2019t fall asleep. Maybe it was due to the fact that he had consumed several glasses of alcohol but no that couldn\u2019t be it! Maybe he was hungry? No he had made sure to eat a good helping of ramen noodles and beef along with a tall glass of OJ (orange juice).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute\u2026that OJ! I don\u2019t remember getting that from the vending machine! That bastard Tamaki must\u2019ve slipped it in the fridge while I was at the bar. Damn it\u201d Alex growled slamming a heavy fist into the mattress.</span></div></div>",

Might as well walk around to get my mind going at least I\u2019ll have a plan when I go into battle instead of going just plain tired and shit out of luck.\u201d Alex explained to no one in particular. Alex quickly got dressed and headed for the gym, the idea was to think while training but as Alex rounded the corner he saw that of Crazy Bitch herself, Miss Rei Takashima! Alex immediately shuddered, that bitch was the only woman he truly feared! As for the Warden Makina, Alex didn\u2019t fear her so much as admire her. Though he had no interest in her romantically, he had given up on romance ever since those bastard popular girls at school played with his emotions only to kick him in the balls, both literally and figuratively! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway back to reality and the Crazy Bitch down the hall. She was talking to another person garbed in a lab coat, a scientist maybe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Regardless I think we should crack open that case and dissect the Wretched Egg\u201d Crazy Bitch explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Wretched Egg\u2019 Alex thought to himself \u2018What is she talking about?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut if we do that then she might escape and kill us a-\u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want excuses! I don\u2019t care what the director says! I want that case open and that bitch on my table yesterday\u201d Crazy Bitch demands getting right into the scientist face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut-\u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it, either get the job done or I\u2019ll do the job myself! God you\u2019re so incompetent\u201d Crazy Bitch groaned putting an end to the scientist\u2019s arguing. It was then that the two began to walk off which is when Alex decided he\u2019d spend his sleepless night finding out what exactly this \u2018Wretched Egg\u2019 was. Besides what else could he do, that damn drugged OJ was still very much in effect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little bit of following, copying batman, and stopping for a piss break later Alex had found what appeared to be a secret entrance to the so called \u2018G-Block\u2019. Thinking about it, wasn\u2019t he already in G-Block? Wait maybe this was an entrance to a secret laboratory in hidden deep within G-Block. Yeah that\u2019s what it was! (Thank you plot hole ^_^)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway Alex, like the somewhat ninja he was, entered the entrance and quickly climbed up onto the hatch so that he would not be seen in case somebody had called the elevator from bellow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018All answers point to down eh? Well as I recall, the beast usually sleeps in the deepest part of the dungeon. At least that\u2019s how my old rpg games did it.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod I miss my play station &gt;_&lt;!\u201d Alex groaned as the elevator comes to a sudden stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey did you hear something\u201d asked a random voice from bellow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm no.\u201d replies another voice from bellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, must\u2019ve been the elevator. I\u2019ll call someone later about repairs\u201d explains a third voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above Alex was doing his best impression of a silent mime while trying not to get caught. This soon paid off as the elevator came to a sudden stop causing Alex to almost fall right back into the elevator and onto the three people bellow. Fortunately he was able to keep his balance and the three men bellow were none the wiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex waited patiently as the three men bellow exited the elevator and then made his move, quickly dashing down into the elevator before bolting outward and into the secret laboratory of Deadman Wonderland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">////INFILTRATION COMPLEATE\\\\</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeird I feel a sudden metal gear reference coming on\u201d Alex exclaimed in a moment of nostalgia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShow time\u201d Alex exclaims striking pose similar to that of a famous eye patched secret agent who was featured in a recent addition of a game baring the initials SSBB! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow to make like snake and find the nearest card board box\u201d Alex exclaimed barrel rolling across a nearby hallway until finally he arrived at what looked to be a control room of some sort. Alex quickly looks at the control panel and spies that of a large red button \u201cHmm\u2026ooh what does this button do\u201d Alex asks, making another reference to a certain classic cartoon character from another famous laboratory? Immediately Alex\u2019s curiosity got the better of him as he quickly pushed the button unaware of what the aftereffect would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cWARNING! WARNING THE SELFDESTRUCT SEQUENCE HAS BEEN ACTIVATED! ALL PER-\u201c</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoopsie, wrong button\u201d Alex grasps in a comedic fashion before promptly pushing several other buttons on the control panel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWretched Egg release protocol initiated! Warning all guards report to the control room\u201d call an automated alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shit! Out of references and almost out of time. Crap and well at least it can\u2019t get worse\u201d Alex laughs insanely as the door to the control room opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">//// ! \\\\</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey what are you doing here?\u201d asked a guard before promptly pointing his gun at Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shit\u2026umm sorry I thought this was the bathroom. My bad\u201d Alex explains scratching the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? Well the bathrooms down the hall. You must be new here and\u2026hey wait a minute! You were trying to pull a fast one on me weren\u2019t you? Come on fess up\u201d the guard demanded!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got me, I\u2019m secretly a sexy cat lady only masquerading as a death row inmate in order to feed my dying aunt who has some in curable disease, NYAH\u201d Alex explains striking a pose like a neko cat girl, unaware that there was a large being slowly levitating upward  and behind him just past the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shit she\u2019s out! The Wretched Egg is out\u201d the guard exclaimed just as several other generic security guards made their way to the control room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm well then I guess I traded in a few omelets for\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>One.</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Bad.</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Egg!</b>\u201d Suddenly the glass behind Alex exploded inwardly sending several huge pieces at Alex and the guards. However Alex simply took it and let the glass penetrate his back and spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGAH!\u201d screamed the guard who Alex was talking to prior, as he fell to the ground bleeding out like a uncorked bottle of gin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEVERYONE OPEN FIRE\u201d screamed one of the remaining guards as all the remaining guards began to open fire with their weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm this seems oddly familiar\u2026oh I know this reminds me of that anime Elfen L-\u201cAlex was cut off as the Wretched Egg sent him flying forward into the stream of bullet, only for that stream of bullets to fly back at the ones who fired them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b><u>Time for the ants to die</u></b>\u201d the Wretched Egg exclaimed with what seemed to be a female voice as a wicked smile crossed her metal masked face. It was then that Alex was bulled back by what seemed to be a huge back draft only to be flung forward once more by an equally sudden blast of air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell this is gonna be-\u201chowever before Alex could finish his joke he was sent flying through several stone walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw\u2026\u201d Alex groaned after waking up a couple of minutes later only to see that of the Wretched Egg standing right before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026you were the one freed me?\u201d it asked, still sounding a malice and psychotic as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, though I honestly didn\u2019t think you\u2019d cheap shot me like that to be perfectly honest\u201d Alex explains standing back up and dusting himself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheap shot? Oh you mean the broken glass and the back attack\u201d the Wretched Egg explained in a somewhat asking tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I have the glass and scrapes in my back to prove it, not to mention what happened to my coat\u201d Alex groaned turning around to show his wounded back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh I can fix your wounds\u201d the Wretched Egg explained with a sadistic laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that\u2019d be great but how-\u201c suddenly the Wretched Egg pulls it\u2019s arm back as if winding up for a punch and then shoves its entire hand into Alex\u2019s chest, more specifically just about an inches above his collar bone right on his neck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d</span></div></div>",

What the fuck?!\u201d Alex immediately snapped back to the current crisis as the Wretched Egg flew up from the huge hole in the floor that took up a huge chuck of Alex\u2019s room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s for smashing my head into the floor\u201d the Wretched Egg exclaimed, vengeance clearly present in her tone of voice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah I throw your face into the ground and you throw me through half of G-Block. Yeah that sounds fair\u201d Alex exclaims in a sarcastic tone of voice as he dusts himself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh did I damage your coat? Too bad that won\u2019t be the only thing I destroy tonight\u201d The Wretched Egg laughed before landing about seven feet from Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah we\u2019ll see about that\u2026\u201d Alex says with a smirk as he quickly darts his eyes around the room before quickly spying his twin chain saw blades about two feet behind the Wretched Egg. \u2018Damn, if I could only get to the blades then I could cut this chick down to size\u2026wait she\u2019s shorter than me. Yeah by a good three inches\u2026Ah shit why did I have to notice that?\u2019 Alex groans to himself, scratching his head in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey look over there\u201d Alex roars \u201cI think It\u2019s Ganta Igarashi!\u201d Immediately the Wretched Egg whirls around giving Alex the opportunity to make a dash for his weapons! In a matter of seconds Alex had grabbed his chainsaws and had already revved them up. \u201cGOT\u2019CHA\u201d he roared causing the Wretched Egg to whirl around only to be struck by one of the chainsaws, in her neck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDie! Die! DIE YOU UNHOLY BITCH\u201d Alex screamed no ROARED as his chainsaw dug into the Wretched Egg\u2019s esophagus and in turn her wind pipe, killing her instantly! However Alex didn\u2019t stop there and continued to dig deeper and deeper until the Wretched egg\u2019s entire head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*pant* t-there*pant* dead *pant*\u201d Alex gasped exhaustedly dropping his chainsaws out of pure exhaustion before collapsing to the floor himself. \u201c*pant* At least *pant she dead *pant\u2026\u201d It was then that a familiar laughter pierced Alex\u2019s ears like a bullet to the brain! \u201cN-no way\u201d Alex gasped look up to see that of the Wretched Egg headless corpse holding it\u2019s disembodies head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like I\u2019m harder to kill than you thought\u201d the disembodied head said with a bone chilling cackle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026damn it!\u201d Alex cried, tears beginning to form in the corner of his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey don\u2019t cry I\u2019ll make sure that I kill you quickly since you put up such an entertaining fight.\u201d The Wretched Egg explained as she put her head back on the stump where it originally stood. In a moment of sheer horror the Wretched Egg\u2019s head was reattached and to add even more horror, it now looked like the whole beheading had never happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-damn it\u201d Alex groaned trying to stand up but it was all in vain as the Wretched Egg quickly delivered a bone shattering leg sweep causing Alex to crash into the floor with a very hard thud! \u201cAh\u2026my head\u201d Alex groaned as he tried to move once more only to find his entire body paralyzed and one of his eyes bleeding profusely. \u2018Did I have an aneurism? Oh god I think my head is bleeding. I taste applesauce, why do I taste applesauce?\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh\u201d *crunch* <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\u201d Alex screams out in agony as the Wretched Egg has just slammed her foot onto his spine, snapping it in half with a single strike!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on what happened to all that spirit you had earlier\u201d The Wretched Egg asked as she continued to stomp on Alex\u2019s spine, snapping it again and again until it was at least twenty different pieces. However suddenly the Wretched Egg stopped and for a moment Alex was granted a reprieve, partially due to the fact his spine was in so many pieces that and he no longer could feel any pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that\u2026a lullaby?\u201d Alex asked before subsiding into unconsciousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmazing...\u201d echoed female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Crazy Bitch?\u2019 Alex thought to himself as his eyes flickered open. There before him was that of Crazy Bitch herself, Rei  Takashima, and some weird guy with black hair who was cracking his neck a lot. \u2018W-who\u2019s that guy?\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApparently he went toe to toe with the Wretched Egg, not to mention destroyed half of G-Block\u201d explained the neck cracker guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Yeah thank you captain obvious\u2026uhh I feel like hell\u2019 Alex internally groaned but the two heard him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, he\u2019s still alive\u201d Crazy Bitch exclaimed in a bit of shock and awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy my how interesting. I guess Tamaki was right to let him join us Undertakers\u201d explained the neck cracker guy as he looked right into my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Why can\u2019t I move? Uhh\u2026my head hurts. I think I\u2019m gonna-\u2018however before Alex could finish his thought he passed out once more.</span></div></div>",

I remember the flavor of the severed limb of my sister as I sunk my teeth into her thigh. It tasted bitter, salty, and revolting. God I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how those zombies in all those horror movies love this stuff.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen the cops showed up\u00e2\u0080\u00a6I felt sleepy and dreamt up something strange. However when I awoke I forgot what I was dreaming about and found myself in a police station.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll the officers looked at me as if I was a monster but was I? No I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not, at least in my opinion. Regardless after several hours one of the officers said I had a visitor. \u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a6<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere be for me, sat in a wheel chair was that of an old man. He was dress in an outfit straight out of hospital and he looked rather ill. Yet even with this he smiled at me. At first I thought it weird as I had never seen this old geezer in my entire life but then he introduced himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy name is Hagire, Hagire Rinchir\u014d\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, introducing himself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPlease, would you care to give me your name?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlex, Alexander\u00e2\u0080\u009d I explained reaching one of my hands outwards towards the old man for a hand shake only to realize that my hands were cuffed together. However the old man quickly remedied this by coming closer regardless to the officers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 warnings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlex, a nice name\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said smiling as he shook my hand. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow do you mind telling me why you are imprisoned?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man was an odd one that was for sure! None of the officers really seemed to care to ask, favoring to trust the report over what the actual criminal had to say. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all I was to them, a criminal that they only wanted gone, a monster they only wanted put down. But then there was this old man, who actually care what I had to say, if not he at least had the ball to ask me what happened. So I decided what the hell and told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u00a6I see so all of your family is dead, but what about your mother? You said you barely touched her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The old man asked crossing his hands placing his chin on top of where they connected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do anything really serious to her because she was the only one that I cared about. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to hurt her, just get her out of the way so I could get to the real problem\u00e2\u0080\u009d I explained crossing my legs crisscross applesauce on the cold concrete cell floor while folding my arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see so you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to hurt her. Oh I if I remember correctly you have a locket\u00e2\u0080\u009d the old man said making me groan a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI \u00e2\u0080\u0098had\u00e2\u0080\u0099 a locket. The police took it from me while I was unconscious.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I explained pouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh you mean this one?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the old man quickly reached into his pocket and pulled out a silver locket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMY LOCKET! Please give it to me\u00e2\u0080\u009d I pleaded almost screaming at the old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give it to you on one condition\u00e2\u0080\u009d he explained tossing the locket to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah what do you want, first dibs on killing me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked sarcastically and the old man simply laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh no I have something much more important for you than just dying. I want you to come with me\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d the old man explained. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 to be an Undertaker in my Deadman Wonderland.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was it! That was how I came to Deadman Wonderland. But why am I thinking of this? Am I dead? Did that bitch Wretched Egg kill me? No I still can feel my heart beating...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Bump, bump*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah I can hear my heart beat, must be I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m in some really bad shape but what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this? I feel\u00e2\u0080\u00a6warm? And I see something\u00e2\u0080\u00a6a color, red. Blood! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m bleed\u00e2\u0080\u00a6wait that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m bleeding out! Fuck no I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not dying till I kick that Wretched Egg bitch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ass! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a6<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp somewhere in one of the other blocks, Rei Takashima was experimenting with latest guinea pig, it was the Undertaker who had went toe to toe with the wretched Egg and had in the middle of the fight, destroyed half of G-Block. However suddenly while she was slicing open the victim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart in order to test her theory that the Wretched Egg has implanted a Red Crystal inside the victim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chest. However she was a bit off target as the actual red crystal was in lodged in the victim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the Cardiac Monitor, which was reading a steady line signally the victim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death, began to beep at a rapid pace!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKKK\u00e2\u0080\u009d the victim began to scream as his eyes shot open right as Rei had a scalpel to his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cB-but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impossible! You were dead\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rei gasps in shock, accidently stabbing the victim in the left part of her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTake it out! Get THE HELL OFF\u00e2\u0080\u009d he screamed when suddenly Alex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blood began to move and form together to create what seemed like combat tentacles. Immediately Alex grabbed Rei by the throat and threw her aside. Rei came to a crashing halt as she collided with a large bookshelf containing many medical and research texts which promptly fell and buried her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOw\u00e2\u0080\u00a6wait what the fu-\u00e2\u0080\u009c Rei didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t finished that sentence as she was in awe. Before her the very person, who she had ripped open and gutted like a trout, was now undergoing a process of self regeneration! Tentacles of blood shot out from the victim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body, before quickly reseeding and then shooting out once more. It was almost like they were trying to grab something!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Wait that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the sudden realize hit Rei like a ton of bricks \u00e2\u0080\u0098he must be trying to regain the organs I removed!\u00e2\u0080\u0099<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed this was the case as several blood tentacles shot out from various other parts of Alex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body such as an empty eye socket, the mouth, even the lower abdomen. Soon after this the victim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye, his tongue, as well as several other vital and not so vital appendages were brought back to their corresponding places. Then the blood tentacles began to form what looked like stitches as they reattached the formally missing pieces to the rest of the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFascinating\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rei said truly amazed at the brutal yet elegant display of precision and science! It was then that she was struck by something. She glanced over to see that of a large blood tentacle piercing her left shoulder blade. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGAH\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rei cried out in pain only to be immediately silenced by some sort of ooze like substance which was actually blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou did this to me\u00e2\u0080\u009d Alex wheezed, trying to stand up from the bed \u00e2\u0080\u009cDidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rei didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t speak which only made Alex angrier. He quickly leaped from the bed and grabbing her by the throat! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have five seconds to answer before I use my new powers to cut you open like a thanksgiving turkey!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Alex croak, his voice box still regenerating which made his voice sound all the more terrifying. Rei immediately nodded to which Alex responded with a bloody fist to the face! \u00e2\u0080\u009cBitch\u00e2\u0080\u009d Alex growled as his voice finally returned. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow where the fuck is that Wretched Egg?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Alex roared as he left the doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office in search of his next target.</span></div></div>",

The girl named Shiro turned around to see that of an old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrampa\u201d Shiro exclaimed happily as she ran up to the old man and gave him a nice warm hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, yes it\u2019s good to see you as well\u201d the old man said sincerely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s been so long, I missed you\u201d Shiro said burying her head into the man\u2019s chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I know, now Shiro I have a very special job for you\u201d the old man began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure anything Grampa\u201d Shiro exclaims anxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, good. Now I need you to listen very closely\u2026\u201d and with that the old man told Shiro his plan to which Shiro nodded and bolted for a nearby vent. She only stopped to turn around and wave goodbye and then left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is she?\u201d roared an enraged Alex as he limped his way through the halls of some random sector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Alex, long time no see\u201d called a familiar voice. Alex immediately whirled around to see that of Guitar Hero himself, Azuma Genkaku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u201d Alex was about to turn right back around when Genkaku stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey now is that any way to treat a friend? Especially an Uber Monk like me\u201d he asked placing a friendly hand Alex\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet off of me\u201d Alex roared unintentionally sending Genkaku sliding down the hall. Genkaku however remained on his feet and merely smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I see you got yourself a branch of sin. Nice, congrats buddy\u201d Genkaku said in his usual laid back tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not your BUDDY\u201d Alex roared firing a number of blood tentacles at Genkaku who merely flashed his skull necklace forward, neutralizing the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey easy there buddy, I don\u2019t want to fight you, honest! Besides you\u2019re far too strong\u201d Genkaku explained picking his ear with his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up! All I want to do is kill that Wretched Egg! She did this to me! She made me into this freak\u201d Alex roared looking at his palm which was covered in bloody stitches as he had begun calling the strands of blood that helped heal his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa maybe you should go see the doc-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up! That bitch cut me open and tried to tear out my heart! Hell she almost did but I woke up just as she was inserting the scalpel\u201d Alex explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Wow I\u2019d hate to wake up only to find some chick with a needle in me.\u201d Genkaku explained sounding sympathetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you really care that much then how\u2019s about you tell me where that Wretched Egg is\u201d Alex demanded reading another set of blood tentacles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo be honest, I haven\u2019t got a clue\u201d Genkaku explained scratching the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLIER\u201d Alex roared sending a second onslaught of blood tentacles at Genkaku, only for him to flash his skull necklace forward again. However this time Alex stopped his attack just mere inches from Genkaku in order to avoid the affect of his Worm Eater skull, and then bolted forward and punched Genkaku straight in the chest, sending him flying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little farther down the hall, near a vending machine Hibana Daida was in the middle of getting a snack from the vending machine when suddenly Genkaku came flying out from around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG-Genkaku?!\u201d she gasped, having never seen Genkaku injured before she was in shocked. Not so much as really caring for him, just surprised that he was injured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hey Hibana\u201d Genkaku cough, a small trace of blood coming out with each cough \u201cwhat\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho did this to you\u201d Hibana asked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it sure wasn\u2019t one of my adoring fans\u201d Genkaku laughed before another voice caused the two to stare directly down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is she? Tell me where she is Genkaku! I know you know where to find that Wretched Egg. Tell me where she is damn it\u201d the voice roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait is that the guy who fought the Wretched Egg\u201d Hibana asked a little scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, his names Alex and he thinks I know where the Wretched Egg is, whatever that is\u201d Genkaku explained as he stood up and lit a smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a Wretched Egg? Is that some sort of food\u201d Hibana asked before suddenly several thousand blood tentacles shot out from the darkness causing her to quickly withdraw her sword-whip in order to block the attack. However even though she managed to block the attack, the sheer power behind the attack was enough to make her slid back towards Genkaku (She had to move in front of him in order to block the attack).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*pant* Tell me *pant* where she *pant* is, Genkaku\u201d Alex gasped exhaustedly, having used most of his blood in that last attack, rendering him almost anemic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need to chill out man\u2026\u201d Genkaku began taking a deep breath of his cigarette \u201c\u2026how\u2019s about taken a shot to calm down?\u201d Genkaku then immediately took out his V Nirvana guitar and aimed it at Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on but seeing as how you are destroying everything\u2026\u201d Hibana began as she readied her sword \u201c\u2026it\u2019s time for your punishment!\u201d </span></div></div>",

Then I\u2019ll beat the shit out of you until you do\u201d Alex roars, pulling all of his blood tentacles back into his body. He knew that the two undertakers were equipped with Worm Eater, a device designed specifically to negate the powers of a branch of sin user like him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, I\u2019d like to show you something I recently composed; I call it Death\u2019s Blossom\u201d Genkaku explained as he quickly took out a guitar pick from his pocket and began to strum some strange melody on his guitar only for Alex to immediately be sent flying. Alex screamed in agony as he was shot thru a wall, something you\u2019d think he\u2019d have become accustom to by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheer up once your knocked out you\u2019ll feel a lot better. Though you\u2019d probably feel even better if I just killed you\u201d Genkaku explained as he and Hibana advanced closer. Alex merely groaned and stood up, his muscles and internal organs were still recovering from that Crazy Bitch\u2019s dissection and it would be quite a while before he\u2019d be at full capacity again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know Genkaku to tell you the truth\u2026\u201d Alex began standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah what\u2019s that?\u201d Genkaku asked as he and Hibana were within reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m more of a techno man; here I\u2019ll even tell you my favorite song\u2026\u201d Alex begins as he begins to hum a melody in his head. \u201cIt\u2019s called: <b>Stamp on the ground</b>! Now Jump, jump, jump\u201d Alex sung jumping up and down to the beat inside his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are-\u201cHibana was cut off as suddenly Alex\u2019s jumps began to shake the entire floor causing the two veteran undertakers to fall on their backs. \u201cWhat the\u2026? How can he be that heavy, he\u2019s not even that huge\u201d Hibana asked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStamp on the ground! Make the room go BOOM! BOOM!! BOOM!!!\u201d Alex sang/roared as the entire floor around him finally collapsed sending him as well as Hibana and Genkaku to the floor bellow. However just before they could get the chance to land Alex used his blood tentacles to destroy the floor bellow causing Genkaku and Hibana to fall even farther but Alex himself simply shot out a handful of blood tentacles and used them to stop his decent. \u201cMan this place is really gonna need a major over hall after I leave\u201d Alex laughed as he descended to the floor where Hibana and Genkaku now were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw that really hurt\u201d Hibana groans as she stands back up, she had suffered some minor injuries, a few scrapes and bruises but otherwise she was still able to fight. Genkaku faired even better and other than a small bit of pain in his legs he was fine! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh that was a nice trick you pulled there\u2026\u201d Genkaku laughed lighting another smoke, having lost the old one in the fall. \u201cNow here\u2019s one of mine, Bullet storm!\u201d Suddenly Alex was bombarded by a hail of compressed air bullets, knocking him into, but not through, a nearby wall. This caused Alex to upchuck blood unintentionally as he slid down the concrete wall until he was finally on equal ground with Gekaku and Hibana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn that hurt\u201d Alex groaned as he tried his best to stand up, to be truthful Alex didn\u2019t feel well. Perhaps it was too much use of his blood or all those hits from Genkaku\u2019s V-nirvana but he was done! If he continued to fight now\u2026no! If he even tried to do anything more than recover and regenerate then his body would fall apart!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026what\u2019s it gonna be man finally giving up? But if not then hopefully you\u2019ll last long enough for-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGenkaku\u2026\u201d Alex interrupted sounding truly exhausted and a lot more like his normal self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u201d Genkaku asked a little surprised by Alex\u2019s tone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI give up\u201d Alex explains \u201cMy body\u2019s too banged up. Hell I don\u2019t even think I can stand up anymore than this\u201d Alex explained barely managing to even lift himself off the ground. Genkaku smiled warmly as he shifted his guitar onto his back and began to walk forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt could be a trick\u201d Hibana warned the foolish Genkaku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf he was gonna kill us then we would\u2019ve already been struck by now. Besides\u2026\u201d Genkaku stopped speaking for a moment as he stopped right in front of the exhausted berserker that was Alex. Genkaku quickly picked Alex up by the shoulder and helped him walk. \u201c\u2026we undertakers have to stick together\u201d Genkaku explained not showing his face as he and Alex walked off for destinations unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later in Genkaku\u2019s room, Alex was being patched up with thanks to the help of Genkaku who seem to have lots of bandages in his room for some odd reason. Alex\u2019s entire body was wrapped in bandages now; his legs as well as his feet were wrapped in tight yet flexible bandages that allowed Alex to move free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you can take these since I\u2019m sure your usually pair of slacks were ripped to hell in that last fight\u201d Genkaku explained walking outside of his backroom with a pair of dark crimson gym slacks. Alex turned his head slightly as Genkaku walked up behind him; Genkaku had switched to his causal outfit which consists of a tank top and some slacker pants. Although Alex did take note that Genkaku had put his hair in a sort of spiky ponytail as Genkaku sat back down on the couch with him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u201d Genkaku said as he handed Alex the gym slacks before quickly turning away. Alex nodded and carefully slipped on his new pair of pants which he did admit looked good on him. Genkaku did always have good taste in clothes, even his monk outfit made Alex a bit jealous of how the cool it made the Uber-monk look. Not that he\u2019d say that aloud of course! Alex wasn\u2019t like that, not personality wise anyway, which for some reason that didn\u2019t seem to both him for the last few days which have show to be the most expressive days for the past year!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-\u2026Thanks Genkaku\u201d Alex stuttered out, he didn\u2019t often thank people and when he did it rare. Genkaku was a bit shocked at that but nodded and quickly lit a smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey it\u2019s nothing man. You were just all high off branch of sin and just went a little crazy. Heh not a problem, after all I cleansed you of all your transgressions and am going to look after you until your fully recovered\u201d Genkaku explained with his whole Uber monk speal tied in to make it authentic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Of course, after all, we may be on camera\u2019 Alex thought to himself as he looked directly 20 degrees left and about 60 degrees up, into a hidden spy camera. \u2018Hello Tamaki.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow how\u2019s about we move on for now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkip a few days?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Several days, one painful surgery, and a few guitar solos from Genkaku later, Alex was back to his usual normal average self. He had almost entirely forgotten about the Wretched Egg which came at a surprise to him as he had almost gone on another rampage the day before and again three days before that. However for some reason Alex just couldn\u2019t do it, he didn\u2019t have the energy to fight. A result of this was that he no longer could participate in Carnival Corpse which Alex didn\u2019t mind one bit! After all, not having to risk your ass every few days because of Tamki breathing down your neck was almost a god send in this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless Alex now had lots of free time at his disposal but he honestly didn\u2019t know what to do. He sometimes went to Mitch\u2019s bar but often found he wasn\u2019t in the mood to get smashed, though to be truthful he never really drank just to get drunk, never really that kind of guy, whatever that was? Mitch did however make Alex feel welcome and in exchange for a bit of info like Alex\u2019s favorite color, red, and what hand Alex was, right, Mitch created something special from that secret mini-fridge he hides where no one can find it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther times Alex tried to hang out with Genkaku, and often ended up discussing things. Why the sky was blue, why they thought they would talk about why the sky was blue, along with other stuff. Some of it was just stupid stuff like the ladder and sometimes it was kind of deep. Like for example just yesterday they had an actual decent discussion about just why they were imprisoned. Kind of made the two closer in a way, perhaps a bond was forming between the two, a brotherhood, maybe? Nah! There was no way Alex would call Genkaku his younger brother, actually Genkaku was older then Alex as it turned out. How Alex learned of this was because it was one of the things the two talked about on one of their discussions days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few times Alex talked with Hibana\u2026Alex didn\u2019t want to talk to here again! She was too\u2026polite, at least to sickeningly polite. Aparantly her mother did some really fucked up teaching while raising her ergo why she\u2019s here. Regardless Alex did manage to find one thing in common with Hibana, their care for their weapons. Hibana used her tool to punish those she fought and Alex just used his to punish well\u2026 whoever deserved it. I guess that was another thing in they hand common, punishing the wrong, though Hibana\u2019s sense of punishment, again, was far more twisted than Alex\u2019s. Regardless Alex soon found himself visited by Hibana in order to repair her weapon or because as she put it \u201cThought he needed company.\u201d Maybe she really was a sweat girl, or not? Alex sure wasn\u2019t about to bother see which. He just enjoyed the company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife seemed rather normal, well as normal as an undertaker stuck in death row surrounded by other crazy murderous people can get. Anyway today was another new day, Alex had spent a majority of the night fixing Hibana\u2019s sword-whip, he had managed to fix the blade so that it could once again separate and reconnect again. The reason he had to fix it was because Hibana had broken it accidently while carrying it around a few days again. Thinking that she would get scold if she showed anyone, and at a surprise to Alex, Hibana brought him her blade and asked him to fix it for her. Alex was surprised at first but the look in Hibana\u2019s eyes just was too much and Alex promised that he\u2019d fix it within a few days! Alex swore he never had seen Hibana smile before and it made him feel kind of glad that he accepted her cry for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless Alex was just now waking up, Hibana\u2019s weapon at his side, a fully opened tool set and scattered tools on the other. Alex stood up with a yawn and scratched his robe-covered side as he moved to the kitchen. After a quick mug of coffee, a nicely glazed doughnut, and a few whacks to the frontal lob Alex was officially awake! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh didn\u2019t think you\u2019d ever wake up,\u201d laughed a cynical yet cheerful voice. Alex almost dropped his coffee but the sheer look of shock on his face was enough to prove he was scared. Alex slowly took a breath and sat his coffee down before then turning to face none other than Wretched \u2018Murder Incarnate\u2019 Egg! Wretched Egg was missing her armor this time around and was only garbed in a white body suit of some sort. However Alex knew it was the same Wretched Egg as the one he had fought before all due to that demented devil smile on the albino skinned girl\u2019s face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026\u201d she began before suddenly grabbing Alex by the face and smashing him into only cupboard that wasn\u2019t on the ground \u201c\u2026you miss me?\u201d Almost immediately cereal began to fall to the floor along with various other sweets that Alex had stashed here. Some of the cereal fell on the Wretched Egg but she either didn\u2019t notice it or was too interested in Alex to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Lucky me\u2019 Alex thought before looking back at the Wretched Egg who was nice enough to remove her hand from his face long enough for him to speak. \u201cSo what brings you to my room\u201d Alex asked casually eyeing his surrounding as the Wretched Egg smiled wickedly and blinked her oddly beautiful blood red eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I was just walking by and thought I\u2019d stop in to see my favorite punching bag!\u201d the Wretched Egg explained with a casual shrug. Alex quickly darted his eyes left as the Wretched Egg closed her eyes for a moment and spotted that of his coffee, still smoking hot and freshly brewed. In a sudden and almost spontaneous bit of movement Alex grabbed the glass mug of coffee before immediately splashing it in the Wretched Egg\u2019s face just as she was reopening her eyes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAGH\u201d She screamed before Alex slammed and smacked the Wretched Egg across the head with the glass mug! The Wretched Egg couldn\u2019t react fast enough as Alex thru off his robe and combat wrapped the Wretched Egg in it before then picking her up and smashing the Wretched Egg head first into the counter, smashing it to pieces!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately Alex ran to grab his chainsaw but a bloody and badly pierced hand grabbed him by his ankle causing him to trip and fall to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d the Wretched Egg asked as she tried to rip off the robe with her other hand which was far more busted up, hell the hand was nothing more moving pincushion! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFUCK YOU\u201d Alex screamed as he kicked the bitch er Wretched Egg in the face to almost no effect as the Wretched Egg merely smiled and continued to try to take the robe off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotcha\u201d the Wretched Egg cheered as she finally managed to grab a part of the robe and quickly ripped it off but at the same time she accidently let go of Alex. She quickly looked up only for the full barrel of a revolver to be pressed against her for head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBang\u201d was all that was spoken and the Wretched Egg was shot through the head point blank, splattering what little gray matter she had left on the walls of the kitchen. Alex stood there, holding the still smoking gun, as he walked a little bit closer. \u201cFive bullets left, good for five more deaths. Guess I\u2019ll make some more coffee\u201d he said to himself as he walked over to the still working coffee machine and got him another cup of coffee, even using the same mug as the one he had used to brutally beat the Wretched Egg with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short bit of time later the Wretched Egg was beginning to reawaken only to hear a sudden clanging, like that of glass against glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning\u201d rung a familiar voice. The Wretched Egg quickly looked up only to stare down the barrel of a loaded revolver. The Wretched Egg gripped her fist, her body having fully regenerated while she was unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long have I been out\u201d she asked sounding a bit defeated?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh about fifty minutes\u201d Alex replies as he sips some more coffee from his mug while still aiming a very loaded and very deadly revolver at the Wretch Egg\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t take advantage of the situation\u201d the Wretched Egg asked sounding a bit perverted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I mean why try. You were a corpse and I\u2019m just not into that. Hey I may be insane but even I have standers\u201d Alex explained \u201cWhich reminds me\u2026\u201d Alex then immediately pressed the gun fully against the Wretched Egg\u2019s brow and then spoke \u201c\u2026I think theres something you want to ask me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wretched Egg smiled her usually devil like smile and spoke \u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d she asked with a sinister tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please I\u2019m insane not stupid. You broke into here, and wanted to fight. But the hands on the other foot now so\u2026\u201d Alex explained and the Wretched Egg continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019m going to make you an offer.\u201d The Wretched Egg explained smiling even wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m listening\u2026\u201d </span></div></div>",

Instead she was wrapped in a crimson red silk blanket with a somewhat bloody pillow where her head originally was. She quickly threw the blanket off and got up only to find a plate of food waiting for her, two eyes with a piece of bacon, all in the shape of a smile face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow-\u201chowever before the Wretched Egg could finish her thought her stomach growled. She had died twice now and her stomach was empty due to her body require a vast amount of energy to bring her back. The Wretched Egg quickly looked left and right, making sure no one was around and then devoured the bacon and eggs like a hungry alligator! *Burp*The Wretched Egg exclaimed before then proceeding to place the plate in the sink. \u201cHmm\u2026still hungry\u201d she groaned rubbing her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s good, cause I just swung by the vending machine\u201d Alex explained startling the Wretched Egg by his sudden appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrr\u201d she growled before he quickly pulled out his gun and put it to her forehead all in the span of a second!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThree bullets left till I have to reload. One if you fight back. Zero if you manage to kill me\u201d Alex explains. The Wretched Egg smiles and Alex smiles as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRussian roulette?\u201d asks The Wretched Egg?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u201d Alex exclaims immediately slamming the gun on the table and accidently setting off a round that shoots him in the gut. \u201cOw\u2026\u201d Alex groans before sitting down at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou going to be okay\u201d The Wretched Egg mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up and die\u201d Alex spat back as his body began to regenerate. Soon Alex\u2019s wound was healed and the bullet that originally was in his lower intestine now was on the table, oddly enough it was still intact. Just one more bullet in the chamber the two thought as Alex loaded it into the gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay what do we shoot for\u201d Alex asked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy else? But for the thrill.\u201d The Wretched Egg replied with a devious shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s about lose dies and winner\u2026\u201d Alex looks around his room and spies his horrible yet comfortable excuse for a bed. \u201cWinner gets a FUTON!\u201d Alex exclaimed with extra exclamation marks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!-before receiving a sudden punch to the face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway you go first\u2026\u201d the Wretched Egg begins, sliding the gun towards Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you scared\u201d Alex taunted?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way!\u201d The Wretched Egg exclaimed immediately snatching the gun from Alex\u2019s hand and pulling the trigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half hour later the Wretched Egg returned to the land of the somewhat living only to find the gun gone and Alex\u2026five feet away with a bag of Cheetos in hand with some other prisoners standing by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee told you guys, half hour on the spot\u201d Alex explained to the other prisoners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa cool\u201d exclaimed one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCreepy if you ask me\u201d explained another before both were impaled through the skull with a blood tentacle from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that I don\u2019t love mindless violence but why did you kill those two\u201d The Wretched Egg asked standing up from the table?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThought you might be hungry, besides one of them is from Louisiana\u201d Alex explained bring the corpses closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEw no!\u201d The Wretched Egg exclaimed in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, thought you would. Oh well. Shit I owe some guy five bucks\u201d Alex explains causally as he tosses the two dead guys into the hall with his blood tentacles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re gross you know that\u201d the Wretched Egg explained shoving a finger into Alex\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBitch you\u2019re calling me gross? Dude you can survive being torn to pieces, having every bone broken, and have your head. Your head mind you. CUT! OFF! AND STILL! SURVIVE!\u201d Alex exclaimed with extra emphasis seeing as how HE was the one to cut the Wretched Egg\u2019s head off!  However a quick foot to the face sent Alex flying before being followed up by several bone shattering gut bunches. Alex retaliated with a kick of his own, well a knee but still, as he kneed Wretched Egg in the gut before then over head smashing her with his fists but before he could get one last move in the Wretched Egg quickly sprung up and gave a horribly painful elbow jab to one of Alex\u2019s kidney\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was for calling me a bitch!\u201d The Wretched Egg growled \u201cNow where\u2019s the bed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex feeling numb and yet still so very much in pain, pointed to the futon and the Wretched Egg gladly walked over and took what was rightfully hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I won\u201d Alex coughed through bits og pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPecking order\u201d the Wretched Egg laughed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFUCK YOU!\u201d Alex screamed before passing out due to pain.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout nine hours later Wretched Egg awoke once more, this time she was awoke by a faint scream. She looked around and saw no one other than a still out cold Alex who seemed to have peacefully fallen asleep after so many hours of painful slumber. The Wretched Egg walked up to the sleeping dog that was Alex, yes, a dog for her to play with until it died! She smiled wickedly as she gave the \u2018dog\u2019 a sharp kick only for the \u2018dog\u2019 to bite back! In actuality Alex who, after being suddenly awoken along with being kicked in the ribs, was a little more than furious with his new \u2018roommate\u2019 and shot her twice. They were in none lethal areas mind you but the shots were enough to cause the Wretched Egg to grasp at her knees as she came crashing down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet sleeping dogs lie\u201d Alex explained grimly as he pointed his gun at the downed Wretched Egg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-Damn you\u201d the Wretched Egg cursed as Alex walked towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLater, I gotta go find out what\u2019s making all that noise\u201d Alex explains as he grabbed his stuff along with Hibana\u2019s sword-whip, before  then walking off making sure to shut the light off before leaving the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown bellow in a secret room that was long abandoned by the more secretive members of Deadman Wonderland, a being was screaming. The being was that of a man, his skin sliced and drenched in blood. He screamed out in pain as the agony of his flesh pierced his mind. And so he screamed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere Alex continued on his search for the source of the screams when he suddenly came across a random ventilation shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Well time to do my best impression of a necromorph\u2019 Alex began before taking in a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\u201d Alex screamed before ripping off the vent and diving in head first! For a solid ten feet Alex just dropped, for another eleven he crashed and tumbled through the vent, and for another two feet Alex groaned his way to another ventilation shaft. With a solid kick Alex was freed from his confinement and now was in a room of absolute darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH\u201d screamed a voice that seemed like it came from every direction at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh a screaming contest, eh? Well then\u2026\u201d Alex took in a deep breath. \u201cAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u201d the voice was silent, it seemed like Alex had impressed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have a loud mouth\u201d groaned a somewhat familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the light flashed on and the gruesome carnage that was formally hidden by the darkness was revealed. The walls were painted with splashes of blood; dead bodies lined the battle field and oddly enough some of them even looked fresh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow now Mr. Reaper I don\u2019t believe you are supposed to be down here\u201d explained a voice causing Alex to look at the center of the battlefield. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTamaki? What are you doing here\u201d Alex asked a bit shocked to see the freaky bastard?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? Well I heard someone set off the silent alarm and just always wanted to check this room out. Anyway Mr. Reaper I think I\u2019ve had enough of your inability to listen\u201d Tamaki explained in his usual venom tainted way of speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah well I\u2019m sick and tired of you always being creepy.\u201d Alex reaches for his chainsaws but pulls out Hibana\u2019s sword by mistake along with one of his chainsaws. \u2018Must\u2019ve grabbed the damn thing by mistake, oh well\u2019 Alex shrugged before charging forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, that won\u2019t do at all, oh boys\u201d Tamaki called before suddenly several armed Undertaker grunts appeared from the shadows and opened fire on Alex causing him to defend himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it\u201d Alex gasped before as he shielded himself with Hibana\u2019s blade. \u2018Sorry Hibana it looks like I\u2019m going to have to return your blade a little bit dirty!\u2019 Alex thought to himself before he dropped his chainsaw and grabbed Hibana\u2019s sword with his two hands. With a mighty swing Alex shot out the sword, engaging its whip function and slicing threw two of the undertaker grunts like a hot knife thru butter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave you men to kill him, have fun Mr. Reaper. Our contract is expired\u201d Tamaki warned before walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExpired eh? Well than guess I can finally kill you. Oh well I found a better boss! Her name\u2019s the Wretched Egg!\u201d Alex shouted only to say a moment later \u201cWhy the hell did I say that?\u201d and face palm himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah and you\u2019re doing a horrible job\u201d called a voice from the shadows. Alex quickly turned only for a sudden blast to force him into the air. Out from the shadows walked that of the Wretched Egg in all her brutal glory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah well\u2026\u201d Alex tried to think up something but suddenly collided with a large slate of solid black iron. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFree me\u2026 \u201d whimpered a voice from inside the solid metal. Alex quickly grabbed onto the roof of the iron box and looked around before spying that of a tiny opening, just small enough for air to get in. \u201cFree me I shall kill everything in your path\u2026\u201d the voice whispered once again. Alex nodded before he then quickly scaled the iron box and began revving his chainsaw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYo Wretched Egg better stand clear\u201d Alex shouted down bellow, unaware if she had heard him or not, as he began to chainsaw through the solid metal, which on normal circumstances this wouldn\u2019t work but this iron cage was very rust and Alex\u2019s chainsaw\u2019s chain was made out of titanium! Do the math or don\u2019t it\u2019s about to get bloody all up in here! In a matter of seconds the rusty iron door came off and the door fell down to the floor bellow, crushing one undertaker grunt who was standing too close to the drop zone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re free\u201d Alex shouted gleefully before suddenly a river of blood erupted from the iron box. There was so much blood pouring out of the iron cage that no normal human should be alive after apparently losing all their blood. Yet a blood drenched hand reached out from the iron box before then another and soon a badly bandaged head erupted from the shadows of the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\u201d the being screamed as blood fell from the cage like a waterfall both staining and drowning the battle field bellow. In a matter of seconds the being leapt from the iron box only to crash land right smack dab in the middle of the battle field which, coincidently, was right at the bottom of the waterfall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlood\u2026I want blood\u2026\u201d the being moaned like a demon. \u201cI WANT ALL YOUR BLOOOOOD!\u201d Suddenly a huge pillar made up of tiny threads of blood shot up from besides the being as he waved his hand. Several undertaker grunts, who were unlucky enough to be in the being\u2019s direct line of sight, suddenly were sucked from where they were standing and pulled right towards the being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlood! Blood! Fresh blood! After all these years! Give me your blood\u201d the being panted excitedly before he flexed his fingers and suddenly the armor of the three soldiers was ripped clean off, revealing the helpless soon to be pale colored skin underneath. The being flexed his fingers in a somewhat taunting manner before suddenly two of the three guards were pulled forward, right into the being\u2019s hands! \u201cNow feed!\u201d Alex being said grimly as he gripped his two, soon to be, victim\u2019s faces and squeezed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud pop was heard as the being crushed the two guard\u2019s heads, with a gentle release the bodies fell into the pool of blood and were immediately drained of any and all bodily fluids leaving nothing but two bloody skeletal forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTasty, but still thirsty\u201d the being muttered to himself as he looked at the third guard, the guard was scrawny and didn\u2019t have much muscle. The being sighed and tossed the guard aside, sending him clear from the pool of blood that seemed to follow the being wherever he went. The being flexed his fingers as he continued to look around when he suddenly spied the Wretched Egg who was on the very edge of his blood pool. \u201cOh you look absolutely perfect\u2026\u201d the being muttered to himself as he suddenly submerged inside the pool of blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Wait where is he going\u2026\u2019 Alex asked himself as he swung far atop the battlefield. It took a moment of looked for Alex to realize where the being was headed. \u2018...he\u2019s headed for Wretched Egg!\u2019 Alex quickly leapt from the iron cage and with a loud splash signally that he was now back on the ground. After a tiny bit of recovery time Alex bolted forward just as the being was surfacing.</span></div></div>",

Two of them had guns; the others had Worm Eater knives. She wasn\u2019t really worried; Worm Eater didn\u2019t work on her like it did other deadmen. Her attacks came much too fast and far powerful to be blocked by such a trivial thing. But why she was in danger of being killed when she could have easily killed these fools? Simple, she was having fun with them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on is that all you\u2019ve got?\u201d the Wretched Egg taunted only enraging the soldiers even more as the two with guns soon opened fire! In a flash of motion the Wretched Egg was forced back, unintentionally touching the pool of blood that had formed mere minutes ago, and simultaneously grabbed from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot you\u2026\u201d a voice whispered into the Wretched Egg\u2019s ear when suddenly several mysterious objects were stabbed into the Wretched Egg at various points in her body. One noticeably painful one was her spine which was soon followed by a large spike like object to the back of her head. The Wretched Egg let out visible tears as whatever impaled her now began to fondle her breasts. \u201c\u2026you certainly will do nicely. Nice body, strong muscle tone, short but slim figure. Yes and nice breasts to go along with that.\u201d The voice mocked as he began to move his fingers dangerously close to the Wretch Egg\u2019s nipples when suddenly a loud bone chilling revving pierced the Wretched Egg\u2019s ears.  The Wretched Egg tried to move but found her body locked and unresponsive to her commands. With a mighty slash the Wretched Egg was free and quickly jumped out of the pool of blood!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*pant* Bastard *pant pant* what took you so long\u201d the Wretched Egg gasped as if all her strength had been drained out of her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo be frank, SHUT THE HELL UP!\u201d Alex yelled back and quickly delivered a bone shattering kick to the Wretched Egg\u2019s chest, sending her crashing into the wall. The Wretched Egg tried to stand but her legs quickly gave out. \u201cYou just stay there and try not to die!\u201d Alex explained as he turned back to face the demon before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo tasty but also such a puppet. Now you on the other hand\u2026\u201d the demon began bearing it\u2019s unholy yellow teeth. \u201c\u2026will you be my puppet or my prey?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s about this buddy\u201d Alex began, revving his chainsaw again for extra emphasis \u201cyou bow before me! Become my demon and we can go fuck the world together! How\u2019s that sound?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDestroy the world? Heh well that sounds lovely but first how\u2019s about you become my puppet\u201d the being roared as he dropped into the pool of blood once more. In a sudden jolt of motion a billion tiny red colored threads erupted from the ground and quickly wrapped around Alex. In an attempt to get free Alex used his chainsaw to cut the thread only to find that his chainsaw now with a life of it\u2019s own as it quickly came back and dug into his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH\u201d Alex screamed as the chainsaw dug into his shoulderblade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahahahaha pathetic hope you enjoy being slice to pieces\u201d laughed the demon from what seemed like far away! Suddenly the threads around Alex grew even tighter and soon begna to cut into Alex\u2019s skin, much to his growing agony!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGAH! Get the fuck this shit off me\u201d Alex screamed growing more and more enraged as his own blood began to seep out of his many new wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Hmm? What\u2019s this?\u2019 the demon wondered as Alex\u2019s blood began to move and combine together to from what one could only describe as combat tentacles. \u201cNo! A human with the ability of a demon! Impossible!\u201d the demon roared as the grip of the thread around Alex grew even tighter only for Alex\u2019s own blood to react in response forming more and more blood tentacles!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlood Tentacle: Bloody Mary!\u201d Alex screamed as his blood tentacles suddenly wrapped around the thread. In a flash of motion Alex was freed, covered in his own blood, but freed as his arms and legs continued to bleed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t *pant* underestimate *pant* the power of a Deadman! Especially not one with the power of an Undertaker\u201d Alex gasped as he fell to one knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow interesting\u2026\u201d the demon began as it resurfaced. \u201c\u2026such a power and yet you didn\u2019t have to make a pact with a devil?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell *pant* actually I did make a pact with a devil but that was long after I had these powers. And that devil *pant* is mine to kill! Got that? MINE\u201d Alex roared as he picked up his chainsaw even though it was completely covered in blood and rush forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa\u2026\u201d the demon laughed as Alex tried to slash him with the chainsaw only for him to dodge by submerging in the pool of blood and reappearing behind Alex. \u201c\u2026hahaha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop laughing at me\u201d Alex screamed as he tried desperately to hit his mark only to somehow miss a second later! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou cannot hit what you cannot comprehend\u2026\u201d the demon laughed as it flexed its bandaged fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shit!\u201d Alex gasped just in time for his chainsaw to come to life and try to kill him! Luckily Alex was able to grab the blade before it could be driven into his body that is\u2026 at the cost of his fingers! \u201cAGH!\u201d Alex screamed as the bloody chainsaw suddenly slipped from his grasp and nailed him right in the chest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStraight for the heart\u2026\u201d the demon whispered into Alex\u2019s ear just before the chainsaw cut into Alex\u2019s ribcage, spattering his blood and part of his lung all across the nearby battlefield. \u201c\u2026soon, yes soon you\u2019ll become my next puppet. Shame you\u2019ll have to lose your heart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh fuck no\u201d Alex screamed as he tried to grab the chainsaw once more with his semi-regenerated hands only for the chainsaw to dig even deeper causing a crippling pain to rocket through his entire body. Alex gasped, desperate for air, as his other lung was beginning to fail. \u201cDamn it! I\u2019m not supposed to die yet! Damn it!\u201d Alex gasped as his last lung finally failed just as the chainsaw pierced his heart!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh now you\u2019re my puppet\u2026\u201d the demon laughed as he began to insert what appeared to be a large spike into Alex\u2019s head when suddenly\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBACK OFF! He\u2019s mine\u201d roared the Wretched Egg as she suddenly came crashing down onto the demon, Hibana\u2019s sword-whip in hand, as a severed arm with matching shoulder falls to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\u201d the demon screams as the pool of blood underneath the trio begins to recede and the demon falls to his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNobody kills the bastard except me! Got it bandage boy\u201d the Wretched Egg warned as she wrapped the blade around the being in an attempt to bind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u201d Alex didn\u2019t have the energy to speak as his body began to regenerate. The Wretched Egg walked over to Alex and gave him a wicked smile as she brutally ripped the chainsaw from Alex\u2019s body, causing an unbearable amount of pain for the regenerating undertaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops did that hurt\u201d the Wretched Egg asked in a sarcastic fashion before laughing a devious chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBitch!\u201d Alex screamed/gasped as his lungs fully regenerated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry what did you say\u201d the Wretched Egg asked recalling the whole bitch fiasco from earlier today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said\u2026\u201d Alex began taking in as deep a breath as he could manage \u201c\u2026YOU\u2019RE!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As usual for my day I awoke from my cell still feeling the pain from my broken arm. \"gotta get Genkaku to relax with his guitar.\" getting dressed I looked around my cell being a undertaker for so long gave me a great many perks I mean hell I got a HDtv ps3 and a bunch of other tech sadly the job I got is so boring Rinichir\u014d doesn't do much besides sit in his room and talk to the twins and shiro. Sigh anyway I grab icorus and walk out of my room only to see the twin walking down the hall with Tamaki. \"So shamus how is the old fart.\" tamaki asked with his usual creepy smile I just keep a straight face and answer. \"he's okay Rinichir\u014d dosn't seem to have any problems. Why You planning something?\" he only laugh before walking away I frown and look at the twin. \"how the hell can you protect that idiot.\" I asked them and the shrugged and said. \"we usually just follow his orders nothing else.\" and followed tamaki sighing again I walked off to check in with the other undertakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFew minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had come to the door to the undertaker hide out I alway's thought it should be more hidden but honestly it's not my call. walking in I hear the usual sounds of my higher up boss Genkaku also known as uber monk he could be a normal guy if his perseption on death was so odd but I'm the guy who thinks that burn someone alive is a good way to waist time. Anyway back on topic Genkaku was sitting on his 'throne' playing his bass guitar his usual off hour outfit on I didn't really care though I sat down on the couch as he played waiting for him to take notice of me but he was lost in his own little world I wondered if I should announce my self but he finally stoped. \"hey shay howed you like the song?\" he asked in his usual fashion I prepared for my usual answer. \"it sound like a better version of a mad man life work.\" he snickered before getting up. \"you up for doing your job or the damage I did going to stop ya.\" \"ha like a simple broken arms going to stop me.\" well this is usually how our quick talks go since nearly every training match we do usually ends with one of us bandaged ever since we both came here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlash back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started a few years ago I was sentence for trying to find truth behind the great quake but the rebuilding of the cities got in my way so I just burnt them down one at a time saddly I got caught after my 18 building two hundred people burned to death at a party dedicated to the reconstruction of some building. Anyway I had met Genkaku not to long after he was still the leader of the undertakers after getting into a few fights they sent him after me and as they say we really hit it off he hired me as an undertaker tamaki was angry that he wasn't informed but he sucked it up and then I learned a few of the secrets of DMWL like the deadmen, the branches of sin, and other things but as I said I don't care though I built icorus I seem to be the only undertaker who refuses to put a worm eater into my weapon I just don't really trust the inventor but ehh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd of flash back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of talking of random shit I got up to leave for my 'job' but Genkaku stopped me. \"dude I got a bit of a different job for ya.\" at that moment a little girl walked in I was a little weirded out that a child had gotten this low in wonderland did she get lost? She walked up and bowed. \"hello sir I'm Hibana Daida I will be working with you.\" at that point my eye grew a child a fucking child I don't work with fucking kids no nater what I was about to flip shit at Genkaku for this when he informed me about her. \"she was arrested murdering her kindergarten class 3 years ago the medical teams and research group have altered her she not normal to say the least.\" great more fucking mass produced monsters how the hell could this go wrong ugh. \"so what do you want me to do with her.\" I asked annoyed Genkaku smiled before telling me I was to show her around atleast I could get something to do besides sit with so old bag of bone we left and I showed her the none restricted areas (or more truthfully the one that normal prisoner are alowed to see.) and then we head to the restricted G-block was boring as ever I don't really mess with these branch of sin freaks except for owl but I only talk to him when need then we ran into the one basterd I hate more then tamaki it was \"Rukuro Bund\u014d what's a low life like you want?\" he ignored me and looked at the girl. \"Hibana you have to come with me for your 'weapon'.\" (forgot to mention where out of G-block so other deadman don't hear.) the Hibana left and I head twords my other job when I reached Richir\u014d's room he was talking to shiro again who just smiled and waved I did the same and sat down trying to hold off the urge to sleep sadly it won I awoke to...</span></div></div>",

I thought to my self I don't often get the chance to roast people I opened the door to the fight to see by surprise mocking bird and some kid as soon as I arrive mockingbird ran away while the kid stood to fight. \"sigh kid I'll give you one chance get on the ground or I'll make you.\" he only smiled and charged at me his blood into a set of claws around his hand I swing icorus while ducking under his attack actually cutting off his legs he fell to the ground screaming. \"I warned you don't worry I'll stop the bleeding.\" I said with a wicked smile I the detached the blade of icorus and activated the flame thrower heating the blade till it actually looked red then I pressed it against the injury he screamed louder than before I did the same to both legs he passed out from the pain I only smiled and hauled his body to the medics office only to bump into Rei Takashima who looked like she won the lottery I left before she could start talking to me I never really liked her but crazy bitches need to keep their distance but you can't avoid everything I was about to pick something for lunch when makina and her assistant Kasuga Ky\u014dko she looked at makina looked pissed while Kasuga was nervous as ever I just tryed to ignore them and go on with my lunch break it was a quick moment but we've had our problems since I came here mostly being blamed for a few fires here and there I prefer bodies not objects anyway I headed to the mitch's bar and yet again ran into a familiar face mockingbird. \"you mind telling me about earlier?\" he only smiled and ate when I was going to ask again he ran I would have chased but I didn't care I ate and the rest of the day was boring I did run into Daida again but only for a second I head to my cell only to find a notice to be in a fight in carnival corpse I didn't care since well i didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomorrow.</span></div></div>",

Do you understand?\" shamus said only to get Daida to raise her hand again. \"but if his job is still leader how are you the leader also how aren't any of the other undertaker not on the leader board?\" she asked shamus chuckled. \"that's easy if you notice me, you, Genkaku, and Mr broken joystick are different we don't wear the undertaker armor and we have our own weapon rather then rifles and knives we are special ether by our crimes or personallities while. Now the leader board thing is if Genkaku acts like a figurehead basicly just accepting orders or telling me the jobs while I dish them out to different undertakers so if that's everything let's begin.\" shamus says warming up icorus's flame Daida drops her dog backpack pulling out her giant whip blade and the two swing taking and blocking each others attacks saddly shamus is doing more blocking then attacking that is until Diada's sword crashes into the tank on icorus causing a explosion in gulfing shamus in flames Daida smiles thinking she's won until laughter could be heard. \"he he he ha ha ha HA HA HA HAHAHAHAHA!!!\" in the flames stands shamus his right arm completely on fire and icorus's blade wedged into his sholder. \"Oh god I've forgotten how good the smell of burnt flesh is the escence of the hair, bone, and flesh melting into a slury of greatness.\" with that he grabed what remained of icorus's out of his arm and held it to his arm making sure the flame caught the blade and charged at Diada a smile painted on his face as he slashed at her hand make sure to slice fast enough to cut deep she was forced to drop he sword he then grabbed her and held her to the ground lifting it up to end her when a memory flashed before his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----flash back-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was his home his wife was sitting next to some one he could not tell who but then it happen the great quake that had destroyed japan he found him self under a pile of ruble but escaped to see his house on fire and his wife pinned down under burning beams and the guest standing above her head his wife screamed for help only to be shot with a revolver round to the for head the guest turned and left him only with a smile he cryed over his wife corpse only to leave and start his search for the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----reality sort of.----- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA punch from Genkaku stamped him out of what he was doing he was about to kill Daida even though it was against the rules to do so he also felt the pain of the burns he blacked out. </span></div></div>",
