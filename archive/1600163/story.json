Drago, furious at his previous defeat, decides to take out the Chans with an all out assault. First, however, both groups are drawn to an artifacts collection in Canada that contains a pair of chopsticks that were made from the Immortal drumsticks, used to banish the Mountain Demon. When Uncle and Jackie arrive home, they fall asleep searching for the right chopsticks amid a large pile they had to take. Tohru takes the chopsticks for his midnight snack, and becomes infused with the Chi. He then starts eating everything, including uncle's 'No junk! Priceless antique!!!......', and takes on the appearance of Po Kong. Drago arrives and manages to steal the Mountain Demon Chi, but Uncle then uses an improved Chi-O-Matic to steal both Po Kong's Chi and Drago's, leaving him powerless. After Drago flees, Jade prepares Tohru to restart his diet.</span></div></div>",

Jade brings her friend Jimmy, a timid boy who is always picked on, to Uncle's shop where he sees the Arcanum. Later, a mysterious Chi wizard steals the Arcanum from Section 13 and escapes into a time portal, followed by Jade. She finds herself in the future, and bumps into her future self from J2, who reveals the name of the wizard: Iso. Jade then encounters future versions of Jackie, Uncle, Tohru, Captain Black, and Jimmy. Tohru is now a full Chi wizard, and Jimmy is his apprentice. The Jades go out on the town, and discover Iso's lair, recovering the Arcanum half he stole from the present. Future Jade, already in trouble with Captain Black, gets fired. Jimmy then tells present Jade the location of the other Arcanum half, and both Jades recover it. However, Jimmy puts the halves together and reveals himself to be Iso, and uses the Arcanum to create an army of minions. Jade goes to the past to bring Jimmy to the future, where he helps them defeat his future self. Jade and Jimmy then take the Arcanum back to the present to be destroyed, where Jackie asks Jade to explain.</span></div></div>",

While Tohru takes Jade to Section 13 to keep her safe, Uncle also goes. He heads to the vault where Shendu is and Shendu offers his help to which Uncle says no. Uncle heads back to his shop to find a way of stopping Drago and some unexpected visitors arrive: Finn, Chow, Ratso, and Hak Foo, because they also don't want to see the world destroyed as well. Meanwhile Jackie and Captain Black head out with Section 13 agents to stop Drago but the Ice Gang stop their attack in an attempt to regain favor with Drago. Drago infuses each of them individually with traces of the Wind, Thunder, and Earth Demon Chi's and orders them to destroy Section 13. While searching for Drago by helicopter Jackie and Captain Black notice a bus that is about to fall off a bridge and try to pull it out of danger and succeed when El Toro, Paco, and Viper show up to help, allowing the passengers (Which includes Valmont) to escape. The Ice Gang attack Section 13, Jade decides to use the Talismans to fight back, but it is too late, Section 13 is crumbling to the ground, so at Tohru's insistence Jade uses the Rabbit Talisman to escape alone. The rest of the J Team arrive at the baseball stadium where Drago is and try to fight off the Ice Gang but are losing badly. Meanwhile Uncle and the Enforcers arrive at the ruined Section 13 looking for something and find Torhu in the rubble. Jade arrives with her T-Troop to assist the J-Team and gives the Rabbit, Ox, Snake, and Dragon Talismans individually to Jackie, El Toro, Viper, and Captain Black and they fight off the Ice Gang. She also gives Paco the Sheep Talisman in order to prevent him from interfering. Uncle then arrives and reveals that he has restored Shendu to his humanoid form knowing that \"Demon must fight Demon\" and Shendu fights off Drago. Jade realizes that Shendu needs all his powers so she orders everyone to toss their Talismans at Shendu. Following on Tohru's idea, both he and Uncle cast a Chi Spell that opens a gateway to the Demon Netherworld. In the end, Drago and Shendu are sucked into it as Ice and his men are restored to their human forms and try to escape only to be cut off by El Toro and Paco. Uncle decides that Tohru is now a Chi Master and no longer needs any training, Captain Black offers Jade a job at Section 13, which Jackie says he will think about it and everyone laughs when Jade says that that means \"no\". In the Demon Netherworld, Shendu and Drago float around, arguing. Now that Shendu is complete and trapped in the Demon Netherworld along with Drago there are no more talismans or demon chi. </span></div></div>",
