You exit the bathroom and head back to your comfy pile of hay. The wooden planks of the shack appear to have been replaced with a rain-proof canvas, sprawled across the entirety of the room. You blink, writing it off as a simple case of misunderstanding in your drowsy state. You turn your head to a small pile of equipment in the corner, consisting mostly of leather armor and a long hunting rifle. Briefly reacquainting yourself with the rifle, you equip your armor and take hold of your weapon, slinging it around your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Upon exiting the tent, the bright sunshine casts itself down into your retinas, momentarily blinding you. As your eyes adjust, you quietly look around and gaze upon your surroundings. The landscape before you is littered with Alliance tents, with basic soldiers wandering about the base without even noticing you exit your tent. Looking down at your armor, you see a loosely hanging medal, beside it a small symbol for \u2018Lieutenant\u2019. \u201cAwarded for leading an engagement with a small tribe of Gnolls, resulting in extreme success, without a single casualty present.\u201d Your field marshal said, as you reminisce the moment from just a week ago. A promotion came with the medal, bringing you into this lovely position. You shake your head for a moment, realizing your need to meet up with your squad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You shuffle your way over to a couple of tents, as your squad calmly awaits your arrival. \u201cTook you long enough, sir.\u201d one of the foot soldiers say, as his attitude immediately gives away his Marine background. The rest of the squad simply salutes for a moment before turning your attention to you. You recognize the Marine as the squad\u2019s second-in-command, \u201cSorry, boys. I had one hell of a night.\u201d You say truthfully, your eyes drifting away from the soldiers standing before you as you remember the dream you had before waking up. \u201cSir?\u201d one of the foot soldiers ask, noticing your despair. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Lieutenant\u2026?\u201d you ask, turning to the experienced second-in-command.  \u201cLieutenant Davis Crita, sir. How you still can\u2019t remember my name is beyond me.\u201d The Lieutenant says, his words ringing true in your mind. Never had you imagined yourself in this position. That medal was deserving of someone else capable of truly leading a group of men into battle, you thought. Quickly shaking the negativity off, you turn to Lieutenant Crita. \u201cCrita, we\u2019re going to the training grounds tonight, and we\u2019re not leaving until each and every one of you can prove to me you\u2019re worthy of being in this squad. Is that understood?!\u201d you shout, as each of the foot soldiers under your command acknowledge your orders with a synchronous \u2018Yes, sir!\u2019, all the while Lieutenant Crita aggressively rounds them up and leads them off to the training grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As you watch your squad head off to the training grounds, you hear a ruckus behind you. You look behind you inquisitively, noticing a small group of high elven archers enter the camp grounds. \u201cAll female, by the looks of it.\u201d You say, quickly interested in the new events. As they get closer, you notice the formation the elves take is that of bodyguards. You step forward to get a closer look. Just as you thought, one elf resides in the middle of the pack, clearly being protected by the degenerate Alliance soldiers staring in awe. You inch yourself back, staring at the beautiful elf in the center. With flowing golden hair and bright green eyes, you understand why such a ruckus was caused among the soldiers. As the group passes, you continue to stare in awe of the stunning elf before you, increasingly curious as to who she is, and why she\u2019s come to visit this frontline Alliance camp. After hearing the soft giggling of one of the bodyguards, you regain your senses and notice the protected elf giving you a fleeting glance, however short. As the elf refocuses herself back to the path, you could tell from her eyes that she was entertained with your casual, flustered gaze. As they continue further into the camp, you rub your eyes for a moment. \u201cWho the hell was that?\u201d you ask yourself, lazily taking a different route down to the training grounds.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The arrival of the elves only serves to extend this feeling of uneasiness as you return to your usual duties. While you continue to ponder on this thought, you enter the training ground, essentially a farm modified to basic fitness and combat practice needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You look upon your squad as they idle around in front of the fitness track, for some reason incapable of starting it themselves. \u201cWhat the hell is the hold-up?\u201d you ask them, stopping right before Lieutenant Crita approaches you, pulling you off to the side, away from your squad mates. \u201cA few soldiers were overheard saying something about a party of female elves wandering through the camp a second ago. Is it true?\u201d Crita queries, his personality relaxing itself away from the prying eyes of your squad. \u201cYes.. five of them. Four escorts, all protecting an elf in the middle. Looked like rangers.\u201d You reply, still trying to figure out why the elves had come here in the first place. \u201cShe must\u2019ve been a VIP. Were they-\u201d Crita prods further, to which you push him out of the conversation. \u201cThat\u2019s enough, Lieutenant. We\u2019ll let the Field Marshal handle whatever those elves were sent here to do.\u201d You state, as Crita sighs disappointedly. \u201cLet\u2019s just get to work, shall we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Just as you\u2019re about to begin the training session, a messenger from your Field Marshal flags you down. You glance over to him, casually waving your squad off to begin. The messenger rushes over to you, breathing heavily. \u201cCaptain, Field Marshal Grim has sent word of our new assignments.\u201d The messenger says, bluntly handing you a letter. \u201cRight.. off with you, then.\u201d You say, shooing the messenger back to the Field Marshal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the letter and begin reading it\u2019s contents:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>\u201cForeign Headquarters<br>\r\nDepartment of the Army<br>\r\n21st Armored Corps<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEffective immediately, active personnel in the 21st Armored Corps will assemble and prepare for battle. All combat group leaders are now required to report to Field Marshal Loren Grim for orders regarding near future combat deployment. The next officer\u2019s meeting will adjourn at 18:00 hours to assign designated combat roles.\u201d</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You manage to let off a sigh before instinctively reaching for something in your pocket. You pause, quickly withdrawing your hand from the pocket. \u201cNo\u2026 I\u2019m done with that.\u201d You say, quickly gathering your squad and relaying the news. As you imagine, the squad grows restless under the thought that they\u2019ll be under your command. Lieutenant Crita steps out and calms the squad down, giving you a short nod afterward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a short respite from the training, you dismiss the squad and have them return to their tents to prepare, while you and Lieutenant Crita trot along to the war chamber, otherwise known as a larger tent. As you enter the tent, Crita close behind you, you\u2019re immediately greeted by the sight of dozens of young officers in the war chamber, all of whom gather and stand around a large, round strategic table in the center of the tent. Among the gathered officers, are the armed high elf escorts you had seen earlier in the day, taking up positions at the entrances and exits of the room, simply acting as if they were but guards now. You follow suit and take a place standing at the table. Field Marshal Grim finally shows himself, with that same mysterious elf from earlier in the day. \u201cHello, officers. I\u2019ll make this quick, because we\u2019ll be departing first thing in the morning.\u201d the Field Marshal says, picking up a small series of papers from the planning table. \u201cIt has come to our attention that a large Orcish war party has infiltrated southern Quel\u2019Thalas. The high elves have seen fit to request our assistance in dealing with these orcs, and assistance they shall receive.\u201d Grim states, beginning to diagnose the plan of attack and immediate strategy of intercepting the orcs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your vision eventually fades from the actual battle plans, realizing everything would fall into place when we were close to the interception point. Instead, your eyes veer up to the beautiful cloaked elf standing behind Field Marshal Grim, carefully watching the battle map as the Field Marshal goes over every slightest bit of detail regarding the lead-up to the large battle expected to take place. You can\u2019t help but watch the elf\u2019s eyes dimly glow, as she memorizes every step of the plan. The cloak she wore concealed her shimmering blonde hair, adding that strange layer of mystery to the woman. Field Marshal Grim soon begins pointing at various officers, all the while you continue to watch the elf, somehow captivated by her beauty. \u201cWho in the world is she?\u201d you ask yourself. Just then she looks up at you, her dimly lit eyes looking straight at you. You blink, and immediately realize Field Marshal Grim is now pointing at you. \u201cCrap..\u201d you think, as several of the nearby officers glare at you angrily. \u201cCaptain, you\u2019ll be the third battle group accompanying the Ranger-General.\u201d Grim says, his words ringing out in your head. \u201cThat\u2019s all, officers. Take your squads and prepare for the march. We leave at 06:00.\u201d The Field Marshal states, his authority ringing true as he exits the tent, followed by most of the officers. You turn to Lieutenant Crita, who appears rather pleased with the orders, and then back to this supposed Ranger-General. Getting mobbed by several of the bolder officers, she merely hangs around and speaks with the first two of her vanguard battle groups. As you leave the tent, dragging your Lieutenant with you, the elf looks past the group and watches you leave before being distracted by the other officers pushing to speak with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat luck. We get to hang around the women? I don\u2019t see how this could get any better.\u201d Lieutenant Crita says, blissfully unaware of the dangers. \u201cThis is certainly a morale boost. Should I inform the squad, sir?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s time for sleep, Lieutenant. We\u2019ll tell them in the morning.\u201d You say, clearly unexcited. As the Lieutenant splits off into his tent, you head into yours and crash down onto the pile of hay you call a bed. Not even bothering to remove your work attire, you close your eyes and continue to question whether or not you\u2019re fit to lead these good men, your squad, to their deaths. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, now you\u2019ve been tasked with safeguarding the Ranger-General. Unable to imagine the harsh responsibility forced upon yourself, you reach down into your pocket and take out a small bag of pills. Staring at it for a second, you toss the bag aside and hit the canvas. \u201cWhat the hell am I doing here..\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was an exciting night, to say the least, and you were tasked with leading your squad to victory, on top of protecting a fragile elf in combat against the orcs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You turn to your side, balling your hand up into a fist and grinding it against the flat pile of hay you sleep on. It was frustrating and nerve-wrecking, knowing you aren\u2019t fit for a job such as this. Being recently promoted to Captain, you don\u2019t even understand why you were put in this important position in the first place. You wonder, perhaps the Field Marshal judged me by what he heard of back during that skirmish weeks ago, that he took that one story and turned it into his next elite officer. It was tough to stomach, however truthful it may have been, but you didn\u2019t know the reasoning behind this choice or its implications. Without a second thought, you stand up and reach over to the small bag of pills you pulled out a few hours ago. You had always suffered from bouts of insomnia like tonight, but you couldn\u2019t pull yourself back into that downward spiral you had so narrowly escaped before your famed skirmish. The pills worked. They worked very well, but they were also addicting. It was a tough choice, but you opened up the pouch and withdrew a small blue pill the size of a pea and cradled it in your hand for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Just as you were about to take the pill, you\u2019re suddenly met with a soft tapping against the dirt in front of your tent. You toss the pill back into the pouch, tossing the pouch back into your pile of hay as you approach the door flap. Taking a quick peek outside of your tent, you see the very same beautiful elf that you had been tasked to guard earlier in the day. You exit your tent and approach the elf in a moment of professional concern. \u201cHey, you\u2019re not supposed to be out here, Miss..\u201d you state, immediately catching yourself not knowing her name. The woman looks over to you, her eerily glowing eyes brightened by the darkness of the camp. \u201cYou\u2019re the Captain assigned to my vanguard, is that correct?\u201d she asks, her voice relaying with a hint of exhaustion, likely from earlier in the night. You were taken aback by her sense of professionalism, until it finally dawns on you. \u201cYes, Ma\u2019am.\u201d you immediately state, shifting to stand at attention. The female elf looks at you, her face shifting with interest. \u201cAt ease, my friend. My name is Sylvanas Windrunner, current Ranger-General of Silvermoon. I sure hope you know how much those orcs would love to get me out of the way.\u201d she says teasingly. You gulp, resuming your lax posture. You had assumed she was of higher military status, but not quite that far up the hierarchy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You knew this job just got even more complicated, especially knowing that Ranger-General was the highest rank any elf could hold in the High Elven military. \u201cErm.. very well. We\u2019ll be working together pretty closely for the next few days, so I hope you don\u2019t mind humans that much.\u201d you say, carefully picking words to not offend the Ranger-General. She looks up at you, her head tilting to the side. \u201cYou\u2019re a different kind of officer, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Sylvanas asks, her posture relaxing during the conversation. Inching back towards the meaning of your comment, Sylvanas takes a step toward you, leaning her torso forward slightly.\u201cWith so many personal guards, I won\u2019t have any trouble finding someone to \u2018assist\u2019 me with the torment of long-distance travel. You understand, don\u2019t you?\u201d Sylvanas asks, casting a subtle hint towards you. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you have any females in your squad?\u201d she queries, her eyes lighting up a bit. You shake your head, as Sylvanas\u2019 glimmer of hope immediately fades away. \u201cI guess you\u2019ll just have to do, then. I hope you don\u2019t mind elves!\u201d Sylvanas says jokingly, beginning her calm walk to her heavily guarded tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You blink, watching her as she walks off. The conversation you had were her seemed strangely relaxed, despite what sort of woman you expected her to be. Barely half-conscious, you honestly didn\u2019t know how to take her jokes, nor did you completely catch on to what she was hinting at. Still, you knew the end result of this conversation only solidified the importance of your role in protecting her. However strange odd the conversation went, you stumble back into your tent and plop onto your pile of hay, feeling the effects of your insomnia fading away. You fall asleep quickly, hoping to get enough rest in time for the officer\u2019s assembly in the morning to review formations and battle tactics.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Feeling surprisingly groggy, you stood up and brush the stray pieces of hay off your clothes. You could already tell this was going to be an exhausting day. You exit your tent, equipped with your officer\u2019s garb, only to be blinded by the bright sun. \u201cLieutenant?\u201d You muttered, looking around for a brief moment. \u201cLieutenant Crita?\u201d Your calls fall on deaf ears, as you realizes your lieutenant has gone ahead of you to the Officer\u2019s Meeting. Just as you are about to be on your way, you notice a hooded female elven escort standing guard in front of your tent. Walking up to the elf, you noticing her exhausted stature, the poor girl barely paying attention to anything outside of keeping herself standing. You sneak up to the guard and pulled the hood down, revealing a rather beautiful female ranger. The morning sun highlights her naturally pale complexion and golden blonde hair, practically drawn back into a ponytail. The ranger looks at you, her dull, expressionless eyes brightening up as she is drawn back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCan I.. help you?\u201d She queries, as a touch of exhaustion breaks through her speech. \u201cWho are you?\u201c Your mind wanders as you ask this elf's name, far more curious as to why she is guarding your tent. \u201cI\u2019m Dryse Winterfall, one of Lady Sylvanas\u2019 personal guards. She tasked me with guarding your tent and escorting you to the Officer\u2019s Meeting. I hope you don\u2019t mind, but I sent your Lieutenant on his way. He was.. shifty.\u201d She states, lazily pulling through her tiredness and looking up at you. Truly a name of elven origin, you think to yourself. \"I wouldn't put it past him, but I can see what you're getting at.\u201d You respond, fully aware of your ill-mannered Lieutenant and his aggressive behavior. Preparing to begin her escort job, Dryse takes her first step and immediately regrets it. A look of distress comes across her face, as Dryse lets out a cute squeak of pain. You blink, looking at her reaction. \u201cErr..? Are you.. alright?\u201d As you took a short moment to gather your thoughts, it finally dawns on you. \u201cI stood on guard throughout the night, directly after Lady Sylvanas left your tent. I-It\u2019s particularly hard on the feet. Don\u2019t mind me, sir.\u201d Dryse nervously exclaims, her figure slumping over in what appears to be an instinctive reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You wonder just what Sylvanas would think of you, neglecting the one and only guard she lent to you. The thought then dawns on you: if you can't take care of one guard, how would you ever hope to protect the soldiers under your command and the beautiful Sylvanas? You felt as if this situation went beyond your allegiance to the Alliance, but just as a personal duty. As a knight of the Alliance, there was no way you would let this poor woman suffer under your command. Just as well, dragging an injured female elf to the Officer's Meeting would be a difficult situation to explain, so you muster up your courage and present Dryse with a compromise.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Let me tend to your feet.\u201d Shocked at your statement, Dryse mutters a sketchy, incoherent reply. \u201cN-N-No, it\u2019s fine! R-Rangers undergo matters far greater than this!

Besides, I have my Lieutenant there in my place. I don\u2019t have an excuse, however, to avoid helping this injured little kitten.\u201d You joke, revealing a warm smile to the resistant elf. You had a one-up against this woman, having slept through the night and woken up with a clear mind, while Dryse had stayed up all night to guard your tent. If there was a way to avoid your assistance, Dryse has clearly not found it yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a brief pause, Dryse nodded. \u201cF-Fine.\u201d She finally speaks, apprehensive to lower herself towards an Alliance officer. Following you back into your tent, she takes a seat on a wooden stool you pull up for her. \u201cMy mother always taught me to spoil women, although I doubt she had an elf in mind.\u201d You tease Dryse before rummaging underneath your bed of hay. Pulling out your personal first-aid kit, you return to Dryse. You gawk for a moment as the hilarity of the situation hits you. Seeing a grown woman, this female escort, anxiously sitting on the stool with her hands nervously tucked in-between her legs was a cute sight. Emitting a brief chuckle, Dryse looks up at you with an unsure glint in her eyes. \u201cSorry, the way you\u2019re acting is pretty cute.\u201d You state, kneeling down before Dryse. As you prepare some of the basic items to heal her feet, you continue foolishly reinforcing this woman\u2019s nervous behavior. \u201cIf it helps, you can even consider this a personal favor for offering me your exceptional escort abilities.\u201d It appeared as though Dryse understood your attempts to console her, as she pulls her legs out from underneath the stool and places her boots in front of you. With a nice, slow motion, you reach for Dryse\u2019s boots. Although concerned, Dryse merely goes along with your actions. You slide both of the tight, leather boots off her body, allowing the cold Lordaeron air to envelop her overworked feet. Dryse releases a loud sigh, her feet having finally been granted a reprieve from the night\u2019s torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Although happy to be of assistance, you noticed this woman was lacking socks. This was an odd surprise, but there was a slightly more intrusive matter at hand. Your gaze was locked onto this ranger\u2019s beautiful feet, the pounding within your chest quickening at the sight of Dryse\u2019s fair skin. While worn from constant abuse, her feet still maintained their persuasive, feminine charm. Being this affected by a woman\u2019s feet was something you hadn\u2019t encountered before, even as the prevailing scent reached your nose. You couldn\u2019t help yourself from gliding your fingers across these sore feet, her sweaty soles gladly accepting your prying fingers. You pressed both of your thumbs into her upper sole, reaching into the moist flesh of her right foot, happily replacing Dryse\u2019s pain with relief. During these actions, you felt as if there was something missing from this situation. Though a fleeting thought, you finally realize that neither of Dryse\u2019s feet are as grievously wounded as she made you think. You amuse the thought, wondering whether or not she goaded you into this situation, before being quickly awakened by Dryse\u2019s voice. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? This feels really.. good.\u201d Sliding your thumbs down to her arch, you carefully flex the sore muscles underneath her moist, sweaty skin. Dryse lets out a soft whimper of pleasure as the tension within her feet withers away at your touch. \u201cSorry, I was distracted for a moment.\u201d Despite saying this, a strange sensation still ran through your body, almost as if your subconscious mind was pushing you further into the depths of your growing lust. Before this thought lingered, Dryse brought you back to reality. Looking down at you, she gave a lighthearted smirk, wordlessly telling you to continue. There was something strange about the way Dryse had so easily adapted to this situation, but you weren\u2019t in a position to complain. Even though this situation is worsening, you are happy to oblige Dryse this rare luxury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While dipping your thumbs further into her sole, calmly agitating the sore muscles within, Dryse speaks, her idle conversation holding part of your attention. \u201cYou know, Captain, we have a name for people like you at home. Most of them are shunned from society as soon as their \u2018interests\u2019 become known.\u201d Dryse flexes her feet forward, allowing you easy access to the sweaty underside of her feet. You cradle her foot at the heel, using your thumbs to pierce through her moist, calloused skin to target the aching muscles within. \u201cSome leave the city, while the rest become outcasts in the military. Elven society is a strange thing. Perhaps this is why Lady Sylvanas has taken an interest in you.\u201d Dryse ponders, playfully wiggling her toes in your grasp. As you continue to gaze down at her feet, you realize your affection for Dryse\u2019s feet is growing at a substantial rate. With every movement of her toes, you feel your body swell with warmth, the powerful urges deep inside of you growing more by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then, out of nowhere, Dryse strikes you with a bombshell. \u201cYou like my feet, Captain.\u201d This sent a brief shock up through your body. As you look up to question her words, your eyes are greeted with Dryse\u2019s left foot, vividly wiggling her toes in your face. Her foot hovering close, you have difficulty breaking your gaze from her agile toes as she continues. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to respond. After all, the answer is very clear.\u201d It is unfortunate, but there is no hiding this infatuation from Dryse, you confirm, the intoxicating aroma of her foot finally reaching your nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shaking your head, you pull away from Dryse\u2019s feet. The allure of Dryse\u2019s feet was a bit too much for you to handle first thing in the morning, and so, you set her boots on the floor besides the stool she sat upon. \u201cYour boots.\u201d Standing up to draw your tent's door flap aside, you wordlessly escaped the situation with this cute escort. It was about time for this elf to stop meddling, you decided. Dryse smirks at you, the shyness you had observed earlier having disappeared. \u201cOf course, Captain. I know when I\u2019m no longer welcome, but Lady Sylvanas will want to meet you before you enter formation with your men.\u201d Dryse states, slipping her bare feet back into the confines of her leather boots. \u201cI trust you won\u2019t make her wait.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Dryse exits the tent, each strut of hers oozing with pride, you take a couple deep breaths to figure out your next plan of action. You think that, even though Dryse suggested it, visiting Sylvanas so close to your departure was a bad idea. But at the same time, you find yourself curious as to what Dryse mentioned earlier. After all, why would the Ranger-General of Silvermoon be so interested in a human? None of this made sense to you, but even so, you make your preparations and choose your next objective.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Casually remembering the previous night, you recall spending the last few days out in a friend\u2019s wilderness camp in the region of Quel\u2019Thalas, just on the outskirts of the high elf capital city, Silvermoon. Coming from a region south of this land, you knew little about the surrounding region of Quel\u2019Thalas, other than it was home to the vast majority of the High Elven race. You calmly shake your head, attempting to remove the fragile memories from your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Turning around to exit the bathroom, you\u2019re immediately greeted by a large bear-like creature staring at you through the doorway. \u201cAdjusting, friend?\u201d the creature asks, his comforting, deep voice resonating within the cabin. He was a furbolg, an entity of the wilderness, and a friend of yours from years back when you met each other in this very wilderness. \u201cAh.. Lorg. Yes, my friend, I\u2019m adjusting to this life.\u201d You ask, walking past Lorg. \u201cDid I wake you?\u201d you ask, approaching your light metal armor and long sword in the corner of the room. \u201cNo\u2026\u201d Lorg states, trotting over to exit of the cabin, his words clearly lacking definition. \u201cWe hunt tonight. Prepare.\u201d He says, exiting the cabin. As Lorg opens the cabin door, the bright morning sunshine infiltrates the dark cabin, shining onto your fully equipped armor. You pick up your long sword and follow Lorg outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the cumbersome beast waddles his way forward, you can\u2019t help but wonder why this day feels strange. You turn to Lorg, who appears to be cleaning his paws off in a small trough of dirty water. \u201cDid anything happen last night?\u201d you query, sliding your long sword into it\u2019s sheathe. Upon finishing cleaning his paws, Lorg softly rotates his head towards you. \u201cMore elves in forest. Had two enter camp looking for something.. what, not sure.\u201d He states, a bit of concern in his low, growling voice. Grasping his words, you wonder whether or not you would run across someone you knew, or more importantly, someone you really didn\u2019t want to meet with again. Shaking the thought off, you return to Lorg\u2019s side, following his relaxed figure further into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a short walk with Lorg to his favorite watering hole, an uncorrupted pond, you decide to question Lorg further about the elves he had seen. As you both approach the edge of the pond, Lorg suddenly stops, halting your progress as you bump into the back end of his warm, furry hide. As you peer past him, you see two cloaked figures armed with bows already at the pond. One appears to be filling their canteens, as the other plays sentry and watches your fuzzy friend intently. \u201cWho are you?!\u201d Lorg shouts, his powerful growl startling the figure gathering water, as the sentry raises it\u2019s bow towards Lorg. You withdraw your long sword from its sheathe and hold it in front of you defensively, keeping the blunt side of the sword in front of you and the cloaked figures. As you step out from behind Lorg, preparing yourself for combat, you analyze the cloaked figures quickly. You notice the fair-skinned limbs on both the sentry and the one previously gathering water, who now shambles for a second bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBy orders of the Windrunner clan, stay back, creature! If you wish to talk, send your companion!\u201d the feminine sounding voice demands, removing her hood to reveal the blindingly beautiful female elf underneath. Defined blue eyes, blonde hair, and the instantly distinguishable sense of authority. They were high elves, without a doubt. You immediately lower your sword and turn to Lorg. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, friend. These are protectors of the woods here. Rangers, to be precise.\u201d You say, sheathing your sword in hopes of correcting this misunderstanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The rangers turn to each other, muttering quietly among themselves. You stare at the rangers, raising an eyebrow at their mysterious conversation, while Lorg understandably shifts around impatiently. Finally reaching their consensus, the rangers motion for you to come closer. You nod and begin walking forward. As you close in on the rangers, an ominous feeling enters your gut. Unsure of the situation, you stop in front of the rangers and ruffle your hair. \u201cWhat seems to be the prob-\u201c you ask, immediately cut off by a sudden burning in your back. Your vision fades as you hear Lorg growl with absolute rage, while the rangers in front of you hastily scramble into the woods ahead of you. Attempting to diagnose yourself vain, you collapse to the grass in front of you. The clattering of metal weapons is heard briefly before you fade into unconsciousness.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Upon your awakening, an ominous darkness was the only thing you could see. You were lying flat against the ground, your wrists bound behind your back. In a similar vein, you realized a blindfold was placed across your eyes. This was the reason for your nullified vision. Although you had a vague idea of the situation, you began to diagnose your predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You ran your hands over the material binding your wrists. It was rough leather, a common find within the wilderness. This was especially true for the various ranger bands that operated within the forests of Quel\u2019Thalas. They wouldn\u2019t have the luxury to return home to get supplies; everything had to be done during their missions. Following this, you ran your cheek against the ground beneath you. There was a familiar mixture of damp earth. It was clear that during the time of your incapacitation, you hadn\u2019t left your recent domain \u2013 the forests. This came as a relief to you. If your captors had thought you to be a deserter, you would have been transported back to the capital city, Silvermoon. While there was a silent urge to go home, you couldn\u2019t find the willpower to make that choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In what was nothing but an expected event, you were lifted up by your arms and dragged to an unknown location. As soon as the movement stopped, you were forced onto your knees. It was then that the blindfold came off. Your eyes adjusted to the interior of a large, dark red tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWere you the one who attacked my rangers amidst their duties?\u201d A stern-looking, female commander sat in a luxurious chair before you. While you noted her presence with a brief thought, your gaze shifted around the room to the many female rangers surrounding you. Each one wore heavy cloaks imbued with a royal crest. These were elites from Silvermoon \u2013 loyal soldiers under the authority of the ruling family. It was odd to see such them so far away from their capital. Your odds of surviving this encounter lessened with every possibility you explored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The commander spoke up again, her voice prying your concentration apart. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting anyone to send a druid against us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0To such a ridiculous accusation, there was only one way you could respond. \u201cI\u2019m not a druid.\u201d You surmised that this was based off your furbolg companion, Lorg. Drawing your eyes away from the commander once again, you wondered whether or not Lorg escaped the wrath of these rangers. Examining the cloaked women around you, they seemed to be lacking the necessary manpower to subdue such a powerful beast. Although it was a stretch, it was safe to assume your friend had escaped harm. You had larger problems to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The commander crossed her legs, leaning back into her chair. \u201cYou\u2019re a brave one. Even in this situation, your little eyes dart around to gather as much information as possible for your masters. What makes you think we\u2019ll let a spy leave this camp alive?\u201d She was growing irritable, but you had larger concerns. If you failed to dispel her accusations, you were going to die to this simple misunderstanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou seem to be confusing me for your enemy. I\u2019m from Silvermoon, the very same as you.\u201d It was a daunting task to convince these elite rangers that you weren\u2019t out to kill them, but you had to make an effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The commander blinked, her suspicions revived. \u201cAnd what is a civilian doing so far out in the wilderness, with a companion capable of decimating a company of Alliance soldiers?\u201d There was a certain amusement you felt as she kept leading the conversation back to your companion. She wasn\u2019t going to let this go without an answer, so you decided to come clean. The problem now though, was how much information you had to reveal to clear their suspicions. You thought to start at the basics, and then work your way up from there. \u201cMa\u2019am, I\u2019m here living in exile from the capital. I\u2019m an outcast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The rangers around you began to whisper amongst themselves, as if this announcement of yours was causing some kind of dissent. You couldn\u2019t help but ponder upon the worst-case scenario. The reason you had left home was based on a promise to contain the truth behind your exile. Your friends and family were spared the embarrassment of knowing your mistakes, and your reputation stayed intact. At least, that\u2019s how it should have been. You were curious how much these rangers knew about your situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The commander brought silence to the room with a sharp glare at her subordinates. It felt as if she was on to something in her interrogation, so she prodded your statement. \u201cJust who are you?\u201d As she asked this, every eye in the room was drawn to you. It was unnerving, but you responded with calmness that catches the commander by surprise. \u201cI was the personal servant to the Queen of the High Elves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIf you once held that position, then you should be able to prove such a claim.\u201d The commander was doubtful, but you weren\u2019t surprised. This entire conversation played out how you thought it would, despite these elves knowing some knowledge of your exile. It wouldn\u2019t be strange for them to hear passing rumors of a dismissed royal servant; after all, you were an important part of the Queen\u2019s life. Such a person doesn\u2019t disappear without a trace. The Queen must have done something to draw suspicion away from you shortly after you left the capital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Still, you had to prove the truth behind your claims. Lies weren\u2019t going to work, and your attempts to persuade are guaranteed to be useless. This was something you didn\u2019t want to reveal, but had no choice. \u201cAnd you shall have your proof\u2026 but I cannot do it alone.\u201d You lowered your gaze to the commander\u2019s boots, staying silent in your motives until the commander shifts her gaze downward in a similar fashion. She began to clue herself in on the meaning behind your stare, while the rest of the rangers continued to piece it together. A bit of nervous shifting in her chair confirmed your assumption. She knew something about you, but that only played to your success at the moment. \u201cPlease, remove your boots.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The tent erupted with chatter as the commander obliged, taking her dirty boots off and setting them beside her chair. It looked as if a few of the younger rangers wanted to persuade their leader to ignore your suggestion, but she was responsible for your interrogation; there was no stopping here. Woolen stockings were all that remained on her feet, as the commander put her feet in front of you. The stockings encasing her feet were damp with sweat, a fact made clear to you when the subtle aroma entered your senses. Your eyes locked onto her stockings for a moment, waiting for something to trigger. Nothing happened. This wasn\u2019t enough to prove your innocence. Now it was your turn to feel nervous.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was filled with embarrassment upon hearing this. Her duties as a ranger never put her in a position like this, where she had to reveal her skin to an outsider. You knew the psychological impact of this request. The commander never put emphasis on her gender, and all of a sudden she was being asked to show her bare legs in front of you. The possibility of her killing you in a fit of rage increased substantially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The commander caught herself channeling a series of powerful emotions, calming down and accepting your final request. She stood up in front of you, wordlessly removing her leather pants. You had never been so surprised in your entire life. Upon being removed, the commander returned to her seat and her body to the side. Before you could stop to wonder why, the commander slipped her finger underneath the hem of her woolen legwear, guiding the material down from her thighs. Despite your professional motives, the eroticism of the moment was not lost on you. This was a beautiful woman, masquerading as an elite ranger of Silvermoon. Behind the exterior of this overworked, royal zealot was a much more precious identity \u2013 an identity you wanted to know more about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her shimmering, blue eyes wavered as she peeled the stockings down her legs and slipped them off her feet. The skin of her freshly revealed feet glistened with a sweaty moistness, while several soft imprints were pressed into the top of her feet by her constricting legwear. The sight was phenomenal. As you took a deep breath to recount your plan, your tongue began to tingle ominously. The feeling of arcane magic flowed throughout your mouth, alerting you to the moment you were waiting for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As resurgence of intimacy entered your system as the commander crossed her legs, letting her right foot dangle in front of your face. A lust-born confidence bloomed inside of you. You couldn\u2019t tell where it came from, or just how much it affected you, but the result was clear. You were prepared to enact the rest of your plan. The commander had no idea what you were going to do, but still managed to hide behind a fa\u00e7ade of composure. In this respect, she was cute. The only problem now was the fact that your hands were still tied behind your back. In the back of your mind, you knew it wasn\u2019t a real problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Left without the use of your hands, you nuzzled the commander\u2019s foot with your cheek. This affection felt so natural to you, despite her reluctance to cooperate. Everyone in the tent fell silent as you cracked your mouth open, extending your tongue to meet with the heel of the commander\u2019s sole. Upon making contact with her foot, a brightly glowing crest appeared on the flesh of your tongue. You were too immersed in the moment to care, dragging your tongue across the length of her sole in one, passionate motion. The luster of the crest grew with every second pressed against the foot of this elvish woman. As your tongue disconnected from the commander\u2019s foot just before reaching her toes, the vibrant glow produced by the crest waned. It remained with a dull glow, occasionally pulsing with the flow of magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Even if she had an idea of what was coming beforehand, this was the best way of proving your connection to the royal family. You held your tongue out for her to inspect. The rune laden in your tongue was of royal origin, much like the emblem sewn onto the ranger\u2019s cloaks. The commander was shocked by this discovery. It was forbidden among the arcane arts to imbue a person with magic like this. For this reason, you understood her feelings. The expression she wore told you that she wanted to ask about this, but there wouldn\u2019t be any answers for you to give. You withdrew your tongue back into your mouth. \u201cIs that enough, Ma\u2019am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Silence. There was no response to your question, as every eye in the room was once again turned on you. The atmosphere was heavy, as if you had just done something totally unthinkable. This reaction felt too strong for simply licking the commander\u2019s foot. It was unexpected. You looked up at the commander, only now noticing the ardent look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A female voice rings out from beside the commander. \u201cSo you\u2019re the foot elf? How pitiable.\u201d These words were exclaimed by a ranger who you assume to be the second-in-command. She opted to keep the hood of her cloak down, masking all of her facial features, save for a pair of faintly glowing blue eyes. \u201cDo you not understand all of the trouble you\u2019ve caused because of your actions? If what the Queen said is true, we might as well execute you right now.\u201d A familiar silence follows her words, as you recount your thoughts. There was nothing you missed, no mistake amidst your explanation of your connection to the royal family. As far as you could remember, all of yours matters linked to the capital city were settled. So, what the hell were these royal elite talking about? Something must have happened after your departure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your train of thought was interrupted by the commander. \u201cCalm down, Amaurea. He obviously doesn\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d The senior ranger backed down almost instantly as she heard her named called. She shot a couple of glares at you before falling back beside the commander. It seemed like the interrogation was over. The commander took it upon herself to explain the situation. \u201cThe Queen marked you as a deserter and traitor to your country.\u201d This revelation hit you hard. You weren\u2019t a traitor. Your loyalty to the royal family was still strong, even while away in exile. To even be considered as such was a joke. The commander continued, imitating the Queen\u2019s dialect as best as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cLast night, my personal servant took advantage of me while I was sleeping.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your relationship with the Queen was more akin to a toy than anything else. She would often tease you about relieving her sexual urges. It was always subtle until one day she discovered your foot fetish. From there on, the Queen refused to let you go about your servant duties until you played along with her. Washing her feet while she was bathing, giving her foot massages after a day of work, kissing her feet as a greeting every morning; everything revolved around keeping you leashed to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe entered my room of his own charge\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While it was all lighthearted teasing for the first couple of years, the problems arose when she first asked for you to deliver \u2018a glass of warm milk\u2019 to her room late at night. Upon arriving with the milk, you were shocked to find the Queen sitting on her bed naked. She beckoned you closer with one hand, concealing her breasts with the other. Her seductive glare conveyed her desires. No more teasing, she wanted relief. That was the first time you were ever ordered to please the Queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c\u2026and without warning, he tied me up and sexually abused my feet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That wasn\u2019t how it went. That night, the Queen requested for \u2018a glass of warm milk\u2019 once again. You knew the truth behind this request at this point, so you didn\u2019t bother to warm the milk in the first place. As predicted, you found the Queen naked and waiting for you. However, tonight she ordered you to tie her up and play with her, just as she had played with you. There was no choice in the matter, so you agreed and did what she wanted. With free reign to play with the woman who had been playing with you all this time, you chose to prolong her satisfaction by focusing on her feet. For what seemed like hours, you worshipped the Queen\u2019s feet. It was sweet revenge, and it was ruined in a fraction of a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThankfully, one of the other servants noticed this act and called the guards.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A female servant who often cleaned the corridors of the castle heard the Queen\u2019s frustrated cries of pleasure. The moment you heard the door open, you knew the fun had come to an end. While the servant expectedly closed the door and ran away, the Queen pressed her feet against you in a wordless plea for you to finish what you started. And so you did. This marked the first and last time you were ever able to worship the Queen\u2019s feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The commander continued to recite exactly what she heard during the Queen\u2019s speech, even as a younger ranger walked up behind you to release your binds. The red marks left on your wrists didn't hurt as much as the blatant lies the Queen told to save herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cFor this reason, I would like to reward this servant with a medal in appreciation of what you\u2019ve done to save the Queen of this nation. You will also find yourself promoted to fill the gap left by the traitorous foot elf. Congratulations, and I hope-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were thankful to the commander for relaying this so accurately, but raised a finger to her lips to cut off the rest of her speech. \u201cThat\u2019s all I needed to hear.\u201d The commander\u2019s eyes widened, a bit embarrassed to be being caught rambling. While in the back of your mind you wondered if that servant girl was going to be alright, there were more pressing matters to worry about. The rangers still surrounded you, and the commander still wanted answers. Everyone already knew the situation, so why continue pressing for the truth? It was curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you can enlighten us about this situation, can you?\u201d The commander asked, her eyes pleading for answers.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Stretching your arms for a moment, your attention returned to the commander. She was asking a rather important question \u2013 one that held little importance to you now. Regardless, you declined her request for details. \u201cThere is nothing for me to say, Ma\u2019am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The commander was disappointed, and you understood the reasons for this. However, there was no reason for you to reveal anything about yourself and the Queen. Any further dialogue on the subject would be considered tasteless, given your new traitorous status. Degrading yourself wasn\u2019t high on the list of things you wanted to do in front of these elves. Before you could apologize to the commander for your refusal, she mysteriously perked up. It would seem she found a way to coax the truth out of you, and was in no rush to conceal this fact. You decided to play along for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou may leave, then.\u201d The commander quipped, the enthusiasm she bore a moment ago having vanished. You blinked in confusion. You knew that you weren\u2019t wrong in your discovery. She must have been planning something, but you chose to take your leave. Upon exiting the tent, you discovered a slight problem. A thick darkness surrounded the camp, rendering any visibility into the forests impossible. The ranger\u2019s tents were set up in a circular pattern to ward off the night, almost as a barrier to protect the largest tent you had just walked out from. Each of these canvas tents were equipped with a series of torches to assist in warding off the darkness. It didn\u2019t take long to figure out that it was night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So this was what the commander was betting on. \u201cMay I trust you\u2019re not stupid enough to go searching for your beastly companion in the dead of night?\u201d She asked, flowing out of the tent to stand beside you. As you took notice of her arrival, you noticed her gentle, blue eyes gazing upon you. Growing nervous of her soft gaze, you found an exceptional quantity of grass to stare at just beside the entrance to the tent. \u201cDuring your time here, the sun has gone down. It would be best if you stayed in the camp for tonight.\u201d The commander wasn\u2019t pushing this on you like her requests from before. Rather, it seemed like she was inviting you personally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShall we?\u201d With a brief pat on your shoulder, the commander began walking to her tent. You eventually followed. There was no idea to know what she was planning, but it would be discourteous of you to refuse such an offer. As you passed one of the nameless tents, a torch illuminated the commander\u2019s bare legs while she walked. You were barely stowed your surprise, noticing the healthy, orange glow that now emanated from her legs. While the sight was dazzling, you were curious to ask why she declined to put her legwear back on. Trudging through the mud and clusters of damp grass barefoot, you figured she was planning something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It felt like the right time to inquire these intentions. \u201cYou\u2019ll go barefoot, Ma\u2019am?\u201d A knowing smirk appeared on the commander\u2019s face as she turned to face you, as if your question was expected. She merely shrugged and went back on her way, dragging you on a lengthy journey around the camp. Her lack of cooperation was no surprise, but you couldn\u2019t help but wonder what she would gain from doing this. You wanted to know about the commander \u2013 about the woman behind her rank. \u201cMay I at least know your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The commander stopped in her tracks, tilting her head to the side in thought. A few moments of hesitation prepared you to receive a disappointing answer. \u201cMy name is Sylvanas, and I\u2019m the next heir to the Windrunner Clan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ah\u2026 \u2018Sylvanas\u2019, then? It was a beautiful name. It fit her forward-thinking personality, and even more so added to the reasons you wanted to know more about her. Still, her willingness to indulge you was more than a surprise. While this could mean any number of things, ranging from her trust in you to a slightly more disparaging outcome, she didn\u2019t seem to have any hostile intent. Besides, her last name was a little more thought-provoking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Windrunner Clan was renowned for their service to the royal family, and even more for their triumphs on the battlefield. In specific, heroes of the Windrunner Clan were often coined as being \u2018the fleet of foot\u2019 for their extraordinary maneuvers during battle. Considering all of this, it felt strange for such a powerful individual running errands away from the capital city. This felt like a sensitive topic, so you spared Sylvanas the questions. \u201cThat\u2019s a lovely name.\u201d Sylvanas responded with a lighthearted grin before resuming her walk through the camp. Both you and Sylvanas were silent the rest of the way. Nothing needed to be said from that point on. It was obvious that she wasn\u2019t interested in discussing her role in the family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0On the approach of a large tent towards a corner of the camp, Sylvanas began speaking again. \u201cBefore we find you a place to sleep, I need one thing taken care of.\u201d The two of you stop in front of this tent, as Sylvanas bends over at the entrance. A torch latched onto the front of this tent exposed these moments for you. The firm muscles beneath her emblazoned skin were drawn taut from her shift in posture. Sylvanas had a slim yet muscular build \u2013 a body fit for combat. Indeed, she was a real Windrunner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Sylvanas slipped back upward, you averted your gaze from her lower half. In her hands is an empty wooden bucket that she picked up from in front of the tent. Your suspicion gets the better of you. \"What's the bucket for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In response, Sylvanas hands the bucket to you. \u201cBring me a pail of clean water from our well, and then we\u2019ll talk.\u201d Before you could question this demand, she slipped into the tent. You caught a glimpse of something just before she left your view. Light beads of sweat accumulated across her brow, her body communicating these secret intentions of hers. It was hard to believe, but it seemed like Sylvanas was nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bucket in tow, you journeyed back to the middle of the camp. Just as you noted before, this was where the well Sylvanas spoke of was. A short respite was exactly what you needed to formulate the possibilities regarding her intentions. Sylvanas displayed similar reactions during the investigation, particularly when your tongue graced the sole of her foot. You weren\u2019t sure what she had to be nervous about, but there seemed to be only one possibility now. Sylvanas was contemplating something erotic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The reason she walked through the camp barefoot, and now the reason you\u2019re carrying a bucket full of water back to her tent. Was she planning on testing you, to prove your affiliation with the Queen? Showing your lineage mark should have dissuaded her from taking such action, but it was still a possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Standing in front of her tent with the requested bucket of water, something about this situation felt uncomfortably familiar. You paused in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWould you please bring me a glass of warm milk? I\u2019m having trouble getting to sleep.\u201d The Queen waved to you from underneath the silk-imbued comforter neatly covering her bed. It was your will to accept this task from your master, despite the implications of a male servant entering the Queen's personal chambers this late at night. She didn't care; why should you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shuffling these memories back into the depths of your mind, you attributed these suspicions to the recent developments regarding the Queen\u2019s betrayal. However, everything just felt too similar to be a mere coincidence. If Sylvanas truly knew something about your service, then perhaps she was looking to share the Queen's latest conquest. This was looking to be an exceptionally long night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Working past the entrance flap to the tent, you soon found Sylvanas sitting on the edge of a lengthy cot. Her legs were crossed again, much like they were during your interrogation. It seemed like an unconscious habit produced by her tension. This posture drew your gaze down to her feet, as they both dangled in the air, unable to reach the roughspun fabric that formed the floor of this tent. As you imagined, there were smudges of dirt and loose pieces of foliage plastered about her feet. Upon catching sight of a scrubbing brush in her hands, you began to piece together what Sylvanas was planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI brought the water.\u201d You stated, watching your silent partner as she flexed the soft bristles of the rectangular brush. Her eyes veered upward as you placed the bucket beside her cot. Averting eye contact, you took a look around the interior of the tent. Besides the cot Sylvanas was sitting on, there was no place for you to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0No sense in jumping to conclusions. You returned your gaze to Sylvanas, only to find her deep in thought. \u201cI\u2019d like to talk to you.\u201d She said, handing you the scrubbing brush. \u201cAnd I\u2019d like for you to clean my feet while we do.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That was the confession you were waiting for, but it was odd for Sylvanas to do this after discovering your infamous encounter with the Queen. \u201cMy hands are stained. Why would you ask this of me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sylvanas seemed to surprise you at every turn, and this time was no exception. \u201cI ask this of you because I have an idea of what happened between you and the Queen.\u201d She kicked her right foot forward into your personal space, resting her dirty foot on your shoulder. \u201cNow would you please begin?\u201d Sylvanas was entrusting her feet to you once again. You nodded, accepting the scrubbing brush and kneeling down beside her cot. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to play along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You grabbed the foot resting upon your shoulder and rolled your fingers underneath her heel, cradling her foot with one hand. Your touch was excessively tender, leading Sylvanas to a noticeable blush. A smirk ran across your face upon this realization, as you focused on her two beautiful feet. You lathered the brush in water drawn from your bucket. This was the sort of menial task you had repeated over the years in service to the Queen, soon introducing the bristled side of the brush to Sylvanas\u2019 heel. Every movement you made was graceful and worked towards the eventual goal of removing the dried mud from her skin. As you were told, using wholesome, gentle strokes was the best way to achieve this. There was no need to rush this moment, as you heard Sylvanas exclaim a sigh of relief. Your devoted service to the Queen allowed you a level of technique unseen outside of the royal servants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The brush progressed upward, across the length of her arch. After everything you learned from the interrogation, you knew Sylvanas was sensitive here. Recalling an instance with the Queen, you accidentally tickled her foot when cleaning it during her bath. It broke the relaxing mood and the Queen made you pay for that mistake thoroughly. Disrupting such a mood was something you never intended to repeat. You worked the brush against the light, earthy build-up along her sole, never ceasing in your efforts to apply the right amount of pressure. Every second of practice that went into perfecting your trade was paying off, right here, for Sylvanas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sylvanas closed her eyes and embraced the soothing calmness that overwhelmed her. You carefully splayed her toes out and worked the brush against her digits. The soft bristles encompassed her individual toes, caressing their supple frame with every pass. You could only imagine the wonderful sensations this brought Sylvanas, as you dutifully cleaned her toes to utter perfection. Another sigh escaped her mouth, this time as ecstatic shivers ran through her body. This was beginning to affect both of you in ways you hadn\u2019t imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This was the first time you had served the feet of a woman outside of the Queen. The connection you felt between Sylvanas filled you with a passion you hadn\u2019t experienced before. You were unsure on how to respond to these feelings, so you merely continued your service to this ranger, oblivious to the slender hands wrapping around your head. Pausing in surprise, you felt Sylvanas hunch over and pull you into her chest. Your focused drifted away from her feet, as you noticed her heavy breathing. Each bout of hot air pouring out from her lungs contained the same passion afflicting you. It clung to her breath, forcing you to realize that this was more than a simple foot cleaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She embraced your head, attempting to catch her breath. Her senses were frustrated by the endless stimulation, unable to handle your practice all on the first go. This made you realize just how well the Queen had adapted to you. Perhaps this was the reason she was so unwilling to share you with the rest of the royal family. It was hard to believe you were really this accomplished, but the womanly evidence of such was bundled up around your head while pondering. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair\u2026 you shouldn\u2019t be able to make me feel like this.\u201d Her voice was soft, still reeling under the exhaustion you caused her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This felt like the perfect time to inquire what she thought of the Queen, so you took a gamble. \u201cWhat do you think happened between me and the Queen?\u201d While the obtrusive female parts in your face muddled the depth of your voice, you think the message was well-received.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Speechless at first, Sylvanas eventually found the will to explain. \u201cI know the Queen. This wasn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve had an incident in the castle with her and a servant.\u201d She rested her cheek on the top of your head, turning to the side as if to avoid your potential glare. \u201cBut this was the first time we\u2019ve had to reveal the matter publically.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Oh, how glad you were to be the first exception. You were ostracized by your people, cut off from your friends and family, and then betrayed by the woman you devoted your life to serving. After having made such a huge commitment to the Queen, this was a cruel realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d There was no hesitation in your voice. You were finally broken, accepting of the fact that you could not return to your master. If Sylvanas brought you here with the intent to try out the Queen\u2019s latest plaything, then there was no longer any reason to sugarcoat her desires. You were at her disposal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sylvanas pulled herself away from you, allowing the torchlight to brighten her face. You noticed her staring down at you. Behind the dull gaze was a tint of sadness, almost as if she was suffering from your lifeless words. \u201cI would like to inherit your services.\u201d She was embarrassed to admit it, but Sylvanas was speaking as truthfully as she could. \u201cWhen you licked my foot, something inside of me just\u2026 treasured that sensation. It happened again when you handled my feet with such gentleness.\u201d Sylvanas was beginning to understand why the Queen chose you as her personal servant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her words were astonishing for you \u2013 who had almost lost hope in returning to his purpose in life. Without the Queen you were lost, but Sylvanas wanted to ensure this didn\u2019t remain so. She certainly seemed willing to make the pledge, just as you had with the Queen years ago. This was an unbreakable, lifetime oath to forever serve and protect your master. Switching masters didn\u2019t bode well in your mind, especially if your new master wasn\u2019t of royal blood. You really would be considered a traitor if you chose to accept, even if it was the best decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But you were an outcast. There was no risk upon swearing fealty to a new master; no one cared anymore. Your peers, friends and family were no longer relevant, as they likely cut their ties to you after the \u2018foot elf\u2019 incident. There were no rules to govern a situation that didn\u2019t officially exist, so the decision was yours to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI just\u2026\u201d The silence was dissipated by her words, prompting you to look up at Sylvanas.
