Better yet, it all occurred 5 minutes before the closing shift ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGo figure!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was tough and grimy work that John had to do, but he enjoyed it. The instant satisfaction/gratification you get after seeing something you\u2019ve cleaned/fixed was always a rewarding feeling to him. Plus, he liked the people he saw everyday, as they always treated with fairly so he did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that should take care of that\u201d he said as he finished mopping the last of the puke off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wiped the sweat from his brow, and checked his watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n12:45 a.m.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally he\u2019d take the day shift, just so that his wife wouldn\u2019t worry about him coming home so late, but he switched shifts with one of the younger guys who had a date tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhelp, I\u2019d better be getting back to Amanda, she\u2019s probably still up waiting for me\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wringed the mop in the bucket, when he noticed a smudge on one of the tiles on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe poor bastard went full exorcist on this bathroom, he even hit the walls\u201d John chuckled to himself, pulling a rag from his back pocket to scrub it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, he lightly scrubbed it because it appeared not to be too dry or bonded with with the tile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat failed, so he exerted a bit more force to get this tough stain out of the tile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat in the hell?\u201d John said, being frustrated by this stubborn stain on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn put all his weight behind his hand and scrubbed his hardest against the stain, when suddenly, the tile clicked and retracted into the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, various clicking noises could be heard from behind the wall. John took a step toward the wall and put his ear up to it, just to confirm that he was in fact hearing these noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the wall split into two halves, and opened up into a dark room. John stumbled into the room as he was totally caught off guard, not knowing the wall was basically going to give out in him. He felt to his hands and knees, letting out an audible cry as he hadn\u2019t taken a fall that hard since he was a teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChrist almighty\u201d he said to himself, looking down at his before sitting upward and rubbing them together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked up and seen that the room was pitch black, and all he could see was a pedestal, with what seemed to be a glowing orb hanging over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn\u2019t quite explain it, but he felt as if he was being called to the orb. To spring up onto his feet and race to embrace it. Despite this feeling, he slowly stood up, dusted himself off, and crept slowly toward the ball of light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he drew closer, he thought he could hear faint whispers coming from the direction of the orb, but discredited that due to his lack of belief in things of such matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, John was right in front of the pedestal and the whispers grew louder. There were faintly engraved words on the pedestal, and they weren\u2019t visible until John dusted them off with his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cle....pouvoir.....de wilko? What the hell is that? French?\u201d John thought out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOui\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked up quickly to see the source of the reply, as now a hooded figure appeared on the other side of the pedestal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure spoke broken English with a French accent, \u201cJohn, as I have watched, your services you give Wilko are irreplaceable. Please, allow, me to offer this blessing, pour ton travail acharn\u00e9\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you talking about mate? Are you feeling funny?\u201d John said, confused and a bit scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh ah, Monsieur John. I am as you say, serious. Many service Wilko for generations, and this gift is for those of service\u201d the figure said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orb then started to pulsate, and the whispers  grew louder and louder in John\u2019s ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat drops began to form on John\u2019s forehead, \u201cWhat sort of gift?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure chuckled, as his voice deepened as he spoke. \u201cThe whispers you hear are from all. With this power, you are free to manipulate all and their vessels\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore John could question the figure, the orb produced a sublime and blinding light that caught him by surprise and forced John to cover his eyes. The orb then shot into John\u2019s chest, rendering him breathless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was about to pass out, he heard the figure whisper in his ear, \u201cManipulate the vessels of others as you please, or even your own for that matter. Farewell, fellow serviceman of Wilko\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn later woke up:</span><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

W-what, Uh, er yes! Come inside!\u201d He sputtered out, still disoriented as to where he was or what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe source of the voice peeked their head in, and John looked up to see that it was the store manager, Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs everything alright John? I just wanted to check in to see if you were feeling okay. Some of the employees said that you seemed lackluster and \u201czombie-like\u201d when you came in this morning\u201d she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn quickly focused in on the situation at hand, \u201cWalked in? To here?\u201d. He looked around to locate where he actually was. \u201cShit I\u2019m in the office, but how did I-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis train of thought was interrupted by Emma, \u201cIf you\u2019re not feeling well or not in the mood for today, you can take it off John. I\u2019ve had plenty of days where work just wasn\u2019t in the stars, so I called in. Hell, I won\u2019t even subtract one of your PTO\u2019s!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he grew more coherent, John felt better and even started to look better than before. The color in his face was a bit flushed but now it had became visible again. However, he could not remember coming into work that morning, or even making it home after his shift last night for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo just let me know in a bit how you\u2019re feeling!\u201d Emma said as she smiled a friendly smile at John, and headed out of his doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll let you know in a bit Em. Thank you\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he was alone, he could really ponder on tracing his steps. Apparently he made it to work, in a different jumpsuit from yesterday which meant that he made it home and showered. But before that? He was drawing a blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was cleaning the Men\u2019s bathroom, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn\u2019s eyes grew wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat fuckin wall!\u201d He said out loud, quickly rising from his desk and heading for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn inspected the wall of the restroom just as he did the night before. He pushed against every tile he could, and none of them performed like last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so crazy\u201d he said to himself, exhaling as he put his hands on his hips. He stepped forward to the sink, and splashed his face with some cold water to really wake himself up and get the neurotransmitters firing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked up at the mirror and let out a small shriek. In his mirror, was not his reflection, but that hooded figure that he had met the night before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell? How\u2019re you doin this?\u201d John asked, unsure whether to be terrified or impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am capable of incredible things Monsieur John.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was odd, even in the well light bathroom, John was unable to see the figures face. It was almost as if the hood itself was a black hole with a voice coming out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd so are you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that? Me?\u201d questioned John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I said last night, manipulate the vessels of others as you please, or even your own\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but what does that even mean? You\u2019re talking all this mumbo-jumbo and I don\u2019t even understand any of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure chuckled, \u201cOh John, you do humor me. If you see that somebody has something you want, you may swap it out for something you have. Or you see somebody needs something, you may gift them somebody else\u2019s\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo like...presents?\u201d John asked, still confused and a bit creeped out that he was talking into a mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no no no Monsieur John. You have no hair, yes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn patted the top of his head, feeling his bald spot. \u201cYeah i guess\u201d, he grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is true. But Micha\u0119l has nice hair, oui?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of Michael and his neatly combed hair popped into John\u2019s mind. It seemed so thick and well groomed at all times, that John couldn\u2019t help but feel jealous in comparison to what he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess he does, yeah\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may simply swap yours, for his. Just think about it, and it will be so.\u201d the figure explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked back up at the mirror to retort the figures claim, but all he seen was his reflection. The figure was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes shot up to his scalp, one that was once full of nice long and healthy locks was not riddled to nothing but a wasteland of hair and scalp. He could feel a mixture of emotions building in his stomach as he thought about it, but the figures words rang through his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh what the hell, why not try what he\u2019s sayin\u201d John thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at his scalp, and thought about Michael\u2019s well kept hair in its place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing initially happened, causing John to chuckle and turn away from the mirror, when something caught his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarks strands of hair started to slowly appear on his head, and soon enveloped his entire scalp. It then grew out and rested on his head, very similar to.....Michael\u2019s haircut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa what the fuck!\u201d John said in disbelief, unable to process the change in front of his eyes. He rummaged his fingers through his hair to confirm what he was seeing, and it was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, someway, he had swapped Michael\u2019s hair with his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn\u2019t had a full head of hair in years, and he wasn't quite sure how to react to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait\u201d he thought to himself, \u201cthat means Michael got my hair, shit\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn walked through the aisles searching for Michael, to see what his reaction would be to seeing his hair on John\u2019s head. He eventually found him showing a customer where the batteries were, and there it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn\u2019s balding hair on full display on-top of Michael\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael stepped away from the customer, and John approached him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, hey Michael, how ya doin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohn what\u2019s up! I was actually gonna ask Liz to radio you. Some kid dropped a carton on milk in the refrigerated section.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, uh okay. I\u2019ll jump right to that. I was actually gonna ask if you\u2019d gotten a haircut recently\u201d John asked, trying not to stare at his former hair follicles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, and no I haven\u2019t. I\u2019ve been trying to grow it out a bit taut I\u2019ve just been losing so much hair lately that I might just go bald. I was hoping to have a full head of hair like yours in my forties but that\u2019s just how genes work I guess\u201d Michael answers, rubbing his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn fought to not let his jaw drop. So apparently, when he made these changes, nobody but him would be aware of what occurred. He couldn\u2019t help but laugh, but quickly swallow it to not appear odd in front of Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I just wanted to check in with you Mike, I\u2019ll go mop that up right now\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn walked away with a smile on his face, as his brain gradually thought of other improvements to his life he could make<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><span style=\"line-height:1.6;\">Questions and ideas poured into John\u2019s mind as he headed toward the refrigerated area of the store, thinking of what he was now capable of with this new bestowed power. He knew that he could change his own life with it, but what about those around him? The figure did briefly mention about the \u201cvessels of others\u201d so did that mean he was free to change others as well? He needed to experiment, and see his power at work firsthand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scanned the aisles are he walked through the store, searching for two guinea pigs he could attempt to change. He soon stopped in his tracks when he caught two of his co-workers chatting while stocking shelves, and they couldn\u2019t be any different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Claire, and Allie. It was clear that Claire had been assisting Allie in stocking up the higher shelves, as Allie was too short to even reach them. Claire\u2019s 5\u201910 frame really helped out around the store, and her co-workers as well. Allie was about 5\u20190, so you could definitely miss her sometimes when searching for somebody. Her height was somewhat of a disadvantage when working at a department store, but she made up for it for being a hard-worker with an enjoyable personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women were gossiping about some show that they both had interest in, and their opinions on what the next season may consist of. John knew nothing of the sort, although it sounded like something that his wife or daughter may be interested in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn stepped back into the aisle adjacent to them, so that he was able to hear what they were saying, but not be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that cliffhanger at the end really duped me! But the end credit scene sort of set up part of the next season!\u201d Allie told Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnd credit scene! I didn\u2019t even know that was a thing! I\u2019m so bad at just skipping over little things like that. Some fan I am\u201d Claire sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of them continued to yak on about their interests, John focused in on what he could change about them. Suddenly, the inspiration hit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTheir legs! One's tall, and the other's small! I suppose I could try and flip em around.\u201d John said to himself, half excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took his feather duster out from his waistband, and entered the aisle that the two women were in. He used that to act like he was dusting some of the shelves, just to witness this change himself, if possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing the custodian, Claire and Allie both greeted him and exchanged happy looks with him, before returning to their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn returned the favor, and begun to fake dust the shelves. He looked over at the two women, and said under his breath, \u201cHere goes nothing\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe envisioned Claire with Allie's stumpy legs and round butt, and Allie with Claire\u2019s long, never ending legs and flat rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t notice anything immediately, but after a few glances back in their direction, he could see that the two of them were slowly meeting face to face without the knowledge of what was happening to them. Allie and Claire weren\u2019t staring in his direction, so he begun to give his undivided attention to the transformation he set forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire\u2019s pant legs were beginning to become baggy at her ankles, whereas Allie\u2019s skinny jeans rose to about her mid-calf area. Given the exchange of legs/height, Allie now had to be at least 5\u20198, while Claire had shrunk down to being 5\u20191. Lastly, as he had a perfect view of Claire\u2019s back, John could see the back of her pants filling up with Allie\u2019s ample rear. Her slim trousers stretched outward as they tried to accommodate her new asset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLord almighty what have I done\u201d John thought to himself after witnessing his power at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard their conversation change somewhat, after he made the change, as Claire seemed a bit more grateful for Allie\u2019s presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m lucky you came around when you did Allie,  I would\u2019ve needed to grab a ladder from the back\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all good! I put \u2018reaching high places\u2019 as one of my strengths on the application\u201d Allie joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn turned away from the two of them and semi-sped walk out of the aisle, in disbelief at what he\u2019d just done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo not only did I change their legs, I changed their minds too! Geez if I could get clothes to fit too it\u2019d be perfect!\u201d John said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then felt a buzz on his waist, his walkie-talkie. It was:</span><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While he was the janitor at Wilko, he also did his fair share of handiwork around the store. Whether it was fixing leaks or assembling things, John was the man for the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>*bzzzt*</i> Yeah Liz, Let me grab my tools and I\u2019ll be up in a jiffy, luv. Over\u201d <i>*bzzzt*</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left the area of the store where Allie and Claire had been, as they\u2019d carried on in their tasks as normal, without any problems due to their swapped legs. He walked towards his workspace, grabbed his bag of tools from the shelf, and headed on over to Liz\u2019s office space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n___________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe never realized how long of a trip it was to the office until he had to lug his tools around. They weren\u2019t profoundly heavy, but heavy enough to make him break a sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess I ain\u2019t built like I used to\u201d John said to himself, concentrating on walking forward without dropping his tools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he reached the foot of the stairs, he examined them up and down, and sighed to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess this\u2019ll be my workout for the day\u201d he said half-heartedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he walked in, Liz was sitting on the floor, trying to comprehend the instruction manual to the best of her ability. She\u2019d already separated all the pieces, and made note of what went where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh! The man of the hour!\u201d Liz said happily as John appeared in the doorway, \u201cI can\u2019t make heads or tails of these instructions\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood to see you Liz\u201d, he smiled before setting his tools down. \u201cLet me take a look at that before you pop a blood vessel\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz handed John the manual and he slowly looked over it, understanding what tools he needed and where to assemble the pieces. He then sat down on the floor directly across from Liz, and begun putting together the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019d call out for different pieces and Liz would scramble trying to find them amongst the pulled piles she\u2019d made, as she tried to remain useful during this task. John could\u2019ve done it alone, but it was nice to have the company when doing something like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how\u2019s Amanda and the kids? Brendon\u2019s really sprouted since the last time Amanda brought them by the store\u201d Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey doing pretty well, same ol same ol\u201d John said as he drilled one of the desk legs in place, \u201cAnd if feels like Brendon\u2019s growing everyday. He\u2019s nearly as tall as I am\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz smiled at that, \u201cI know how you feel, as I watch Ethan. His brain and body just won\u2019t stop growing. I want him to be my little baby forever\u201d she cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn shared a laugh with Liz, and in the meantime, he got a really good look at the assistant manager. She had her hair tied up in a high ponytail, to prevent it from getting in her face at this time. She\u2019d taken off her heels, and her suit jacket to try and deal with the manpower that assembling this desk took. She had rolled her sleeves up too, just to really look like she was full handywoman mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Liz continued to blabber on about her young son, John couldn\u2019t help but take a peek down at her extra-large bosom. Although she was dressed very conservatively, her breasts made anything she wore appear erotic. The fabric around her mounds appeared to be strained, as her tits protruded quite fiercely against her blouse, and the buttons seemed to be fighting a losing battle. John tried to become more respectful about his ogling of particular women, especially when his daughter was born, but Liz made it pretty tough to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...and then he threw the bowl of spaghetti at me! What a crazy kid right?!\u201d Liz laughed, interrupting John\u2019s thoughts and his line of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Yeah! Hahaha, kids are funny\u201d John fake-laughed, appearing to have been listening for the past few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Liz was about to bring up another lame story about her kindergartener, John stood up and lifted the desk in its correct position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat should do it luv!\u201d He said as he patted the desktop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow thank you so much John! I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do this without you or your help! How can I repay you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen presented with that with that question , initially, some questionable thoughts definitely filled his mind but were cleared almost immediately when he realized who he was talking to. Two thoughts reminded, and he decided to act upon one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe lunch on you? I think I forgot what Amanda packed me in the fridge at home\u201d John admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay less! Lets go down and grab something. I\u2019ve feeling like a good club sandwich with some soup\u201d Liz said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo walked out of Liz\u2019s office space and headed down to the store floor to go get their lunch. They made their way though the thick of it all, when somebody called out to Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLiz! Liz! Wait up!\u201d she called out as she slow jogged over to here and John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there luv, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d Liz inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was stocking this item and the item's price tag didn\u2019t match the one from last week so I.....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kiran went deeper into her situation, the more John tuned her out. The more he tuned out their conversation, the better his second idea from before sounded. He had briefly thought about the swap that he had made before, and believed that Liz would be the perfect subject to swap something from. But what to swap? And from who? Liz had a lot of great attributes to choose from, and he wanted to find another candidate on this small lunch trip. Luckily, Kiran stumbled upon them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran was virtually the opposite of Liz, physically. She was very petite whereas Liz had extra weight in most places where it mattered. Liz was quite bustier (obviously), and had quite a bit more meat on her rear. Liz also was a bit taller, but her heels really made the difference between them show. This just made John more than willing to make another swap occur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does John decide to swap between Liz and Kiran?</span><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><span style=\"line-height:1.6;\">John focused on the chests on the two women, who were clearly on opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of their busts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLiz, you seem to have a lot on your chest, let me help ease that load\u201d he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Liz and Kiran were distracted by their conversation, John directed his gaze specifically towards Liz\u2019s chest, and envisioned Kiran\u2019s budding breast in place of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz\u2019s bust began to slowly shrink down, virtually unnoticeable unless you were staring as hard as John was. Her tits soon no longer filled the cups of her bra, or pressed against her blouse. He could see her bra shift downwards as they were no longer bound to her incredible bust. All that remained was a rather empty H-cup bra, with a meager pair of B-cup breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked a tad bit odd, wearing a bra that was too big, as her blouse had now returned the favor and pushed back against it which make the cups appear flimsy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked over at Kirian\u2019s bust, just as it had started to develop. Her cleavage had started to push out the top of her bra, as it could not compensate the expansion of her B-cup breasts. As Kiran continued to hit a new cup size, it became more and more apparent that her bra was unable to carry the literal load of her new breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, her bra snapped and fell out from under her work polo. Her borrowed breasts were fully outlined due to the amount of space they occupied in her ill-sized polo, and her nipples were visible due to the fact that she no longer had a bra to cover them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy bra!\u201d Kiran exclaimed, bending over to snatch it from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat thing looks like it could hold mine Kiran, not yours\u201d Liz chuckled, observing the small bra that Kiran had in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a comfort thing for me. Plus, it kinda pushes them down so folks don\u2019t stare at them so often. It\u2019s hard enough being a bit small, but these tits of mine look like they robbed me of my growth spurt\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat they do\u201d John admitted under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran did indeed appear a bit odd, as everything was petite about the young woman, except for the large set of breasts she now possessed. Anybody who was to see her turn from back to front was certainly in for a shock when her massive orbs were on display on her small torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Liz\u2019s bra slipped down to her waist, as it was now too loose to be supported by anything on her torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAht! There goes mine!\u201d Liz said wide-eyed, scrambling to take it off, \u201cI don\u2019t even know why I wear this thing, doesn\u2019t even fit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWishful thinking? \u201c, John said, finally contributing to the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women looked over at him, and to his delight, started laughing. They must\u2019ve thought it was a joke, where John was being serious, but he decided to go along with it and laugh too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch out John, yours might come off too, Kiran said jokingly, prompting the three of them to laugh once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></span></div></div>",

There\u2019s this spill over here i need you to look at please, over\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlready on my way Darrell, stay put so I can see exactly where it is, over\u201d John responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he headed over to Darrell, his mind couldn\u2019t help but replay the sight of seeing his powers at work. It was a surreal feeling, knowing that you caused something so extraordinary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was happy to see Darrell, as he was somebody who was always respectful and usually cleaned up after himself in the break-room. They\u2019d also talk sports even now and then, so they had a nice work relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy man! Good to see ya. Yeah so they spilt this stuff all over here, so I...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Michael had told me earlier, I\u2019ll go get my things and clean up. Pull that wet floor sign out from the side of that refrigerator. Dont need any lawsuits on our hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing boss. See you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn headed to one of the closer maintenance closets scattered around the store, and his mind bounced around on what he could do next with his ability. He wanted to cause another change for himself, but wasn\u2019t quite sure what to swap or even who do it with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he entered the closet to get the cleaning supplies, the lightbulb flickered and somebody popped into John\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarrell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could definitely try and swap something with him. I\u2019m sure he has plenty of great attributes.\u201d John said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe headed to the wet area, and as he started mopping, he brainstormed on what he could use from Darrell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHair? No, I\u2019ve got that now. Smile? I think my teeth are quite alright. Maybe his..legs? No, we\u2019re almost the same height.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr maybe...what\u2019s between his legs\u201d John thoughtful himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a particular stereotype that John was a bit curious about when it came to men like Darrell. Rumor had it, that they tended to have larger reproductive organs than that of a average man. Now, John was proud of his own package. Roughly 5-6 inches when erect, his wife enjoyed it, and he was able to reproduce with it. No worries at all! However, there was always the fantasy in the back of nearly every man\u2019s mind, regarding as to how they could increase the size of the junk. Call it immature, boyish, or even primal, but John was now curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo John, this seemed like a perfect opportunity to see if the rumors he had heard were true, and if they weren\u2019t, no harm done and he could personally debunk them. He knew that Darrell was popular amongst the ladies, so he guessed that his good looks weren\u2019t the only thing drawing them back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose it wouldn\u2019t hurt anybody. I could just borrow it for the day, like a trial or something\u201d John said as he reasoned with himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s all he needed to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he mopped, John closed his eyes, and imagined Darrell walking around with his (John\u2019s) genitals between his own legs. John wasn\u2019t initially too sure how it\u2019d go, seeing how he\u2019d never even seen Darrell\u2019s junk before, so he didn\u2019t know if he would be able to swap the two parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his eyes were closed, he felt an odd sensation in his trousers. It felt as if he\u2019d been getting an erection, but his penis hadn\u2019t hardened at all, it just got longer. It traveled a few inches down his pant leg before stopping, and then growing outward as his girth increased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shit!\u201d John exclaimed, as these unfamiliar feelings increased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes shot open when he felt his testicles droop, as they grew from being two peanut sized balls that stay closed to his member to being walnut sized now and hitting his thigh. He looked down and gasped to see that an outline of his newest addition could be seen on his jumpsuit, due to the fact that his old genitalia wasn\u2019t capable of such this. He hurriedly finished up his task, put the supplies back into the closet, and rushed to the nearest restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering the restroom, John went straight into one of the stalls. He wanted to see what in total that he\u2019d swapped with Darrell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his way to the bathroom, he couldn\u2019t help but notice the new weight of his genitals, as well as the stares he was getting from some of the customers. Men and women alike would gaze upon his dick print, some in jealousy, while some in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe unzipped his jumpsuit, and his jaw dropped at the sight of the head of his penis now poking out from the leg of his boxers. Before, he might\u2019ve been pushing mid-boxer, on a good day. But now, it dangled freely. He pulled his boxers down to investigate further, and was greeted by his much larger testicles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJesus Christ, the stereotype was true! Darrell, my man, you\u2019ve got the works!\u201d John chuckled to himself, admiring his new possessions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was bit odd for John to see his cock in such a state, being so large in a flaccid state, or even staring it like in this manner. Some ill feelings came over him, as he felt bad for stealing his friend's manhood. Then again, he was curious to see his wife\u2019s response to it, although the brain may have been altered to where she believes she\u2019s already experienced a few rounds with this behemoth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, I\u2019m sure Amanda would get a kick out of this thing\u201d he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn packed his member back into his jumpsuit nice and snug, and zipped himself back up. He wasn\u2019t too sure what he should do, as he also just wanted to relax in his office before doing any of those other things, but again, he was not sure.</span><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was too old school for that, and photos didn\u2019t usually do his member justice. However, things were different because his things were different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile standing, He angled his phone in front of his penis, so that he could fully capture its entire length, as well as his new enormous balls in the frame. After a few failed attempts, he formally got one that he was proud of, and sent it off to his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn\u2019s wife Amanda should have been busy at the moment with work, as she sold houses on the real estate market, but her job did allow her to keep her phone on her at all times. John knew that it would be a matter of minutes before she responded to him, as she was usually quick to reply when she was on the clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe zipped himself back up, and sat down on the toilet seat to wait to see what his wife would say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed by, and just as John was about to abandon hope, his phone buzzed. He checked the screen and seen that it was indeed from Amanda, who said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Oh baby, I miss that monster. It\u2019s been a long day at this open house so I\u2019m gonna need it when i get home <br>\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/wink.png\" alt=\"*Wink*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">  xoxo </b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn felt his face redden up, as he felt a bit flustered at his wife\u2019s compliment. She typically wouldn\u2019t refer to his cock in such a way, or even allude to sex half the time. Darrel\u2019s parts were really opening some doors!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn responded:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Haha, no worries bby. U kno I\u2019ll do what u like</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda: \u201c<b>Thanks hubby. I\u2019m gonna be all over i when I get off ;)</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSheesh\u201d John exhaled. He wasn\u2019t used to all this dirty type talk with his wife, but now he was starting to understand it. It was turning him on! He felt his member harden and lengthen in his jumpsuit, down his leg as he thought about getting intimate with his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn: <b>how bout I get sum pix back <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe giggled like a preteen after hitting send. He hadn\u2019t been this excited or riled up since the day his wife moved in with him. Or that time when those college girls came into the store and the sink shot water all over their white shirts. Good times, goooooood times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn\u2019s trip down memory lane was interrupted when his phone buzzed, and seen a man\u2019s favorite word assortment: \u201c<b>Attachment: 4 images</b>\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis breathing increased as he pressed on the message and waited for the images to show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first image consisted of his wife\u2019s breasts in a red lacy bra. Amanda\u2019s breasts had seemingly ripened with age in John\u2019s opinion, as they started as smaller B-cups, before turning into decently sized C-cups after bearing both of their children. They sagged somewhat as they'd gotten a bit older, and she wasn\u2019t too fond of how they started to look, but John found them to be as beautiful as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second image was a sequel of the first, as it contained Amanda\u2019s nude breasts. One thing  Tom had always thought was unique about his wife\u2019s breasts was that her nipples were inverted. When he first seen the, he was under the assumption that she had no nipples at all, but she kindly showed him the flaw in his logic. He felt his member burn as it hardened up even more at the idea of sticking his new cock in between her tits, something that he wasn\u2019t capable of doing before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third image was a picture of his wife\u2019s rear,  with her thong on. She wasn\u2019t exceptionally curvy but she did have a nice shape to her hips and ass, although she always envied women with better shaped bottoms. It definitely wasn\u2019t something to write home about, but Amanda did well with what she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth image, and probably the most graphic, was his wife\u2019s soaked vagina. John was taken aback at the sight of it because it caught him extremely off-guard. She\u2019d never sent him a picture of it, so exposed and stimulated. That was typically a strictly bedroom thing for them, but now it seemed that all bets were off! As he continued to examine this photo in particular, he could see how soaked her inner thighs were, the fluids dripping down her leg. It was incredibly as to how turned on she got just by seeing his genitals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the images sent, she said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Had to sneak away from the clients to send these. Miss you loads. You\u2019ll get a close up 2night xox :)</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>U R a goddess</b>\u201d John replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChrist almighty, this is nutty\u201d he said to himself as he wiped the sweat from his forehead. All this dirty time with his wife had gotten him feeling all hot and bothered, and judging from the steel rod in his pants, pretty turned on as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued to examine the photos of his wife\u2019s private part in the stall, an idea popped into John\u2019s mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder....should I give Amanda some boosts too? I mean, it\u2019ll only benefit the two of us\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon\u2019t get him wrong, John loved his wife and her appearance, without a doubt in the world. But there was always room for improvement, and those improvements varied, as his mind constantly thought about what he\u2019d just seen on his phone. His mind wandered quite frankly, before coming down to a decision between two parts of her body. He thought hard as to what new body part he should gift his wife, which ended up being: someone\u2019s buttocks, or their breasts?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he decide to do?</span><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had her head down and was inspecting something, while her boss Carly, wearing a short-sleeved pink salon tunic, black boot-cut slacks and a pair of black leather 3-inch stiletto pumps, was busy putting the finishing touches to a client's manicure. Of course, reception was where Holly seemed to be most of the time now, but she was at least thankful to still have a job after Lash Academy had closed it's doors. Zoe had taken Holly with her back to Beautylicious when Carly offered them both jobs. Now here she was, working under Carly and Zoe, and her other co-workers were Hannah and a certain lesbian American by the name of Nat, who used to work at Wilko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holly!\" Zoe's voice suddenly called out as she walked over in her 3-inch heeled black patent pumps. Holly looked up at her former employer now co-worker, the tall brunette looked as professional as ever, her stylish shoes complimented by a knee-length and form hugging black pencil skirt and a red short-sleeved blouse. Zoe was wearing her dark brown hair in a plait today that was hung over her left shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Holly replied, a little startled by the sudden mention of her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you looking at?\" Zoe giggled slightly as she approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly shook her head gently. \"Nothing, just deep in thought.\" She lied, as she slipped a certain remote looking device back into her handbag. \"What is it?\" She then smiled, noticing the piece of paper in one of Zoe's manicured hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you to pop down to Wilko luv and buy a few things. We're out of several lipsticks and nail polishes and we need some more wax strips.\" Zoe said, as she held out her hand and let Holly take the shopping list from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, okay.\" Holly just nodded, opening the paper up and looking at it. Zoe's handwriting was not as easy to read as Carly's, but she could make out the items that the salon needed. Holly stood up and grabbed her handbag/purse, putting it over her shoulder. Then she inspected her appearance briefly. Holly herself was dressed in a white short-sleeved blouse, a plaid skirt, black tights and a pair of black suede ankle boots with 2-inch block heels. As usual, she wore her ash blonde hair in twin plaits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the money.\" Zoe smiled, handing Holly a \u00a320 note before clicking off in her heels to find Nat and ask her to make some coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly slipped the money in her purse and gave her boss Carly a quick smile before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce outside, Holly looked sykwards, took in a breath of fresh air, and started walking down towards towards Wilko. Along the way, she dug into her handbag and pulled out the remote looking device she had been inspecting earlier. A curious smile formed on her pretty face as she thought of the possibilities. The device had arrived at her apartment that morning by anonymous mail, with a note inside the package explaining what it was. A 'Trait Exchanger Device' or TED for short. The note explained that the device could swap people's traits and clothing without them noticing. But it also mentioned that in rare occurrences, somebody else other than the wielder might notice the swaps. Of course, Holly was still sceptical, but as she got near Wilko, her curiosity was biting hard and she just had to know if the device actually worked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she had a look around pretending to intend on buying something, she scouted the area for potential targets, including customers and employees. It didn't take her long however to spot an adult couple walking in front of her, intending on swapping the pair of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly looked at the remote and started to attempt to figure out how this thing worked. It may have been a remote but it was nothing like her tv remote and even with that thing she didn't really know what every single button did. As she was pressing random buttons trying to get it to work however, she was causing a few things to happen, even if she didn't notice it herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her were two pairs of customers. A dad walking with his daughter and a young adult couple who were very much into each other and weren't intending to hide it. The father was fairly average, had a 'dad bod' body shape, was wearing some loose jeans and a t-shirt with messy brown hair. His daughter looking to be about 15 or 16 was wearing a denim skirt and a pink t-shirt as well as some cute boots. She didn't seem to really enjoy being here and complained about wanting to go to the toy store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young couple was made up of a fairly attractive looking guy with sleek black hair, a button up shirt and slim jeans as well as a pair of smart shoes. He and his girlfriend, a pretty blonde with C-cup breasts who was wearing some light blue skinny jeans and a white crop top with some heeled boots, walked hand in hand and occasionally shared a loving kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Holly attempted the swap the couple in front of them, she accidentally targeted the daughter and the girlfriend instead, swapping their relationships and families, which had some interesting results. The 15 year old girl was now walking hand in hand with the young man and it didn't take long for them to share a passionate kiss as he squeezed her ass through her skirt. The young woman however was now walking with the father but she was a lot less annoyed with being there than the daughter was a moment ago, maybe that was because she was a bit older but she and her \"father\" shared some more grown up conversations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth pairs soon took a different turn into a different aisle as Holly kept following the adult couple she was still trying to cause a swap between as she struggled with the remote.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was still unaware of the relationship swap she had just caused accidentally, just as she oblivious to the next accidental swap she made. The remote fired off without her realizing and zapped a couple of teenagers in the aisle, a 16-year old boy and his 14-year old sister. Flustered, Holly looked up for a minute, gripping the remote in one hand while she wiped her brow with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't look at the teenage siblings, who were now dressed in each other's clothes. The boy looked silly wearing his sister's short-sleeved pink t-shirt, denim shorts, underwear and black &amp; pink hi-tops, all resized to fit his larger body. While his sister didn't look quite as ridiculous wearing his t-shirt, jacket, jeans, boxer shorts and sneakers. The girl actually just looked like a tomboy, since her hair was cut quite short, just below her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after knocking it a couple of times, another light flickered on at the top of the remote and Holly took this to mean that it was working finally. So she took aim at the couple in front of her, a husband and wife in their mid thirties. She imagined them swapping hairstyles as she zapped them with the device, and that's exactly what happened. The man's short brown hair cascaded down his neck and shoulders, becoming his wife's permed blonde hair, while the woman's hair retreated upwards, turning brown and turning into her husband's masculine cut. Holly let out a giggle at the sight, delighted to know her device actually worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, she immediately sat about searching for new targets in the store's aisles.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A hot young woman wearing a tank top and some yoga pants walked into the store, but thanks to Holly's mishap, a tent was pitched inside of those pants not long after as her crotch was switched with that of a nearby man. Her butt was promptly exchanged for his as well before Holly finally caught a grip on the device, oblivious to all the random swaps she had been causing already today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on what else do you want me to do?\" Holly thought to herself as she finally successfully made another swap. The man's muscles suddenly appeared on the woman, making her muscular new legs visible underneath the dress while the man's arms looked a bit lackluster compared to what they were.<br>\r\n\"Oh finally.\" Holly sighed in relief as she saw the success of her swap.</span></div></div>",

She was really excited with all the possibilities that now lay before her. But just then Holly noticed the hot young brunette woman in the tank top and yoga pants as she walked past her. \"Wait... what?\" She frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly's eyes widened when the saw the erection stretching the fabric of the young woman's yoga pants, and how flat and 'unfeminine' her backside appeared to be. \"Er... I guess I did that? I really need to be more careful with this thing.\" She shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be more careful with what?\" A voice said behind Holly, startling her. She spun around to see a Wilko employee standing there. His name badge read '<b>Nathan</b>' and Holly had seen him around a couple of times when she came in shopping, but she'd never spoken to him. \"And can I help you with anything Miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing, I er... no I'm fine, thank you.\" Holly replied nervously, trying to get rid of the guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw what you did with that... thing.\" Nathan cut straight to it, pointing to the device in Holly's hand, despite her trying to hide it behind her back. She made it a little too obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What thing? This? It's nothing.\" Holly chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan pointed over to the man who now his wife's hairstyle and viceversa as they headed for the checkouts. \"You call that nothing? You swapped their hair somehow. How did you do it?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that, yeah... alright, you caught me.\" Holly mumbled, scratching her head. She then proceeded to show Nathan the remote and explain what it could do. Needless to say he was surprised and excited, just like Holly was. \"You're the only other person who noticed anything you know.\" Holly informed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am? Huh. You work in Beautylicious right?\" Nathan asked, as he stared first at the remote and then at Holly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly just nodded. \"Yeah, Zoe sent me shopping, and I figured I'd see if thing worked while I'm here.\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan smirked, his cock getting hard as he thought of what the device could do to the people around them, including possibly his co-workers. He also thought Holly was cute, but he couldn't bring himself to say anything like that just yet. This was the first time they'd spoken after all, and what an introduction it had been. \"Well, do you mind if I observe, maybe give you an idea or two?\" He asked nervously, smiling at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly liked the idea of having someone to share the device with. \"Sure, I guess. But won't you get in trouble if you're caught not working?\" She replied to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan shrugged his shoulders. \"This thing is worth the risk.\" He said with a smirk, tapping the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well alright then.\" Holly grinned, preparing her next swaps.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In its culture it was customary to swap parts with friends and co-workers to build trust.

Jenny immediately stopped abruptly in her heels and turned around, looking daggers at her two children. Freddie had a toothy grin on his slightly chubby face and Imogen had an expression of disgust on her face as she pawed at the slight bulge that had appeared in her jean shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your voice down Imogen, how many times do I have to tell you?\" Jenny, 43, berated her daughter. \"There can be no mention of swapping, am I clear?\" She continued, also glaring at Freddie. \"And you Freddie, swap your sister back RIGHT NOW!\" She growled, only raising her voice at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She called me a pig.\" Freddie, 15, defended himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care, I've told you no end of times that you CANNOT use your new powers on your brothers and sisters, including Imogen.\" Jenny dismissed her son's defense, idly gesturing with her hand. With that, she stepped back and sighed. Ever since Freddie and Imogen had injected themselves with the experimental syrum from the Transformation Group lab that Jenny had been told to test out herself, things had got more than irritating for the mother of eight. Now, there wasn't just her who could swap people's body parts around, her two aforementioned children could as well. \"Swap her back, before she retaliates.\" Jenny again warned her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" Freddie complained, glancing across the street at the elderly man in his late 60's who currently had his sister's vagina between his frail legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewww, you swapped me with an old man ?\" Imogen said in disgust, seeing where Freddie was focused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up, I'm swapping you back.\" Freddie responded, and within seconds Imogen felt the old penis in her knickers retract back into her body, leaving her with her usual 13 year old vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now STOP using your powers on each other. I'm not in the mood today.\" Jenny shook her head, scolding her two kids. \"You're going to make me late for my appointment if you keep messing around like this.\" She continued talking, as she set off walking again. Jenny had a 11:00am appointment at Beautylicious to have her nails and eyebrows done and she didn't want to miss it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, cuz I really want to sit in a salon bored shitless while you get your nails painted.\" Freddie moaned again as he caught up with his mother, only to get a clip upside the head for his trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch your language!\" Jenny admonished her son, eliciting a slight smirk from Imogen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Imogen didn't like the idea of being sat in a salon waiting for her mother either. \"Freddie is right though mum, I'd rather not sit doing nothing either for however long your apointment takes.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny rolled her eyes and sighed as she kept walking towards Beautylicious. \"Well you can always go back home, but I'm not sure I trust you to get along together long enough to achieve that simple task.\" She told her children, as she noticed the long brown hair of a nearby college girl suddenly retract into her head and form into a man's haircut. She knew one of her children had just swapped the girl with someone, not that she minded them using their powers on others, since none of them noticed their changes. Her only rule was that they not use their powers on her, on each other... unless they agreed to it, or on their six other unsuspecting siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we could just hang around out here and mess with some people.\" Freddie shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or better, we can pass the time in Wilko.\" Imogen suggested, pointing to the nearby store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny stopped walking again, glancing at her watch. Then she spun around at looked at each of her two children in turn. \"Fine, go and amuse yourselves in there while I'm done, but do NOT go anywhere else, okay?\" She stated, wagging a finger at them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mum.\" The siblings said in unison, nodding and smirking. \"Beat you there!\" Imogen then exclaimed, before running towards the store. Her brother, who was slightly chubbier than she was, followed as fast as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kids!\" Jenny muttered under her breath, before continuing on to the beauty salon.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jenny rolled her eyes and kissed her teeth as she watched Freddie and Imogen spring off in the direction of the store, bumping shoulders and mercilessly teasing each other as they did so. She hadn\u2019t the energy nor the willpower to go off chasing behind them. It sounded bad on paper but she had no qualms with them screwing around and having their little \u2018playtime\u2019\u2014at least as long as it didn\u2019t affect her directly. Ever since that fateful day when she\u2019d popped off for a nap and the two kids had accidentally-on-purpose taken the trait-swapping serum for themselves, they\u2019d done little more than bug her with tales of their swapping antics or pleas to trade things with her herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Rotherham,\u201d she mumbled to herself as she adjusted the mocha-brown poncho on her slight frame, \u201cBut it\u2019s your turn to deal with those brats.\u201d She pushed open the doors of the salon with much ease, breathing in the scent of shampoo and bath salts and sighing contentedly. A spa retreat was <i>exactly</i> what she needed right now. Moments after she\u2019d walked inside a lady, complete in a spotless white masseuse outfit and sparkly heeled-loafers, approached her, her hands tucked behind her back and a disingenuous smile plastered on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood afternoon, ma\u2019am,\u201d she said in a delicate American intonation, \u201cMy name is Nat and can I just wish you a very warm welcome from all of us staff at Beautylicious!\u201d Jenny chuckled awkwardly. She couldn\u2019t tell if it was the lady\u2019s American origin or if she was on something but she was unusually perky for someone who probably worked on minimum wage. In England she\u2019d learnt one thing; never trust a person that\u2019s uber-happy after lunchtime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny sized up the lady: she wasn\u2019t really anything special, at least not in Jenny\u2019s eyes, an inch or two shorter than her at 5\u20195\u201d with a decent figure and bust size (a C-cup, to be precise). The only noticeable features really were her vibrantly dyed blue-ish green hair pulled into a loose braid and her punk-ish tattoos and piercings, one of which was a small hoop going through the flesh around her precisely plucked dark eyebrow. Jenny admired the craftsmanship above her eyes very much and, not being one to want to experience the painful plucking process, decided it\u2019d be much easier to take the girl\u2019s for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took hardly any effort to do so, just a flash of a thought sent her stomach churning, her head spinning and her eyes lolling backwards. <i>Crap,</i> she mumbled as she stumbled slightly. Though she could perform much more extravagant swaps, the inconvenient (but not all that detrimental) toll on her body was always the same. In some ways she was envious of her children\u2019s effortless indifference to the momentary disorientation. Nevertheless, as she regained her composure, she smirked as she reached up and stroked her new pierced eyebrow, feeling the digit of the little slit that Nat had etched into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled a small compact from her purse and marvelled at the style of it\u2014sure, the black eyebrows contrasted with the rest of her dusty blonde hair but she could always swap the colour back later. Jenny looked back up. The beautician\u2019s assistant still stood diligently by the entrance, albeit looking a bit restless from Jenny\u2019s inactivity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you very much, Nat,\u201d Jenny purred. \u201cYou\u2019re a perky one, aren\u2019t you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like to think so, ma\u2019am! How may I be of service for you today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny\u2019s eyes roamed the room. Sitting and waiting patiently in various stages of boredom were a wide age range of women, some of them with husbands, partners, children and various other acquaintances. However in Jenny\u2019s eyes they were all unsuspecting meatbags that she could manipulate to alleviate her pent-up stresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the beautician, you tell me.\u201d Nat smiled and gestured for Jenny to follow her to the front desk and book an appointment, unknowingly guaranteeing that her eyebrows would not be the only feature of hers that would been changed today.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It would have been quite easy to just take the girl's manicure as she took her eyebrows, but Jenny decided against it. If she just used her power to get all she wanted, what was the point of booking an appointment in the first place. Besides, she knew Carly, the owner of the salon was a master manicurist and she wanted to see her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a bikini wax? Or a false tan?\" Nat asked Jenny, as she put the eraser-tipped end of her pensil to her luscious lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny smirked a little, also noticing the young woman's nicely tanned skin. She'd either recently come to the UK from America or had been on holiday recently, because she had a lovely tan. The sudden churning stomach and spinning head occurred again and suddenly Nat was looking much paler with Jenny's skin tone. \"Hmm, scratch that, you've already got a great tan, I'm jealous.\" Nat said, tilting her head as she inspected Jenny. \"But how about the wax? Or some false lashes? Zoe is our expert there.\" Nat suggested with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell, I'll take the lashes, hold off on the wax though.\" Jenny replied, smiling at Nat as she scribbled on some paper with her pencil. True, Jenny knew her 'bush' could do with trimming, but there was no way she was going to put herself through the kind of pain waxing inflicted. Not when there were easier ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could help you out with a massage if you like? You look a little tense.\" Nat then offered. \"It's only another \u00a310.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny chuckled. \"You'd be tense too if you had eight kids under your feet all day.\" She told the beautician.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNat's eyes widened a little. \"Wow, eight? I can't imagine. Well you have a great figure all things considered.\" She said, as her eyes worked their way up and down Jenny's body shape. Nat couldn't have known that Jenny - after popping out child number eight - had swapped her excess 'flab' around her mid-section onto a particularly annoying woman in her mid thirties several weeks back. The woman hadn't been too different from Jenny in terms of build, but hadn't had any kids, so now after the swap Jenny more or less had the figure she had before giving birth to any of her own children. She had kept her own vagina though, for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you.\" Jenny nodded in gratitude. \"I do try to stay in shape.\" She smirked, looking around the salon again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was a global pandemic spreading across the world right now, most people were at home in lockdown. Carly however decided to break the rules and attended an illegal rave the night before, with the full intention of trying to catch this strange new virus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new virus never seen before had emerged from China, if an infected person sneezed on you, then you too would catch the virus. Once infected, your head somehow becomes detachable. The added side effect is that you can also place your head on somebody else's body. Scientists have dubbed this strange new virus Hovis-19.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly knew that the virus was spreading like wildfire, especially at mass gatherings like illegal raves. Although she was still absolutely gorgeous, she was no spring chicken, at 38 years old, she was only 2 years away from 40. After coming out of another bad relationship, Carly decided she deserved to treat herself to something special. She thought about selling her Range Rover and buying something a bit sportier, perhaps a Porsche. But when this pandemic started sweeping the globe, Carly had a much more sinister plan to treat herself. She decided that she was going to steal herself a younger body and she knew exactly where to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly knew that there were a lot of younger girls at the local Wilko store where her own mother used to work before she retired. All she had to to was walk in, sneeze on someone, then the virus would spread like wildfire. She could have her pick of nubile young bodies that she could place her pretty 38 year old head on. If she got bored with it, she could always steal another. Carly smiled smugly, she knew she should be self isolating, but this was going to be too much fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of ruminating about her plan, Carly decided to switch on her TV. She flicked through the channels impatiently as she kicked her heels off and put her feet up on the sofa as she tried to find something to watch. It wasn't long before she settled upon her favourite quiz show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly hated being single, her pussy ached for attention, she especially missed having her pussy eaten out. That's when Carly smirked to herself wickedly \"I couldn't could I? I mean eat my own pussy?\" Carly muttered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity got the better of her. Carly peeled her white slacks off and lowered the red thong she wore around her ankles. Still lying on the sofa, Carly reached up and placed both hands on her head, it took a bit of effort but after a couple of hard tugs her head detached with an audible pop, a bit like the sound of a champagne bottle opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly held her detached head in her hands for a moment before lowering her face down towards her own waxed, hairless pussy. It was already wet as she began to lick the outer lips of her own folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly shuddered, the feeling of her own tongue teasing her twat. \"Fuck this is kinky!\" Carly groaned before ramming her tongue deep into her own pussy. Carly got lost in herself as she went to town. This was the ultimate form of masturbation and she loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who needs a fucking man!\" Carly groaned as she finally brought herself to climax, her toes curled and her screams were muffled by her own pussy. After she'd stopped quivering with ecstasy, Carly calmed down. She decided to leave her head detached for the rest of the night, not even bothering to clean her own juices from her face. There was no point, she was going to give herself a break for a few minutes before going back for round 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She quickly slammed down the lid of her laptop and pushed her swivel chair out from underneath the desk, watching as Liz did a similar thing albeit with her face more red and flustered. Emma straightened her blouse and composed herself before she clacked up to the door handle. She\u2019d already prepared a whole host of excuses to use to explain her and Liz\u2019s idleness but none were needed this occasion as a reasonably young lady in a fluorescent fuchsia bodycon dress burst into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry ma\u2019am, we don\u2019t allow customers up...\u201d Emma was beginning to say when the woman put her finger to her lips. She moved quickly yet cautiously, peeping out of the overlooking window before closing the shutters before proceeding to lock the door behind her and pull the latch across. \u201cExcuse me, ma\u2019am?\u201d Emma\u2019s voice tried to command confidence but squeaked midway as her knees trembled. Both Wilko employees were feeling helplessly terrified and crept towards the back of the room. The young lady seemed to notice and raised her arms in surrender, adjusting her glasses slightly as she did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease,\u201d she said in a scintillating Polish-tinged accent, \u201cGuys, you need to calm down.\u201d That was maybe a bit too much to ask for from Liz who\u2019d already moved beside the PA intercom and was about to press the button and holler for help. The woman tentatively took a step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMove an inch closer and I\u2019ll have the whole store coming for you,\u201d Liz hissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman stopped in her tracks, hands still raised in surrender. \u201cLook guys, I know you\u2019re probably a bit frightened right now but please, let me explain.\u201d Though Liz was still sceptical, Emma nodded and motioned for her assistant manager to hold off for a second. The lady breathed a sigh of relief. \u201cThank you, Emma, honestly. I don\u2019t want to think what would happen if anyone else found out about this. Look, I know this sounds far fetched and I know it\u2019s hard to believe\u2014God, I find it hard to believe myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust hear me out. Alright... guys, it\u2019s me, Steven.\u201d Emma\u2019s jaw dropped. Liz stumbled backwards slightly and looked at \u2018Steven\u2019 in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow the-... No way, it can\u2019t be true...\u201d Emma and Liz were both firmly entrenched in a shared state of disbelief. Aesthetically speaking it was clear this \u2018woman\u2019 wasn\u2019t Steven; first off, of course, they were a woman. A woman with many feminine characteristics such as their slender build, supple legs and thighs with plump magenta lips, a cute button nose and thinly painted eyebrows. The lady\u2019s clothes were also quite racy by Liz and Emma\u2019s standards, hugging her curves tightly, barely covering the rim of her bulbous bum, and allowing the pert nipples of the woman\u2019s bountiful D-cups to poke through the light material. Though her blonde-highlighted hair was cropped a bit short to one side and her arms were a bit more muscular than the managers were used to, this ofigure in front of them was unmistakably womanly. The only item that vaguely reminded Emma of Steven were the dorky looking spectacles placed in the bridge of her nose. They seemed oversized for her face and it seemed too out of place to be a stylistic choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f5/c1/b3/f5c1b38da7c52d857903bfe48fa226ac.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f5/c1/b3/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow the...\u201d Emma tried to find words to describe how she was feeling but no sound escaped her lips. Liz meanwhile strode up to her old friend and assessed him up close, pinching his soft cheeks and feeling his new breasts (much to Steven\u2019s arousal) to verify if what they were seeing was real. Steven squealed girlishly as Liz took a firm grasp of his left nipple in her nails. \u201cOw, f*ck that hurt! What\u2019re you doing, Liz?!\u201d he screeched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz grinned and turned back towards Emma. \u201cWell we know she definitely <i>whinges</i> like Steven!\u201d They all shared a chuckle and the ice growing between them had thawed and splintered partially. Emma gingerly stepped beside Steven and reached out, feeling soft flesh behind her finger. \u201cWow... It feels so real...\u201d she mumbled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is real. I went to this car boot sale nearby my house, a weird thing for me to do in the first place and even weirder considering that I knew the person organising it was this whackjob old hag down the street. Anyways, I was just browsing through when I saw this amazing looking girl browsing through some old jewellery on display there. She\u2019d picked up this beautiful golden teardrop earring with this strange glowing emerald inside and put it on but, for whatever reason, she couldn\u2019t find the second one. Lo and behold I look down and see that the identical other half had rolled right beside my feet. Now I don\u2019t what came over me but I got this <i>really</i> incessant urge to try it on, only for a second, and then I\u2019d just take it off afterwards.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou put the earring on?\u201d Emma asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c \u2018Beautiful teardrop earring\u2019?\u201d Liz asked, bewildered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven blushed slightly and pushed a lock of hair behind his ear (a nervous idiosyncrasy he\u2019d absentmindedly inherited from his host body). \u201cThere are layers to me that you don\u2019t even know about, Liz,\u201d he chuckled warily. \u201cBut don\u2019t get me sidetracked! So basically I put on the earring for a second and <i>BLAM!</i> I\u2019m on the other side of the display cabinet, inside the woman\u2019s body and staring back at myself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly moly,\u201d Emma said, \u201cThat sounds so surreal, luv!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you get aroused by looking at yourself?\u201d Liz chimed in before Emma punched her in the shoulder. \u201cWhat?! I caught Courtney once writing one of those smut stories where this kind of sh*t happens! There\u2019s always a perv that gets turned on by themselves! Am I right, Steven?\u201d Steven blushed scarlet red once more. He cleared his throat brusquely and shook his head unconvincingly. \u201cNo, no way, pfft! Course not,\u201d he fibbed, \u201cThat\u2019s not the point of my story, alright! Let\u2019s just say I was very confused and these new female hormones were screwing up with my head!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore I could say anything the woman in my body strode over and dropped the other earring into my hand and left, just disappeared into the crowd, leaving me stranded with her body and these crappy bodyswapping pieces of junk!\u201d Steven threw the earrings across the room with surprisingly strong force, sending them whizzing alarmingly close to Liz\u2019s right ear. While Emma calmed him down, Liz ducked underneath her and Emma\u2019s shared desk and picked up the antique trinkets. She marvelled at the ornate design, golden leaf patterns and strange inscriptions etched into the jewel\u2019s surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful, Steven! These could cost a fortune!\u201d Liz snapped as she wiped off the dust that\u2019d rubbed onto it with her blouse. Steven scoffed. \u201cPlease, those things are useless now. I tried putting them back on but nothing happened. Guess I\u2019m stuck like this for the foreseeable future.\u201d As he sighed dejectedly, Liz and Emma looked at each other and shared a knowing grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you are, Steven,\u201d Emma chuckled softly. \u201cMaybe your new body and these weird artefacts are exactly what we need in order to show the area manager that we <i>are</i> diverse and we don\u2019t discriminate against employees according to age!\u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven seemed puzzled. \u201cWhat are you on about? Did you not hear that I\u2019m now <i>stuck</i> like this?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was on the same thought track as Emma and quickly replied, \u201cYes, we heard that Steven and, though we offer you our deepest condolences, maybe this can actually lead to more pros for the branch than cons! Listen, corporate are starting to get on our backs. Apparently our workforce looks a bit too fresh-faced in their eyes and they\u2019re worried that Rotherham\u2019s showing biases towards younger people in the selection process. These earrings,\u201d she said, lifting them in front of Steven\u2019s bespectacled eyes, \u201cMay just be exactly what we need to prove them wrong!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments of silence passed, no-one inside the room saying anything at all. Then suddenly Steven burst out howling, slapping his knees and snorting in a cute way that would\u2019ve sounded obnoxious back in his old body. He looked towards Liz and then onto Emma, both of their expressions rigid and stone-cold. \u201cC\u2019mon guys, you can\u2019t honestly expect me to say that\u2019s a good plan! Those stupid things don\u2019t even work anymore and when they did, they screwed me over! I\u2019ve still got my old crappy eyes right from before I swapped over! Even afterwards I must\u2019ve put those damn earrings on and taken them off a dozen times!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you didn\u2019t try it with someone else, did you? You might not be able to swap back to your old body anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven groaned as the realisation hit him. He trudged over to the desk and sat on the edge, splaying his legs out in a decidedly unladylike manner. \u201cEven if you were to try an idea as stupid as that,\u201d he whined, \u201cHow would you get anyone agree to give up their youth just for a stupid reason like this? There\u2019s only one pair of these things so you\u2019ll have to do all the swaps one at a time. It\u2019s not feasible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma giggled as she took the golden earrings from Liz and juggled them inside her palm. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry your pretty little head, Stevie,\u201d she laughed. \u201cI can be <i>very</i> persuasive when I want to be.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You didn't swap eyes and you got her accent.  Why didn't that woman you swapped with, accuse you of stealing her body?\" Steven shrugged.  \"I think we need to experiment.\" She opened the desk drawer and pulled out the notepad she usually carried when making her rounds.  \"I'll take notes.\"  She looked over at Liz. \"We'll need another person to swap with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz leaned over towards the PA intercom. \"Who did you have in mind Emma?\" She asked.  Emma smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I was thinking of you, luv.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" Liz asked somewhat surprised. \"What if I get stuck in Steven's body? What will Eric think when I tell him?\" She was worried about her husband's reaction.  Emma took another look at Steven's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I don't think he'd complain.\" She turned back to Liz. \"Do you?\"  Liz looked at Steven herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the boobs are a bit smaller but I don't think he'd have a problem with anything else on that body.\" She winked at Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven stood up. \"Who says I want to be in Liz's body?\" He asked Emma.  Before Emma could respond Liz butted in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with my body?  You'd still be younger than you were as a man.\" She poked one of his breasts with her finger. \"Just remember, I've got three years on you sunshine.\" Steven scowled at her silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Said Emma whilst clasping her hands, \"Now we've got that sorted out.  Lets see if we can reproduce what happened originally.\" She unclasped her hands and handed an earring to Steven. \"Put that on.\"  Steven put it in his ear.  She walked over to Liz who was taking her own earring out.  \"Okay Liz.  You know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed Liz the earring. Liz was about to put it on when Emma stopped her. \"Wait a second till I get my notepad.\"  She leaned over to grab it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up Emma, for some reason, I really, really want to put this on.\" Liz was having to use all her willpower to stop herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, just like Steven. Okay luv stop resisting.\" She started scribbling down notes.  Liz put the earring on and everything in the office went a little fuzzy for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz looked at her hand and saw the other earring but it wasn't actually her hand.  It was the hand of the young woman Steven had swapped with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz why did you just give Steven the earring?\" Emma asked while leaning over her pad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't, he did. We've swapped.\" Liz said with a slight Polish accent.  She looked at Steven again. \"And he's put his glasses on my head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma and Steven in Liz's body, looked at Liz somewhat confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't make sense.\" Emma said looking at both of them. \"You are still in your own body Liz. Steven is in the body he got earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it didn't work.  I'm still stuck as this woman with these huge tits.\" Steven said looking down at Liz's large breasts while grabbing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was getting frustrated. \"Those are my tits, I mean breasts.\" Emma shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz, luv we've worked together for years, I know what you look like.\"  Liz was about to tell her Emma she was wrong again when she worked out what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your memories have changed.\" Liz told them.  They both looked at her sceptically. \"When Steven swapped at the car boot sale.  That woman must have had her memories changed so she though Steven's body was her own.  That's why she didn't accuse him of stealing her body.\" Emma scratched her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which would mean, the person who put the earring on second remembers but the first person doesn't.\" Emma said thinking it out.  She leaned over and noted the discovery down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that doesn't make sense either.\" Steven said as he put his hand on his hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Asked Liz in the young sexy body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If the earrings change our memories, how come you didn't recognise me when I turned up in this body,\" he thought about it for a few seconds then pointed at Liz, \"that body I mean. This is bloody confusing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're telling me, I'm the only one that remembers it right.\" Liz said as she sat her body back on the desk. She kept her legs together unlike Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see what err, Steven is saying. Even though I find it hard to believe, that body was a stranger to us.\" Emma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see another problem.\" Liz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Emma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our ages. If people's memories change, then I imagine the records will too and I'll still be thirty eight.  It won't make any difference to the average age of the workers in the shop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were about twenty five?\" Steven asked Liz, convinced her current body was her original.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh the age goes with the body.  That does help then.\" Liz said. She turned to Emma. \"You better write that down Emma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma wrote that down. \"So how old are you Steven?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm forty one.  I don't know how old this body is probably about the same, maybe a bit older.\" He said as he examined the back of his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheeky bugger, I just told you it's thirty eight because that's what I was before we swapped.\" An annoyed Liz told him as she stood back up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma had the top of the pen in her mouth as she thought about it. \"Again Steven should think he's thirty eight but he still remembers being forty one.  There must be something else we're missing.\"  They all thought about it silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got it!\" Liz practically shouted.  She put both earrings on. Everything seemed to go fuzzy again. \"I remember Steven said he put the earrings on to try and change back.  Did it work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got my body now.  We must have swapped again.\"  He thought about it for a second moving his eyes from side to side. \"No we haven't, have we?\" Liz shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are just remembering the swap properly now.\" Liz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who is who?\" A confused Emma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Liz.\" Liz said from the young body. \"Your memories aren't affected any more.  I've swapped with Steven and you remember our original bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Steven has your body.  Okay so that's what happens when the second person puts on the earrings, so what happens when the first person puts them on?\"  Liz took off the earrings and handed them to Steven.  He put them in his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has anything happened?\" Steven asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that I can tell.\" Emma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither.\" Liz confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Typical.\" Steven said as he removed them. \"They never seemed to do anything when I wear them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on.\" Liz told him as she moved her sexy body towards him. \"We've cleared out everyone's false memories, so maybe it does something else if the first person wears them before the second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma nodded. \"You'll have to swap back to find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we can.\" Steven said somewhat dejectedly.  He handed Liz an earring.  She put it in her ear. \"Well here's hoping.\" Steven said as he put on the earring.  Everything went fuzzy.  Steven found the earring in his hand. He was back in his young sexy female twenty five year old body again.  His glasses were back on his nose. After the previous swap he knew he was the person with the correct memories.  He turned to Emma. \"Let me guess. You think we haven't swapped?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz?\" Emma asked. Steven shook his head. \"Steven.  That makes sense you were swapped before but now you must be back in your original bodies even if I remember that body as being Liz's\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Steven said. \"Liz was the first person to put on the earring, so she needs to put them on.\" He gave them to her and she put them on. Everything went fuzzy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just did what it did the last time.\" I remember I'm back in my original body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not.\" Emma told her. \"As far as I remember that is Steven's body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.  It only affects me.\" Said Liz as she handed the earrings back to Steven. \"Put them back on.\" Steven nodded.  He put them back on and once again everything went a little fuzzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, so you are back in your originally bodies?\" Emma asked.  Both Liz and Steven nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven said \"I can't believe I'm thinking of this as my original body.  I was a man.  It seems like such a distant memory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't be so melodramatic Steven.\" Liz told him as she rubbed his shoulder.  \"You're a pioneer.  The first of many people who'll be getting swapped around here shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma finished writing her notes. \"I think I've got it all worked out.  If one person each puts on an earring, they swap bodies mostly.  The eyes stay with the mind they belong to.  The first person to put on the earring and everyone else thinks there hasn't been a swap and their memories are adjusted.  The first person gives their earring to the second person but doesn't remember doing it.  The body's age seem to go with the body.  The mind seems to think it is the age of the body.  That could get weird if there is a big age difference.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to help us massively with the staffing issue though.\" Liz interjected.  Emma nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only the second person is unaffected by the change in memory.  If the first person puts on both earrings they are the only person made aware of the swap.  If the second person puts on both then everyone becomes aware.  I think that's about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what?\" Steven  asked Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,  you are going to get changed into a company uniform.  Don't think swapping bodies is going to allow you to get away with skiving off work.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liz disappeared out the office with Steven, leaving Emma on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally she'd be back on her computer. Right now she was far too excited to play Solitaire.  She wanted to make use of the earrings but she wasn't sure how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided she needed a brief distraction and chose to touch up her make up.  She opened her desk drawer and pulled out the vanity mirror she kept in there.  As she applied the make up, she looked at her face.  She didn't think of herself as old yet but she knew she wasn't young any more.  She looked at the crows feet at the corners of her eyes and the few wrinkles around her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran her fingers through her dark hair.  She had to dye it more regularly now to stop the grey creeping through. She thought about how much longer it took to get over an illness or a hangover for that matter.  Emma suspected she had started to go through the early stages of the menopause, having the occasional hot flush.  She felt like time was slowly catching up with her.  \"It would be great to be a young again.\" She said out loud to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wicked idea suddenly popped into her head.  She put the mirror away.  Emma pulled out her mobile phone and called her daughter Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was currently at home in the living room, sitting on the sofa, watching television and eating her breakfast.  Her phone began ringing. \"Hi mum.  What's up?\" She asked as she answered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if you could pop by work luv.  I may have a lead on a job for you.\"  Alice was currently 'looking' for a temporary summer job before starting university. She yawned in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll be there in couple of hours.\" She said sleepily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you need to come as soon as possible.  The interview is today.  I just found out about it.\" Emma lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should wear that outfit I got you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the mini-me one?\"  She laughed at the derisory term she used for the outfit that resembled her mother's work clothes.  It consisted of black trousers and a white blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's professional.\" Emma insisted.  Maybe it was a step too far she thought.  She was starting to have doubts about this plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly trendy though.  I'm kind of in the middle of something right now anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you can afford to miss an episode of This Morning.\" Emma told her referring to the daytime talk show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Homes Under the Hammer actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma sighed.  \"The point is you're wasting your whole day away doing nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just gone ten o'clock.  That's hardly the whole day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I've been up since seven.\" Emma really didn't want to get angry with her. The poor girl was just relaxing after finishing school.  She couldn't blame her for that.  Emma was starting to reconsider her whole plan. She calmed herself down. \"There's more to life to sitting in your PJs, watching daytime TV and eating cornflakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not,\" Alice insisted, \"it's Weetabix.\"  This instantly angered Emma again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know the Weetabix is mine.\"  Emma was annoyed by the cheek of the girl, stealing it.  This decided it for Emma.  Her plan was going ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fancied a change.\" <i>Me as well</i>, Emma thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you got a job you could buy your own bloody Weetabix.\" Emma told her in the well established tone of a parent.  Alice mimicked her nagging silently.  \"And stop making faces.\" She told her after using her parental telepathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mum.\" Alice said with only the slightest hint of sarcasm. \"I'll get the bus, should be there in about an hour or so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is urgent. Get a taxi and wear the outfit.\" Emma changed to a sweet tone. \"See you soon, luv you.\" She hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice stepped into the manager's office just under an hour later.  Emma who had been waiting impatiently, closed her computer and stood up to talk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Honey.\" Emma said in a friendly manner as she looked at Alice in her business suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope this job is worth it.  I feel silly in these clothes.\" Alice told her as she looked at their nearly identical outfits.  Emma frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad news I'm afraid.  They already hired someone.  One of their temps it seems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great. All this effort for nothing.\" Alice said as she put down her hand bag on the desk. \"You could have phoned.  Where was it for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma thought of something on the spot. \"Our store in Barnsley.\"  Emma said in that unique way all people from Yorkshire say Barnsley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like I dodged a bullet. I'm glad I'm not going to Barnsley every day. Well, if I hurry back I might catch Bargain Hunt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Don't run off.\" Emma said pulling out the earrings.  \"I picked these up today.  They are antiques.  I thought you could tell me what you thought.\" She handed one to Alice. She looked at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are kind of pretty,  I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Model it for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My piercings have sealed up.  I need them redone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know luv.  I think these earrings have a special attachment.  Just try please.\" Emma insisted.  Alice shrugged with her eyebrows and put the earring to her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow. It does attach.\"  Emma instantly felt the compulsion to put on the other earring.  She didn't resist.  Everything went fuzzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma looked down and saw the other earring in her hand.  She looked up and found herself facing herself.  It was such a strange sensation she could barely keep a straight face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny, mum?\" Alice asked in Emma's middle-aged voice. She picked up her own handbag.  Emma noticed, finding it interesting that the hand bag's ownership didn't swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\" She lied, in her new voice.  She grabbed her own handbag and pulled out her purse.  She noticed Alice's nails were unvarnished.  She reached in and pulled out a twenty pound note.  \"This is for your taxis.  Get yourself some lunch with change.\"  Alice took the note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks mum.\" Alice responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma sat down behind the desk and opened her computer.  She looked up. \"I'll see you later.\" She returned to looking at her computer indicating that the conversation was over.  Alice turned round and walked out closing the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma leaned back on her seat, in her new young body and smiled. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She pulled her mirror out her drawer again.  She spent several minutes examining her new face.  She was familiar with it of course but she'd never seen it from this angle before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noted Alice's facial resemblance to her own.  It seemed even more noticeable now.  Many family members had commented on how much Alice looked like a younger version of her mother.  In fact she clearly remembered someone using the word clone as a joke.  That suited Emma just fine.  If you were to get a younger body and you were generally happy with your looks surely you'd want some familiarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found it quite difficult to tell if she had her original eyes.  Like her facial features Alice's eye colour was similar to Emma's.  On closer inspection though, she was fairly sure she had kept the originals.  They just looked 'older'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spent quite a bit of time making faces in the mirror.  She finished by pursing her lips several times and giggling each time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put the mirror down and ran her fingers through her hair.  It felt silkier than her own.  Emma was also aware it hadn't been damaged by years of dye treatment.  In fact she couldn't remember Alice ever dying it.  She didn't like her hair down though, especially when she was working.  She reached into the drawer and pulled out her spare scrunchy.  She quickly styled the hair into a pony tail. \"Much better.\" She said to nobody again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she put the mirror back in the drawer, she spotted her handbag.  As that hadn't swapped with Alice she was curious about the contents.  She opened it.  It seemed to be all her own stuff.  She opened her purse and pulled out her driving licence.  There on the pink piece of plastic was a photo of Alice with Emma's name next to it.  She looked at the Date of Birth.  It was the same as Alice's.  As far as the world knew Emma was a few weeks shy of her eighteenth birthday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was even more surprised when she saw the date the licence was issued.  It was eight years ago.  \"How the hell does that work?\" Emma asked out loud.  She wondered how a nine year old girl got a driving licence.  It seemed the earrings could change more than just memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put the licence away.  She knew she had to investigate the age thing more but for now she wanted to inspect the rest of her body.  She pulled out the chair and stood up.  She would have preferred a full length mirror but she could kind of see a reflection in the office window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't mind posing in front of it.  The old Tesco across the river had been demolished a few years ago.  All that was visible was the Wilko store roof.  She couldn't resist the urge to feel her own breasts.  She cupped them in her hands.  She was a little disappointed Alice's seemed a little smaller than her own.  She wasn't complaining though, she'd gained thirty years in age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she moved around she felt a different sensation.  It felt like her underwear was digging into her ass crack.  She slipped her fingers down to free the rogue knickers when she suddenly stopped.  \"Am I wearing a thong?\" She asked out loud after feeling the fabric. She had to see.  She quickly pulled her hand out and unfastened the trousers letting them drop to her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did indeed reveal a very skimpy teal coloured thong underneath them.  She couldn't recall ever seeing thongs in Alice's laundry.  She would have had something to say about it, if she had.  That wasn't her only surprise.  There on her hip just below her non-existent waistband was a tattoo.  It was a small red heart.  \"When the hell did she get that?\" She asked both amazed and annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as she felt she had a certain level of control in Alice's life, she was quickly learning there was a lot more going on than she was aware of.  She slowly pulled the trousers back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished fastening them, just as Liz walked in the door Emma had forgotten to lock.  She silently cursed herself for getting distracted by the contents of her trousers.  She put it out of her mind for now and returned to manager mode.  \"You all right Emma?\" Liz asked as she fiddled with the printer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes.  How are you getting on with Steven?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Stefania now.  I came up to print his, I mean her, name badge.\" She said as she loaded the name badge blank into the printer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you get her sorted out with a new uniform?\" Emma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eventually,\" Liz sighed.  \"She is a total diva.  She didn't like any of the underwear I got her.  Reckoned the bras chaffed her too much.  My bras chafe too but you don't hear me complaining about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is what happens when a man is in a woman's body.  They complain about all the stuff we take for granted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Liz said as she opened the badge template on her computer.  \"Anyway she ended up dressed.  Our uniforms aren't designed for ladies with his proportions.  He's quite the sight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can imagine. So how are you explaining our new staff member?\" Emma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we're telling everyone Steven has gone on a course.  We're going to say Stefania's a trainee assistant supervisor who is getting sent to a different store.\" Liz explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not Parkgate or Meadowhall?\" A worried Emma asked, referring to the two nearby stores in the out-of-town shopping centres.  \"The staff know loads of people from there.  They'll find out.\" Liz shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't panic.  Barnsley.\"  She said as the badge started printing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma sighed with relief.  \"Thank goodness.  Our staff wouldn't know anyone from there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who would want to?\" Liz asked rhetorically with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma was amazed that she could chat to Liz in Alice's body like normal and she was completely unaware.  She was quickly getting used to experiencing a swap first hand.  She decided to put the memory alteration to the test.  \"How many years have we worked together now Liz?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz had a thoughtful look on her face as she stood up.  \"What's it been? Three or four years since you started here.\" She said as she walked over to the printer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma nodded.  \"Yeah four years I think.  I was pretty young back then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure were.  I remember you could barely fill a bra when you started.\" She said laughing.  Emma remembered Alice had been fairly flat chested till she got a growth spurt about three years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still drove to work though, right?\" Emma asked.  Liz stopped and stared at her. Liz eyed her manager suspiciously.  \"Of course.\" She said slowly.  Emma nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've used them, haven't you?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The earrings, you've used them.  Standing there grinning and asking me strange questions.\"  Liz correctly deduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\" Emma said grinning even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it.  Oh my God, did you swap with me?  Is that my body?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would say that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz, you're being paranoid love.\" Emma reassured her.  Liz still unconsciously stood away from her. \"Look I'll prove it.\" Emma picked up the earrings and handed them to Liz. \"Put these on and you'll know.\"  Liz slipped them on her ears and the room went fuzzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Are you telling me I saw her in your body?\" Liz asked.  Emma nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should still see me as Emma though.  We didn't swap, so how come the earrings are making you see the truth?\" Emma asked a little confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we assumed a few things when we were doing the experiments with Stefania.  It looks like anyone who wears the earrings sees the truth.  The only person it seems to make a difference with, is the person who put on the second earring.  They cancel it out for everyone.\"  Liz deduced from what she'd seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll have to take more care with who gets to wear them after a swap.\" Emma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you swap with Alice anyway?\"  Liz wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are expecting the staff to swap for the good of the store.  I wouldn't expect them to do anything I wasn't prepared to do myself.\" Emma said like a General talking about their troops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you pick someone from the store? Is what I meant Emma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well err, I thought it made sense to swap with a family member first.  I thought it would be easier. This way I don't have to be an interloper in a family of strangers.  I wouldn't have to locate the other person's house either.\"  Emma felt she'd covered up her own selfish motivations pretty well with her explanation.  She certainly wasn't going to mention the stolen Weetabix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded but still felt a bit cynical about Emma swapping with her teenage daughter.  \"So you aren't planning on swapping out before the end of shift then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to call her in here again today.  The last thing I want is for her to get suspicious.  I can do it when I get home.\"  She could see Liz wasn't convinced.  \"It's been a learning experience too. I've already found out...\" She paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Liz asked now curious. Emma lowered her voice and leaned closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice has got a tattoo.\" She leaned back and made a 'what do you think of that?' expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was a little surprised.  \"She's managed to keep that hidden from you?\"  Emma nodded.  \"Is it a boy's name or something juicy like that?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a heart on her hip, it must be nearly an inch across.\" Emma said trying to impress her assistant manager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's hardly anything these days.  Courtney's got a fire breathing dragon right across her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I don't need to know.\"  After Liz's revelation, Emma considered she was a bit more out of touch with young people than she liked to admit.  \"That's the only one I've found so far anyway.\" She was feeling a little jealous now that she knew tattoos were commonplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, you are going to check? Don't you think that's, you know, a bit of an invasion of privacy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Changed days luv.  Do you think Stefania cares about the privacy of the body she's in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you're right. If someone's mind is in it, realistically the body belongs to them.\" Emma was pleased, Liz had came round to her way of thinking.  \"Speaking of you and Stefania, I thought the whole point of this was to increase the age of our staff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Emma could see where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have forty members of staff here.  You've lost, what thirty years,\" Emma nodded, \"and Stefania has lost about fifteen.  That's forty five years roughly. Between the pair of you, you've managed to knock the average of the staff down by over a year.  We are going in the wrong direction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, aiming to go work for corporate one day Liz?\" Emma asked sarcastically.  \"You sure seem bothered by following their directives to the letter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just don't want us to get into any more bother from them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a manager I probably don't count and even if I do, I'm going to class this,\" she pointed at her body with both hands, \"as a managerial perk.\"  She could see the looks Liz was giving her.  \"We'll get it sorted out eventually.  Don't get you knickers in a twist luv.\"  Emma said as she sat back down at her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  I'm getting cold feet about all this now.\" Liz said worried about the way it was effecting Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should try it.  Swap with Courtney.  At least you'll be doing something productive with her body. Look at Alice, if I hadn't swapped with her she'd be wasting her days away watching TV and stealing my Weetabix.  Now her body is actually doing something constructive with its youth.\" Emma said as she started up Solitaire on the computer.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once she was sure Liz was away, Emma closed her computer down.  She opened the drawer again to grab her vanity mirror.  \"You know I really should check this body for any more hidden surprises.\" She said to herself.  She twisted her head in the other direction.  \"That sure sounds like a good idea Emma.\"  She giggled as she stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Emma there was a small bathroom attached to the manager's office.  The managers weren't expected to use the regular toilets.  It was yet another symbol of the 'them and us' mentality of employers when it came to staff, in many large workplaces throughout the nation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a managerial perk though, it wasn't particularly impressive. It was tidy enough, John cleaned it personally, not that it required much cleaning as it was only used by two people in a shop with forty workers.  It was pretty small though.   It's contents were unimpressive, there was just a toilet and a hand basin with a mirror above it.  It was usually illuminated by a small skylight covered in bird droppings.  Luckily someone had the good sense to install an extractor fan near the skylight, so nasty aromas weren't an issue in the manager's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma looked into the tiny dingy room.  She would never describe it as impressive but it was just about suitable for what she had in mind.  She shut the door and locked it with a well worn snib.  After putting the vanity mirror on the toilet cistern, she started undoing the buttons on her blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her way down the stairs Liz started to reconsider Emma's suggestion.  She originally hadn't been keen on the idea of swapping with Courtney.  It certainly wouldn't help with the staffing issue but why shouldn't she get herself a younger body too?  It wasn't as big an age change for her either. Just fifteen years rather than thirty.   The apparent issues Emma had with the generation gap wouldn't be as big a problem for her. The pros seem to add up in Liz's mind while the cons were rationalised away.  She giggled at the thought of going all the way with the swap. Let Courtney be the one to deal with looking after her little brother.  Liz would be free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was interrupted when she reached the bottom of the stairs.  She could see a figure skulking in the shadows in a dark corner of the corridor.  Liz mentally reminded herself to mention the broken light bulb to John yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting her eyes adjust to the darker area she could make out the silhouette of the skulker.  Actually it was pretty easy to recognise.  \"Stefania what are you doing?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know it was me?\" Stefania asked back, stepping out of the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" Liz asked as she glanced at Stefania's breasts.  Stefania just stared back.  \"Apart from me you've got the biggest boobs in the store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I see.\" She seemed a little distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And those nipples should come with a government warning.  If Health and Safety saw them, they'd shut the store down or make us fit warning lights.\" Liz joked.  Stefania stared off into space not responding.  \"So anyway, what you doing out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just taking a breather.  Everything has been a bit, intense.\"  She told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The shop busy?\" Liz asked.  Stefania shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's just the guys have been keeping me really, occupied.\"  She looked Liz in the eyes.  \"You know normally I can go a whole shift and nobody will come up to me.  Usually I have to go chasing people.  Today, I can barely turn around without one of the blokes being in my face with a price query or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Liz asked pretending to be concerned but actually completely unsurprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once I tell them what they need to know, then they start asking me other questions that aren't work related.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing inappropriate I hope.\" Liz asked.  Stefania shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  Stuff like, do I have a boyfriend?  Do I have plans for the weekend?  Do I prefer tall guys or short ones?  Stupid stuff like that.\"  Liz kept nodding sympathetically.  \"They've been complimenting me too.  They keep saying things like, I'm the best supervisor they've ever had, I'm very understanding or telling me they like my uniform.   They seem to get in my personal space more than they normally would too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz couldn't believe Steven had got through forty one years of life with this level of naivety when it came to men's motives.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately it goes with being a woman.  It shouldn't but it does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really want to be a guy again.  I need to track down my body or swap with another guy as soon as I can.\" Stefania's eyes were nearly tearing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patience, Stefania.  I'm sure you can handle being female for a couple of days.  I've managed it for nearly forty years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm worried Liz, I'm worried I'm going to start liking the attention.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma was currently naked in the small toilet.  She had decided to strip completely down.  This included her shoes and knee high pop socks.  Her blouse and trousers hung on the hook on the back of the door.  Her matching teal, thong and bra sat on the cistern.  The tag on the bra had informed Emma she was now a B-cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was bent over in an unusual position looking into the vanity mirror.  She was trying to look at her back and bum in the reflection of the mirror above the hand basin.  She carefully angled the mirror to see different parts of her body.  Eventually she put her tired arms down. Her extensive examination had failed to find any other tattoos on Alice's body. After what Liz had told her earlier about their popularity, she was somewhat disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only other major surprise was her bush, or the lack of one.  She was completely shaved.  This made perfect sense considering Alice's apparent fondness for thongs.  This was a new experience for Emma, she'd never been shaved or waxed bald before.  She turned round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wash basin mirror was surprisingly large.  She could actually see a good amount of her naked body.  Emma was actually becoming quite fond of the smaller breasts and nipples.  She rubbed her hands and down her bare arms feeling the soft supple skin.  She looked at her unpainted nails again.  A trip to Beautylicious was definitely required.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to look at Alice's pale alabaster skin.   There seemed to be masses of it.  A blank canvas almost.  She fantasised about getting a tattoo herself.  She immediately felt her pulse raise.  She could hear the blood from her young heart pumping through her ears.  She felt herself tingle all over.  Her pussy seemed to be drawing her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned cheekily at herself as her reflected hand moved downwards and disappeared out of view in the hand basin mirror.  \"Oh I'm soooo naughty.\" Emma said in her sexiest voice.  \"Mmmm....\" Her fingers made contact with the moist folds of skin.  She closed her eyes.  \"Mmmm.... On company time too.\"</span></div></div>",

It did cross Liz's mind that maybe she had been a bit hasty expecting Steven to adapt quite so quickly.  He was genuinely struggling with all the male attention.   His ego seemed surprisingly fragile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz excused herself to go into the corridor.  After all the soul searching, she was determined to get Courtney's body today.  She called her on her mobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Liz.\" Courtney said.  Liz could hear the sound of traffic in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Been shopping all day.  I'm in town right now.\"  Courtney informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what did you buy?\" Liz asked, genuinely curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, I'm skint.\" She said some what unhappily.  Courtney had been looking for an excuse to get out the house and window shopping was the best idea she could come up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you far away from my shop?\" Liz asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not too far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you can swing by.  I need to talk to you about something.\"  There was a pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I was crossing the road.\" Courtney said. \"Can't it wait? We'll both be home in a couple of hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it needs dealing with now.\"  Liz said, becoming insistent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you don't want dad to know then?\"  It was a logically conclusion for Courtney to come to.  Liz didn't want Eric to know but she really hadn't thought about that part when she contacted Courtney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just come by the shop.  I'll explain everything then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later Courtney entered the store.  Liz met her just inside the main door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz had planned on doing the swap in the manager's office.  When she went up to retrieve the earrings she'd heard sexual moaning from the toilet.  She left a quick note for Emma while she was there. She'd explained she'd taken the earrings.  Liz left the office as quickly as possible, not wishing to hear Emma's squeals of self gratification any longer than necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz needed to find somewhere else reasonably private, quickly.  The logical choice was the break room.  Stefania was in there of course but she knew about the earrings so Liz didn't think that would be an issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Courtney.\" Stefania said, automatically as her and Liz walked in.  The Polish beauty immediately blushed with embarrassment as she remembered she wasn't supposed to know her.   She had messed up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I know you?\" Courtney asked a little surprised.  Stefania couldn't use the name badge excuse this time.  She just looked at her blankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of.\" Stefania admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's part of the reason I brought you here.\" Liz told her step-daughter.  \"Sit down please.\" A confused Courtney pulled out a chair and sat down.  Liz put the earrings on the table. Liz took a deep breath. \"Now Courtney the reason I asked you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Code three hundred! Code three hundred!\" Natalie's loud voice came out the PA intercom speaker, interrupting Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Liz said.  Natalie was requesting a manager urgently.  She hoped Emma would deal with it but given what Liz had heard earlier she doubted it very much.  She waited a few seconds.  Nothing happened. \"As I was saying...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Code three hundred! Code three hundred!\"  Natalie's voice was practically screaming into the microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, don't go anywhere.  I'll be right back.\"  Liz said to Courtney who was also aware of the code meant.  She nodded towards her step-mother.  Liz shot off out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney turned to face Stefania and the two women smiled awkwardly at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried phoning Emma first,\" Natalie said, \"but there was no answer.\" Her and Liz were near the front of the store surveying the damage.  A car had mounted the pavement and hit one of the large windows at that faced the street.  The window had stopped the car but had become badly cracked in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an ambulance and police car outside.  There was also a small crowd of onlookers.  \"Nobody was hurt, were they?\" Liz asked.  Natalie shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, the driver is getting checked though.\"  Liz sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We only just fixed that window last year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes later Liz was heading back to the break room.  She had popped back to the office to phone the emergency glazier and contact head office about the accident.   Emma was still locked in the toilet.  While Liz was on the phone there was no sounds coming from the small room.  She began to wonder if Emma had fell asleep in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was getting ready to leave when the moaning started again.  She wondered where Emma got the stamina from. Even in Alice's much younger body she'd been at it for several hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Liz approached the break room she could hear the two young women talking and laughing.  She was happy they had been keeping each other company.  Upon entering she could see them sitting on both sides of a table.  Stefania's glasses sat on the middle of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that. We had a bit of an emergency. As I was saying,\" Liz looked at the two women who were both smiling at her, \"what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz,\" Stefania said, \"guess what?  We've swapped bodies.\" She pointed at Courtney.  Liz looked at them both a little confused.  It was then she noticed the earrings in Courtney's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true.\" Courtney said.  She picked up the large glasses and put them on her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStefania's body spoke again.  \"This is so cool.\" She was beaming.  \"I'm hot now!\" Courtney's body nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to be so much better for me too.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStefania had unintentionally stolen Liz's new body from right under her nose.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Liz thought about what she wanted to say. Did she actually want to admit, she had planned on taking Courtney's body for herself? Courtney might be upset with her but that was a pretty common situation.  It had been worse when she was younger, with Liz being the 'evil' step-mother.  It had got better as Courtney matured but she still had her moments.  \"I thought that's what you had in mind when you brought Courtney here.  When you brought the earrings, I was certain of it.  I took it upon myself to explain the earrings, she was sceptical at first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney stepped into the conversation. \"He got me to ask questions only he'd know the answer to.   He answered them all correctly.  The thought of this hot body being mine was a no brainer to me, so we swapped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz put her hand over her mouth.  Steven actually believed Liz had brought Courtney here for him to do a swap with.  Steven continued talking to Liz.  \"You knew I was struggling being in that body.\"  He pointed at Courtney in Stefania's body.  \"This was amazingly kind of you Liz. You are such a thoughtful person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Courtney agreed, \"I'm glad you thought of giving me this body before anyone else.  It's really sexy.  Have you heard this accent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well just doing my bit.\" Liz lied with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank goodness.\" Steven said. \"I had started to worry I'd made some sort of mistake.  We should really have talked about it with you first.\"  Liz silently cursed him.  She had expected him to sit there quietly till she got back.  Why did he have to show some initiative for once, totally spoiling her plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had planned to discuss it beforehand, you know, explore,\" Liz paused,  \"the possibilities,\" she took a deep breath,\"the consequences...\"  She noticed Courtney was wearing the badly fitting polo she'd gave Stefania.  \"You reset the awareness?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven nodded.  \"Yeah I didn't really fancy the prospect of going home to an empty house.   You've been so helpful about my sudden change.  If I start to struggle again, it will be comforting to know we'll be under the same roof at home.  Knowing me,  I'll be around you so much, I'll be like your shadow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\" Liz said without emotion.  Normally, Courtney and her didn't interact much.  Now Steven was going to be hovering around her at home.  It would be a constant reminder of the swap that could have been.  She didn't want to dwell on it too much. She turned to Courtney.  \"You realise now the awareness has been reset, everyone will think you're Stefania.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suits me.  Steven was telling me he'd made a big hit with the fellas in here.  I could do with the pay too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you can handle the job?\" Liz asked.  She was a bit concerned that it could be too much for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've worked for the company before.  I know the procedures.  I know the job.\" She had been a temp for four months in the run up to Christmas last year.  \"I was assisting the staff supervisor directly in the Barnsley store.\" She reminded Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded. \"I remember, I don't think you've ever fully recovered.\"  Courtney rolled Stefania's eyes. \"I'll have to discuss it with Emma,\" she doubted Emma would ever get out the bathroom before the end of the shift, \"at some point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven removed the earrings and handed them back to Liz.  She was still desperately trying to think of a way to repair this mess.  She could swap with Courtney. Stefania was indeed hot but part of her motivation was getting more normal sized breasts.  That certainly would not happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could take the direct route and swap with Steven.  She would get Courtney's body which was her original goal.  Unfortunately, that would leave Steven in her body.  Knowing how unlucky he was, that would probably end in disaster.  If it did, the last place she wanted Steven to be was in her body.  Her thoughts were interrupted by Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz, I was wondering...\"  He looked a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" The distracted Liz asked.  He seemed to squirm a little in his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would it be all right if I called you 'mum'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma looked around the small bathroom.  Had she passed out?  She looked down.  She was naked and leaning back on the toilet.  Her legs were spread wide in a very unladylike fashion.  One hand sat on her thigh, the other on her very wet pussy.  She moved her hand, her lips and clit looked red raw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly put her legs together.  They were feeling stiff.  She pushed her arms out and braced herself on the wall.  It took a massive effort on her part but she managed to get on to her feet.  She unsteadily stepped towards the mirror.   The figure in the reflection was barely recognisable.  A combination of sweat and tears had caused all her make up to run down Alice's face.  Her skin was still sweaty.   There was a dried trail of saliva that had clearly run down her chin and on to her neck.  Much of her hair was sticking to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer nipples and breasts were no longer pale, they were red like her pussy.  In a strange way it looked kind of sexy, like a young woman who had been screwing for hours.  She felt a tingle deep in her groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Emma almost shouted at her reflection.  Her vocal chords strained to speak after all the moaning she'd been doing.  She had heard Liz talking in the office earlier.  She had bit her finger to stop herself moaning as she came over and over.  Thinking about it was setting her off again.  \"Get a grip Emma.  Actually don't get a grip luv, that's how I ended up in this state.\"  She picked up her watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\" She exclaimed when she saw it was after four.  \"I need to get cleaned up.\"  She knew with the limited facilities available it would be no easy task.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Emma filled the basin with the warmest lukewarm water the shop's crappy heating system could provide.  She tried to wash herself as best she could.  It wasn't easy, given how stiff and sore she was.   Luckily she'd had the common sense to remove all her clothing before starting on her marathon masturbation session.  This meant they were reasonably clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put on Alice's skimpy underwear and had a good long look at herself in the mirror.   Pulling herself away she put on the rest of the clothes.  She decided to leave the top few buttons of her blouse undone.  That is something she would never have done in her own body.   She liked to dress conservatively but Emma decided to show off Alice's body a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe re-applied the make up, using her own colours and shades.  Finally she grabbed the scrunchy and put her hair back in the ponytail.  She smiled at her reflection.  She actually looked quite presentable but she still decided, she was still going to have a long hot bath when she got home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe unbolted the door and stepped out.   There was no sign of Liz.  There were however a large number of post-it notes stuck to Emma's laptop.   They all appeared to be in Liz's hand writing, she put them all in a bundle in her hand.  She sat down to read them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Courtney here, took earrings.</i>\" She read out loud.  \"You did take my advice.\" She said with a grin. She discarded the note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Contacted Head Office.  They'll say they'll contact insurers.</i>\" A confused Emma read.  \"What the hell happened?\" She quickly flicked through the post-its till she got to the one about the window being broken.  \"What again? We just fixed that.\"  She sighed with relief that it was nothing more serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz came storming into the office.  Her body language clearly betrayed that fact she was angry.  Emma being at her desk caught her by surprise.  \"Oh, you're back.\" She observed while calming down a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, looks like you've been quite busy.\" She said pointing at the post-it notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh, it's all dealt with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry luv.  I did get a bit carried away.\"  Emma felt a little guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bit? It's been nearly half the shift.\" An angry Liz spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I knew I could count of you to look after the place.  You're the best assistant manager anyone could ask for.  I don't tell you that often enough.\"  The compliment took the wind out of Liz's sails somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well...\" She looked down at her hands.  The earrings were in them.  \"I was bringing these back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, did you swap?\" An excited Emma asked.  \"You still look like you. I wouldn't know anyway.\"  Liz shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's still me.  I had planned on swapping with Courtney but Steven beat me to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz went on to explain what had happened earlier.  How Steven had swapped bodies with her step-daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The cheek of it.\" Emma said.  \"He hadn't even been in that body five minutes and already he's swapped out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I've got to live with him too.\" Liz said shaking her head.  She wasn't looking forward to that all.  Although Steven generally acted civilly around others, he was unattached for good reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he gets out of working here.  The lazy bugger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least Courtney will be keeping his pay.\"  Liz said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to do now?\" Emma asked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They are briefing each other in the break room right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma picked the earrings up and spun round, facing the large office safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Emma could open it. Liz asked \"Aren't you going to use the earrings later?\"  Emma was still in Alice's body.  She slowly spun back round.  Her face was a crimson colour.  \"No.\" She admitted.  \"I wanted to see how it changed my clothes, personal belongings and things like that.  I'm quite curious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but you'll be sharing a bed with Kyle, in that body.\" Liz said, pointing at her. \"I guess he won't know of course, but still.  That's Alice's body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I deserve this.  I sacrificed a lot for her.\"  She couldn't think of a specific example at that exact moment.  She was sure there were plenty of times she'd given up something in life for Alice's benefit.  Weetabix popped into her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but won't,\" Liz made a circle with her index finger and thumb.  She took her other index finger and pushed it in and out of the circle.  It was a commonly used crude gesture indicating sex,  \"be an issue?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma looked shocked and disgusted.  \"I don't think so.  I'll be having a headache tonight.  Kyle is used to them.\" She spun back round and opened the safe.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe safe was ancient, older than any staff member currently in the store.  It was far too big for the cramped office. At one time it had held many valuables, important documents, pay packets, customer cheques and the like. The march of technology had made it largely redundant.  All that it was used for now was the small cash floats for the tills. It was so huge and cumbersome, it would cost too much to replace it with a smaller one. It remained as a monument to the businesses of the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some unknown reason the office lights flickered slightly as the heavy door creaked open.   A musty smell came from inside. The open safe seemed to absorb light and little could be seen past the front of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never appreciated how creepy that safe is.\"  Liz told Emma as she picked up the earrings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a safe,\" Emma said as she reached inside,\" there is nothing creepy... ...Aaahhh!\"  Emma screamed.  \"Something's got my arm,\" Emma fell out of her chair.  It looked like she was being pulled into the cavernous depths of the safe.  Liz ran round the desk to help Emma her large breasts bouncing as she went.  She wasn't entirely sure what she could do to help.  Emma was trying to shake off, whatever had grabbed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Emma stopped moving.  Her panicked expression changed to a smile as she leaned back against her chair and began laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny.\" Liz said completely unimpressed.  She figured with the bodyswap Emma had got a more immature sense of humour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised her hands beside her head.  \"Oh, help me Liz, the big scary monster that hides in the safe is going to eat me up.\" Emma said sarcastically as she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay I get it.  I'm a worrier.\"  Several small bags had fell out of the safe as Emma had flopped about.  She picked them up and threw them back inside. \"What are in those?\"  Emma shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea.  I really should do an inventory one day.\" Emma said as she got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we can get you to quit solitaire,\" Emma didn't respond, \"or playing with yourself.\" She mumbled under her breath as the safe door clanged shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Emma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, nothing.  I just noticed the time.\" Liz said as she looked at the clock.  The shop had shut ten minutes earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz could see Steven already sitting in the passenger seat of her car as she walked off the footbridge, that led to the car park.   He had his seatbelt on and looked like he was ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was practically bouncing up and down as Liz got into the car.  His glasses nearly fell of his face.  \"This is so exciting.\" He said as he barely contained himself in Courtney's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're like a big kid.\"  Liz pulled on her own seatbelt. \"Courtney is twenty two, not twelve.  You are even older.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know mum, it's just I'm happy to not be Stefania any more.\"  Liz cringed at him calling her mum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just the two of us, you can still call me Liz.\" She started the engine.  \"Courtney calls me Liz anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww!\" Steven pouted.  \"You said I could.\"  Liz looked down at the body that should have been hers by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed.  \"Just don't say it too much.\" She warned him as she drove out the car park.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had certainly been an interesting evening for Liz.   She trusted Steven enough to let him keep an eye on Ethan, after the babysitter had left.  It was something the real Courtney would normally do while Liz got changed and made dinner for the family.  Actually most days a babysitter wasn't required, Courtney would collect him from school and look after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was considered part of her contribution to the household for her accommodation. She wasn't working and couldn't contribute financially.   She was permitted the odd day off and today just happened to be one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz popped her head into the living room to find both of them watching television which was fairly typical behaviour for Courtney.  The only difference was Steven seemed genuinely interested in the television show.  Courtney would generally have her head stuck in her phone while she 'looked after' her little brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Eric got in from work, Steven did a good job at pretending to be Courtney.  Actually a slightly better job as he asked about his day.  Normally Courtney would do little more than grunt an acknowledgement when he got in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring dinner, Steven handled the conversation well.  Eric hardly noticed anything amiss.  Liz did have to prompt him a few times in the conversation when he got stuck.  Every time he called her 'mum', Eric secretly glanced at Liz with a smile.  Liz returned Eric's looks with one of surprise, like she had no idea about why Courtney was calling her that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner Steven helped with the dishes which was more than Courtney usually offered to do.  Afterwards Steven also joined 'her' dad and step-mum in the living room.  This was extremely out of character for Courtney.  Steven even engaged in the various discussions.  Liz considered this out of character for Steven too, who was normally quite quiet and introverted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz still felt the whole situation was bizarre with this infiltrator pretending to be a family member.  He wasn't exactly a stranger though. Liz and Steven spoke to each other most days.  It was Liz herself who had talked Steven into becoming the assistant supervisor.  She wouldn't do that for a stranger.  They had known each other a long time, over ten years at Wilkos.  Liz had in fact known him much longer than Eric and Courtney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think she's after?\" Eric asked his wife, when Steven went to the bathroom.  Liz had been watching the television and turned to her husband sitting beside her on the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think she's up to something?\" Liz asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at how helpful she's been and she keeps calling you 'mum'.\" Eric couldn't help but laugh.  \"She's buttering us up for some reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she's just becoming a bit more mature, putting all the uncaring step-mother nonsense behind her.\"  Liz thought she managed to sound plausible.  Eric gave her a sceptical shrug.  Their conversation was cut short by Steven's return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Eric took Ethan up the stairs to bed, Liz took the opportunity to speak to Steven.  \"What do you think you are playing at?\" She asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being nice, respectful and actually talking to me and Eric like human beings.\"  Liz stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's a bad thing?\" A confused Steven asked.  Liz hadn't intended for it to come out like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, obviously but what I meant was, it's not how Courtney acts.\" She quickly corrected herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't I be a little more like myself?  Is that so terrible?\"  Liz didn't really see much of Steven either but let it slide for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course but gradually.  You can't go from grouchy, distant twenty-something to contestant for the daughter of the year award in the space of a day.  Eric's already suspicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry mum.\" Steven looked upset. Calling her mum actually made Liz feel a little guilty even though she was still annoyed with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For future reference, usually Courtney disappears to her room after dinner.  I thought you'd be keen to check out 'your stuff'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know where it is.\" Steven told her.  Liz found this hard to believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You managed to find the chuffing toilet.\"  Some of Liz's earlier resentment about the body stealing was coming through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I used it when you had the barbecue.\"  Liz and her family had a large barbecue here the previous summer, she had invited a few of her work colleagues too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should just have checked the rooms quietly when we were all down here.  I'm sure you could have picked out which one belonged to you.\"  She found herself talking exactly the same as when she explained things to her less capable subordinates at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah.\" Steven said as if it was the most obvious thing in the world after he heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought Courtney explained all this stuff?\"  A now frustrated Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just so excited about the swap,\" Steven paused, \"I might not have been paying attention.\"  Liz stared at him.  Steven didn't want to piss off Liz any more than he already had.  \"I guess time is getting on, I really should go check it out.\"  He stood up and quickly left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz sighed and leaned back on the sofa.  Relieved to get peace at last she felt her body relaxing as she heard Steven walking away.  She was caught by surprise when Steven reappeared, sticking his head round the door.  He gave her a gormless smile.  Liz rolled her eyes.  \"The door to the right of the toilet.\" Steven nodded and disappeared again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma lay in a deep bath sipping a glass of wine.  It felt wonderful.  Her new body was feeling a little tender from earlier and the bath was the perfect remedy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the way through dinner she half expected to be called out for being a fraud.  She couldn't help but watch Alice act her normal self in Emma's own body.  She was even wearing one of Alice's own outfits.  It seemed perfectly normal to her to be a forty seven year old woman dressed as a teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner Emma quickly excused herself and headed upstairs.  She had a quick look at her own wardrobe as she prepared for her bath.  All her own clothes were there.   She checked her underwear and found all her bras were now B-cups.  All her clothing had adjusted for her new body.  Even a pair of shoes that were too tight on her were still too tight even though her feet were down a size too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma was brought back to the present when Kyle walked into the bathroom.  She felt a bit weird being naked around him but thankfully the bubble bath suds covered her up to her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, luv I was dying for a pee.  I couldn't wait any longer.\" Kyle said as he turned his back to Emma and went to use the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What time is it?\" Emma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Half nine.\" He said.  Emma nearly spat out her wine. She'd been here nearly two hours.  Kyle had been drinking beer, he must have been at bursting point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, it's been a long day.\" Emma told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's the migraine?\" He asked as he finished up and turned back around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little better.\" She lied.  That was her excuse for not having sex later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe the wine will help.\" He said smiling.  Emma shook her head. \"You never know.\"  Kyle lived in hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  The wine isn't dulling the throbbing at all. I think this is going to be a bad one.\" Emma said, feeling a little regretful about fibbing to her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice rolled over in her bed.  She was incredibly tired but unable to fall asleep.  The doctor had told her sleeplessness was a common symptom of early menopause.  She knew it was something she had to live with.  It didn't help that she could hear her parents talking in their bed.  She couldn't make out the words but the constant murmur of two different voices was stopping her from relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was definitely planning on moving her bed.   This wall had the radiator on it but it was also right next to her parent's room.  She rolled over again, hoping facing away from the wall would help. It didn't and now her clock was in her face reminding her how slowly time was passing.  Eventually the talking stopped.  Alice waited a few minutes before she actually calmed down. She was relieved her parents were finally asleep and the disturbances were over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just drifting off when she heard it.  A sound she was very familiar with although she wished she wasn't.  The springs on her parent's bed were squeaking.  They were squeaking in a very rhythmic fashion, gradually growing louder and louder.  She cringed inwardly.  The distraction of talking noises were one thing, this was something else.  She was moving the bed tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't end there though.  She could now clearly hear her mother moaning in time with the bed springs.  Alice grabbed a pillow and wrapped it round her head in a vain attempt to block out the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't look like Alice was getting to sleep any time soon. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning Liz was doing her typical plate spinning act of getting ready for work while trying to get Ethan organised for his day.  She was currently preparing to get him to eat his breakfast.  Eric had already left for work.  As per usual, there was no sign of Courtney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some things never change.\" She said as she put the bread in the toaster while brushing her hair.   Thinking about it though she didn't explicitly tell Steven he was expected to help in the mornings.  Courtney might have mentioned it but Steven had probably forgotten.  Steven knew he had to take Ethan to school at least, he had mentioned that last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew Steven was awake.  She was pretty sure she'd heard him coming out of the shower earlier.  Once she was satisfied she could leave Ethan for a few minutes while he ate his toast, she decided to investigate where Steven was.   Before she'd even reached the kitchen door there was a tugging on her arm.  Liz sighed as she cut the toast into triangles for her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she got up the stairs, Liz noticed Courtney's room door was half open.  She slowly looked round it.   Steven was standing in front of the large wardrobe mirror.   He wore nothing except for a pair of neon pink boyshort panties.  From behind Liz could see the back of a dragon emerge from the top of the underwear.  She looked upwards.  Courtney's back was covered in tattoos. There were very few on her arms and legs though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz had never seen Courtney's whole body nearly naked like this.  Liz awkwardly cleared her throat.  Steven turned around, his arms were folded across his breasts.  His nipples were covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi mum.\" He said as he put his hands on his hips.  \"I was just checking out Courtney's tattoos.  I could see them in the shower but I wanted a proper look.\"  The front of Courtney's body was covered in ink as well.  A mixture of scripts, mythical animals with some tribal art thrown in as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz had her first proper look at Courtney's body.  She was usually quite modest when it came to clothing.  Seeing her individual tattoos was the most Liz had seen of her naked flesh.  She noticed her breasts were quite a bit smaller than she expected. As she looked down she noticed Courtney didn't have much in the way of curves.  In fact she did but they were a different kind, she had a bit of a belly.  It hung over the underwear slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz didn't think she was fat or unattractive but was taken back by how different her body was from how she expected.  \"You really should shut the door if you're going to be parading around like this.\"  Liz noticed there was clothes on the bed, presumably the ones Steven planned on wearing.  She casually picked up the white bra to look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?  It's not like there are any men around.  We're all girls here.\" He said with a ironic grin.  It was a push-up bra Liz noted.  That explained why Courtney's breasts seemed bigger when she was dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan is downstairs,\" Liz dropped the bra back on the bed, \"he could barge in anytime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's five,  I doubt he'd be interested in his big sister's tits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you are at home call them boobs or breasts please,  I don't want him picking up bad language.\" Liz admonished him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, mum.\"  Another concern popped into Liz's head.  It would be common sense to normal people but she wasn't sure how much she trusted Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do know where Ethan's school is, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Courtney bookmarked it on my phone.\" Liz was surprised he even had a phone, she'd never seen him use one.  It wasn't like he socialised much.  Getting him to the barbecue last year had been a difficult mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm leaving in ten minutes, so you better get dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked another garment up off the bed.  \"I found a pile of these in the underwear drawer.  I'm not entirely sure what they are.\" Liz laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really are clueless, they are girdles.\"  Steven looked confused.  \"I don't know if you noticed but that body has a bit of a tummy.\"  He looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And? I've no idea what to do with this thing.\"  Steven was clearly looking for advice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let you work it out for yourself.\" A cheeky Liz felt like humiliating him a little.  \"Until you do, I would suggest a really long baggy top.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz spotted Courtney as she drove to work.  She offered her a lift the rest of the way and she hopped in.  Courtney struggled a little getting the seatbelt round her large breasts.  \"How are you getting on living Steven's life?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The body is great...,\" she paused, trying to make the best choice of words, \"but his flat is a tip.  I don't think he's washed any dishes for a week.\"  Liz smiled. \"It took me about two hours of cleaning just to get the place habitable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you're learning some responsibility.\" Liz told her as they stopped at a set of traffic lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am responsible!\" Courtney said angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why you are never to be found when there is any housework to be done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to insult me all the way to work?\" Courtney asked, her Polish accent getting stronger as she got more emotional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, luv.  I'm a little emotional with Steven's behaviour.  You know he has forgotten most of the stuff you told him yesterday.  Didn't even know where your bedroom was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's bloody useless.\" Liz nodded eagerly in agreement as the lights turned to green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma came into the office with a little bounce in her step.  She felt great.  She was also thirty minutes late for her official start time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Liz.\" She said cheerily as she hung up her coat.  She sat down behind her desk and turned on her computer.  There seemed to be a toothy smile continually spread across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in a good mood.\" Liz said as she looked up from her own computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a long soak in the bath last night.  It felt incredible in this body.  After that...\" Emma suddenly turned bright red and stopped talking.  She looked at her computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After that, what?\" Liz asked, she had a suspicion of where this might be going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, I had a really good sleep.  That's why I'm a bit late.\" Emma lied badly, the thought of sleep made her yawn.  As happy as she was she had to admit to herself she didn't get a lot of sleep last night.  She was paying the price now.  She yawned again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, to summarise you had a relaxing bath and overslept last night.  Yet you are tired this morning?\"  Liz asked in a fashion that would make Sherlock Holmes proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Emma said as she turned even redder.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen that exact look on your face before.  I know what it means.\"  Liz extended a finger towards Emma.  \"I put it to you, Emma that last night you in fact, got laid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you are talking about Liz.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll explain, you and Kyle were at it like rabbits, you made the beast with two backs, he put his snake in your garden...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" Emma had cracked.  \"Yes, okay we did it.\" She confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to you 'having a headache'?\" Liz asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried that to begin with...\" Emma stopped.  Liz stared at her. \"I had some wine and you know what I'm like after a few drinks.\"  Liz nodded as she thought back to the last Christmas party. \"Kyle can be very persuasive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz gave her a stern look.  Emma unconsciously pushed back into her chair as she prepared for a lecture from Liz.  \"So,\" she started before her face suddenly softened, \"what was it like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma was caught off guard by Liz's curiosity for a few seconds.  \"Fantastic, it was like we were newly-weds again.  Even after the session I had in here yesterday,  I felt like I could have gone on all night.  It was Kyle that ran out of energy first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should get him to swap with someone younger.\" Liz suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a thought.  If we swapped him with someone here, we could get the average age of the staff up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you do remember that is the whole point then, not so you can get your jollies in a much younger body?\"  Emma frowned and took on a professional tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I much like your attitude Liz, just remember what is printed under my name, on my badge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wilko?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No above that.\" Emma clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Manager?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.  I'm in charge and it is my job to delegate, so I'm delegating. Lets get this plan in motion.  I want everyone's name on a piece of paper except for those that have already swapped.\" She knew full well that only really applied to her and Steven. \"We'll pick two at random, they can be our guinea pigs, before we try it out store wide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I have to be included too?  I'd rather choose for myself.\" Liz said.  Emma was about to say yes then reconsidered.   The reason she could get away with doing so little in her position was that Liz didn't mind doing most of it for her.  She really didn't want to upset Liz, she may actually have to do some proper work then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd never dream of including you.\" Emma lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later Liz handed Emma an unused polystyrene coffee cup containing thirty seven pieces of paper.  Emma stirred the pieces of paper around with her finger.  \"This is quite exciting.\" Emma said.  She pulled out two pieces of paper.  \"Okay the first two staff members to swap are...\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Liz nodded approvingly. \"And Liam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pick someone else.\" Liz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a waste of space.\" Emma shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Opinions shouldn't matter, I picked his name.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but nobody likes him and he's bone idle.\" Liz really had nothing positive to say about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the more reason for the swap.  Maybe a new body will change his attitude besides it wouldn't be fair on the others if we start choosing who gets swapped.\"  Emma made her feelings quite clear.  Liz picked up the PA microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liam to the manager's office. Liam to the manager's office.\" She said clearly and slowly before putting the microphone back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you going to page Rose too?\" Emma asked.  Liz shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we may be waiting a while.  The call will make Liam think he's in trouble for something, so he'll be doing everything he can to avoid coming up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you are being a tad cynical.\" Emma always did try to see the best in people when she could.  She of course didn't deal directly with the staff as much as Liz did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been meaning to ask you how you planned on persuading them to swap bodies?\"  Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just the good old carrot and stick, it's the best form of motivation.\" Emma explained.  She liked to use the old technique of punishing bad working behaviour and rewarding good.  The mistake managers like Emma made though was that the reward was usually only offered, not actually given.  Like the carrot used in the analogy, it was always a few feet in front of you.  You never got to eat it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz shook her head.  \"You do know that has largely been debunked, don't you?  It's been shown in several studies that it actually reduces motivation.\"  Emma scowled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma pointed towards the door.  \"They don't know that, do they?\" She said referring to the shop workers. Liz shook her head as Emma totally missed the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later and there was still no sign of Liam.  Liz had put two chairs in front of Emma's desk in preparation for the arrival of the guinea pigs.  \"Maybe he didn't hear the PA?\" Emma suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He bloody heard it all right.\" Liz said under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Emma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try something else.\" Liz said as she picked up the phone and called the customer service desk.  After making her phone call she paged Rose to come to the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took two minutes before there was a knock at the door.  Liz opened it and Rose walked in a little nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman was dressed in usual attire of a company polo and a knee length skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Rose, come in, come in.\" Emma said cheerily.  Somewhat apprehensively Rose stepped forward.  She pushed aside a few strands of her curly red hair that had fallen across her face.  \"Don't worry you're not in trouble.\" Emma reassured her.  She pointed at one of the chairs. \"Have a seat, we're just waiting on someone else.\"  Rose sat down on the plastic chair.  She kept her knees together and her back straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz closed the door.  \"So how are you today?\" Emma asked the young Scottish woman.  \"I am well, thank you.\" She said slowly and clearly. Her accent was barely noticeable.  She was making a conscious effort when speaking to avoid using the dialect that came naturally to her.   It was a novelty for Rose to actually talk to Emma directly at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seconds passed slowly in silence as they waited for Liam.  Emma desperate to break the silence, turned to Liz and asked \"You're mother is Scotch isn't she?\" Liz nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scottish, yes.\" Liz corrected her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never been myself.\" Emma admitted.  \"Hey, you and Rose could be related, it's not like a lot of people live there, it's all mountains and desolate islands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually the population is over five million...\" Liz started to say before there was another knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz opened it.  Liam came walking in and sat down without saying anything.  He slouched in his chair immediately.  Caleb the security guard had been standing behind him.  \"I found him hiding behind some pallets in the warehouse.\" He told Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was looking for something.\" Liam said. Everyone looked at him cynically.  He looked around. \"It was a customer query.\" He said defensively. Liz doubted if Liam had actually seen any customers yet.  Lying came as second nature to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Caleb.\" Liz said.  He turned round and headed back down the corridor.  Liz shut the door.  She walked round the office and stood behind Emma like some sort of enforcer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma leaned forward.  \"Good, now we are all here.  I wanted to bring up a matter...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't me.\" Liam stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz leaned forward in front of Emma.  \"This isn't about you Liam.  I'd advise you to listen.\" She stood behind her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you Liz.\" Emma said.  \"You have both been specially selected by the company,\" Emma noticed the cup with the names in it was still on the desk. She picked it up and put it behind her computer, \" to take part in a new pilot scheme.  If successful we plan to introduce it store wide.\"  She paused looking at her guinea pigs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam barely reacted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds off-ay exciting.\"  Rose said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  It is a little unorthodox though.\" She took a deep breath. \"It involves swapping bodies.\" Again she paused waiting for a reaction.  Rose look confused.  Liam still looked bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have access to a special item that allows us to take one person's mind and put it in someone else's body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds a bit far-fetched.\" Rose said quietly not wanting to openly contradict her manager.  Emma nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would say it sounds extremely far-fetched Rose, like some bad story off the internet but I have seen proof that it works.\"  She briefly glanced down at her own younger body but didn't say anything.  She didn't want the whole world to know she'd stolen the body of her teenage daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose turned to look at Liam and back to Emma. \"You want me and Liam to swap bodies?\"  Emma nodded.  Rose was a surprised by this and her mask slipped a little. \"Ah dinny ken anee-thing aboot-um.\"  She said rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma stared at her blankly for a few seconds, unable to comprehend the young woman.  Liz leaned down and whispered in Emma's ear, \"She doesn't know anything about him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" Emma said, probably a little too loud.  \"Nothing to worry about there.  Everybody else still sees you as yourself.\"  She pointed at Liz. \"Liz and I will know too of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A see, but why would you want to day that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has to do with company diversification policy. I don't want to be going into all the boring details...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's above our pay grade.\" Liam said to Rose as he finally joined in the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well I wouldn't have put it quite like that.\" Emma was relieved she'd managed to get out of some long winded explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's in it for us?\" Liam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A unique opportunity to experience the life of someone else.\" Emma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but you said we'll still be ourselves, so that wouldn't work. Would it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well,\" She turned to Liz looking for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz sighed. \"Liam your disciplinary record is shocking.  It's a wonder you're still here at all.  In all my years of working for this company I've never seen a record so bad.  You have been on your final written warning for months now.\" Liam smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" He said proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a flipping badge of honour.  If you go ahead with this swap we might look at removing a few of your disciplinary warnings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What aboot me?\" An emboldened Rose asked Emma.  \"Ah've no dun aneething wrang. Ah'm a geed worker.\"  She realised she hadn't been filtering her language.  She quickly regained her composure.  \"I mean, I am a good worker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm sure if there are any promotions in the future, we would look favourably on you.\" Emma said in the way managers wheedle out of committing themselves to doing something. \"Good, so if you two are happy we can proceed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose turned a bright scarlet colour.  \"No I canny day it.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Emma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've just been thinking aboot it.  I can't explain.  It's a personal reason.\"  She looked terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's perfectly safe.\" Emma reassured her.  She was pretty sure it was.  Nothing too bad had happened so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no that, it's just...\" Whatever it was, Rose clearly didn't want to discuss it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,  I have kind of gone off the idea too.\" Liam said as he moved into another slouching position. \"I don't really fancy being a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma knew it might come to this.   They two of them had already had the carrot, it was now time for the stick.  She had prepared one for this situation.  She pointed at her computer.  \"I received a company memo this morning.  It's from one of the nearby stores, apparently they are bit short-staffed. They were asking if we could spare a couple of experienced workers for a transfer.\"  She gave both Liam and Rose a hard glance.  \"If you choose not to go ahead with the swap.  I could put both your names forward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose put her head down.  \"I like the staff here.  I don't really want to go somewhere else but if that's what it comes to then fair enough.\" Emma turned to Liam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care.  A job is a job.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like Emma's blackmail planned had failed.  \"I see.  Oh silly me I forgot to tell you which store you'll be getting transferred to.\" She paused and smiled.  \"It's Barnsley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam and Rose turned to each other. Their faces both expressing total terror.   In unison they turned to face Emma.  They both shouted. \"I'll do it!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After this Rose (In Liam's body) put on both earrings, as did Emma and Liz.  All four were now aware of the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma handed her vanity mirror to Liam so he could see his face, in case he needed extra convincing.  All had gone according to plan except for one thing.  \"Whit's way the hair?\" Liam asked in Rose's voice.   Liam's new red curly hair was now short.  Rose's was long, looking similar to Liam's old hairstyle that he had until recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz looked at the hair on both of them.  \"Sometimes other features transfer across in the swap.

We don't all eat shortbread and haggis either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rrrr-eallly?\" Liam asked with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't tend to roll our Rs at the beginning of words.  I noticed, I was controlling it more towards the end of words when I was trying to suppress my accent.\"  Rose had taken a great interest in her differences in pronunciation. She had been considering studying linguistics in university.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rrr-ight, Ah'll trr-y to rrr-emembe-rrrrr that.\" Liam trilled.  Rose turned to Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's just taking the piss now.\"  She told the manager.  Emma was about to open her mouth.  When Liz jumped in before her, playing the enforcer role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay quit it Liam, you are on thin ice as it is.\" She warned him.  The smile disappeared off his new face.  He slouched in his chair.  Emma looked at Liz, making certain she'd stopped talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does look like you have swapped hair length.  It's the first time I've seen that. Normally your eyes get transferred and your personal items.\"  She said.  Liz picked something up off the floor.  She handed it to Rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might need this.\"  It was Rose's hair tie.  It had fell to the floor when Liam's hair changed.  She took it and fashioned Liam's old hair into a loose ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma cleared her throat.  \"Just remember everyone will see you as your old selves.  Just behave as normal.\" She looked at Liam slouching.  \"Although maybe some of us could put a bit more of an effort in.\"  Liam didn't react to Emma's words at all.  \"Good now you can get back to work.\"  Rose put her hand up slowly, like a school girl. \"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long will we be like this?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, we're not sure exactly, a few days possibly.\"  Even if this test lasted a few days there was a good chance both of them would be swapped with older bodies afterwards.  Emma didn't tell them that though.  Rose nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz opened the office door for them.  Liam put the mirror back on Emma's desk.  Liam and Rose stood up and walked out the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they left, Rose touched Liam on the arm. He stopped to look at her.  Rose looked apprehensive, she leaned over towards him as if she was about to talk quietly in his ear.  Before she could say anything Liz interrupted, still standing in the office doorway.  \"No chatting in the corridors, you can do it during your break.\"  Rose, a little frustrated leaned back.  The two of them walked down the corridor silently while Liz watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz shut the door behind them.  \"That should be interesting to watch play out.\" She told Emma as she returned to her own desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exciting, wasn't it?\" An enthusiastic Emma agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so.\" Liz didn't share her manager's excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the thought of it.  Swapping two people like that.  Being in control of them.\"  Emma squirmed in her chair.  Liz seemed to pay a bit more attention. Emma closed her eyes.  \"Mmmm, just imagine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emma? Is this turning you on?\" Liz asked.  Emma could feel her underwear getting moist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's made me pretty horny.\" She admitted, feeling a little embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shouldn't be surprised, I guess.\" Liz said.  Emma turned on her computer and half-heartedly pressed a few keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's no good, I can't concentrate on work like this.\" Emma said as she stood up.  In her younger body, she headed towards the office toilet.  She  stopped and turned to Liz. \"If anyone is looking for me, luv, I'll be unavailable for the next thirty minutes.\"  She started walking toward the toilet again.  She stopped when she got to the door.  \"Actually make it an hour.\" Emma said before slamming the door shut behind herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once out of the watchful eye of Liz, Liam with well practised ease, had ducked into a side corridor.  Rose hadn't noticed and kept on walking, heading towards the shop floor.  She had wanted to talk to him but he figured it could wait till later.  He really wanted to check out his new body.  It had taken him a massive amount of effort not to feel up his new breasts in the office.  He knew Liz would have personally kicked him out the shop, if he had tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started heading towards the staff toilets.  There was another issue.  He'd noticed every time he tried to walk normally he felt a little pain in his groin.  He had to take small feminine steps to avoid it.  He wondered if Rose had some sort of injury. Was that what she wanted to tell him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam arrived at the toilets.  He felt conflicted.  Being a man he wanted to use the men's toilets.  He was in a female body and also felt compelled to use the women's toilets.  He remembered what he had been told about the swap.  The world saw him as Liam, so that made him want to use the men's again.  He rubbed his new softer chin.  Two against one.  He pushed open the door of the men's toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Mark was washing his hands. He looked up and barely acknowledged Liam's presence.  \"Caleb was looking for you earlier.\" He said doing his minimum as a responsible employee to pass on a message.  If that hadn't been the case he wouldn't have spoken at all.  Like many of his colleagues, he despised Liam.  He didn't seem to give a crap about anything or anyone.  He'd even had the gall to come to work dressed in a skirt.  No wonder the managers wanted to speak to him, again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, he found me.\" Liam said.  Mark left silently leaving him alone in the toilets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had enough common sense not to strip down in the middle of the room.  He went into one of the stalls and closed the door.  Thankfully for Liam it was a full door.  He shut it behind himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed his breasts.  Something felt a little off but he wasn't sure what it was.  He thought he'd been able to feel his new nipples but he just felt fabric.  He reasoned Rose had been wearing a thick bra, not that he really knew much about women's lingerie.  He put the toilet lid down and sat on it.  He unfastened the buttons on the polo's collar.  Grasping the hem he pulled the uniform top over his head.  Once he removed it he looked down at his pale skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his chest was a white bra.  In the cups were large pieces of foam.  Experimentally he pulled one of the cups away from his chest.  The foam went with the cup.  It was sown into the bra.  He slipped his little fingers into the gap between the foam and his skin.  He could feel his small nipple inside.  He felt a tingle in his crotch as he rubbed his fingers across it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed in pleasure.   This was more like it.  He pulled his fingers out and looked at the bra again.  Was this what Rose wanted to talk about?  That she stuffed her bra?  Liam imagined she wasn't the only woman in the shop that did it.   He couldn't deny he was a little disappointed but brushing his nipple had certainly felt pleasurable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slid his hand down his smooth belly.  His old body was pretty hairy, so he could definitely feel a contrast.  He let his finger slide into his belly button.  Surprisingly it caused a little tingle too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up again.  He needed to figure out how to get his skirt off.  There didn't appear to be any buttons or a zip.  He pulled experimentally on the waistband and discovered it was elasticated.  He pulled out and downwards.  He easily managed to get the skirt over his hips.  It fell to his ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next obstacle were his flesh coloured tights.   They seemed straightforward enough.  He pulled the top of the tights down.  He feared he wouldn't get them back on again so only took them down to his knees.  He sat back down and opened his knees.  This was the main event as far as Liam was concerned.  He looked down at the white knickers.  They looked pretty plain and a bit larger than expected.  In his mind he had expected Rose to wear something a little skimpier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcited at the prospect of seeing his first pussy, the tingle returned to Liam with a little of the pain.  He winced from the discomfort as he put his fingers in the waistband and pulled the underwear down.  He lifted his pert ass a little in the process.  The knickers turned inside out as he pulled them across his thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam looked down.  Over his flat crotch looked like something that reminded him of a giant sticking plaster.  It was flesh coloured and there seemed to be a cotton wool dressing underneath it.  It was several inches across.  It looked like Liam's theory was right, Rose had actually injured herself. He knew she liked to keep fit maybe she'd strained something when she'd been exercising.  A giant band-aid seemed like a strange choice though.  It completely obscured her pussy.  He wondered how Rose could even pee with this thing on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe winced at the thought of removing and replacing it.  He noticed that his new body was hairless around the crotch.  It looked like Rose liked to keep it clean and tidy.  He rubbed his fingers on the flesh around the sides of the adhesive bandage.  The tingle of arousal ran through him again.  The pain was worse now and it wasn't going away.  It felt like someone was squeezing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew it was this taped medical dressing causing the pain somehow.  Injury or not this thing had to come off.  He got a long nail under the edge as he peeled it away from his skin.  It wasn't quite as painful as expected.  He unpeeled it revealing the thick layer of cotton wool underneath.  It was wrapped around his groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was movement, the cotton wool had fell to the side.  It landed on the wet floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSticking out of Liam, much to his surprise, was a small hard cock.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now, it was obvious to Liam, what Rose had wanted to tell him.  That particular mystery had been solved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam was at a loss about what to do. He had a cock.  He knew that shouldn't feel weird, he'd had one his whole life after all.  He had thought he'd lost that particular piece of anatomy in the swap and it turned out he hadn't.  He still had one but this was a woman's body, how could it have a cock?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnconsciously he gently touched it, doubting it was real.  Maybe it was some sort of fake?  He put his fingers round it.  No it wasn't fake, he felt a huge tingle of pleasure through his body.  He'd never felt anything as intense from his own penis.  This one was super sensitive.  He felt it grow a little stiffer and a little longer in his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContrary to popular opinion Liam was actually quite intelligent.  Many lazy people are, being able to invent clever ways of getting out of hard work. His usual strategy of planning ahead for potential outcomes had failed him miserably.  Nobody could have predicted this. The most laid back person in the shop was now starting to feel anxious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the conflicted emotions he felt was causing adrenalin to pump through him.  The primitive fight or flight response in his brain kicked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFight - Keep playing with it.<br>\r\nFlight - Put it away and think about his next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at himself he doubted that he'd be able to get the freed penis back into the female underwear, not in it's current erect state anyway.   This didn't leave much choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to fight.  If he played with his new replacement body part, it would perhaps help him to relax.  He had planned on having some fun with this body, just not in this exact way.  He started stroking.  Almost immediately he had to loosen his grip, the sensation was overwhelming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took his spare hand and slipped his fingers back into his padded bra, rubbing one of his small nipples to increase his enjoyment.  He started to moan quietly.  He hoped the sounds wouldn't  get past the door.  The moans were high pitched and womanly.  He looked downwards over his body.  The curved hips, the shapely thighs.  His body's beautiful form was clearly female.  Even the cock itself looked somewhat feminine.  It was hairless and smooth.  It had no wrinkles or bulging veins like the one on his old body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam could feel his climax approaching very slowly.   As pleasurable as this experience was, every time he edged closer, his orgasm seemed to get further away. Time was a factor, his presence was going to be missed sooner or later.  He couldn't spend all day in here, as much as he wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed himself harder.  Gripping tighter didn't work, so he stroked faster.  He grew frustrated by his bra.  It was limiting access to his nipples.  In a moment of annoyance he pulled the garment upwards.  It moved easily with little in the way of breasts obstructing it.  He pinched his pale pink nipples.  He felt both pain and pleasure as he squeezed them.  \"I need to cum.\" he squealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt his new penis twitching in his hand.   It was too much for Liam. He screamed in pleasure for a few seconds before he knew what was happening.  He placed his hand over his mouth to mute the vocal noise of his crescendo.  A jet of semen shot out of his penis, clear past his clothing, hitting the wall with a loud squelch.  He started to soften almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the most intense thing Liam had ever experienced. His head lopped from side to side as his entire body filled with the pleasure endorphins that had been released.  He struggled to remain conscious from the waves of relaxation and gratification that passed over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced at the blob of his cum as it very slowly slid down the tiled wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later Liam emerged from the stall.  He'd managed to get all of Rose's clothing back on.   He had no idea how to replace the tape that covered his crotch though.  He'd didn't mind, he felt a  lot more comfortable without it.  He crumpled it up along with the cotton wool and put it in the bin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began washing his hands in one of the sinks.  He glanced at his reflection in the small mirror above the sink.  After everything he experienced he thought he'd feel differently about his new body.  It still looked like a young woman though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brought his face closer to the mirror.  He ran his fingers along his chin.   He noticed Rose's smooth jawline was a little on the angular side.  It was more apparent now her hair didn't cover it.  He was caught a little by surprise as the bathroom door opened and John walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe janitor had several packs of paper towels under his arm.  Liam was relieved it was someone he could talk to.  John was one of the few people in the store who actually tolerated him.   It probably had something to do with the fact they didn't have to work together.   John opened the towel dispenser and looked at Liam examining his face in the mirror.  \"Still trying to grow a beard?\" He asked as he rubbed his own trimmed facial hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think ah'll gie it up as a lost cause.\" Liam frowned still not entirely used to the Scottish accent.  John started loading the dispenser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably for the best, you've got too much of a baby face.\" John grinned as he made fun of Liam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've nay idea.\"  Liam said grabbing a pile of towels from the top of the open dispenser.  His wet hands soaked the stack deep into the dispenser much to John's annoyance.  After drying his hands and disposing of the towels, Liam turned to head out.  He really needed to speak to Rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I'd find you lurking around here.\"  The voice said as Liam emerged from the toilets.  He spun round to find Natalie standing there.  She walked up to him.  \"Liz told me to keep an eye on you.  She seems to think you'll be more trouble than usual today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's ha-rrrr-assment. I need tay...\" Was all Liam managed to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need tay,\" Natalie said mocking his accent.  She was about to make a sarcastic comment about moving his surprisingly attractive backside but thought the better of it, \"get yourself down to goods in and move the delivery pallets into the warehouse area.\"  It was a monotonous task that could be quite physically demanding depending on the weight of the pallets.  Liam sighed deeply.   \"What's the problem? You'll have the pallet cart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's crap, we need a new wan.  Meadowhall and Parkgate have forklifts in their warehooses.\"  Liam protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well they are both bigger than this store, besides do you think we'd trust you with a forklift?\"  Liam scowled. \"Stop complaining, I know you are just procrastinating.\"  He started moving and Natalie followed.  It was looking like she was going to escort him down to the warehouse personally.  Any chance of speaking to Rose in the near future went out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily though he did catch Rose's attention as they passed through the back of the store.  He could see her stacking shelves in his old body as they passed by.   Liam deliberately pointed subtly at his crotch while staring at her, letting her know that he knew her secret.   Her face went bright red and she turned away from him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As they entered the warehouse Natalie glanced down at Liam's feet.  \"Hang on a minute.\" She said as she pointed at the ballet flats on Liam's feet.  \"Why aren't you wearing your safeties?  You knew your were assigned to the warehouse this week.\"  Liam was about to protest his innocence.  He had been wearing his boots, except now they were on Rose's feet.  \"Never mind, I don't want to hear your excuses.  I'll see if I can hunt you down a pair.\"  She started walking away then spun round.  \"You better be here when I get back.\"  She disappeared out the warehouse door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam stood and waited.   The other workers moved around the warehouse, largely ignoring him.  There were the occasional shouts of words like 'skiver' behind his back as he waited for the supervisor to return.  For once it wasn't actually his fault he wasn't doing anything.  \"Nice skirt.\" Aaron said sarcastically as he went past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, fuck-eee, yee arsehole.\" Liam responded loudly.  As unimposing as his new female voice was, Liam did like the way swear words sounded in his Scottish accent.  It was almost like the dialect was designed specifically for hurling obscenities at people.  Aaron caught by surprise, took a quick step backwards before walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie soon returned with a dainty pair of safety boots for Liam's new smaller feet. She was actually pretty amazed he hadn't wandered off.  \"I think these should fit.\"  She said as she handed them to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Liam, there weren't that many pallets in the last delivery and most were relatively light.    Liam  was aware his original body had been a bit stronger but he also knew Rose's body was considerably fitter.   It all kind of balanced out and the job took about as long as he expected.  Even the fact he was wearing a skirt wasn't that much of a hindrance as the weight of the pallets forced him to take short steps anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he'd finished he wiped his sweaty brow with his arm.  As he put the pallet cart away he heard several rounds of sarcastic applause behind him.  When he turned round everyone pretended they hadn't been clapping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe realised he hadn't seen Natalie for a while, she must have been satisfied he was actually working for a change. He checked the time, it was five minutes till his scheduled break.  \"Close enough.\" He said out loud.  He left the warehouse and went to go look for Rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found her not far from where she had been previously.  She was still stacking shelves.  She was almost finished her cage of stock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you due yer break?\" Liam asked her.  She nodded silently, clearly still feeling embarrassed about the situation.  Without making eye contact she spoke.  \"I'll get you outside, near the footbridge.\" She said without looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam stood waiting by the bridge as he saw Rose emerge from the small shopping area that Wilko was part of.  It was pretty quiet this time of day.  \"I'd never a guessed you were really a bloke.\" He said as she approached.  She sped up and grabbed his arm pulling him further away from the footbridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your voice down.   I don't want everyone to know about my private business.\" She said.  Feeling a little more vunerable next to Rose's larger body, Liam complied lowering his voice slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really look like a woman.  Does dressing like one turn you on or something?\" Liam asked.   Rose scowled at him.  She pointed a finger at him.  \"Let's get one thing straight. No matter what you think, I am not just dressing like a woman.  I am a woman.  A real one.\" She told him angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What aboot this then?\" He said as he gently squeezed the small lump in the front of his skirt.  Rose's eyes opened wide and angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You took my tape gaff off?\"  She turned red again.  \"Fuck, everyone will know now.\"  Liam had found out what the tape covering his crotch was called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, ah tain yer gaff aff!\" He said, laughing at the unintentional rhyme.  He neglected to mention what else he'd done with her body.  \"Ah could barely walk.\" Tears started rolling down Rose's face.  Liam actually felt a little guilty now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't expect you to understand.\" She said through the tears.  \"I can't help being born in the wrong body.  It's been a lot of work dealing with it.  Not just for me, my mum too.  That's why we moved from Scotland, so I could start a new life as the woman I really am.  All that effort, gradually changing myself.  I was starting to get more comfortable being me.\" She pointed at Liam and seemed to focus her thoughts a little.  \"I got kind of lucky with my genetics. I was always small, with my long hair I often got mistaken for a girl when I was a kid.  It made me happy.\" She put her hands on her own chest.  Getting upset again, she said \"Now thanks to the swap, I'm back to square one.  I'm a man. A big ugly man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam tried to get his head round Rose's outburst.  He could comprehend she'd always thought of herself as female.  She wanted the world to see her like that, it seemed.  It must have been really important to Rose and her mum, if they were prepared to move to Rotherham to keep her secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs strange a story as it was to him, he admired her in a way. He could never show that kind of commitment to anything. \"Yeah ah'm no exactly handsome.\" He admitted, causing Rose to laugh and she slowly stopped crying.  He took a deep breath. What he was about to say next required a massive effort on his part. \"Sorry, ah do stuff all the time withoot thinking aboot others feelings.  Ah ken am no a very nice person.\"  He surprised himself, he thought he'd chicken out half way through his apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stood there not saying anything to each other for several minutes.  Liam broke the silence.  \"Feeling better?\" He asked.   She shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No not really but thanks for asking.  There may be hope for you yet.\"  Liam smiled.  \"Look I've been thinking, I may have overreacted, people will see you as a guy, right?\"  Liam nodded.  \"I guess a bit of a bulge down there shouldn't be an issue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, they see me as a guy.  Ah've been getting some strange looks fay people, for wearing a skirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  Yet you haven't been sent home to change clothes.   It's weird how the swap has worked.\"  She said as she ran her fingers through her long hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liz checked the time when Emma emerged from the toilet.  It had been one hour and fifty minutes since she went in there.  Liz had tried to work but the occasional moans of pleasure from the small room were somewhat distracting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling better?\" Liz asked as Emma headed towards her desk.  She hadn't even buttoned up her blouse yet.  A fair chunk of Alice's breasts and belly were on display along with a good bit of Emma's white bra.  A bra that had adjusted in size to fit Emma's new body.  Liz shook her head at Emma's casual exhibitionism.  She used to be so modest.  Bare arms were about the most flesh she had seen Emma display before the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Emma said as she sat at her desk, leaning back in her chair.  She lifted her arms above her head, revealing more of her body. She was clearly in a very relaxed mood. Once she put her arms down, she started slowing fastening the buttons like it was a complete afterthought.  \"If I keep this up, I'm going to have to start bringing spare knickers to work.\" She said with a laugh.  Leaving the top few buttons of her blouse open again, she turned on her computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz didn't find it very funny.  She enjoyed pleasuring herself as much as the next woman but Emma was taking this to a whole new level of irresponsibility.  \"So you are going to make it a regular thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might.  Schedule it in for an hour every morning.\" She said as she started browsing some tattoo art websites.  She was still arousing herself with the idea of getting some for her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not make it two hours?\" Liz asked sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even better especially after a swap.  Not like I do much mid-morning anyway.\" Emma said as she completely missed the sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob had just finished serving a customer and his till was now empty.  He turned on the alert light which flashed green at the top requiring a supervisor's attention.  He closed his eyes and chanted under his breath.  \"Please be Stefania, Please be Stefania, Please be Stefania,\" Natalie was okay but like many of his co-workers, Rob was smitten by the new supervisor, \"Please be Stefania,\" she had seemed more confident as she moved around this morning, \"Please be Stefania...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob?\" A confused Courtney asked as she approached his till.  He opened his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" He said as he fist pumped the air.  He could see the concerned look on <i>Stefania's</i> face.  \"Sorry I had a cramp in my leg.\"  He rubbed his calf pretending it was sore.  \"It's just gone away. It is a relief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm guessing you need change too.\" She said despondently.  This was the current strategy of the male till operators wishing to attract her attention. She thought it was odd, as most of their till drawers were filled to the brim with coinage.  Unlike Steven it didn't bother her too much when the male workers spoke to her but she wanted to be professional until she was comfortable in her new job.  She wanted to be comfortable in her new body too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body didn't help when it came to unwanted attention.  It just exuded sexiness, unlike Steven she was aware of the effects it had on her mind. \"No I don't need change.\" Rob told her. \"I wanted to talk about our discussion yesterday.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I spoke to so many people yesterday.\" Courtney lied. \"What did we discuss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The romantic date we had planned...\" Courtney had no idea what Rob was talking about.  Had Steven organised this yesterday? He'd certainly worked fast after getting this body.   Courtney certainly felt flattered but she wasn't ready for this, not so soon. \"...when you get comfortable dating co-workers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney sighed with relief.  Steven must have told Rob that he wasn't happy to date colleagues yet.  It seemed Rob had made a lot of assumptions about the rest of that conversation. \"That's not what I said Rob.   You are nice and everything but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I can wait.\" He said.  Courtney shook her head, he just wasn't getting it.  \"You look different with your contacts in.  I think it makes your eyes prettier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I don't think this is a suitable topic for a work based discussion.\" She said trying to shut him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, scanner is playing up.\" He said pointing to his device for reading bar-codes, in a poor attempt to keep the conversation work related.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It probably just needs a clean.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried. It didn't seem to make much difference.\"  He lied, desperate for <i>Stefania</i> to stay and talk to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you try cleaning it with a wipe?\"  She asked.  He looked at her blankly. \"There should be some under your console.\"  Courtney stretched out and leaned forward reaching under the till.  Her large breasts touched Rob's thighs.  She couldn't locate the wipes. She moved her hand around under the till trying to feel for them.  This caused her breasts to rub across Rob's thighs.  She didn't notice as she was focussed on finding the wipes.  Rob certainly did notice.  He also noticed the growing hardness in his underpants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising up slightly, she turned to face him.  They were both surprised at the proximity.  She put her hand on the back of his chair for support.  Their faces now only a short distance apart, the sexual tension was measurable.  Courtney smiled at him, Rob smiled back. \"Found them.\" She said pulling out the tub of wipes.  She opened the container and removed one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still had to lean over to reach the scanner but not quite as far as before.  She supported herself on the ledge around the the till seat.  Her breasts were now in Rob's eye-line.  She started ferociously rubbing the lens of the scanner.   This oscillation transferred through her body to her chest.  Rob couldn't help but stare at Stefania's large mammaries as they jiggled from side to side.  Trying to distract himself he looked further down her body, her shirt had fell away from her stomach. Its smooth and slim nature was revealed.  He kept moving his eyes across her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnconsciously Courtney was wiggling her ass sexily in time to her wiping the scanner.  \"Oh, Christ!\" Rob said unable to contain his sexual feelings. Courtney stood up again.  She looked at the wipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! It was really dirty.  You should really take better care of it.  It is a sensitive piece of equipment after all.\"  Courtney said innocently.  Rob nodded, now unable to speak.  His face was straining.  \"Something wrong?  More cramp?\" A concerned Courtney asked as she put her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Rob yelped as he just about just gathered enough willpower to stop himself creaming his underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, so no more alerts, unless it's important.\" He nodded.  Courtney turned around.  Every other till alert light was going.  The operators were all pointing at their scanners.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two of the shelf stackers were on their break.  Natalie had asked Courtney to cover the staff members till the end of it and she happily complied.  The shelf stackers of course suspected someone would be covering the break and so had left the cages containing the heaviest stock till last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney sweated as she put the heavy tins of paint on to the shelf.   As much as some workers in the shop were better than others when it came to work ethic, it was quite clear to her, that most of them had their own little skives.  Even the newest workers had found little ways of getting someone else to do the hard work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't help matters that Stefania's body didn't seem to have done a lot of physical work recently.  Courtney could see that from looking at her muscles. After so much heavy paint, the perspiration was running down her body.  \"Hi luv.\" Liz said as she approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had decided to get out the office.  As much as Liz and Emma had always got on, since Emma had swapped, Liz was finding it difficult to spend long periods of time with her.  All she seemed to talk about was sex, body swapping, tattoos and more sex, Liz was growing weary of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Liz.\" Courtney said as she stood up.  She grabbed the hem of her polo and pulled it up to wipe the  perspiration off her face.  In the process she managed to reveal her belly and most of her shapely back.  The skimpy bikini top Liz had given Steven yesterday for underwear, was even partially visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney was sure she heard something that sounded like half a dozen sexual gasps nearby but when she turned round nobody was visible.  She slowly turned back round and let her polo top drop back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz noted how casually Courtney displayed her skin.  She would have put it down to Stefania's original personality but she'd seen both Steven and Emma show similar behaviour.  It looked like earrings lowered some inhibitions.  \"You still wearing that bikini?\" She asked her swapped step-daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's surprisingly comfortable,\" she said as she cupped her breasts without thinking, \"and I couldn't find any other underwear at Steven's.  At least not women's underwear anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it was just Steven's clothes?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but they fit me okay.  They were men's clothes but they were clearly designed to fit a curvy woman.  I'm wearing a pair of his underpants,\" she grinned, \"apart from the wide waistband they aren't much different from some of my knickers.\"  Liz nodded.  Emma had said all her clothing had adjusted to Alice's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has your clothes at home too.  I think clothes are meant to swap with you but you two resetting the awareness might have done something to upset that.  The earrings seem to be quite quirky anyway.  It's almost like they have a mind of their own.\"  Liz looked around. \"You haven't seen Liam, have you?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natalie was keeping an eye on him.  He was in the warehouse, I think I seen him going outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting out of work again, no doubt.\" Liz said cynically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be fair I'm sure he was due a break.  Natalie said she was quite surprised how hard he'd been working.  She was a bit annoyed, he forgot his boots.\"  Liz knew exactly why that was.  She didn't have much sympathy given his usual attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Typical Liam, he has too mess up somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw him when I went by earlier.  He looked quite comical trying to move the pallets about, wearing that tight skirt.  I don't know what possessed him to dress in that.\"  Liz again was aware this was due to the swap between Liam and Rose.  The world saw him as a guy but in Rose's body he was a 'guy' wearing women's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liam's in a skirt?\" Liz faked her surprise.  \"I really should speak to him about being out of uniform.\"  She knew it was only because of the swap.  She was keen to find out what other people thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it crossed my mind too, but I figured as long as it was a one off and didn't happen again, I'd let it go this time.  It actually looked sort of okay on him.\" Liz looked at her sceptically.  Standard policy was to send staff home or try and locate suitable clothing in store. \"I mentioned it to Natalie, she agreed as he would be mostly in the warehouse and not customer facing.\" Courtney told her, justifying what seemed like reasonable decisions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I suppose.\" Liz reluctantly agreed.  It seemed the earrings were making people jump through all sorts of logical hoops to try and rationalise swapped people's strange behaviour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething caught her attention in the distance.  \"Oh, talk of the devil.\" Liz said loudly as Liam and Rose came walking back in together.  Both looked a little distracted.  \"What have you two been up to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, just talking.\" Liam said defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney stepped nearer them.  \"I was just telling Liz about your cute skirt.\"  She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, ah ran oot of clean troosers, it's awe ah had left.\" He said in his Scottish accent that he got from Rose. He hoped he could dispel Courtney's interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, did you run out of clean socks too, is that why you are wearing tights?\" She asked smiling, as she gently poked fun at him.  Liam scowled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's enough.\" Liz said.  She didn't mind embarrassing Liam a bit but the swap wasn't his fault. \"Stefania, why don't you take Liam back to the warehouse.  Natalie's in there, she'll find something for him to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam pointed to the warehouse door that was only about ten steps away. \"It's just ower there.\" He said, not wanting another escort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knowing you, you'd still manage to get lost on the way there.\" Liz told him.  She pushed her arms out and shooed him and Courtney away.  This left her alone with Rose who was looking at the paint tins she had to stack.  Liz had been wanting a quiet word with her.  She turned to her.  \"How you doing luv?\" She asked the swapped girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had better days.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I suppose it's a lot to deal with.\" She looked at the cage of stock.  \"You shouldn't have any trouble with this lot.  Liam's body isn't in the best of condition but he'll have more upper body strength.\" Rose nodded.  She kept herself fit but she did avoid exercises that bulked her up, to avoid looking more masculine.  This meant her arm and shoulder muscles weren't particularly strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still just taking it all in.\" Rose admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a little jealous.\" Liz admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are?\" Rose asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz leaned in closer and spoke quietly.  \"You get a penis.  That will be a brand new experience for you.  I know it's Liam's but it should be a lot of fun to try out.\" She winked and nudged Rose's arm with her elbow, keen the young women got the most out of her new body.  Liz was of course unaware that it wasn't as new or as fun an experience for Rose as she thought it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose sighed as she pick up a tin of paint and put it on the shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She asked me to come in and see her.\" He said.  Liz figured Emma must have phoned him after she had gone downstairs.  Liz began to grow a little suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh she did, did she? I thought you'd be working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am, this is my lunch break.  She said it was urgent.\" He informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I won't hold you up any longer.\" She said about to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, Emma said I had to get,\" he paused for a few seconds recalling the name, \"Luke to show me to the office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you know the way.\" A confused Liz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emma said it was new procedure or something.  I had to be accompanied.\" Liz was very suspicious now. \"Emma said I should ask for Luke, she was quite insistent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet she was.\" Liz said, knowing exactly what Emma was up to.  Luke was a good choice.  He was young, attractive and fit.  He had some nice toned muscles too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" A confused Kyle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing. I'll just get him for you.\"  Kyle waited as Liz disappeared down one of the aisles.  She returned about a minute later with the young man.  \"This is Emma's husband.\" Luke smiled and half waved.  \"Will you accompany him to the manager's office, please.\" Luke was a little confused but wasn't going to complain about being given a little skive like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Luke said.  \"This way Mr. Thompson\" He pointed in the direction of the door marked 'Staff Only'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA devious smile grew on Liz's face as Luke and Kyle headed out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma had told Luke to wait outside when they got to the office.  She explained Kyle wouldn't be long and Luke was to take him back downstairs again, when he was finished.  She quickly shut the door in Luke's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke waited patiently.  He could hear the murmur of conversation.  He started to get bored after ten minutes or so and walked from side to side.  There were a couple of chairs for visitors but he was reluctant to use them.  He didn't want to get caught sitting down.  Eventually he cautiously sat on one of the chairs, just as the office door opened.  A frightened Luke quickly stood back up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Emma at the door. \"Hi Luke.\" She said.  She seemed to be looking him up and down.  \"Kyle will just be a couple of minutes.\" Luke could see him in the office. He was looking towards Luke too. Emma turned to Kyle.  He seemed to be checking Luke out as well.  Their body language seemed strange to him. Kyle nodded to Emma, who turned back round. \"There's one more thing.  Put your hand out.\" Luke did as he was asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma dropped the earring into it.  \"I was wondering if you could put that on.\"  Luke was a little surprised by her request.  \"It's okay, it clips on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" He started to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have time to explain.  Just put it on.\" Emma said in a forceful manner.  As forceful as she could manage in Alice's voice anyway. Luke put the earring on. Emma smiled. \"Good, now take a seat while you wait for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait for what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, wait for Kyle coming out.\" Emma realised she'd nearly gave the game away.  She closed the door again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Luke sat down he spotted another worker coming along the corridor towards the office.  It was Kiran, the short young woman who strode towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You in trouble or something?\" She asked him as she approached the office. Luke shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm waiting on someone. What are you doing here?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's strange.\"  She said cryptically. She looked from side-to-side around Luke's head.  He felt a pang of embarrassment. Kiran had obviously spotted the feminine piece of jewellery.  \"Liz sent me, she said you'd be wearing an earring and I was to get it from you.\"  She looked quite surprised. \"And here you are wearing one.  It's weird.  How did Liz know?\" Luke shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do with it?\" He asked as he removed it and handed it to the woman.  He was happy for an excuse to get rid of it.  He felt stupid wearing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was strange as well. Liz told me to put the earring on.\" Kiran put on the earring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long for?\" Luke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea.\" She said, just as everything in the corridor went fuzzy for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke blinked.  Kiran had disappeared and Emma's husband was where she had been standing.  The office door opened and Kiran came out. When did she go in there? Luke wondered.  She handed her earring to Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran turned to Luke. \"I better go talk to Liz.  I'll catch you later.\" Unknown to Luke, Kiran was in Kyle's body.  The middle-aged man's body wandered back down the corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma's husband stood there looking confused.  He looked downwards.  He placed his hands on his small breasts. Looking somewhat shocked Kyle spoke.  \"I'm a gi...\" Before he could finish speaking, a panicked looking Emma had grabbed Kyle and pulled him back into the office.  She gave Luke a strange stare before she slammed the door behind him.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

They\u2019d both snuck into Elizabeth\u2019s former digs and had torn into the piles of assorted clothing dumped there. Though it\u2019d been relatively easy to pick out a reasonably presentable red polo that was just about large enough to accommodate his new proportions, it was proving nearly impossible to satisfy the bodyswapped assistant supervisor. Each bra was too chafing, each pair of slacks was too tight and each set of footwear was too constricting. Eventually after a handful more painful tries to appease She-Steven, Liz decided to just whip out a skimpy two-piece bikini set that hadn\u2019t sold the previous summer and chucked it Steven\u2019s way, consequences be damned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is this? I\u2019ll look like a bloody whore if anyone sees me!\u201d Steven moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh relax, you big crybaby. No-one\u2019s gonna see it underneath the uniform anyway so why does it matter?! Look, that\u2019s the last item of lingerie that you haven\u2019t chucked back into my face so, like it or lump it, you\u2019re wearing it!\u201d Steven sarcastically mocked Liz\u2019s voice as he slipped the swimsuit on, prompting her to roll her eyes in return. \u201cWhatever,\u201d Liz chuckled sardonically as she watched Steven struggle to pull the polo over his head. As she observed him squirming and writhing she had to resist her urge to cuff him over the back of the head while he was haplessly defenceless. Instead she strode to his side and helped him like a good friend would, struggling to contend with Steven\u2019s constant wriggling but gradually pulling the shirt over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he mumbled as his cheeks turned rosier. He pushed his glasses back onto the bridge of his nose and yelped as he peeked downwards. No wonder why, the polo that\u2019d seemed to be able to fit beforehand barely made it down to his midriff, making him look like a pale-complexioned Indian belly dancer or just your average English sket. Steven screeched piercingly as he frantically tried to pull the material downwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, Liz, no way am I wearing this outside of this room!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImagine Steven\u2019s face as he watched Liz try (unsuccessfully) to stifle her laughter by covering her mouth in her palms. \u201cC\u2019mon, luv, you\u2019re overreacting,\u201d she squealed between short bursts of laughter. \u201cHonestly, I think it <i>suits</i> you. Anyway, I\u2019m not helping you to put another one on again, you nearly took out my eye the first time! Just take these bottoms I found you and stop complaining!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven grumbled as he took the slacks in his dainty hands and pulled them on. \u201cGod, I look like a 70\u2019s <i>Charlie\u2019s Angels</i> reject.\u201d He whined unceremoniously as he twirled in the breezy bellbottomed trousers. \u201cStop being a drama queen,\u201d Liz taunted as she nearly reached bursting point. To add insult to injury, Emma decided to make her presence known at that very exact moment and she was immediately dumbfounded by Steven\u2019s...<i>interesting</i> clothing ensemble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did...? Why did you...? You know what, never mind. I just came here to hand you this.\u201d Emma passed him a laminated piece of card, his new name tag, and Steven eagerly clipped it on. Liz, ever the eagle eyed supervisor, was the first to notice a slight amendment to the text on the name tag. \u201cEmma, how come it says <i>\u2018Stefania\u2019</i> instead of Steven?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma smacked her forehead as she realised her mistake. \u201cSorry, luv, must\u2019ve been a typo! I\u2019ll go back and get another one printed out...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Steven said in a surprisingly stoic tone. Emma and Liz stopped in their tracks. \u201cI mean, no, it\u2019s fine, Emma. Maybe assuming a new identity is the best thing, at least for now. I don\u2019t want <i>anyone</i> outside this circle knowing about what went on with me. Until we can locate my old body, I guess I can pretend to be \u2018Stefania\u2019 for a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuick question: do I still get the salary of an assistant supervisor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yes, but if you\u2019re gonna be working in the store with the others, you might not qualify...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen it\u2019s settled!\u201d Steven skipped out of the room, humming a pleasant little tune to himself while his trouser legs billowed underneath him. Meanwhile Emma and Liz looked to one another, holding off for a second before exploding into raucous laughter. Liz wiped a joyful tear from her eye before presenting the golden earrings in her right palm to Emma. \u201cSo what do we do now?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Take <i>Stefania</i> up to the break room.  You can introduce her to two groups of workers.  While you are up there you can scope out some potential swap candidates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a great idea.\" Liz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why they pay me the big bucks or they are supposed to at least.\" Emma said, somewhat dissatisfied with her current salary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could be worse.\" Liz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I could be the manager at the Barnsley store.  Poor soul.\" Liz nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the rest of the staff?  How will they find out about our new assistant supervisor?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get the workers you talk to, to pass it on that there is a new staff member.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I probably won't have to, you know the way gossip travels around this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a constant stream of talking and laughter coming from the break room as Liz and <i>Stefania</i> walked down the corridor.  Liz went in first, there were a few glances in her direction but the noisy talking continued.  When <i>Stefania</i> stepped inside, you could have heard a teaspoon drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men looked dumbstruck.  She quickly looked around the room from side to side.  Her exaggerated head movement seemed to be in slow motion to her male audience.  It gave the impression they were in some sort of shampoo advert.  Unconsciously she removed her glasses which just added to the effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer female audience stared silently for different reasons with the possible exception of Allie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone if I could have your attention for a moment.\" Liz said loudly although she didn't have to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this work related? because we don't get paid for breaks.\"  Asked Michael in a militant mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but I'll be brief.  Just remember who pays for your free tea, coffee and fridge when you are on your unpaid break.\" Liz said, shutting him down. She smiled at everyone. \"I want to introduce you to Stefania our new temporary assistant supervisor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has Steve been sacked then?\" Asked Aaron.  Before getting a response he continued. \"No surprise, I can understand why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral of the others nodded.  \"Yeah he was pretty useless.\" Said Charlotte.  <i>Stefania</i> bit her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven has not been sacked.\" Liz said loudly, she could see the annoyed look on Stefania's face.  \"He's been sent on staff training.  Stefania is training here before going to another store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one?\" Asked Aaron. Liz hadn't thought of one when she was putting together this hastily concocted cover story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barnsley!\" She practically spat out.  There was a large amount of sympathetic murmuring throughout the group. \"Well I'll let her introduce herself.  <i>Stefania</i> took a step forward feeling very self conscious in her new attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi everyone.  I look forward to working with you.\"  Again most of the men were spellbound by the sweet sounds coming from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're Polish?\"  Kiran asked from the far end of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Stefania</i> nodded.  \"I think so, Kiran.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, how do you know my name?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Stefania</i> started to panic.  She'd almost blown it already.  \"I read it on your name badge.\"  She said proudly, impressed at her own cleverness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, from over there?  They must be really good glasses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe break period had barely been over two minutes when Natalie came storming into the manager's office.  She nearly caught Emma finishing the pile by putting on her last King. \"What's this about Steven being replaced?  Shouldn't I be told about this?\" An angry Natalie demanded to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz was right, word does travel fast.\" Emma said as she sat upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry luv, it was one of those last minute things.  I didn't get much notice myself.  She just appeared in our office this morning.  It caught me and Liz by surprise too.\" She said honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, I see.\" Said Natalie, calming down a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you met the replacement yet?\"  Natalie shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard conflicting stories.  Some of the staff were saying she's very beautiful and very friendly.   Others said she was rude and standoffish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you've been talking to male and female staff, I'm guessing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind.  Her and Liz will still be in the break room if you want to talk to her yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe considered the idea.  It would be a great excuse to be off the shop floor.  It was her manager's idea after all.  \"I might just do that.\" She was about to turn to head out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you go luv, tell me what you think of these.\" Emma said as she pulled out the earrings.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Emma slyly persuaded Natalie to try on the earring, Steven was having a difficult time trying to adjust to his new predicament. He\u2019d left the break room temporarily to try and get some work done, leaving Liz to sip her tea on her lonesome. His work wasn\u2019t that hard all things considered\u2014though he still preferred to work down and amongst his colleagues, his role as a supervisor had slashed his workload in half. No, the thing that perturbed him the most were the looks he was receiving from all sides. He\u2019d noticed at least a dozen men glance his way and size him up, many of which had stars in their eyes and one brazen fella even had the nerve to catcall him. He blushed profusely, too embarrassed and too uncomfortable to react to any of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst culprits by far were his own coworkers. While many of the women stared at him purely for the sake of sizing up their new superior (Allie being the exception; her glances were a lot more lustful than anything else), the men looked at him for one reason and one reason only. And to be fair to them, Steven couldn\u2019t blame them. Heck, had a beautiful Eastern European girl been hired at the store a day before he had little doubt he wouldn\u2019t have been slobbering over her. Steven swore under his breath as he walked into the canned goods aisle. Though the loosely cut bell bottoms provided plenty leeway for his supple legs to move, the skimpy thong underneath them clung to him tighter than stink on rice. He grumbled as he slipped his dainty hand inside to try and readjust it\u2019s position, rummaging around whilst his other hand reached high to place a can of baked beans onto the top shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere seemed to be no suitable placement though and after a few dozen seconds without success Steven grew frustrated. A customer looking for some canned peas strode into the aisle but soon strolled right back out, seeing a very out of context scene indeed. Steven meanwhile was still going ham on the bikini thong, using both hands now to pull the restrictive material out from his buttcrack. Fortunately or unfortunately, depending on the reader\u2019s perspective of the ensuing incident, Steven\u2019s hand somehow slipped as it moved through and his manicured fingers brushed  against the edge of his clit, sending a fuzzy vibration coursing through his body from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...\u201d Steven moaned slightly. Wow. Is that what female arousal felt like? Steven swivelled his head from side to side to make sure no one was watching him. Although he wanted to try and experience that feeling again, he didn\u2019t want to be caught by a customer, or even worse, a coworker, and have to try and explain his way out of an awkward moment. Curiosity beat out caution and Steven was mere moments from trickling his fingers back inside his front when he heard a light cough over his shoulder. He reacted poorly to the surprise, stumbling in the heeled ballet flats Liz had lent to him, and would\u2019ve fallen to the ground had the stranger not caught him in their arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah, sorry there,\u201d their familiar voice said as they levered Steven back upright. It turned out that the person was no stranger but was actually Luis. The Dominican born man watched silently as Steven brushed himself off and adjusted his glasses back into place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo sorry if I startled you, <i>chica</i>,\u201d he said in an easygoing Dominican tone. \u201cSorry, I meant to say \u2018ma\u2019am\u2019. Excuse my informality, Miss...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStefania. Just Stefania.\u201d Steven held out his hand to shake but Luis instead kissed it, eliciting a shy blush and a nervous giggle from him. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no need to call me \u2018Miss\u2019 or anything like that. Think of me as just another coworker who\u2019s covering for the assistant supervisor until he comes back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hopefully soon,</i> he grumbled internally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuis chuckled. \u201cHow can I think of a sweet little <i>j\u00e9von</i> like you as just another coworker?\u201d Steven blushed again and cursed himself for it. Why did this body get so flustered at every single ambiguous example of flirtation? Luis noticed \u2018Stefania\u2019\u2019s rosy cheeks and grinned partially. \u201cSorry about that, we Dominicans are natural flirts. Can\u2019t help myself. Anyways, I just came over \u2018cause I saw you struggling to put that can on the shelf. Here, let me help.\u201d Steven silently passed it over and watched as Luis stretched up and positioned effortlessly. Steven couldn\u2019t help but observe Luis\u2019 athletic figure ripple underneath the standard red polo, his tanned biceps straining the seams. Steven didn\u2019t even blame his new form for admiring Luis\u2014no homo but that dude was built like an Olympic cyclist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you go, Miss Stefania. Holler at me if you need anything else, y\u2019hear?\u201d Steven nodded and thanked Luis as he stepped out of the aisle. He breathed a huge sigh of relief knowing Luis hadn\u2019t seen anything. He still had the urge to experiment with his new equipment but seeing as how close he\u2019d got to getting busted before he didn\u2019t think it was the wisest idea yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now at least he\u2019d try to keep his head down and stay out of people\u2019s way as much as possible. He pulled the thong out once more and moved onto the next task set for him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had asked Natalie several times to try on one of the earrings and she had refused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They aren't really my style.\" The supervisor said a little frustrated by her manager's insistence.  Emma sighed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I suppose I better come clean then.  I do have an ulterior motive.\" She admitted.  Natalie looked at her confused.  \"This should be on a need to know basis but you are the most senior member of staff after Liz.  You are higher up the totem poll than Steven, after all and he knows obviously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knows what?\" A confused Natalie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, luv.  They are magical earrings.\" Emma informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are nice I suppose, if you like that kind of thing but I wouldn't say they were magical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, magical like hocus pocus.\" Emma waved her hands around like she was casting a magic spell.  Natalie stared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling okay Emma?\" A concerned Natalie asked.  \"The stress of the job getting to you?  I know it can be tough at the top.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't believe me?\" Emma asked, a little disappointed.  Natalie shook her head.  \"They can swap bodies.  Steven has already used them.  Don't you think it's a bit of a coincidence his replacement who has suddenly appeared has a very similar name?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you trying to tell me <i>Stefania</i> is really Steven in a different body?\" Emma nodded.  \"What sane woman would want to swap bodies with Steven?\" She asked, which she followed with a nervous giggle.  In her mind the whole thing was preposterous.  She did find the idea a little intriguing though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want proof then?\" Emma asked.  She slipped one of the earrings into her ear.  She pulled open her drawer pulling out her make up mirror and put it in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that would be a reasonable request.\" Natalie said.  She was a little concerned she might be fuelling Emma's delusion.  Hopefully when she saw it didn't work, she would see the whole idea was silly.  Emma walked round the desks and handed her the other earring.  Unaware of the compulsion, Natalie slipped the earring on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything in the office seemed to go a little fuzzy for a few seconds.  Natalie found herself holding the second earring in her hand.  She immediately noticed the nail varnish and that she wasn't wearing her polo shirt.  She looked down and saw a white blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on?\" She asked in Emma's voice just as she saw a woman in front of her who looked very familiar. \"That's me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't freak out luv.  You are in my body.\" Emma told her in Natalie's own voice. \"Actually in my mind,  I think it's still your original body.  I know we've swapped, so I really know it isn't.\" Being in someone else's body was confusing enough.  She had no idea what Emma was going on about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma lifted the earring out of Natalie's hand.  Extending her other hand, Natalie understood what she wanted.  She took the earring off and handed it to Emma.  \"I'll sort this out in a second.\" Emma said as she slipped both earrings on.  The room went fuzzy again.  \"That's better now I know that is my body.\" She said pointing at Natalie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a trick.  You've drugged me and dressed me up in Emma's clothes.\" Natalie just couldn't believe it. Emma pointed towards herself. \"That doesn't explain me. Did I use the secret cloning machine in the stock room?\" Emma asked sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are obviously a body double.  You don't actually look that much like me.\"  Natalie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now who is in denial?\" Asked Emma.  She pointed at the mirror in Natalie's other hand. \"Check it out for yourself.\"  Natalie lifted it to see her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bloody hell!\" She practically screamed as she saw Emma's features in the mirror.  She raised her hand to touch her face just to make sure.  Along with the excitement, she felt something else.  Her underwear or rather Emma's underwear was feeling a little moist.  She wondered if being in Emma's body was turning her on.  \"The earrings are magic.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma nodded with a smile.  She'd spent so much time trying to convince Natalie of the truth she had neglected to examine her own body.  She gently cupped her polo covered breasts.  They felt similar in size to her own but were definitely firmer.  Natalie did have ten odd years on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Natalie said when she saw what Emma was up to.  \"That's my body.\" She said, although honestly it was turning her on even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine now, luv.\" Emma told her as she put her hands on her hips.  She rubbed them too, moving slowly round to the backside of Natalie's younger body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can swap back right?\" A worried Natalie asked her manager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, anytime but do you want to?\" Emma asked.  If this had been purely a hypothetical situation, discussed beforehand Natalie would have definitely said yes.  Now she was actually here and experiencing it, she wasn't so keen to swap back.  There was also the fact she was finding being in Emma's body just a little bit sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could try it for a little while,  I suppose.\" Emma grinned. \"So I have to pretend to be you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's what you want but right now the rest of the world sees us as ourselves.  You can just be yourself with the knowledge you're in my body.   If you put both earrings on, everyone will see us normally and you will have to pretend to be me.\"  Emma explained.  \"Either way, bed time with our husbands tonight will be interesting.\" Emma winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I wasn't meaning for that long.  I just meant a couple of hours or till the end of shift.\"  Said Natalie in Emma's shocked voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just pulling your leg luv.\" Emma said a little unconvincingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie wanted to change the subject.  She didn't really want to dwell on the ideas Emma had presented. \"Where did the earrings come from?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea.  Steven found them at a car boot sale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to know a lot about how they work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've done some testing.\" Emma admitted.  She looked at Natalie's watch.  \"Time is rolling on.  One of us is going to have to go downstairs.  Who is it going to be?\" </span></div></div>",

Though she found the idea of infiltrating Emma\u2019s life and becoming the manager for a day intriguing, what she\u2019d just learnt was a lot to process and trying to pass as someone else might just overwhelm her. \u201cI appreciate the offer, Emma, but for now I think I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s too much for right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma grinned and shrugged her shoulders. \u201cFair enough. Guess it\u2019s for the best. I wouldn\u2019t want to make things awkward between you and your family by acting weird. Though I\u2019d love to see little Harry and squeeze his cute widdle cheeks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can still do that. How about you and Kyle come over for dinner tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019d be great! It\u2019s been too long since we\u2019ve shared a proper cuppa and convo. I\u2019ll bring Alice and Grace while I\u2019m at it, they absolutely adore you! Well, Grace definitely does\u2014Alice is in one of her irritable phases in which she hates absolutely everyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both chuckled. Emma grinned mischievously as she looked downwards to her new form. \u201cHoly moly, I haven\u2019t felt this spry in years!\u201d Natalie shifted uncomfortably as she watched Emma use her former hands to cup her bosom and jiggle them around. \u201cDamn, not even a sign of sagging in these girls... Sorry Natalie, but...\u201d Emma moaned sensually as she played around with Natalie\u2019s now erect nipples inside her polo. Natalie blushed as conflicting thoughts entered her mind; as strange as the scene was, something about seeing herself (or Emma in her body as she had to remind herself) masturbating in front of her turned her on. Despite being close to menopause, Emma\u2019s snatch was surprisingly active and made Natalie very restless indeed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that\u2019s enough, Emma,\u201d Natalie said, her bottom lip placed in a stranglehold between her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, Natalie? So soon? Come on, luv, I didn\u2019t even get a chance to do this...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie winced as she watched Emma slip her fingers inside her black slacks. After a few tense moments of rummaging, Emma finally found her target, plunging a tentative index into Natalie\u2019s welcoming pussycat. Emma groaned as her finger brushed past the clit and then deeper into Natalie\u2019s crevice. \u201cGod,\u201d she mumbled, \u201cYou\u2019re surprisingly <i>tight</i>...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurprisingly?\u201d Natalie giggled nervously as she felt herself getting more sweaty by the second. She placed her hands nervously into her lap but took them off as she felt a damp patch slowly stretching out like wet tendrils onto the front of her black bottoms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma spotted Natalie\u2019s unease and decided to screw around with her. She steadily began increasing her volume, playing up each plunge verbally and moaning like one of the C-list pornstars she\u2019d seen Alice watching once. Soon enough and Natalie\u2019s groans synchronised with Emma\u2019s own, creating a sexual symphony that Mozart himself would be proud of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop!\u201d Natalie yelled in between groans, her cheeks puffing and her trousers dripping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma rolled her eyes but laughed nonetheless. \u201cYou\u2019re no fun, I was <i>so</i> close to making you orgasm.\u201d Emma giggled as she took her fingers out of her pants and licked them clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s disgusting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma shrugged. \u201cHow else do you want me to clean \u2018em? In ten years or so when you get to my stage, you\u2018ll learn to appreciate the kinkier moments in life. Actually scratch that: you\u2019re already at that point right now! Anyway, I can\u2019t understand why you\u2019re so peeved. You seemed to be loving it a few minutes ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie blushes again. \u201cOk, maybe it turned me on a little, but that doesn\u2019t excuse you jacking yourself in my body!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe not, Natalie, but your kitty\u2019s a treat. Mike\u2019s a lucky fella...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs everything so sexual with you?! Let\u2019s change the subject.\u201d Natalie harrumphed loudly and crossed her arms. \u201cUgh,\u201d she said as she felt the wet material around her new crotch. \u201cHappen to have any spare underwear lying about? I seem to have... ugh, <i>creamed</i> myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, hun. I always bring a spare set of trousers to the office with me. You know, just in case. Just pop your head into that little box in the corner and sort yourself out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you just get them for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma\u2019s pale blue eyes sparkled mischievously. \u201cWell in normal circumstances it\u2019d be no problem, luv, but these are <i>far</i> from normal circumstances. It\u2019s been fun being you for these fun few moments but me and Liz have got some... <i>\u2018staff restructuring\u2019</i> to do that requires me to maybe pick up a few new bodies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, so you\u2019re just going to give my body to some random goon off the street?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. Well at least probably not. It\u2019s hard to explain but trust me, we\u2019ll find a way to make sure you can get back to your body if needs be. For the meantime have fun in my body. It may be slightly older but its still got a heck of a long way to go before its ready to settle down, if you know what I mean!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie pondered whether she should explode or not before dropping her shoulders and sighing her worries away. \u201cFine,\u201d she said begrudgingly. \u201cYou\u2019re the one with the magical earrings so I don\u2019t think I have much say in the matter. Just know I trust you Emma and I know you won\u2019t let someone screw around with my body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re trust is much appreciated, Natalie. Don\u2019t worry about it though, I\u2019ll make sure if I do leave your body, I\u2019ll leave it in responsible hands.\u201d A thought popped up in Emma\u2019s mind and she quickly darted to her handbag. She ruffled a few papers round before pulling out a chic pair of glasses and placing them on Natalie\u2019s forehead, resting on the front of her new shoulder-length brunette hair. \u201cAlmost forgot these. I\u2019d be half blind walking round the store without them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey look good on me,\u201d Natalie giggled. In the reflection of the glasses she could see her own eyes lodged firmly in Emma\u2019s eye sockets, colour unchanged and shining brightly back at her. \u201cSo if you\u2019re gonna get up to more hijinks with those earrings, what am I supposed to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor the time being just get back to work. No one can tell we\u2019ve swapped bodies so everything will basically stay the same. Maybe you can keep an eye out for good customers that we can use as body donors, y\u2019know ones that look a bit more mature but not old and decrepit. Think you can do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure. No problem.\u201d Natalie waved goodbye and quickly exited the room, stumbling slightly as she was unused to her new sense of gravity and Emma\u2019s 2-inch t-bar heels. Emma chuckled as the door closed behind Natalie. She had a newfound sense of confidence in her gait as she sashayed up to her chair and crashed down into it. She laughed to herself as she replayed their meeting in her head. She didn\u2019t know whether it was the fact that she\u2019d suddenly lost 10 years or if it had been the swap that had increased her libido but she was still feeling horny as hell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe discreetly lowered the hem of her black slacks and reached inside with curious fingers once more. Had anyone walked past they might\u2019ve heard the occasional moan escaping through the door. However, Emma was too lustful and too preoccupied to care anyway.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Emma was determined to finish what she had started in Natalie's body.  Her limber legs were wide open and her hand buried deep in the crotch of her black slacks.  Her knuckles were visible moving under the tight fabric.  She couldn't remember the last time she'd been this horny.  Her fantasy had started with her husband Kyle.   She found herself unconsciously moving on, imagining sex with some of the better looking male workers in the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel the orgasm build quickly.  She let out one last long moan, before silence came as she hit her crescendo.   She couldn't draw breath as she came all over her panties.  The pleasure was just too much, she gripped on to the chair with her spare hand fearing she'd lose her balance. \"Oh yesssss!\" She screamed as her breath returned to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that exact moment Liz walked into the office after her tea break.  Emma had locked the door after Natalie left but Liz had her own key.  Emma had been so lost in pleasure she hadn't even heard it turning in lock.  \"Bloody Hell Emma!\" Liz said.  She slammed the door shut as she stepped backwards in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer manager was panting like a dog on a hot day, her face covered in perspiration.  Her hand was deep in her slacks which had been pulled down over her hips.  Her eyelids were half closed and she was grinning.  It was quite the spectacle for the assistant manager.  Emma slowly regained her composure as Liz stared at her. \"What?\" Emma asked.  \"Everybody does it.   That's what Alice told me when I caught her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not in the middle of the manager's office they don't.\" Liz said as Emma pulled her hand out her slacks with a noticeable plopping sound.  Liz face took on a slightly disgusted look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't help myself.  I think this body is sex obsessed.\"  Emma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've swapped?\" Liz asked.  Emma nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's...\" She never got the chance to finish.  Liz put her hand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me.  I had an idea when I was on my tea break. Where are the earrings?\" Emma was going to push them towards her but she didn't have the energy.  She vaguely pointed towards them and collapsed back in her chair.  Liz picked them up and put them on.  The room went fuzzy for a few seconds.  \"Natalie?\" A surprised Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know that?\" An equally surprised Emma asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got to thinking, we never tried putting the earrings on someone who wasn't part of the swap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma thought back to earlier.  Liz was right she hadn't. \"I wouldn't make a very good scientist.\" She admitted.  \"I'm guessing because you can see me, it is the same effect as for the first person who put an earring on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it.\" Liz said.  \"Natalie eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wanted to know about Stefania but when I explained about the earrings she wouldn't believe me and so here I am.\" Emma said raising her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering why you were wearing a polo.  I know it's not strictly against policy but I've never seen you wear one since you started here.  I'm going to start noticing stuff like that all the time now and think people have been swapped.  I'll get suspicious of anyone acts slightly out of character.\"  She put the earrings back on the desk.  \"So what's Natalie's body like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing.   I haven't had a good look but she's so slim, you'd never guess she's had a kid.  It took me years to get my figure back after Alice.  As for these.\" She cupped her breasts.  \"Much firmer than mine.  If I had to guess I'd say she was in her twenties not mid thirties.\"  She looked at the fluid drying on her fingers.  She grabbed a wipe to remove it. \"And horny, wow. I've been gushing since we swapped.\"  Liz looked intrigued.  \"I think Natalie is a bit of a wolf in sheep's clothing, she must be amazing in bed.\" Emma said concluding her review of the staff supervisor's body.  She saw Liz licking her lips a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma narrowed her eyes as she looked at the hunger in Liz's own eyes.  \"Are you wanting a go?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please.\" Her eager colleague said as she grabbed an earring. \"Wait, I'll go first.\" Emma said as she picked up her earring.  The room went fuzzy as they swapped places.  Liz found herself in Emma's chair.  Emma was standing beside her after putting the earring in her hand.  Emma spotted the earring and took it out Liz's hand again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing what to do Liz pulled out her earring and handed it to Emma.  She put them both on and the room went fuzzy.  She looked downwards. \"Wow, Liz luv how do you know where to put your feet?\"  Her view was obscured by Liz's large breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Decades of practice.\" She admitted as she grabbed her own much smaller breasts. \"I haven't been this small since I was thirteen.\" She said, a stray strand of hair, fell across her face.  She blew it away and didn't taken her hands of her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma recalled the task Liz had been assigned while in the break room.  \"How did you get on finding people for swaps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked if anyone would be interested working on a special secret company project.\" She moved one hand downwards over Natalie's slim belly.  \"I did get a few people interested, mostly the brown nosers though.  I think we'll maybe need to offer some incentives.\"  Emma nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm off to do my rounds.  I'll maybe offer them some gift tokens or something.  That might help.\" She picked up her notepad. \"I'll leave you in peace, luv.\" She said to Liz with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz got up as Emma headed towards the door.   She almost lost her balance to begin with as she stepped forward.  She wasn't used to not having as much weight up front and her body was quite tired. \"Where are you going?\" Emma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unlike you I'm planning on using a little decorum.  I'm going to use the bathroom, besides I'm quite interested to see what my breasts look like now. I'm not going topless in the middle of the chuffing office.\" She said as she stepped into the manager's toilet.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her only real cause for concern were the the black Prada loafers that Liz had worn that squeezed dangerously on her dainty little toes inside. A bit clunky for her taste but it really made no difference to Emma\u2014her focus was unwavering as she scanned each passing customer and coworker in sight and approximated age assessments for each and every one of them. She also, obviously, wasn\u2019t just gauging them on their ages alone. Though she wanted a more mature look aesthetically, she\u2019d no intentions of swapping decades-old dinosaurs into the fray just for the sake of appeasing corporate. No, she wanted to give herself some good eye candy to stare at during the shift. Especially now that she had Liz\u2019s younger snatch she was hungry for some stimulation and the urge needed to be sated quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw a few customers in the range from cute to appealing but none stood out as significant candidates worthy of mention. There was a bloke who looked decently hung that Emma would\u2019ve tried her luck with had she had the opportunity to speak with him, but he exited the store as quickly as he came with his dumbbells and shaving cream tucked underneath his arms. That brought up a new question for Emma; though she was still quite uncertain about the nature of the swapping abilities given by the earrings, the prospect of hopping into a male body and experiencing the throes of a male orgasm made her so giddy she was practically foaming at the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what\u2019s the best way to do that?\u201d she asked herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering there weren\u2019t any, quote unquote, \u2018prize male specimens\u2019 laying about in the customer gene pool available to her, Emma decided she\u2019d just play it safe and stick to the store\u2019s employees. Emma slyly gave Liz\u2019s nipples a slight tweak for motivation before she set off to look for her next target.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She occasionally pretended to write a few scribbles in her notepad to make others think she was actually paying attention to what was going on.  It also helped keep the workers on their toes, as they became paranoid she was writing about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon saw Stefania.  There were a group of men round her. Emma thought she looked a little flustered.  As Emma walked towards the group, one of the guys spotted her.  She could see them talking amongst themselves.  They all walked off in a hurry pretending to be doing it casually, like they hadn't just been spotted shirking work by a manager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How you doing, luv?\"  Emma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I guess Emma.\"  Stefania said.  Emma grinned at Stefania's complete inability to tell she was actually in Liz's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was all that about with the guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess they were just being friendly to the new girl.  Welcoming me to the store that sort of thing.\" Emma nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay but it shouldn't be taking them away from their own work.\"  Stefania nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kept telling them that too but they just seemed to change the subject on to work related matters for a little while before talking about me again.  It made it difficult to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of them must think I have a bad memory or something, they keep introducing themselves and telling me they are single.  Even the ones that aren't.  I honestly don't know what's so interesting about me.  I guess it must be these stupid clothes or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma looked down a Stefania's body.  The outline of the bikini she wore under her polo was pressing into the fabric.  Her breasts pushed the polo shirt out so far, when she was standing straight, it hung away from her body.  It revealed a enticing sliver of her slim belly.  The oversized trousers whilst massively flared at ankle level, got tighter and tighter as you moved upwards. Her large ass looked like it was just about ready to escape from it's confines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma nodded.  \"Yeah, it might be the clothes.\" She told the oblivious Stefania.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to spend any longer than I have to in this body.  I could ask one of the guys if they want a swap and get a male body at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we don't want to start over complicating things right now.   Honestly I don't think the guys would want a swap with you,  anyway.\" Emma told her assistant supervisor in a dismissive fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They seem pretty interested to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but being a woman is completely different from just looking at an attractive one.   For one thing, it takes a bit more effort to get yourself off.  Most men like the easy route, just grab hold of your dick and give it a few tugs.\" Emma suddenly realised she was unconsciously mimicking jerking off with her hand.  She put her hand down quickly and looked around to see if she had been spotted.  \"Anyway, you get my point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStefania nodded.  She understood was Emma was saying, she hadn't expected her to be so graphic about it though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was topless and sitting on top of the toilet.  Her slacks pulled down to her knees, so she could get easier access to Natalie's pussy.   Emma had been so right about this body.  It's sex drive seemed never ending.  She'd already orgasmed several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also got to see more of it than Emma.  Natalie's tits were fantastic to look at it.   They were so firm Liz doubted Natalie needed a bra.  Liz was actually a little bit jealous.  Bras had been a fact of life for Liz for the past twenty five years.  Even resting in bed could be painful without one.  Yet another reason Liz wore a bra, was her large nipples.  Without it her arousal would be obvious, her nipples poking through her top.  Natalie's nipples had got hard but they were kind of on the small side and hadn't stuck out like Liz's own would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she had a body like Natalie's she'd never wear a bra again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as she enjoyed this body though, it was getting physically tired.  Liz had stifled a yawn a couple of times.  She gently rubbed herself in post-orgasmic pleasure.  She looked down at the mess that was Natalie's underwear.  She had no idea how many loads of female lubricant had coated them.  She speculated that if she removed them and threw them at the wall they would stay in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better get back to work, I suppose.\" Liz said as she put her hand over her mouth covering another yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma had reached the actual Natalie down on the shop floor.  Emma couldn't help but notice Natalie was staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong luv?\" Emma asked as she looked at Natalie in her own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, I'm just back from the toilet.\" She winked, indicating she'd had some fun in there.  \"I must say your body is in great shape for your age.  I was expecting your bush to look like, well a bush but I was happy  to see you keep it trimmed a little.  Not as short as I like though.  I'm guessing you haven't done it for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure if I should take offense or not.\" Emma told her with a smile.  \"If I'd known I'd be swapping bodies today I would have put a bit more effort into tidying up my garden.\"  Natalie laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm actually surprised you've still got my body.  I thought you would have swapped it away by now.\"  Natalie admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, do you..?\" Emma couldn't quite understand why Natalie still thought Emma was in her body.  She kept silent while she thought about this, so she wouldn't give herself away.  It kind of made sense.  The last swap Natalie was aware of, was her swapping with Emma.  As long as Natalie didn't wear the earrings or the memories were reset, she'd think Emma was in her body no matter how many times Emma swapped with others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, do I, what?\" Natalie asked, repeating Emma's unfinished question back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, nothing.\" Emma decided to see how far this swapping of awareness went.  She looked down at Liz's sizeable chest.  \"I'll tell you what though.  I was struggling to know wear to put my feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie laughed. \"I can imagine, to be fair I've had decades of practice though.\" She looked downwards over Emma's middle-aged body.  \"It is nice to see my feet when I'm standing. Even if they are actually your feet.\"  Emma was amazed.  As far as Natalie was concerned she'd had Liz's body her whole life.  Emma was struck by how incredibly powerful the earrings were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to change the subject to stop Natalie getting suspicious. \"I am thinking about swapping with a man.\" Emma blurted out.  She didn't even consider this made her a total hypocrite when it came to Stefania.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" An intrigued Natalie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too good an opportunity to miss, isn't it?  Get to see how the other half lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But having a dick though, you think you could deal with that?\"  Emma felt herself getting excited at the mention of it.  She made a somewhat non-committal nod.  \"Imagine it, a hard thing like that in your underwear all the time, I think it would be annoying.\" As Natalie continued to voice her concerns, Emma got turned on more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want it to be someone good looking.  Without being nasty, there aren't exactly a lot of attractive men working here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, some of them aren't too bad. What about Darrell?\" Asked Natalie, referring to their colleague with mixed heritage.  Emma vigorously shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good Lord no.   If the rumours are to be believed, I don't want to handle his monster before I get a bit of practice on something a bit more manageable.\"  Emma did find the idea appealing but just wasn't ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, how about?\"  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Natalie observer the change in demeanour and turned around expectantly, opening her mouth in shock as she locked onto who Emma was eyeing up. The person in question was none other than Luke, the handsome, crewcutted employee with rippling pecs and a charming smile. Natalie admired his dazzling blue eyes from a distance, her mature snatch moistening as she discreetly pawed at it inside her slacks, whilst Emma\u2019s gaze was firmly locked on the flaccid bulge in the front of his black trousers. Though he didn\u2019t seem to be aroused while he bantered with a nearby shopper, his constant rearranging of his boxers told Emma that he was at least packing some kind of serious heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Luke.\u201d Emma chuckled devilishly to herself and stroked the tip of her chin with Liz\u2019s manicured finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you\u2019re gonna steal a man\u2019s body, I\u2019d advise you to take one as hot as that! But aren\u2019t you worried about the implications of taking his form? Stealing a cock-and-balls for your own enjoyment might seem fine to you but how will your husband or your kids think of it? Not to mention the fact that Luke\u2019s already engaged to a woman already, that girl...what\u2019s her name? Rachel, or whatever her name is, might not necessarily want to eat out her soon-to-be husband.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma hadn\u2019t really thought of all that before and now she felt guilty for not even asking those questions herself. Was the thrill of swapping really worth risking everything she\u2019d built up for herself? Emma nearly chickened out until she felt a dream breeze blow through the store, brushing past Liz\u2019s bulbous nipples and causing a sharp sting of arousal coursing through Emma\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScrew it,\u201d she said, throwing caution to the wind. \u201cKyle and the kids won\u2019t think anything\u2019s amiss anyway if I don\u2019t pass the second earring over. As for Luke\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, well she might actually like the idea of hot lesbian sex. It\u2019ll be fun to see them doing all sorts of kinky stuff, maybe even going so far as to share a fake dildo someday...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie didn\u2019t protest as Emma jogged over to Luke and whispered something in his ear. Luke didn\u2019t seem to be too alarmed so Natalie accurately guessed that Emma had come up with a feasible excuse for him to follow her. Soon enough Emma had grabbed Luke\u2019s hand and dragged him up to her office behind her, a giddiness evident in her steps and an exuberant smile plastered on her lips. Natalie rolled her eyes as she continued to take inventory of the items on the shelves. Natalie wouldn\u2019t have admitted it directly to Emma but the thought of Emma trading away her body felt a tad disheartening. She knew she wasn\u2019t a spring chicken anymore with her stretch marks and the occasional wrinkle but she\u2019d have hoped Emma would\u2018ve taken more time to appreciate her new figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie was completely oblivious to the fact that Emma had swapped herself out with Liz beforehand so she was unaware that she was unconsciously complaining for Liz\u2019s sake rather than her own. However, some tiny sliver of her now perverted mind surprisingly found the prospect of \u2018her\u2019 former body bedding up with another girl incredibly sexy. She bit her lip as she pulled out her fingers from her pants and straightened herself out. At this rate she\u2019d have to go back into the toilets and satiate her cougar urges once more. In a move more out of curiosity than of practicality, Natalie took her fingers and dabbed the tips of them onto the edge of her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlech!\u201d she exclaimed, pulling her hands out and spitting the fishy tasting liquids out of her mouth in a very crass manner. <i>Apparently it doesn\u2019t taste as good as Emma made it out to be,</i> she thought to herself as she took the fabric of Emma\u2019s white blouse and scraped it across her taste buds. She made a mental note to not do that in the future before well and truly resuming her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me I have to wear this in order to earn a free day of paid leave?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma beamed at Luke\u2019s question. It had been child\u2019s play to convince Luke to follow her upstairs. He\u2019d been sceptical when she\u2019d mentioned an employee questionnaire but the prospect of paid leave was absolutely class for him. Emma knew that his wedding was just over the horizon and he\u2019d been wailing about not having a day to plan everything over the past couple months. What better method could she have used to exploit him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the deal, plain and simple. We need to make sure customers get the utmost satisfaction from our products and if our employees don\u2019t even want to buy them, why would they?\u201d Luke shrugged his shoulders as Emma crouched down low to him with one earring in hand. He winced as she clipped it on and then looked dejectedly at himself in the mirror Emma had procured from inside her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, whaddaya think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI look like my Grandma on bingo night.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma giggled and rolled her eyes. \u201cHardy har, good one kid. Relax, they look adorable on you. But on me...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma grinned as she pulled the other earring out of her pocket and slipped it into her left earlobe. Everything in the office seemed to go a little fuzzy for a few seconds. After a moment or two of disorientation Emma found herself holding the second earring in her hand. She immediately noticed the nail varnish, or lack thereof, and found that though she was still wearing a polo shirt, this specific one hugged a little tighter to her chest. She looked down and saw the toned arms she\u2019d been admiring on Luke before as well as that, oh so sweet, bulge sat snugly between her thighs. As she watched it, it quickly grew in girth and length, stretching the material of the boxers Emma now found herself wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled as she saw the familiar chiselled features and crewcut hairstyle. \u201c...But on me, they look absolutely <i>f*cking incredible.</i>\u201c Now Emma was the one sat in the chair as Luke crouched down beside her and held the mirror up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr, guess so,\u201d he said as he stood up and scratched his head. He had no idea how he\u2019d ended up down there. His mind reasoned that he\u2019d somehow dropped the mirror and had to pick it up from the floor but something seemed wrong about that. Oh well, he was feeling a bit dizzy for whatever reason. Maybe that was it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo does that mean I get that extra vacation day?\u201d Luke watched on in silence as Emma shamelessly groped herself, flexing her biceps and fondling her ball sack like she\u2019d never seen it before in her life. He had to cough to get her attention before she could reach her hand into her underoos and stroke her womanhood. Emma blushed bright scarlet. \u201cSorry, excuse my inappropriate behaviour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no problem at all. It\u2019s perfectly normal to pleasure yourself, everyone does it.\u201d Luke looked side to side before leaning on and whispering, \u201cBetween you and me, I sometimes take time off my lunch break to pop into the bathroom and finger myself silly!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma burst out in laughter, both at the statement and at the preposterous nature of the obliviousness the earring provided. \u201cAren\u2019t you not supposed to tell your manager about misconduct like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, in normal situations you wouldn\u2019t want to divulge that kinda information. But something tells me you won\u2019t tell anybody.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy lips are sealed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat. Oh, but in the worst case scenario where you were to tell anyone, please don\u2019t tell Liz. I\u2019ve already been late 6 times in the last fortnight and I don\u2019t want to give her another reason to chew me out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You might actually like that,</i> Emma thought to herself as she pictured Liz in Natalie\u2019s polo and slacks eating out her former pussy with stars in her eyes. Still she agreed not to tell anything to Liz (whether she\u2019d uphold it or not was yet to be seen\u2014she had her fingers crossed the whole time) and stifled her horny giggles until Luke had strutted out of the room and closed the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime to get acquainted, little buddy,\u201d Emma cackled as she plopped herself back into her swivel chair and undid Luke\u2019s bulky leather belt.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It turned out little Lukey wasn't so little.  The bulge was clearly visible in Luke's tight black boxers.  It had been revealed when Emma unzipped her fly.  She stood up.  As she did so she noticed her chair had already been adjusted for her new much taller height.  Her trousers slipped down her new legs by themselves.  They stopped just above her knees.  Emma took a second to admire her hairy thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed the waistband of her boxers and yanked them down.  They joined her trousers at knee level.  She sat down again.   The boxers were elasticated, so it enabled Emma to get her knees apart.  She looked downwards.  Little Lukey sat proudly between her thighs.  All the excitement so far had meant the penis was no longer soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma wasn't unfamiliar with the anatomy.  She'd seen Kyle's most nights for the last twenty odd years.  It still felt strange seeing a penis attached to her own body.  She lifted it up and looked at the large hairy ballsack underneath.  She cupped it and tried to gently squeeze the testicles like she did with Kyle when she was trying to getting him in the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma winced as she pinched into the wrinkled skin a little too hard.  She moved her hand back to the shaft, gently stroking it.   Emma was amazed how it was all right there in clear view, nothing was hidden.   If she had wanted to see her pussy properly she needed to use a mirror.  No such problem for a male body, yet another great advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed little Lukey a bit tighter, she could feel the tingle of pleasure shooting through her body.  The closest comparison she could think of was when she played with her clit.  The sensations were not completely different.  \"Oh, little Lukey.\" She said quietly in her new male voice.  It struck her that the pet name wasn't completely accurate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma grinned. \"Time for a bit of corporate re-branding don't you think?\" She asked the male organ.  \"Little Em, is such a better name.\"  The thought of giving a penis a female name aroused her even more.  Little Em became rigid in Emma's hand as the blood pumped into it. \"Oh yes.\"  Emma kept stroking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have a measuring tape to hand but she knew her husband was between five and six inches.  She did have bigger hands now which made the comparison more difficult but she believed her new appendage was a little larger, perhaps nearer seven inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sped up.  She could feel her muscles flexing in her arm as she took it up a gear.  The arousal built up in her body as she started to fantasize.   She tried thinking about women, it made logical sense, this was a male body after all.  She pictured naked versions of Liz, Natalie and even her own body.  She could feel the arousal build slowly.  Experimentally she pictured Kyle's naked body and the passion Emma felt rose quickly.  Precum leaked out of the tip.  She visualised more men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma found herself moaning, it sounded almost like a growl.  She knew now she could orgasm through stimulation of her prostate.   She imagined Kyle penetrating her, stimulating her.   The figures morphed in her mind as her imagination wandered.  Her cock seemed to become impossibly hard as she now pictured herself pushing her cock into Kyle.  It felt so right to the horny manager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I need that.\" She said out loud.  She took her other hand and brushed her small nipple through the shirt.  The anal sex turned into a blow job in her mind.  Her hands wrapped round Kyle's head.  The positions had been reversed so often, it was time she got a bit of payback in her imagination at least.  She could feel her climax approaching as she visualised emptying a load of cum down Kyle's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\"  She nearly started screaming.  She could hear people talking in the corridor outside.  Emma suppressed her screams and hissed out the pleasure of her climax.  Ropes of cum shot out of her dick.  They fired straight up and back down into her lap.  They coated her fingers.  It seemed never ending.  Eventually the stream of cum stopped.  The sensation had been overwhelming.   Unlike a female orgasm, she seemed to be returning to her senses much more quickly.  Emma looked at the huge pool of spunk and wondered how long it had been since Luke last came.  Had Rachel been holding out on him, she wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course she had to taste it.  She brought her fingers up to her lips.  The distinctive smell of sex was on them.  She licked her fingers with her tongue, it was salty as expected.  She went to grab her wipes but found them out of reach.  \"Oh dear, how am I going to clean up this cum without wipes.\"  She said mockingly as she scooped up another load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Emma's mind the sensation of the male orgasm was incredible.  It had been so similar but different.  She was so glad she had done it.  All it had cost was a day's 'vacation' pay as Luke had put it and the company paid that.  Emma wondered if Luke watched a lot of American television.  Going by his muscles she doubted he was much of a couch potato.  He was probably more of a gym rat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was finishing licking up the last of her cum, Emma heard a door unbolting.  An exhausted Liz emerged from the office toilet in Natalie's body.  She had decided against putting the heavily used underwear back on.  She had wrapped them in a ton of toilet paper and was now holding them in her hand.  She was so tired it took her several seconds to notice what Emma was up to.  \"Oh God Emma, not again.\" She said in a shocked voice. \"Can't you find somewhere else to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma stood up, pulling her boxers up over the now soft little Em.  \"Well I would have used the office toilet luv, but someone was in there rubbing one out.\" She said sarcastically as she pulled up her trousers.  Liz blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have waited.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Needs must and all that.  I couldn't concentrate on work at all.  I needed a quick wank.\"  Emma felt a little naughty using the colloquial term for male masturbation.  \"Did you get a good look at Natalie's tits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded.  \"They are really nice.  Solid too, she doesn't need a bra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a little jealous.  I should have checked them out while I had them.  Oh well maybe another time.  Do you want to keep that body for a bit?\" Emma asked her as she sat back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been fun.\" Liz admitted.  \"I'm starting to miss my cock though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Emma said before she processed what Liz had said. \"Wait, What?\" She boomed in surprise with Luke's voice.  Liz gave her a strange look.  \"You're a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Liz agreed, wondering why Emma was pointing out the obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you have a cock?\" Emma asked.  Liz nodded again surprised she was pointing out things anyone could see by looking.  \"Big boobs, brown hair, trouser suit, Prada shoes, that ring any bells?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it does.\" Emma smiled, good she wasn't going crazy after all. \"You are describing Luke.  I really need to speak to him about being out of uniform.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luke has big boobs?\"  Emma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Biggest in the store by a mile.  Got quite a nice ass too.\"  Liz said,  he didn't have the greatest figure but still very attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose he has now, but I meant before.\"  Emma knew this had to be the earrings doing.  She had to work out what exactly was going on.  \"How would you describe your own body?\" Emma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should know, you've got it.  Played with my cock right in the middle of the office.\" Emma shook her male head as she tried to grasp what exactly was going on.  This didn't go unnoticed by Liz.  She eyed Emma dubiously. \"You've done something with the earrings haven't you?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game was up.  Emma had been caught.  \"I wanted to try a man's body for a change, so I picked Luke.\" Liz had swapped with Emma to become Natalie.  This now meant Liz believed whatever body Emma had was in fact her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luke would be a weird choice, he basically looks like a woman.  I don't even think he has a penis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Emma could respond there was an unexpected knock at the door.  Now both Emma and Liz were decent, Liz decided to answer it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Liz.\" Natalie said from Emma's body oblivious to the fact that it was her own body she was speaking to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natalie?\" Liz asked slowly as she looked at Emma's former body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" She said as she walked into the office.  She turned to Emma.  \"I was just on my way back from the toilets.\" It was Natalie's  turn to  blush.  She'd spent some considerable time there 'thinking' about Luke in Liz's body having lesbian sex. \"I saw Luke on the shop floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad he wasn't skiving on the way back from here.\" Emma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you decide against the swap then?\" Natalie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I've done it.\"  Emma told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why has Luke still got his own body and why have you still got mine?\"  Emma put her head in her large hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not you too?\" Emma asked rhetorically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" Liz turned to face Natalie, \"Emma isn't in your body, she's in mine.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Whilst Natalie and Liz bickered with increasing passion in the supervisors\u2019 office, a certain swapped Wilkos worker was idly going through their tasks on the lower level of the store. Luke sang an old pop song to himself as he stacked the shelf in front of him with dog food, his voice actually quite scintillating with its feminine tone and soprano warble. He\u2019d plugged a couple earbuds into his ear, claiming they were for his own motivation, and quietly began to  bust a move as he worked, moonwalking, cabbage patching and just generally shaking his motherly butt to the rhythm of the music. In normal circumstances he wouldn\u2019t even attempt to do something like this but for some reason Emma, Liz and Natalie had been sporadically absent all day and didn\u2019t seem to be interested in interacting with any of the staff, leaving that hot little thing, Stefania, to try and sort out everything herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke smiled as he thought of her. Sure, there\u2019d been plenty of eye catching ladies roaming around the store from time to time. He\u2019d even had a crush on his coworker Rebekah for the longest time before he\u2019d hooked up with his now fianc\u00e9e! However, something about the young lady intrigued him; maybe it was the oversized glasses bobbing up and down in the bridge of her nose, maybe it was that melodic Polish accentuation that made the hairs on the back of his neck curl, or maybe it was the fact that she was simply drop dead gorgeous. The buxom form and cute button nose seemed to really do it for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had half a mind to copy some of his working cohorts and materialise a fake query out of the sky just to approach her and try to make a lingering impression on her. In his heart he knew it\u2019d be pointless though: his body\u2019d just turned thirty-eight, a whole thirteen years older than the beautiful blonde and though he hadn\u2019t yet borne a child yet be still had strange stretch marks that he felt disfigured him slightly. His boobs may have been humongous (a fact that he was certainly very proud of) and his butt may\u2019ve been decently sized but his curves were average at best and he\u2019d grown tiny \u2018love handles\u2019 on his sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No worries,</i> he thought to himself as he stared at his pretty face in the reflection of the glass display, <i>Nothing a few hours of hard sweating can\u2019t work off.</i> He flexed confidently in the mirror, silently pondering over where all of the muscle mass he should\u2019ve gained in his gym sessions had gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee, the power of the earrings were absolutely amazing in terms of altering the realities of those who wore them. He was completely oblivious to the fact that he currently possessed Liz\u2019s womanly figure. Natalie and Liz were upstairs arguing over ownership of his original body and he neither knew nor cared. In his eyes he\u2019d been like this for all his life\u2014there may\u2019ve been a slight memory blip for the first eleven years of it (due to the age disparity between him and Liz) but apart from that he\u2019d had all his most significant memories with this body. His first time falling off a bike, his first kiss, his first time borrowing his mum\u2019s dildo, all of them were linked to Liz\u2019s body now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke temporarily paused his music as he heard a tiny wooshing notification sound. He opened up his phone and dropped his jaw as he gaped at a lewd photo his fianc\u00e9e had shot him over on Instagram. He salivated as he looked at her topless body wrapped in nothing but a towel with high white schoolgirl socks on her feet. In bold white letters above she wrote <i>\u2018Like what u see hubby?\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMost definitely,\u201d he mumbled as he licked his lips and sent her a couple horny texts to get her blood rushing. He\u2019d been planning to go and whack himself off in the bathroom at lunchtime like he\u2019d told Emma but his libido was surprisingly high today and his partially tight coochie was beginning to drip into his tight thong. He silently took his leave from his post, clacking away on his Prada heels in the direction of the men\u2019s toilet. </span></div></div>",

She was looking at Liz and pointing at herself.  \"This is Emma's body right?\" She asked Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Liz said.  She was happy to admit that Natalie was occupying Emma's original body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which means, if I have Emma's body, she's got mine.  It's common sense.\"  Liz shook her head.  The head that was currently on Natalie's original body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're wrong.  I know that isn't your body,\" she pointed at her manager, who was sitting behind her desk, \"that Emma is in.\"  Liz knew that because she was aware she was in Natalie's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if that's not my body Liz,\" it was Natalie's turn to point at Emma, \"then where the hell is it?\" Natalie asked.  Liz was about to tell her but decided against it when she saw Emma looking at her, shaking her head slightly.  Emma was making it clear to Liz she wasn't to tell Natalie.  \"I can't tell you that.  It's need to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need to know!?\" Natalie practically screamed. \"It's my bloody body.\"  The angry Natalie went to grab Liz who put her hands out to defend herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma decided to intervene. \"Calm down luv,\" she told Natalie, \"I'm sure we can sort this out without you turning it into a scrap.\" Showing a great deal of restraint Natalie put her hands down.  Now the threat had decreased, Liz relaxed too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma wondered how it had come to this.  Were the earrings just too powerful? Had she made some sort of mistake with them?  She was trying to concentrate and work out what had gone wrong.   The constant fighting between the next two highest members of staff was making that all but impossible.  They had been arguing in circles since Natalie got here ten minutes ago.  \"You know, I think it might be better if I spoke to you individually.\" Emma told them.  Splitting them up for now seemed to be the best plan.  \"Natalie.  Can you wait outside please.  I'll speak to you shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" Natalie said as she gave Liz one last death stare.  She span around and walked out the office, slamming the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She has lost it, big time.\" Liz commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think she has.\" Emma said cautiously.  She was mulling over the swaps in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't seriously suggesting that you have her body.  I have her body.\" Liz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that luv but...,\" the pieces were coming together like a jigsaw in her mind, \"from her point of view, I think it is.  The last person she swapped with was me.  She's going to think I have her body no matter who I swap with.  The only time she'll be convinced I'm not her is if I swap with her directly again.  I could get her to wear the earrings, that might do something.\"  Emma reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz looked shocked.  \"You're not giving her my beautiful body.\" She said as she pointed at Emma.  \"I don't want to be stuck as her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't complaining earlier.\" Emma told her referring to the jilling session Liz experienced in the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I won't deny I enjoyed it but I don't want to be stuck as her.  It's making me feel a little odd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odd?\" Emma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't feel like a proper woman without my penis.\"  Emma shook her head in disbelief.  \"Oh I don't expect you to understand.  When I was a young girl I hated it.  It caused me a lot of embarrassment but as I got older I came to terms with it.  I'm quite proud of it now.\"  Another thought occurred to Liz. \"Oh my God, what's Eric going to think?  He loves playing with little Lizzy.\"  It appeared even Liz had a pet name for Luke's penis which she believed to be her own.  She didn't realise that Eric wouldn't be any the wiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Emma said without any emotion.  She was so surprised by Liz's revelations she could barely express her emotions.  \"We need to get this sorted out.\"  Emma thought of a possible solution.  She scribbled out a few drawings to represent the effects of swaps.  \"I was thinking of getting Natalie to wear the earrings but I think maybe you should instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wouldn't get me my body back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll just have to trust me.\" Emma told her as she passed over the earrings.  Liz put them on and everything went a little fuzzy, for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz no longer saw Emma sitting behind the desk.  \"That's Luke!\" Liz almost screamed as she saw Emma's true body.  Emma shushed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it down, Natalie's just outside the door.  I don't want her knowing.\" She said quietly.  Liz smiled at the manager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bloke's body? That's kind of kinky, even for you.\" Emma smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right?\" Emma grabbed one of her biceps.  \"I can't get over the muscles.  I am just so sexy and manly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, does that mean Luke has my body now?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afraid so luv.  I'm sure he'll have fun with it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet.\" Liz eyes opened wide.  \"He's got a fiancee, a woman.\"  Liz put her hand of her mouth. \"He'll be having lesbian sex in my body.\"  Emma felt little Em tingle at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh.\" Emma bit her lip. \"How does that make you feel?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz stood there silently for a few seconds.  She put her hands to her crotch. \"Dammit, I'm soaking again and I've no knickers on.  I'm glad these trousers are black.\"  Emma couldn't help but laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sudden knock at the door.  \"What's going on Emma?\" Natalie asked from the other side.  \"You've been ages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma leaned towards Liz. \"Okay you need to tell Natalie that you don't think I have your body any more.\" She told her, quickly and quietly.   Emma turned towards the door and shouted. \"Just a minute!\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I don't have it, Luke's got it.  We've established that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't tell her that part, she won't believe you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you see Natalie.  I didn't understand how the earrings worked until Emma explained it.\" Liz lied partially to the staff supervisor.  \"You sometimes have to concentrate for the magic to work properly.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you admit Emma still has my body?\" Natalie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes absolutely.\" A somewhat over eager Liz told her.  Natalie turned her attention to Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you agree that you haven't swapped with Luke yet?\" She asked Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no.  I simply misspoke earlier.  I meant to correct myself but with you two arguing, I could barely get a word in.\" Emma explained. Natalie blushed with embarrassment for acting so foolish.  \"You don't mind staying in my old body for a bit?\" Emma asked.  Natalie shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I do miss my cock a little though.  I feel kind of lost without it.  You probably find that weird.  When I was a kid it used to be an embarrassment for me.\"  Emma got a sudden sense of deja vu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure as you've got older you came to terms with it and you're proud of it now.\" Emma said, aping Liz's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Natalie admitted, thinking Emma was almost telepathic. \"I am worried about Mike, he'll be lost without little Natty to play with.\"  Emma had to make a conscious effort to keep a straight face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It-it's all right.  He's not aware of the swap.  You'll get to experience sex with a pussy.\"  Natalie screwed her face up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd really want to be swapped back before then.  It would be kind of weird to make love to my husband like that.  Emma, we already discussed this.\"  Emma remembered a slightly different version of the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't make any promises, we have been kind of busy.  I did explain it might not be possible depending on swaps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose one night wouldn't hurt.\" Natalie agreed.  She really hoped Emma would take pity on her and let her swap back into her original body.  She was also slowly coming round to the idea of sex with her husband in her current form.  The more she thought about it the hornier she got.  It felt strange to her not feeling the hardness of an erection in her knickers.  \"Well if I don't see you downstairs, I'll catch you tonight.\" Natalie said referring to their original dinner plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she returned to the shop floor in a good mood, Natalie couldn't help feeling that somehow Emma and Liz hadn't been totally honest with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think we can call that a successful resolution to an interpersonal staffing conflict.\" Emma told Liz as she typed on up her daily work report.  Liz who was at her own desk didn't respond.  Emma looked up from her screen.  Liz's eyes were closed.  \"Liz!\" Emma shouted in Luke's deep voice.  Liz opened her eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Emma I'm knackered.\" Natalie's body had been through a lot in the last few hours.  \"I think I might call it a day.\"  She just wanted to head home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you here though.  You know I'm lost without you.\" An idea came to her. Emma picked up the earrings.  \"You know if you got another body, you could stay till the end of the shift.\"  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m sure if we could find a suitable replacement bod, we could...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if Emma had physically summoned someone with just her verbal willpower, there came a sudden and unexpected knock at the door. Liz and Emma\u2019s heads swivelled round rapidly. Emma motioned towards her lips before tiptoeing to the window beside the door and cautiously peeping out through the blinds. Who she saw must have excited her as she flipped the blinds back into place and eagerly pulled the latch of the door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn stepped Lexi, the youngest (and newest) member of the Wilko staff. Her hands were tucked nervously behind her back and she rolled her ankles in circles anxiously with her head dropped low. Emma observed the young girl with giddy glee; no doubt about it, she was one hell of an attractive girl. She was much developed for her tender age, voluptuous and curvier than most of her older counterparts already\u2014Emma envied her for this; when she herself had been a young stupid seventeen-year-old she hadn\u2019t been blessed with beauty, rather she\u2019d had to grow into her own body and reinvent herself from an awkward period of dorky spectacles, acne and adult braces. Lexi also had a beautiful complexion, mocha-skin that looked creamed and glittered in the normally unflattering office light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she had a huge mischievous smile plastered on her face, Emma didn\u2019t want to scare the girl away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, babe, how\u2019re you doing? C\u2019mon, no need to stand up, sit down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma pulled a chair from the side of the room and placed it in front of her and Liz\u2019s shared desk, putting Lexi in the uncomfortable position of having both her managers\u2019 curious eyes focused on her. Emma steepled her fingers and softened her expression before saying, \u201cSo, Lexi, what brings you to our humble office today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Poor girl,</i> Emma thought as she watched Lexi squirm in her seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...\u201d Lexi looked like she wanted to say something important but decided against it at the last moment. She apprehensively twiddled with her black braids. \u201c...someone on the shop floor told me that Luke got a vacation day for doing a questionnaire or something, I dunno.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes he did, Lexi! Would you for any reason be interest-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, Lexi, but would you mind if me and Emma had a little chat, just the two of us?\u201d Emma turned to Liz and frowned incredulously. \u201cJust wait outside, poppet,\u201d Emma said, wondering what Liz so desperately needed to talk about as Lexi walked back out of the room. Once the door had closed completely Emma burst out of her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell was that, Liz?! We were literally <i>this</i> close to using the earrings and swapping your bodies!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that, but didn\u2019t you see the look on her face? Something\u2019s on her mind, something that she doesn\u2019t necessarily want to discuss with us but feels important enough to inform us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c \u2018The look on her face\u2019? C\u2019mon Liz, maybe you\u2019re reading into this too much. Yeah she looked a bit tense but that\u2019s probably because she\u2019s still a newbie. How many times has she physically spoken to us since her interview, twice, three times? When I was her age I would never even have the balls to even look my manager in the eye!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Liz snickered, betraying her stoicism. \u201cYou seem to have more than enough balls now.\u201d Both women began to giggle between themselves at the inside joke. \u201cYou clown,\u201d Emma chuckled, playfully slapping Liz on the back (which, unsurprisingly, hurt quite a bit with Luke\u2019s toned muscles).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut in all seriousness,\u201d Liz continued, \u201cShe looked upset about something or other. I know we\u2019re having a lot of laughs screwing around with the earrings and all that, but at some point we have to prioritise our responsibilities as senior members of staff over our personal enjoyment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how do you want to play it? Do you want me to call her back in for the swap?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Making the management team more productive should be a consideration too.\"  Emma said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true.\" Liz agreed before covering her mouth as she yawned again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma put her weight on her back foot, giving the impression she was assessing the situation.  \"Let's compromise then, if your conscience is bothering you.  We'll do the swap and then ask her what's wrong.  A new body won't change whatever problems she is having.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are being more sympathetic than I expected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just because I'm a man now, it hasn't turned me into a monster.   I still care about people.\"  Emma pictured Lexi in her head.  \"She's quite the little stunner.  If I wasn't enjoying having a cock so much, I'd been tempted to swap myself.\"  She told Liz bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma went to sit at her desk as Liz ushered Lexi back into the office.  \"Sorry about that luv.\" Liz said to her. \"A confidential management matter came up.\"  Emma pointed at the seat.  Lexi still feeling nervous sat down as Liz shut the door and stood behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you were interested in an extra day off?\" Emma asked.  Lexi nodded.  \"I don't know who you've been talking to downstairs but we better get a few things straight.  There are only a limited number of slots available.\"  This was true, if Emma kept handing out paid time off like sweets at Halloween, it would draw attention from her superiors. \"Also the participants are supposed to be picked at random.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't realise...\" Lexi said, she was worried she'd messed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get yourself in a tizzy about it.  We can make an exception in your case.  I'll sort out any trouble from the area manager.\"  Emma's ploy was straight from the big book of manager's dirty tricks.  Step 1 - Imply employee messed up big time when they did nothing wrong.  Step 2 - Fix 'mess up' at great personal cost.  Result - Employee is now eternally grateful and loyal forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I have to do?\" Lexi asked, desperately wanted to appease Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma picked up the earrings. \"Just put on one of these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA somewhat confused Lexi sat in front of Emma's desk.  Now she was in Natalie's body of course.  Emma had cut right to the chase and hadn't went into any long winded explanations.  Emma had asked her to put an earring on which she had done.  For some reason, unclear to Lexi, Liz had put one on too.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi had then found herself giving her earring to Liz.  She handed them to Emma who had then put both them on.  Lexi was bewildered by the  whole process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand.\" Lexi said as Emma took the earrings off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it.\" Emma said, she didn't want Lexi thinking about it too much. \"I'll sort out all the paperwork and add the extra day off on to your allowance by the end of the week.\"  Lexi was surprised how little work she had to do.  Emma glanced towards Liz in Lexi's body before looking back at Lexi.  \"I couldn't help feeling there was something else you wanted to discuss.  How's life in general?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi nodded. \"Up and down, I suppose.  It's just Marcus...\" She trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, man trouble.\" Emma said in an understanding tone.  \"I should have guessed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We haven't had as much time together as we'd like.  We both work full time.  When we do get together he seems distant, like he's not interested.\"  Lexi found herself pouring her heart out to her manager.  Her middle-aged female manager, who herself was in the body of a young man.  Emma nodded sympathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, err, putting it politely, how's your love life?\" Emma asked.  Lexi blushed after such a personal question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, we don't do that much.\" She admitted. Emma smiled as she comprehended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, there's your problem.  You need to up your game.  If you know what I mean.\"  Emma said employing a euphemism.  Lexi seem to perk up after hearing Emma's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think that would help?\" Lexi asked.  Emma nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me Lexi, if you both do <i>it</i> more, he'll soon be treating you like a different person.\"  Emma barely managed to stifle a grin as she looked at Liz standing behind her.  Liz was smiling and shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do that, actually I'm going to see him tonight.\" Lexi said loudly and confidently.  Suddenly she was overcome with a wave of tiredness.  She put her hand to her mouth covering her embarrassed yawn. \"I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You feeling okay?\" Emma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I've been really tired today for some reason.  I've been really distracted.\"  She yawned again.  Emma mulled it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't help with your boyfriend.  I'll tell you what, if you don't mind losing the pay, you can finish an hour early today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you.  I might be able to get a nap then.\" A grateful but tired Lexi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll phone Natalie,\" she of course was actually talking to Natalie's body, \"and let her know.\"  Lexi nodded.  \"Well if that's everything?\" Emma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes.\" Lexi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, off you trot.\" Emma said pointing at the door.  Lexi nodded and got up.  Liz opened the door for her and she walked off down the corridor.\" Liz closed the door.  Both of them waited a few seconds, until Lexi was well out of earshot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both burst into uncontrolled laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...treating you, ...like a, ...different person.\" Liz managed to say between laughs, mimicking Emma's words<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Natalie's body will be getting some tonight.\" Emma said before bucking her male hips and howling with laughter again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they were struggling for breath, tears streaming down their faces.  They tried to calm themselves down.  The room became  quiet again, which felt kind of strange to both of them.  Liz pointed at something and she was soon splitting her sides with laughter again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Emma asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not..., she's not...,\" Liz couldn't get the words out as she pointed to a small bundle of toilet paper, \"...got any knickers on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma's face stretched before a huge belly laugh came out.  \"That'll speed things up tonight then.\" That set off Liz once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually it all came to an end and the two 'women' settled down.  Liz had borrowed Emma's vanity mirror and was sitting in her seat, checking out her new face. She couldn't wait to have a good look when she got home.  She could have made another trip to the toilet but she'd already wasted too much time in there.  \"Lexi is so beautiful.  How could her boyfriend resist this?\" She asked as she played with her new braids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma giggled a little, reminded of the earlier conversation and the laughter.  \"I know.\" Emma glanced over Lexi's former body and felt her penis move a little. \"I must confess, I'm getting some very unwomanly urges, when I look at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz grinned. \"I'm very flattered Emma but I'm not into women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Emma's turn to grin.  \"Do I look like a woman to you?\" She said seductively as she pointed at her male body with both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit your flirting, you tease.\" Liz said as she held up a mocha coloured hand. Her eyebrows pressed together.  \"How does that work anyway, aren't you still straight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm totally straight and so is my husband.\" Emma said slightly sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's kind of what I meant.  How can you be into women, when you and Kyle are gay now?\" Liz asked.  Emma actually had been thinking about this since getting Luke's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't know for certain till I get home but I suspect Kyle is still ninety-nine percent straight.  He'll find women attractive but he'll hopefully be gay for me.\"  Liz was still confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why should that affect how you feel?\" Liz asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If being attracted to women is good enough for Kyle it's good enough for me.  I want to know what it's like.\" Emma told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With the reality changes though, if you acted on your urges, you'd come across as a lesbian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Emma sighed, disappointed, \"I know, weird isn't it?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Still it did little but thin out the weak-willed from the determined few, the latter of which doubled their resolves once Steven acknowledged their antics. One specific old bastard with a wonky eye and a row of rotted teeth refused to stop stalking Steven as he moved around the store, skulking behind and mirroring his every move for  a solid minute or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven peeped over his shoulder once more then ducked into the frozen food aisle, panting heavily. Steven breathed a sigh of relief as he watched the creepy guy start sniffing around in an aisle three rows down before eventually losing interest and exiting the store. \u201cHopefully that\u2019s the last of the sleazebags that I\u2019ll bump into today...\u201d Steven mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an ironic twist of fate, as if done by a higher power themselves, Steven pirouetted round and collided face to someone stood suspiciously close to him and roughly toppled to the ground, grazing his elbow slightly.

His cheeks blushed a bright crimson\u2014he\u2019d always been a nervous wreck around ladies\u2014before he picked himself up quickly, brushing himself down and puffing his chest out in a masculine manner, unintentionally giving the figure in front of him a pretty decent view of his buxom cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven finally took a moment to look at the person who\u2019d apologised. \u201cOh,\u201d he said, slumping his shoulders and frowning slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s you, Luke.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven rolled his eyes. Even with Luke\u2019s melodic tones he couldn\u2019t believe he hadn\u2019t recognised his coworker. They may\u2019ve not been anything more than occasional drinking acquaintances after work hours but they\u2019d worked together long enough to build a decently amicable relationship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven tutted impatiently as Luke stood across from him, nervously tucking a lock of light brown hair behind his ear and anxiously twiddling his fingers. \u201cStefania, I am so, <i>so</i> sorry about that. I was just walking through the store, minding my business and all that, when I had an idea and I wanted to ask you to...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo what, Luke?\u201d Steven\u2019s lips were now unconsciously pursed into a passive-aggressive line, an idiosyncrasy he\u2019d picked up from his body\u2019s previous owner. \u201cCmon, spit it out.\u201d It\u2019d been a long day and Steven just wasn\u2019t in the mood. He tapped the tip of the ballet flats Liz had loaned him onto the cold tiled floor frustratedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...\u201d Luke\u2019s mouth bent into an \u2018o\u2019 to speak but his eyes locked onto Steven\u2019s gash. \u201cOh my god, I\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m such a klutz!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven shrugged, still trying to display some semblance of machismo. \u201cNah, don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s just a scratch, doesn\u2019t even hurt,\u201d he lied though his teeth. Nonetheless Luke sidled up to his side, caressing the skin around the graze with the gentle, experienced touch of his manicured fingers, assessing and probing it with his thumb and forefingers whilst his hot breath raised the hairs on the back of Steven\u2019s neck, inexplicably giving Steven arousing chills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI studied sport science before I worked here,\u201d Luke said with an infectious grin. \u201cTell you what: how about we both head over to the medical aisle, grab some rubbing alcohol and a couple bandages and sneak into the bathroom to get you patched up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Steven really was getting hot under his collar. He cursed his feminine body for the strange and erotic thoughts coursing through his head, hoping above all else that Luke couldn\u2019t tell that he was practically soaking his thong at the prospect of alone time with him. \u201cErm, I-I don\u2019t kn-know, Emma and Liz left me in charge, y\u2019know, and I...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Stef,\u201d Luke laughed. \u201cOops, sorry for calling you Stef, boss. And yeah, you\u2019ll be gone for a little while but it\u2019s been quite a slow day anyway. There\u2019s not gonna be any urgent problems round here and even if there are most of these lads and ladies have been working here for years, they should already know what to do by now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven debated it in his head for a second or two. \u201cOne minute,\u201d he said sternly. \u201cNo more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeven minutes later and Luke and Steven were already five minutes into a hot and heavy make out session. It was raw and rough, both men absolutely ravenous with each trying to assert their dominance over the other. Luke attacked Steven with a flurry of kisses, planting them all over from his face, to his neck, to his cheeks and even sending a few wet ones to Steven\u2019s midriff. Steven, though hesitant at first, had quickly learnt the ropes of his new body. The sensual way he manoeuvred and writhed inside the cramped confines of the stall felt like second nature to him and as he grew in confidence his mind shut down and his body\u2019s muscle memory swiftly and effortlessly took control. As of right now Steven had three of his fingers plunged deep into Luke\u2019s 38-year-old snatch and pumped his fingers in and out, smiling maniacally as Luke shivered under his touch and bit his lip to stop himself from crying out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in his lust, Steven was too inebriated by his own erotic pleasure to really consider the implications of what he was actually doing. In his mind he knew he wasn\u2019t gay; far from it considering he\u2019d crushed on practically every female that had walked through those Wilkos sliding doors. In his defence Luke actually appealed to him a lot aesthetically because of all his womanly features\u2014he was voluptuous in the sense that he possessed a slim-ish waist and a nice pair of curves leading to a fat bubble-butt but still was \u2018in Steven\u2019s league\u2019 in the sense that Luke had the same pudgy \u2018love handles' on his sides that Steven had been blessed with in his old form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe situation had started off pretty rudimentary with Luke and Steven sneaking into the sparsely populated men\u2019s bathroom and Luke applying his physiotherapist knowledge to Steven\u2019s injury. Following a few moments of awkward squirming Luke finally admitted why he\u2019d wanted to speak to \u2018Stefania\u2019 in the first place, to politely ask if he would be allowed to quickly satiate his surreptitious urges with \u2018her\u2019 inside the stall. Steven, in any other scenario, would\u2019ve rejected Luke flat out but for whatever reason he decided against that path\u2014whether it was his exhaustion, his frustration or even the lustful curiosity that\u2019d been building up inside him since the initial swap, he didn\u2019t know. What he did know was that right here, right now, he was not plain, boring old square Steven who got walked on by those that acknowledged him and was ignored by those who didn\u2019t. No, he was Stefania, the new, Polish bombshell of an assistant supervisor who could turn men (and a couple women he suspected) into putty in his hands and manipulate them anyway he saw fit. Plus, how he could he say no to those sparkling sapphire eyes and those huge, heaving tits? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad Steven known that the body Luke currently possessed formerly belonged to his friend and longtime unrequited love, Liz, it probably would\u2019ve increased his horniness tenfold and he would\u2019ve creamed his thong even before the first kisses were exchanged. Alas, the power of the earrings was great and neither party was aware of that specific tidbit of information. It didn\u2019t hamper their interactions nonetheless and soon, after swapping roles and having Luke perform what seemed like expertly practiced connilingus to his snatch, both climaxed, Luke\u2019s more mature equipment tapping out just before Steven followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven exhaled blissfully, revelling in his first experience of a female orgasm. He began to giggle childishly, the absurdity of the circumstance finally catching up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Luke grinned. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven chuckled. \u201cThis...I mean, you\u2019re you and I\u2019m me...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven had to hold his tongue before he let out something he couldn\u2019t take back. \u201cNothing. I mean, I\u2019m the new stand-in assistant supervisor and already on the first day I\u2019m making out with one of my employees!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI for one am glad we shared this moment, Steffie. I can finally cross <i>\u2018make out with my hot boss in the work bathrooms\u2019</i> off my bucket list!\u201d They both chuckled. Luke leaned in for a tender peck on the lips and Steven refrained from refusing it. The sound of them sucking each other\u2019s lips seemed deafening in Steven\u2019s ears. \u201cAre you...sure that...it\u2019s okay...for us...to do this?\u201d Steven mumbled in between kisses and as he massaged Luke\u2019s perky nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat Rachel doesn\u2019t know won\u2019t kill her,\u201d Luke said with a dopey smile. \u201cPlus she already knows that I need to blow off some steam during work, one way or another. She\u2019s really chill about this stuff and with the way my pussy\u2019s been dripping all day, I think she\u2019d make an exception.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute or two later and Steven stepped out of the bathroom, his glasses wonky with the lenses shattered, his unevenly cropped hair looking messier than it had beforehand and with a mysterious damp stain on the hem of his short polo. Luke followed suit half a minute later, staggering his exit so no suspicion would be aroused. Steven blushed as Luke strode past and gave a sly wink, dropping a paper into Steven\u2019s palm. Steven unfurled it and giggled:  Luke had written his number down with the message, <i>\u2018Hit me up again if you\u2019re ready for some superior-on-inferior action again!\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d definitely be interested, Luke,\u201d Steven laugher to himself. For the first time today, being stuck in this random woman\u2019s body didn\u2019t seem to be so bad.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Emma lifted her head up from the computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounded like laughter.\" Emma said.  \"It sounded like it came from our toilet.\" She looked over at the office toilet.   Liz looked towards it too as the door slowly creaked open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprise!\" A voice said.  Out of the small room stepped Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you doing in there?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arriving.\" He said with a huge grin on his face.  \"I can't get over how different you two look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look pretty different yourself.\" Liz told him. \"You look like you've aged ten years.\"  Steven smiled at that comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven's hair was thinner and greyer than it had been the previous day.  In fact he was balding pretty badly.  It wasn't the only thing different about him.  He had a few more wrinkles on his face for one thing.  His Wilko polo had a giant white 'W' on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis name badge was now illuminated by some sort of colour changing light.  The text was on some sort of small graphic display and was alternating every few seconds between 'STEVEN', 'WILKO' and 'ASST. MANAGER'.  He was also wearing new glasses which appeared to have some blinking lights in them too.  The whole look was in a word - distracting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always were the clever one Liz.\" He said.  \"I am here from the future, ten years in fact.  I have travelled in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma looked up from her computer.  She was used to Steven's hi-jinks so had been largely ignoring him until now. \"Have you been sniffing the cheap air fresheners from the car care aisle again?\" She asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm trying to explain.  I came here from the future using this.\" He held up a small hand-held device covered in buttons. \"It allows me to travel in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why are you here?\" A sceptical Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To bring you gifts from the future.\" He looked around.  \"Oops I forgot to bring her, again.\" He pushed a few buttons and there was a bright flash of light that briefly blinded Emma and Liz.  Steven's future glasses automatically darkened to prevent eye damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding besides Steven now was Carly.  Dressed as fashionably as ever.  There were a few streaks of grey in her blonde hair.  Under her eyes was some rainbow coloured glittery make up.  \"About time.\" She said angrily to Steven.  \"I've been waiting ages.  If you can't learn how to work that thing properly,\" she pointed at Steven's device, \"I'm taking it off you.\"  She looked around and noticed Emma and Liz who were both staring at her, obviously shocked.  \"Hi ladies, I'm from the future, blah, blah, blah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is incredible.\" Said an amazed Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It changes my whole world view.\" Said an equally amazed Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I get it,\" Steven said, somewhat annoyed, \"when I tell you, I'm from the future, nobody believes me but when Carly says it everyone's like wow, this is incredible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up,\" Carly said, \"we've got work to do.\"  She handed Steven a very large carrier bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes.\" Steven said as he started explaining to Liz and Emma. \"In the future we have a bit of an issue.  All this crazy stuff keeps turning up in the store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In my salon too.\" Carly added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of crazy stuff?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All sorts of magical items and weird technology.   You name it and it has appeared - spell books, ray guns, amulets, potions, strange clocks, glowing crystals, board games, bizarre helmets not to mention a small mountain of remote controls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Said Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" Steven continued, \"Liz, she's the manager now, has been locking it all away in the safe.\" Steven pointed at the safe behind Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, where am I in the future?\" A curious Emma asked.  Steven and Carly exchanged a panicked look with each other before Steven turned back round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So anyway,\" he carried on without replying to Emma, \"the safe is full to bursting.  No more room.  We needed somewhere to take the items.  I'd just about figured out this time travel thing.\" He waved the device again. \"Carly, and I discussed it and I came up with the idea of spreading it all through the history of the shop.  That way we keep our present free of all this strange stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz thought that Steven hadn't thought this through very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked up to Emma's desk.  \"So this is for you.\" He emptied out about half the contents of the bag on her desk.  \"Gifts from the future.\"  He handed the bag back to Carly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going now?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven started pushing buttons on the device.  He started waving his arms around \"We're going to grab our Furbies, Rubik's cubes and our hula-hoops.  We're going to slip on our winkle-pickers and our hot-pants, listen to some cool tunes on our cassette walkmans and head off to the nineteen nineties.\" He pushed a button and vanished in a flash of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly was left behind.  \"I don't think Steven has a good grasp of pop culture.\" She told them.  Liz nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think Steven has a good grasp of anything.\" Liz said just before Carly vanished too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma looked at the pile of random objects on her desk.  \"We've no idea what any of this stuff does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or how it works.\" Liz added.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Some of the scribbles were on the object directly where there was enough space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it mean?\" Emma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like the people from the future at least tried to figure them out.

The button at the bottom was a shaped like a triangle pointing down the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a small label next to each button.  \"This is covered in cocks.\" Emma said as she held it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Liz asked as she took it from her.

There was something moving in her knickers, something very unfeminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe residual pleasure was washed away in the panic that came over her.

When she stood up, she felt it move again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill in a panic, Emma glanced downwards.  Nothing was visibly wrong, from the outside at least.  Taking the remote with her, she walked towards the office toilet with a slightly more masculine gait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside she quickly snibbed the door. She put the remote down on top of the wash basin.  She quickly unfastened her trousers and pulled them down.  There in her pink knickers was a small but noticeable bulge.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She hadn't done this standing up and the pleasure nearly knocked her off her two inch heels.  \"Better sit down first.\" She said quietly to herself.  She walked over to the toilet, the best she could manage, as her trousers were round her ankles.  The lid was already down, so she backed up and sat down.  She leaned back a little to get a better view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at the bulge as she pressed the button.  She had to make a strong effort not to moan with the arousal as she continued to hold the button down.  Before her very eyes the bulge grew, slow enough that she could enjoy it but fast enough so it was easily visible.   \"Wow.\" Was all she could say as her eyes grew wider as her bulge grew longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the waistband of her pink knickers started to pull away from her body she decided that was enough for now.  Emma quickly released the button.  The tube shape was clear now, pressing against the fabric.  She decided to try the other buttons before she examined it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held down the third button, that was also shaped like a triangle.  Fairly quickly her waistband popped back into place as her bulge started to shrink.  The function of the control was kind of obvious to Emma now that she thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis left the rectangular button in the middle.  She wondered what the 'R' stood for on the label.  She pressed it.  She almost screamed in horror as the bulge rapidly disappeared.  \"Nooooo....\" She whispered angrily as she was returned to her regular camel toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately she pressed the first button and to her relief the bulge returned, slowly growing, like her arousal.  As it grew she thought about the middle button.  It was possibly some sort of reset, that was logical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was happy with its size she stopped.  It was bigger than when she came into the room but smaller than the knicker stretching size it had been.  She wanted to be able to get her underwear off easily.  Emma put the remote down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed the fabric of her underwear and pulled it down.   There on her crotch, instead of a pussy was a penis.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Surprisingly, the first thing that popped into Emma's head when she saw her new cock was her husband Kyle.  She thought how much it reminded her of his penis.  It was the one she was most familiar with after all.  She wondered how big it was.  She really needed some way of measuring it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew her hand was a pretty good gauge of size so she wrapped her fingers round it.   The waves of pleasure immediately returned as she made contact with the skin.  Pulling upwards she could see her ballsack underneath her fingers.  It was the complete male package.  She felt it grow harder in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter experimentally feeling it, she decided it was a little smaller than Kyle's.  She could easily rectify that though.  She held down the button on the remote and she could feel the cock grow larger in her hand.  It wasn't unlike feeling a growing erection but she knew she was already erect.  Her balls moved by themselves as they redistributed their new weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued to grow, she could feel  her fingers getting spread further apart.  She was definitely bigger than Kyle now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer knickers were in danger of getting snagged again, so she stopped briefly to move them over her knees.  She quickly resumed pressing the button.  She was getting heavily stimulated.  Touching the cock was arousing her, as was the sensation of it growing.  It felt incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did notice the growth rate was changing as time went on.  It had been quite rapid to begin with and although still observable, it was significantly slower.  Her girth was increasing proportionally so it made sense, still she couldn't help getting a little frustrated by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a minute she had grown so large that she believed she could have challenged Darrell for the title of biggest cock in the store.  That was assuming the rumours were true.  Hers was easily nine inches long now.  Emma looked on fascinated as it continued to grow.  Her fingers were being opened up so much she had to briefly loosen her grip, so that she could re-postion them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed the cock downwards slightly.  Forcing it into a nearly horizontal position the cock almost reached her knees.  In Emma's mind it was both obscene and stunning.  She felt herself get dizzy with excitement.  There was so much blood getting pumped into her cock it was slowing the oxygen supply to her brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with the other enjoyable sensations, this pushed Emma to a whole new level of pleasure.  She hadn't even started stroking it yet.   Luckily she had the common sense to stop before she fainted.  Reluctantly, she let go of the button.  Still in a semi-dazed state she looked down, marvelling at the absolutely huge dick that was between her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as it looked awesome, she knew it wasn't very practical.  After enjoying the view for a few more seconds she reluctantly held down the third button on the device.  The penis slowly started to reduce in size.  She let go and let it bob around by itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe released the button somewhere between Kyle's and estimated Darrell's sizes.  Probably in the region on seven and a half inches.  Once more she put down the remote.  She grabbed her penis again and began to slide her fingers along it's length.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Emma was discovering how the remote worked in the toilet.  Liz had made her own discovery.  Her eye had been drawn to one of the items on Emma's desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked it up to examine it.  It was a metallic silver tube about five inches long, that resembled a pen light or laser pointer.  Liz checked the end, there was no bulb or laser, just a small hole.  In the middle of the tube was a ring. Liz managed to easily rotate the ring with her thumb and index finger.  On the ring was something that looked a small LED.  On the opposite site of the ring there was a prominent bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the bottom half of the tube there was what looked like a small digital display.  It ran along the length of the lower half of the tube and looked long enough to display about a dozen characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe label on it showed two similar stick figures with a large arrow pointing between them.  The only control on the device was a large slide operated switch on it's top half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz's curiosity got the better of her and she slid the switch.  It was spring loaded and after she slid it forward it slipped back into it's previous position. The display back-light came on.  \"NEW SUBJECT\" appeared.  This was quickly replaced with \"HOLD ENDS\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing seemed to happen after that.  After a few seconds the words began to flash.  Liz was confused by the words until she realised it was giving her an instruction.  She was holding the device along it's length, like she would normally hold a torch.  Was she doing something wrong?  She re-positioned the device so she had an end in each hand.  The display went blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah\" Liz said out loud as she understood her mistake.  The ring in the centre started rotating by itself.  The LED lit up, it was unnaturally bright.  The display changed to \"SCANNING\".  A bright white light was covering her feet in the form of a horizontal line.  The ring rotated slowly and the line of light from it slowly moved up Liz's body.  When it got to her eyes it dazzled her briefly before moving upwards.  The beam seemed to spend a very long time on her head although Liz couldn't see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light switched off and the display changed again. \"ONE HAND\" was what it now displayed.  Liz quickly worked out the device wanted her to hold it in a single hand again.  She resumed her previous grasp of the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owwww!\" Liz screamed as something painful stabbed her hand.  Reflexively she dropped the device on to the carpeted floor.  She examined her sore hand.  There was a tiny drop of blood at the base of her palm.  She quickly wiped it off.  Leaning over, she carefully picked up the device. A small blood covered needle was visible where the bump had been on the ring.  It retracted inside leaving the bump behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe display changed again.  It displayed \"SAMPLED\",  Liz wondered what it had sampled exactly.  From what she had observed so far, she was thinking this was some sort of medical device from the future.  Maybe it would tell her if she had any illnesses or other medical conditions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe display changed to \"ENHANCING\"  If it was some sort of medical diagnostic tool, that didn't make any sense to Liz.  The display remained static for about thirty seconds.  The last thing it displayed was \"COMPLETED\".  What looked like a pellet shot out of the end of the device.  It landed on the floor several feet away from Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz inspected the device, the back-light had gone out, it had appeared to have turned itself off.  She went over to examine the pellet on the floor.  It was small and black.  It looked like it was growing!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The spherical object was growing quickly, within ten seconds it was nearly the size of a basket ball.  It looked like it was made of some sort of black fabric.  As it grew the fabric split and white fabric was revealed underneath the opening.  The white fabric grew with the black.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a stretching noise and the ball deformed.  Five protrusions pushed out of it.  The top three of these were tipped with what looked like some kind of flesh coloured plastic.  The bottom two pushed downwards and flattened slightly.  As the shape grew so did the two downward pointing lumps, pushing the remainder of the mass away from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole thing was starting to appear humanoid in shape.  Liz wondered if it was some sort of giant doll.  She speculated it was some sort of sex-aid and began to giggle at the thought.   The fabric was clearly the dolls clothes, more than that, she recognised them as her own clothes.  She was starting to think the shape was now resembling her.  She knew for certain when a large bosom had formed in the chest area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe appendages began to form more clearly.  Hands and fingers formed from the plastic.  Brown hair grew out it's head rapidly as it's facial features formed.  \"It is me!\" Liz said out loud.  Finally the skin took on a more natural appearance.  The process was complete.  Liz was standing in front of a copy of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe copy's dead eyes stared off in to space.  Liz put her thumb and index fingers in a 'L' shape and rubbed them across her own chin and cheek as she thought about what happened.  She was amazed by the quality of the reproduction.  She moved closer for a better look.  She could see movement in the chest area.  \"Is it breathing?\" Liz asked herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Yes.</i>\" The copy answered without moving anything apart from it's mouth, even it's eyes were motionless and continually open.  Liz was caught totally by surprise and stumbled backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, what are you?\" A frightened Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I am Liz version two.</i>\" The copy answered in a stilted artificial manner which Liz noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you a robot?\" She asked her duplicate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>No, I am a purely organic construct.</i>\" It said again without moving  and expressing no emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sound like a chuffing robot.\" Liz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I am in an altered state of consciousness comparable to a hypnotic trance.  In this state you can give me general directives and run any diagnostics you may require on my normal conscious state.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\"  Liz said only half understanding what the construct was telling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You can put me in a normal conscious state by telling me to 'wake up'.  If you wish me to return to this state you can tell me to 'go under'.</i>\" Liz nodded.  She understood that bit at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you mean version two?\" Liz asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>A number of your physical and mental flaws have been eliminated or greatly reduced in my body.</i>\"  Liz didn't like the sound of this at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" She asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>The mass of your breasts has been reduced by twenty five percent to alleviate spinal pain.  The size and consistency have been maintained.</i>\"  Liz grew a little jealous already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky bitch.\" She spat angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Yes.</i>\" The other Liz responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell do you think you are to pick and choose what my flaws are?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Flaws were designated by your own subconscious.  It was scanned extensively.</i>\"  That took some of the heat out of Liz's fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, okay.  I should know best, I guess.\" She wasn't entirely convinced. \"So what do you do exactly do? I mean apart from stand there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>My purpose is determined by the person I was created from.</i>\"  Liz screwed her face up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you could be a bit more specific, luv?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>The most common purpose for organic constructs, is to perform menial tasks in place of the individual, to free up more leisure time.</i>\" Liz thought that could be handy if she fancied a sneaky day off.  \"<i>Enhanced constructs are often assigned tasks that the individual is unwilling or unable to do themselves.</i>\"  That too opened up some interesting possibilities in Liz's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do I call you?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>My default designation is Liz 2.</i>\" Liz 2 stated.  Liz nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's all I need to know for now.\" She took a deep breath. \"Wake up!\" She told Liz 2.  Liz 2 seem to relax and her shoulders sagged slightly.  She also blinked a few times.  She looked around the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you wanting me to cover the rest of your shift, luv?\" Liz 2 asked.</span></div></div>",

She logged into her computer and started checking her e-mail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know my password?\" Liz asked.  Liz 2 nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.

Less risk to you or Emma.\" Liz 2 explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, just stand there for now.\" She pointed to the middle of the office.  Liz 2 complied. \"I need to figure this all out, in my head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz 2 looked around the room and sighed.  \"This isn't a very productive use of my time.  I'm supposed to be helping you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still not sure if I trust you yet.\" Liz admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really think I'm going to kill you and take your place?\" Liz 2 asked Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" A panicked Liz asked.  Was Liz 2 actually considering this.  Liz got very worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a joke.\" Liz 2 laughed nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a very funny one.\" Liz told her counterpart.  She felt a bit of relief but wasn't entirely convinced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an improved sense of humour.\" Liz did sometimes feel she didn't find things as funny as other people did.  Had the device classed that as a flaw? She ignored Liz 2 and resumed working.  \"Okay sorry it was in bad taste but I have an idea that might help convince you.\" Liz 2 told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the bathroom Emma was having problems.  She'd been jerking off her new cock for ages but she couldn't orgasm.  She was  growing tired now.  She'd even undone her top to look at her own tits, to see if that helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApart from a little inherent narcissism about herself it hadn't made much difference.  She couldn't get turned on by the female characteristics of her own body.  Thinking about other women was making her horny, really horny but she still couldn't cum.  She'd come to a conclusion.  The only way she was going to get off, was if someone else helped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly she had stood up and pulled up her underwear. A good portion of the cock poked out above the top of her knickers.  She pulled up her trousers and with some difficulty managed to fasten them.  She wondered why women's trousers had to be so tight around the crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to the wash basin to clean her hands.  She caught her reflection in the mirror.  She saw the obscene bulge pressing against the front of her trousers.  Emma briefly thought about shrinking it down a bit with the remote.  She decided against it, she liked the size her cock was now.  If her plan worked, it wouldn't make any difference anyway.  She opened the toilet door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought she caught some movement out the corner of her eye but she ignored it as she walked into the office.  Liz was now working on her computer.  Beautiful Liz, Emma thought as she hungrily looked at the assistant manager.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I have to confess something.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that remote with the cocks drawn all over it?\"  Liz nodded.  \"Well, I used it and it gave me a cock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can hardly say that comes as big surprise.\" Liz said while grinning.

Her modesty prevented her from finishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...a wank.\" Liz finished the sentence smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, a wank.\" Emma confirmed as she sat down in her own chair.  \"I couldn't climax though.  I think I may need some,\" she stared hard at Liz,\"help.\" Her eyes were almost pleading. Liz didn't seem to notice.  Emma changed tack.  \"You know Liz, you are a very attractive woman.  I really should tell you that more often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz looked at Emma cynically.  \"Are you trying to chat me up?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I'm a bit out of practice luv.\" Emma admitted.  \"Do you think you could help me out?\"  Emma made the gesture of a shaking fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz stood up angrily. \"Bloody hell Emma, you want me to do that for you?\" She practically screamed.  She went marching over to the older woman.  \"I can't believe you expect me to give you a hand job.\" This had gone badly wrong for Emma.  She was about to tell her forget it, when Liz held up her hand to silence her.  A smile appeared on Liz's face.  \"I've got a much better idea.\" She said sexily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz got on her knees in front of the chair.  She reached up and started unfastening Emma's trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the toilet, in the corner of the office was an old desk.  It was rarely used except by Gemma the HR rep when she did her periodic visits.  It was completely enclosed on three sides and the real Liz was hiding underneath it.  There was a hole drilled out in one side for an old cabling set up.  Liz's eye peered out it.  She was wondering what the hell Liz 2 was up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Emma emerged from the toilet, Liz 2 wanted to prove she was entirely capable of pretending to be Liz.  She suggested Liz hide under the table and observe her interactions with Emma.  That way Liz could keep a careful watch on Liz 2 without Emma knowing.<br>\r\nLiz had reluctantly agreed.  If Liz 2 was trustworthy, it would mean an easy life for Liz.  Hiding under a desk for a while, was a small price to pay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation between Emma and Liz 2 had definitely not gone as Liz had expected.  She knew she should really get out from under the desk and put a stop to Liz 2's antics. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't really sure she wanted the world to know about Liz 2 yet. She didn't want to climb out straight away and give away that she had a double.  She had convinced herself, if Liz 2 went much further with Emma, she was going to interrupt proceedings.  She'd probably scare the shit out of her manager in the process, so she started to doubt that was a good idea either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched on.  She could hear some strange vocal noises.  Her vision was somewhat obscured by Emma's desk but she could definitely see the top of Liz 2's head bouncing up and down.  Emma appeared to be leaning back, moaning in pleasure.  Liz actually felt her own knickers getting a little damp.  Was watching the two of them in secret like this, turning her on?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liz watched in horror as this performance continued.  Liz 2 suddenly stood up and whispered in Emma's ear.  Both women giggled and Emma said \"Yes!\" loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz 2 walked away from Emma's desk and over to Liz's.  Liz had to reposition herself in her hiding spot slightly so she could still see what Liz 2 was up to.  She tried to do it as quietly as possible, so as not to alert Emma to her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning Liz 2 pulled her trousers and knickers down to her ankles in one swift move.  She was side on to Liz who now got a view of her bare arse.  Emma was now visible walking over to Liz 2.  Her bottom half was completely naked.  She still had her blouse on though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz unconsciously licked her lips as she saw Emma's impressive penis.  Its hard length glistened in the light, it was clearly very wet.  She didn't get to see it for very long as Emma soon pressed it into Liz 2's arse crack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz 2 had removed her shoes, so both women were now the same height.  Emma leaned her neck forward as Liz 2 twisted her's round so that their lips could meet. Both women kissed passionately for quite some time.  Tongues could be seen moving in mouths as they moaned.  Eventually they parted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz 2 dropped her body on to the desk with a thud.  Several pieces of paperwork went flying as she stuck her rear end up and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz watched transfixed, every time she felt like stopping this spectacle, she thought the better of it.  Each time it almost seemed like Liz 2 sensed this and decided to double down and go further with Emma.  Liz had to face facts, she was going to let this play out, consequences be damned, for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma lined herself with what was effectively Liz 2's virgin pussy.  She leaned forward and pushed her new cock into her slowly.  Both women moaned so loudly that Liz feared they'd hear it in the store downstairs.  The tips of Liz 2's fingers turned white as she gripped the desk for dear life, stopping Emma from pushing her forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma was clearly straining. \"Jesus, Liz you are really bloody tight!\" She spat out as she slowly pushed herself into Liz 2's pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz noted this was another corrected flaw.  Her poor pussy had never been quite the same since Ethan was born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Emma's length disappeared inside Liz 2.  For the last inch or so Liz 2 was actually holding her breath.  When she felt Emma's balls hit her, she took in a huge lung full of air.  Both women were motionless for quite a while, as they both got comfortable with the position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Emma started to slowly pull back.  Her penis was well lubricated with her partner's wet pussy.  Liz who was under the desk was pretty wet too.  If it wasn't for the noise it made, she'd have stuck her hand in her own knickers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Emma pushed back in and the familiar rhythm of sex started between her and Liz 2.  Liz 2 squealed every time Emma bottomed out.  Emma grunted on each forward stroke. The sounds being produced were almost musical.  Liz 2 rotated her head and looked in Liz's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of panic spread through Liz.  Was Liz 2 going to give the game away?  Liz 2 smiled cheekily and winked.  From this position Emma couldn't see her face.  This was a secret message just for Liz's benefit.  The message was, that she was loving every second of this experience.  Liz 2 turned her head back to avoid suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma leaned over and whispered something in Liz 2's ear.  She nodded and got up on to her elbows.  Awkwardly but quickly she unbuttoned her blouse.  When she was finished Emma slipped her hands round the sides of her body.  As she pulled closer to Liz 2, she grabbed her huge bra-covered breasts.  Liz 2 moaned with delight as Emma felt her hard nipples through the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was squirming under the desk.  It was making her so horny watching this, it was almost unbearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she played with Liz 2's large breasts, Emma's rhythm changed.  Her climax was approaching.  Liz 2 could feel it, her own climax being brought on as she sensed Emma's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting close Liz!\" Emma hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cum for me baby, cum in my pussy.\" Liz 2 squealed encouraging her manager to climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jesus!\" Emma shouted as she unloaded herself deep into Liz 2's abdomen.  She could feel the masses of cum fill up her assistant manager.  Her toes were curling with the sensation as the pleasurable feelings passed through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe explosion inside her, had triggered Liz 2's first orgasm, her hips were bucking by themselves.  She had the memories of many previous climaxes but this felt more 'real' to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma completely spent, fell downwards on top of Liz 2. She collapsed underneath Emma which caused the softening cock to slide out.  Both lay there unmoving for quite a long time.  Liz actually wondered if they were okay, Emma had landed pretty hard on top of her copy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have to worry, as both women soon started to giggle.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They had put their clothes back on and had decided to actually do some work.  Liz 2 had spent some time picking up the discarded papers from her desk that their noisy lovemaking had pushed on to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women occasionally glanced at each other across the office.  They both smiled when they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma was pressing the odd key on her computer keyboard but her mind was elsewhere.  Thinking about the possibilities of the remote.  She really, really liked having a cock.  Honestly, she would be happy to have one permanently, if she could.  She was forty seven, she really didn't have any plans for more children, so biologically her womb was somewhat redundant now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main problem would be getting her husband Kyle on board with idea.  He was your average heterosexual middle-aged man.  He may have something to say about his wife having a cock instead of a pussy.  A devious plan entered Emma's mind but she had to experiment first to find out if it would work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up.  \"I'm just going to do my rounds.\" She told Liz 2 as she picked up the remote.  \"I'll be a bit longer than usual.  I've got a few extra things planned.\" She said mysteriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you go out like that, you'll get yourself arrested.\" Liz 2 said pointing to the bulge in Emma's trousers.  She was no longer erect but it was still obvious she was packing something down there.  Emma nodded, a little disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess.\" Reluctantly she pressed the size reduction button.  She could feel her penis, slowly shrinking.  She held it down for the bare minimum amount of time. She still wanted her cock as big as she could get away with.  \"How does that look?\" She asked her assistant manager and lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should be okay as long as you don't try to adjust it in public.\" Liz 2 joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as Emma closed the office door behind her, Liz 2 jumped out of her chair and ran round to the spare desk.  She put her hand out for Liz to grab, to help get her up on her feet.  Liz reached out and pushed it away.  \"I don't need your kind of help.\" She told Liz 2 angrily.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA very stiff Liz climbed out from under the desk and slowly stood up.  She had pins and needles in her legs and feet. She had to support herself on the desk until the normal sensation returned.  She brushed her trousers quickly removing the light covering of dust.   \"What the chuffing hell was that all about?\" She asked Liz 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand.\" A confused Liz 2 said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, why did you let Emma shag you over my desk?\" A still angry Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see, well hers was still covered in the mystery items from the future, it saved us time clearing all that.\"  Liz 2 explained naively, Liz shook her head.  She did briefly wonder if this was Liz 2's enhanced sense of humour again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I meant why did you shag her at all?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You desire to be more open to new sexual experiences.\" Liz 2 informed her.  Another enhancement Liz deduced as she was actually quite correct.  Liz was aware she could be a bit of a prude when it came to sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah I might desire it but I wouldn't actually do it.\"  Liz 2 smiled at her original.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's part of the reason I exist.  I can do the things you desire but you can't or won't do yourself.\"  Liz realised she couldn't stay angry at her.  Liz 2 had a purpose and she was just doing her best to act with that purpose.  Liz was still frustrated with her though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every time Emma looks at me, she'll be reminded of putting her cock in my pussy.\"  Liz 2 nodded and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoyable shared experiences should be the foundation of a strong friendship.\" Liz 2 said as she sighed contently after reminding herself of the encounter she had just had with the manager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What planet are you living on?\" An incredulous Liz asked.  \"It's going to make things weird between me and her.  I'll have to have an awkward conversation with her now, thanks to you.\"  She pointed at Liz 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't enjoy watching it luv?\" Liz 2 asked a little confused.   Actually Liz had enjoyed watching it, she had enjoyed it a lot.  It still didn't stop it being wrong though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz's own pussy had been soaking.  Part of her anger now led on from her sexual frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" She snapped at Liz 2.  Liz 2 look at her a little sympathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem awfully stressed Liz. Would you like a little neck massage?\"  She held up her hands.  Under normal circumstances she would have jumped at the chance, her neck and back were in almost constant pain.  Right now her emotions were all over the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" She was about to tell Liz 2 to get out the store, when the enormity of it struck her.  Where was Liz 2 meant to go exactly?  She couldn't expect her to wander the streets all night.  She didn't have any money even, she was completely dependent on Liz.  She was still a human being, it looked like she'd be going back to Liz's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I going to tell them?\" Liz thought out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" Liz 2 asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My family.  I'll need to tell them about you. I'll have to do it tonight.\" Liz didn't look forward to it at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I can tell the idea is making you feel uncomfortable. Do you want me to do it instead?  I could pretend to be you.\" Liz 2 asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, that's not a bad idea.\" Liz paused. \"Wait, what am I saying? I have to take some responsibility here.  I can't have you do everything for me.  I'll do it when I get in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will just be Eric.  Courtney's taking Ethan to the cinema.\"  Liz 2 reminded her.  That was right.  Every couple of weeks Courtney would take Ethan to some activity, so Eric and Liz could get some private time for a few hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay new plan.  You go home now, pretend to be me.  Offer to go with Courtney and Ethan to the cinema.\" Liz was a little bit worried about Liz 2 being around Ethan but she felt better knowing Courtney would be there.  This way Liz could go home and explain everything to Eric before the rest of the family got back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's what you want.\" Liz 2 was a little surprised by the request, she expected to be staying at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it is what I want.\" Liz was desperate for Liz 2 to be out from under her feet.  \"Take some money out my handbag in case anything crops up.\" Liz watched as Liz 2 pulled a \u00a320 note and the spare house key out the bag.   Liz sent a text message to Courtney to let her know she was finishing early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz 2 closed the handbag and headed towards the door.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Natalie walked over to her.  \"Doing your rounds?\" She asked Emma.  The manager nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I'm looking for someone to help me with a special assignment.\" Emma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Special assignment? That sounds exciting.\" Natalie said.  Emma shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a stock check of the supply room.\" She explained.  Natalie looked a little confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just did that a couple of weeks ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know,\" Emma agreed, \"but someone at head office, will have got it into their brain that we've go too many biros or bog rolls or something, so they asked me to do it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Natalie looked round the warehouse. \"I think Ruby is just about finished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need a man!\" Emma said a little too loudly.  Natalie gave her a strange look.  \"I mean, there will probably be a bit of..., physical exertion required.\" The last few words practically dripped off her lips as she felt her new penis twitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Natalie said wondering how much exertion was required to lift a box of paper towels.  \"Err, I suppose we could spare Nathan for a little while.\" An often repeated tale in store was about how at the last Christmas party Nathan had got really drunk and admitted he had a thing for older women.  He still got mocked for it.  Emma was just his type and she knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect.\" Emma said unaware she was smiling a little too much.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie walked over to him.  As they both walked back Natalie explained what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Emma.\" He said grinning as he approached.  Emma scanned him from head to foot.  He'd matured somewhat in the last year but he was still young looking.  He was reasonably tall and slim with well toned muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has Natalie explained?\" Emma asked the young man.  He nodded.  \"Come along then.\" She spun round and headed in the direction of the store room.  Nathan trailed along behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't far, the supply room was at the other side of the warehouse.  It was completely enclosed with no windows. Room was a bit of an exaggeration.  It wasn't huge and with the racking and supplies in there, it looked like a glorified cupboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma selected the key and pushed it into the Yale style lock.   There was a little resistance when she came to turn it.  \"Hmmm, it seems a little stiff.\" She said to her young companion seductively. \"I'm having to push quite hard.\" She emphasised the last word.  She looked back and could see Nathan sweating. \"I'll have to get John to, ...lubricate it.\"  The door swung open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan was getting really horny, he didn't have a girlfriend at the moment and spending this time with the hot MILF manager was like a dream come true.  The way she was talking was making it even hotter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma turned on the light.  There was barely room for two people to move around inside. She turned to Nathan. \"I hope you don't mind the two of us being in there,\"  she stepped forward, her breasts almost reaching his chest, \"because it looks like a tight squeeze.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan gulped.  He tried to play it cool.  \"No, no, err...\" He spluttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you first.\" Emma said extending her arm in the direction of the supply room.  Nathan nodded and quickly walked inside, Emma followed.  Once inside she backed up and closed the door with her heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe briefly turned round to double lock the door.  Nobody was getting in till she was finished. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unconsciously Nathan moved backwards but was stopped by a massive stack of toilet rolls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.\" He squeaked.  Nathan was quickly appreciating that dreams and reality were two completely different things.  Adrenalin started to pump into his veins.  Running seemed pointless.  There wasn't enough space to get past Emma in the tight confines of the supply room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma reached out and grabbed the buckle of Nathan's belt and started undoing it.  He knew he was incredibly turned on by this but also felt fear.  \"Let's see what you've got under here.\" Emma said as she popped the fastener on his black jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing, Emma?\" He asked as she unzipped his flies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't this what you want, to be all alone with an older woman?\" He nodded slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" She said as she yanked down his jeans.  He was wearing a pair of white old fashioned Y front style briefs.  \"Mmmm..., sexy.\" Emma said, barely stifling a grin as she rubbed the thick fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My gran bought them for me.\" Nathan confessed feeling embarrassment on top of everything else.  Emma's focus had already moved to their contents.  There was a sizeable although not huge bulge in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma grabbed one of Nathan's hands.  She held it up and kissed it gently.  \"Take this.\" She said as she pushed the remote into his palm.  She grasped his hand and move the thumb so it was over the 'shrink' button.  She pressed her own thumb on top of his own.  She took great care not to touch the remote itself. \"What are you doing?\" He asked, a little confused.  She shushed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at his bulge receding.  She licked her lips in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everything that was going through his mind, it took a while for Nathan to notice his dick was shrinking.  His subconscious quickly worked out it was related to the remote and he released the button. Emma shook her head.  She lifted her hand and extended her index finger.  She waved it from side-to-side in front of Nathan's face. \"Naughty, naughty.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResigned to his fate he stopped pushing against Emma's thumb and the button was again pressed.   His bulge continued to shrink until it seemed to be flat, Nathan felt a little weird inside.  A little more vulnerable for some reason. Emma yanked the remote out his hand.  \"Let's have a look shall we.\" She said as she pulled at the sides of his underwear.  She pulled them over his hips and down his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, It's gone!\" He shouted as he saw the flat crotch.  He cupped his groin and accidentally brushed his brand new clit.  The wave of sensation, rolled over him so hard he nearly took a tumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma's theory had been correct.  She had speculated that a man would eventually gain a pussy if the 'shrinking' button was continually pressed.  The proof was standing in front of her.  \"Why Nathan.  I always thought you were a man but you're really a woman in disguise.\" She said with a grin, mocking Nathan's new condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a man.  I had a...,\" His emotion filled brain was filled with confusion.  He just couldn't get a good handle on what was happening to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. Don't panic.\" Emma gently stroked his arm, trying to calm him a little. \"It actually works out well because,\" she unfastened her own trousers and pulled them down along with her knickers, \"I'm a woman with a cock.\"  Her smaller cock stood out proudly.   \"It's not as big as it used to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand.\" Nathan cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's quite simple luv, I have a cock you have a pussy.  Shall we get them together?\" Emma asked while tilting her head.  Nathan remained silent.  \"Okay you're on the fence, I guess.  Would this help?\"  Emma quickly undid her buttons and pulled off her white blouse.  He stared at her mature breasts contained in her white bra.  \"If you're a really good girl, I might take the bra off too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan groaned.  This was turning him on.  It wasn't unnoticed by Emma who saw his pussy getting a little moist. In his mind this was the most awesome and the most terrible experience of his life.  He gradually got used to the idea of being penetrated as Emma removed her shoes, trousers and knickers.  \"Err....,\"  He managed to say as his mind adjusted to the new reality.  He didn't understand why but he decided he was just going along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it does speak.  Coming around to my way of thinking?\" Emma said sarcastically.  \"So do you want it?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,  Emma.  Yes.\" Nathan begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lean back luv.\" Emma ordered. As Nathan complied, she looked down at her cock. \"Let's make this more interesting.\" Holding the remote, she pressed the 'grow' button till her cock reached roughly her previous size of seven and a half inches.  Nathan looked on terrified once more.  Emma leaned her smaller body forward and slowly slid her length into Nathan's new pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was comfortable with it, she started her thrusting.  When she had made love to Liz earlier she'd taken it gently.  She was going to offer no such treatment to Nathan.  She wanted to do it like an animal.  Primal and hard, Emma bucked her hips as fast as she could.  Finding new strength from deep within her she pushed harder than she thought was capable, given her lack of muscles and age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan squealed and moaned with delight as Emma jack-hammered herself into him.  He reached out and she let him touch her breasts, he slipped his fingers into her bra.  His pussy was so slick there was practically no friction. Emma came like the animal she wanted to be.  She growled as she shot her seed deep into Nathan's soaking pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later and Emma was nearly finished dressing.  Nathan was still a crumpled heap against the stack of toilet rolls.  His recovery seemed to be taking a while, to be fair she had railed him pretty hard. There was an impression of his body imprinted into to the rolls by the force of Emma's thrusts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again she reluctantly reduced the size of her cock.  She looked at Nathan.  His adorably spent body lying in a puddle of sex. His eyes were closed and there was a huge satisfied smile across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma's original plan was to test her theory about the remote, when used on men.  After that she was going to offer him a little reward of a slightly enhanced penis to buy his silence.  She had gone way, way off script.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to keep him this way to buy his silence instead.  Offer to return his cock eventually,  if he kept her secret. The thought of him just walking around the store all day with a pussy between his legs was just so sexy.  She felt her cock get hard again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on luv, let's get you tidied up.\" Emma said as she tried to get the young man back on to his feet.</span></div></div>",

Natalie thought it was odd that Emma wasn't carrying a clipboard, a PDA or any other way of recording the stock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope Nathan was useful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes very useful.  Nathan is a responsible young...,\" Emma was about to say man but that wasn't totally correct, \"person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he's one of the better ones.\" Natalie agreed.  \"We better stop complimenting him or he'll get a big head.\"  She joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think we have to worry about the size of Nathan's head.\" Emma told her while slyly glancing at Nathan's crotch. \"Well, I suppose I better get back upstairs.\"  She moved towards Nathan. \"Be good Nathan.\" She said.  She had to control herself or she would have kissed him right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma turned around and strided away grinning.  Nathan remained motionless.  \"Earth to Nathan.\" Natalie said to her distracted young colleague.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err.., yeah.\" He said once he'd taken his eyes off Emma's backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got a job to finish.\" Natalie informed him.  He nodded and walked somewhat awkwardly back to his previous task in the warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie had followed Nathan's gaze.  It looked like the rumours about his fascination with older ladies were true.  He couldn't keep his eyes off Emma.  Natalie pictured the nervous young man being around his crush in the supply room. She was hopeful that the experience had supplied a dose of reality. After actually spending some time in a confined space with an older woman and finding out it wasn't that exciting. Maybe now he would take more of an interest in women closer to his own age, she speculated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anything, the opposite was true.  After his experience with Emma, Nathan was now obsessed with older women more than ever.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Liz cringed inwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should talk,\" Liz said in a sombre manner, \"about earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh.\" Emma said as she sat down at her desk.  She'd picked up on Liz's mood.  \"What about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sort of got caught up in the moment and well I'm a married woman, Emma.  I love my husband.\" Liz stated.  She hated having to do this at all.  If Liz 2 hadn't been so gung-ho, she wouldn't have to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I love mine.  It was just a bit of fun, we were just being, what do they call them?\" She asked rhetorically, probing her own mind. \"Fuck buddies?\"  That word itself was getting her aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe we shouldn't do it again.\" Liz suggested.  Emma looked disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you enjoy it?\" Emma asked.  Liz nodded.  She thought back to when she was under the desk watching Emma and Liz 2 doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I enjoyed it.\" Liz agreed as she sighed.  Her pussy had started to melt again before she exerted control.  \"It's just we have our professional relationship to consider.  I don't want to jeopardise that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Emma's eyes were tearing up a little, \"if that's what you want.\" Liz could see the damaging emotional impact this was having on Emma.  Liz felt terrible, she just wanted the world to swallow her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is.\" Liz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma cleared her throat as she regained her composure.  \"So, err, do we have any meetings scheduled?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was caught a little off-guard as Emma returned to managerial mode.  \"Err, yeah Liam's got a disciplinary in ten minutes.\" Liz was still a little distracted by hurting Emma's feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Another one, already?\" Emma asked.  Liz nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam stood in a slouching position as Emma finished giving him his disciplinary 'counselling' .  It had been a long three minutes and Liam wasn't used to being on his feet unsupported, for this period of time.  He'd been through this process many times before and he soon grew bored of Emma's words.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed there were a strange collection of objects on Emma's desk that weren't there previously.  They were all pushed off to the side as if Emma had made a hasty effort to clear the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...do you understand that?\" Liam heard Emma say as he started paying attention to her again.  He nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma was frustrated with Liam.  He was constantly getting in trouble.  She wasn't entirely sure why he still had a job here.  Every time she had requested a termination authorisation for him, the area manager rejected it.  They kept pleading with Emma to give him one more chance.  She suspected Liam had some sort of family connection high up in the company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the desk, she played with the remote in her fingers.  She was so very tempted to use it on him.  Liz's presence put her off.  She'd changed her tune so quickly.  She'd been so loving and caring earlier.  Now she was so distant, it was almost like she was a different person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma opened her desk drawer.  Looking downwards, she pulled Liam's copy of his disciplinary report out of the drawer and pushed it across the desk.  He picked it up and looked at her waiting to be dismissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just go.\" Emma said as she shook her head.  Liam turned and banged into the desk in the process. He had another go at turning round before casually limping out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Emma hadn't be so distracted over her anger with Liam and her confusion with Liz she might have noticed something was missing from her desk.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before the end of the shift Emma and Liz put all the items from the future into the office safe.  It seemed like the logical place after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remainder of the shift finished without incident.  Liz was happy it was over, as it had been a very 'eventful' day for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, she felt a slight chill in the air, she pulled her thick brown overcoat in closer to her body.  As she crossed the footbridge over the river, that joined the shopping precinct to the car park, she started to forget the day's events and thought about this evening's.   Her and Eric would get a little romantic time alone together.  She started to regret sending Liz 2 away with Courtney and Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz got that idea that Liz 2 could have been the couple's cook, dish washer and waitress for the night.  Liz wouldn't have to lift a finger, which would free up some time for a little sexy fun with Eric before the kids got back.  If he was up for it, of course.  He wasn't particularly old but Liz had found, his sexual stamina was seriously on the decline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she reached the car park, she sensed something was wrong.  The space where she parked was empty.  Panicking, she looked all around, she couldn't see her car anywhere.  Had it been stolen? Had it been towed away from some reason? She thought this was the crappy end, to a crappy day.  She opened her handbag to get her phone, so she could contact the police to report the car stolen.  As she went through her bag, she noticed something else, her car keys were missing too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was a little confused.  She thought back to the times her handbag had been open throughout the day.  She remembered when she gave money to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realisation hit her like a brick.  \"She's taken my chuffin car!\" Liz screamed in the empty car park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma sat in her own car, in the drive way of her house.  She'd been here for several minutes with the remote in her hand.  She was extremely reluctant to do what she was about to but there was no way she could go into her house with a cock sticking out of her.  Someone would notice sooner or later.  All it would take was a frisky Kyle grabbing her the wrong way and the game would be up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed the 'shrink' button and held it down.  She could feel her knickers adjusting as her penis shrank.  She started thinking wishfully, maybe if it was really small she could get away with it.  No, she shook that idea out of her and kept pressing.  Eventually she was left with her old pussy.  She felt so empty and feeble.  Her new power was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf all went according to Emma's plans though, this would be the last night she'd have a pussy.  After forty seven years of having one, she would be moving on to a new phase.  The cock wielding phase.   She'd only had a penis for a matter of hours but she knew deep down she wanted one for the rest of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't just the sex that attracted her.  The penis enabled her to skip the menopause that was already starting to affect her body.  Then there was peeing standing up, that seemed very convenient.  Emma was looking forward to practising that too when the cock became a permanent addition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more night.\" She said out loud as she got out her car.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A miserable Liz walked in through the front door of her house.   It was dark outside, the curtains were still open and all the lights appeared to be off.  She closed the door and sat at the bottom of the stairs, in the cold and dark dwelling.  She put her head in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finding out Liz 2 had taken her car she had gone to the bus stop, just missing her bus.  The next bus didn't turn up at all. She was left waiting nearly half an hour, for the one after that. The sun had set over Rotherham as she waited.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty seconds after the bus dropped her at her stop, there was a sudden downpour of rain, Liz had been soaked to the skin.  She hadn't taken her umbrella because she was driving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly as she approached her house, over an hour later than usual, did she start to dry out.  In hindsight, a taxi or even walking the whole distance would have been substantial quicker.  She had noticed her car wasn't parked at the house.  She assumed Liz 2 had taken the kids to the cinema in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, finally home she was very damp and very unhappy.  This day couldn't possibly get any worse.  She lifted her head up wondering where Eric was. He should have finished early today.  His car was outside.  She could hear faint noises from upstairs, he was probably lying in bed watching television or something, Liz figured.  She thought that was a bit inconsiderate, this was supposed to be their special personal time.  He could have at least started making dinner, a cranky Liz thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would usually prepare for her coming in, why didn't he this time?  Of course, Liz realised, he'd obviously been in contact with Courtney who had told him Liz was taking them to the pictures.  It was actually Liz 2 of course but Eric didn't know that.  Liz put her palm on her forehead.  He'd be annoyed with her, disappearing off to the cinema, missing out on their special time together.  She really should have thought this through better, it made sense that Eric and Courtney would talk to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Liz 2 hadn't got her so flustered she would have worked that out.  Liz stood up, turned round and started ascending the dark stairs.  She started putting an apology for her husband together in her head.  She'd explain she came back early because she was missing him and she felt guilty about leaving him alone on their special night.  That's it, he'll buy that she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could see a crack of light escaping under the bedroom door.  It was confirmed, he was definitely in there.  She froze when she heard voices. Eric's she recognised straight away even through the closed door, but the second voice was a woman's!  Eric did think he had the place to himself and he had thought Liz had dumped him for a night at the cinema.  Liz got a sinking feeling in her stomach, was Eric cheating on her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, she told herself, Eric wouldn't do that. Would he?  Surely she was so stressed she was, imagining things.  She heard the woman's voice again as she approached the bedroom.  Bloody cheating bastard! ran through her head as she stormed through the bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough momentarily dazzled by the bedroom light, Liz 2 was presented with a sight that left her totally speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had expected to find Eric and his lover in bed.  That was the first place she looked.  Instead Eric was lying in bed alone, on his back, naked.  His small penis was erect.  His arms were above his head.  His hands were attached to the metal rods on the headboard by a pair of handcuffs.  There was a blue satin scarf tied over the top of his face, acting as a blindfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes were then drawn to the voluptuous female figure standing at the bottom of the bed.  She was wearing red leather heels, they looked about four inches tall.  On her shapely legs she wore a pair of black fishnet tights.  They disappeared into a very tight red one piece swimsuit made of what looked like PVC.  The vinyl shone in the light as it's deep v-cut displayed this woman's busty chest.  It looked like it was about ready to burst as her large breasts and curvy belly pressed against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her hands she wore black satin gloves that almost went to her elbows.  In one hand she held a short riding crop.  Liz looked upwards to the woman's face to see if she recognised her.  Unfortunately for Liz, her face was covered by a large butterfly shaped black mask.  She could see the woman's bright red lipstick covering her very surprised lips.   The mask was framed with waves of the women's long brown untied hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz twisted her head, several times between Eric prone on the bed and the foxy seductress who'd evidently put him there.   She just could not process what was happening.  The surprised looking women in the PVC and leather outfit, lifted her hand up and pulled the mask off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err... Hi, I guess.\" Liz 2 said awkwardly as her face became visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fu...?\" Liz asked as some semblance of order returned to her brain.  She pointed towards the open door indicating she wanted Liz 2 to leave the bedroom.  Liz 2 started moving towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening mistress?\" A confused Eric asked as he lifted his head. He was sure he had heard the door open and then his wife said some strange things to herself.  Liz 2 stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, be a good slave and wait till I get back.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mistress.\" He replied, putting his head back down.  Liz 2 turned and smiled at Liz.  A raging Liz grabbed Liz 2's bare upper arm and dragged her out the bedroom.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liz turned on the living room lights and practically threw the scantily clad Liz 2 on to the sofa.  \"I think you need to relax.\" Liz 2 told her as she rubbed her sore arm where Liz had grabbed it.  \"You're going to stress yourself out and give yourself a headache.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax? relax?\" An incredulous Liz asked.  She couldn't believe this flesh robot was asking her to relax after everything she did.  She'd reminded herself that earlier she was adamant she wasn't going to get angry with her.  Unfortunately, Liz 2 just had to keep pushing her buttons.  She looked as Liz 2 continued to slide her fingers over her sore arm.  She shivered a little from being put in the cold room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis actually caused a somewhat empathic reaction from Liz.  Maybe she'd been a bit harsh not recognising Liz 2 as a real person.  As enhanced as Liz 2 was, she was still human and that made her fallible.  Liz calmed a little.  \"How's your arm?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little tender but it's nothing serious.  I think we should discuss your mental well-being.  Perhaps we can explore why you are so upset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even know where to begin.\" Liz said as she strutted around the room.  \"There is just so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz 2 smiled.  \"I think it would be better if you sat down and you could talk to me about it.\"  Liz sat down beside her on the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess, I desire to be a better listener?\" Liz asked anticipating what Liz 2 would say.  Liz 2 shrugged.   Liz decided to start unpicking everything that had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you take the car?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted me to come home.  I used it for that reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You feel you don't get enough exercise.  I thought it was a great opportunity for you to get some.\" Liz scowled, it was an explanation at least.  She thought back to when she returned home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, where is my car, exactly?  It isn't outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I loaned it to Courtney.\" Liz 2 said matter of factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did what!?\" Liz stood up again.  \"I'll be lucky to get it back in one piece.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's had her licence for nearly three years.  She's drove Eric's car numerous times without any incidents.\" Liz 2 had a point.  It might be true, but it didn't make Liz feel any better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you go with them? You could have driven them.\" Liz was completely oblivious to her hypocrisy.  She had no evidence that Liz 2 , a brand new biological construct was a better driver than her step-daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Courtney asked that I didn't.  She felt I didn't trust her alone with Ethan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She looks after him all the time.\" Liz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And when you return from work you usually criticise her childcare skills.  I can understand how she felt.\" Liz 2 said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whose side are you on exactly?\" Liz felt like she'd been stabbed in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm on your side but you desire to trust Courtney and wish to respect her decisions more.\"  Liz was quite surprised with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do?\" She asked. Liz 2 nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I acted that way, so you must.\"  Liz face betrayed her confusion.  She didn't think she felt that way about Courtney.  \"Sometimes sub-conscious desires aren't clear to the conscious mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I might wish, want and desire things that I'm not aware of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Liz 2 got a little more animated and grabbed one of Liz's hands, \"I can help guide you through it.\" Liz 2 leaned forward into Liz's personal space.  She was acutely aware of Liz 2's skimpy outfit.  Liz was still in her work clothes and overcoat.  She felt a little frumpy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,  I'm having trouble taking you seriously while wearing that.\" She pointed at the clothing. Liz 2 smiled. \"I must admit, you do look pretty sexy in them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel pretty sexy too.  Do you want to try them on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good God, no, I'd feel so bloody silly.  I don't have the figure to pull it off.\"  As soon as the words left her mouth, she realised how monumentally stupid they were.  Her and Liz 2 physically were practically identical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't want to dwell on it though.  Now she had calmed down a little, it was time to address the elephant in the room.  \"So?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you fucked Eric?\" She asked bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I hadn't got around to that yet.\" Liz 2 said a little embarrassed.  Liz sighed with relief. \"I just made him cum a few times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's okay then...\" Liz stared at Liz 2. \"You did what!?\" She screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made him cum, I grabbed his little cock and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop.\" She really didn't want to hear any more but her curiosity got the better of her. \"How long had you been at it when I arrived?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An, hour? And he came twice?\" An amazed Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three times.\" Liz 2 corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" A very surprised Liz asked. \"I'd be lucky to get three loads, after fucking him all night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Liz cringed, she really had no secrets from Liz 2. \"He really likes getting dominated by a woman.\"  Liz shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's like our little joke.  He asks me all the time to be more dominant in bed.  He's not being serious.\" Liz informed her.  She suddenly remembered something.   She had a slight flicker of recognition with Liz 2's outfit earlier but she couldn't place it.  She had remembered Eric had given her it as a gag gift a couple of years ago.  She recalled that for some reason he didn't laugh that much when she refused to wear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz 2's face grew with concern.  \"You noticed how happy he was when you were on top during sex.\"  She extended her first two fingers and pushed her hand up and down to demonstrate his erect penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just because he finds it more comfortable.\"  Liz 2 shook her head.  All the pieces dropped into place, in Liz's mind.  Her husband got off from being dominated.  He had wanted her to dress up as a dominatrix and treat him like a slave.  All the clues were there.  No wonder she had trouble getting decent sex out of him.  She treated his desires like a big joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz stared off into space, feeling like the world's worst wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to be a better lover for your husband.  I know that and even better I can help.\" Liz 2 said with a great big grin.   Liz looked hopefully at her. \"First, we need to get you out of those clothes.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Shorts and a tee shirt for Kyle, a tank top and yoga pants for Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had both been drinking for a while.  Emma was making sure Kyle was drinking more than her.  Four empty beer bottles sat on the coffee table.  Emma had only consumed half a glass of wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another beer luv?\" Emma asked.  She'd been his waitress all night which Kyle wasn't complaining about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Em, it's only eight o'clock and I've got work tomorrow.\" He said, which he followed with a small burp. He looked over towards her.  He slipped his hand round her backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's getting horny, Emma thought.  She looked at his crotch.  His erection was visible through his tight shorts.  In Emma's mind he was silently taunting her with it.  Reminding her she was dickless for now.  God she missed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got a late start tomorrow, haven't you?\" Emma asked.  Kyle nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have to get up till nine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be fine for a couple more.\"  Luckily this wasn't too out of character for Emma.  She didn't mind Kyle drinking.  She would be a hypocrite if she did. She could easily sink a couple of bottles of wine in a night.  Kyle shrugged.  Emma leaned forward, deliberately rubbing her bum on his hand a little. \"I've got to go to the loo.  I'll bring you one on the way back.\" Kyle nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma entered the bathroom and locked the door.  She stuck her hand in her small thigh pocket and pulled out the remote.  She held the 'grow' button for long enough to give herself a decent sized bulge in her yoga pants.  She returned the remote to her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned over and lifted the toilet seat. She stood up straight again and pulled the waistband of her pants right down over her cock and balls.  She hadn't worn knickers to make this process easier.  It hadn't gone unnoticed by Kyle who thought she was teasing.  She grasped her cock and started peeing.  She loved the sound it made, hitting the water from so high up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was surprising how quickly she'd picked this technique up.  She'd missed the pan about as much as Kyle, even less so now he was getting drunk.  Kyle would get the blame anyway. She finished and gave herself a shake, removing the last few drops.  She rubbed her masculine cock lovingly a few times with her small feminine hands before slipping it back into her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reversed the process with the remote.  She watched in disappointment as the dick slowly vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew she'd have to wait a while to get her cock permanently but she was adamant she wasn't going to sit to pee any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flushed the toilet.  After quickly washing her hands, she headed down to the kitchen to get her husband another bottle of beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had completely forgotten to put the toilet seat back down.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Liz had very reluctantly put on the sexy outfit herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember these shoes being part of the outfit.\" Liz told Liz 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep still.\" A frustrated Liz 2 said as she applied the finishing touches to Liz's sexy make up.  \"They aren't.\" Liz sat silently as instructed.  She tried to communicate to Liz 2 that she wanted to know more by just moving her eyebrows.  Liz 2 smiled. \"You don't remember?\" Liz shrugged.  \"You got them for that party at uni.\"  Liz thought back, that had been nearly twenty years ago.  Liz 2's memory seemed so much better than her own.  It made sense Liz's brain was thirty eight years old and Liz 2's was brand new.  It would be easier for her to recall much more distant memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Liz was reminded, she remembered.  She'd bought them as a dare.  She had never had the nerve to actually wear them at the party or afterwards.  They had sat at the bottom of the wardrobe ever since.  She had never got around to throwing them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz 2 finished the make up and started rearranging Liz's hair.  \"Where did you get the handcuffs?\" Liz asked.  Liz 2 shook her head, surprised by Liz's poor memory.  \"That Halloween party we had about five years ago.  Don't you remember? Eric dressed up as a prison convict.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah.\" Liz said as it came back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I think you are good to go Mistress L.\" Liz 2 said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz stood up and nearly took a tumble. She wasn't used to such high heels.  She Looked down at herself. \"How do you feel?\" Liz 2 asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chuffing ridiculous.\" Liz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you look amazing.\" Liz 2 told her.  \"You want to please Eric don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but it's so skimpy and tight.  It makes me look fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a sexy woman and Eric loves you.\" Liz 2 reassured her.  Liz tried walking around.  Her movements were a little robotic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you've got to move more naturally. Like this.\" Liz 2 walked around swaying her hips and moving her body sensually.  In Liz's eyes she was exuding sexiness even under her frumpy dressing gown. Liz gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about Eric, but I think you are turning me on.\" Liz said, only half joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did enjoy watching Emma and I make love.\"  Liz 2 remarked.  \"We all have at least a little narcissistic streak running through us.\"  Liz didn't really want to dwell on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well, you're so much better at this than me.\"  Liz 2 frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought the whole point was, you wanted to do it yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, you're right.  I need to grow a pair.  Even if I do look like an idiot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric shouted from upstairs.  \"Liz, I mean Mistress.  Are you coming back?\" He had been lying on his own for over half an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz 2 looked at Liz at then moved her gaze upwards.  She wanted Liz to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right.\" Liz said.  She turned her head and shouted up the stairwell. \"Silence slave, I'll be back soon.\"  Liz looked back towards Liz 2 who gave her a big thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mistress.\" Eric responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, it actually chuffing works.\" Liz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it give you a thrill?\" Liz 2 asked.  Liz nodded vigorously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This may actually be fun.\" Liz started walking towards the hall.  Liz 2 followed closely behind her.  Just as the pair got into the hall there was an unexpected noise.  The front door was opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're back!\" Courtney called.  Both Liz and Liz 2 stared at each other in pure and utter panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" Liz 2 said. Liz was momentarily confused by Liz 2's statement, before she found herself getting pushed backwards into the under-stair cupboard.  Liz was quickly consumed in darkness as the small door was shut.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liam sat with his legs crossed on his bed, in his tiny little bedsit flat.  The clothes he was wearing were his typical 'at home' attire.  This consisted of just his Wilko polo and his underpants.  Also on the bed were a collection of strange looking fruit.  He was currently experimenting with the item he swiped off his manager's desk earlier in the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like a small toy ray gun.  It appeared to be made of cheap blue plastic.  He had already made a number of amazing discoveries.  Liam had quickly established that the toy was clearly magic or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApart from it's trigger, it had a few other notable features. On the back just above the grip was a two position switch marked 'U' and 'A' to the right of that was a recessed red button.  Above the previously mentioned trigger was a small yellow light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA label had been attached to the barrel just above the yellow light.  On it were scribbled three similar looking stick figures all standing next to each other.  The middle figure seemed to be split down the middle and consisted of two halves.  The left figure had an arrow pointing right to the middle figure and the right figure had an arrow pointing left to the same middle figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drawing's meaning had been a complete mystery to Liam at first.  Now he understood completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a merging gun.  It merged two things into one.  He had been experimenting with his fruit, his only concession to healthy living.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he used two pieces of fruit, he could use the gun to combine them into a new single fruit.  As soon as he held the grip, a green beam emerged from the gun.  He quickly established after taking some photos with his phone that this was only visible to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he pointed it at a target (e.g. an apple) and pulled the trigger, then the light on the side lit up.  The beam then changed to a yellow beam after he selected a second target (e.g. an orange), the two would become a single strange hybrid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mixture appeared to be random.  He had got orange apples, green oranges, brown hard things that looked like oranges and soft olive coloured fruit that look like apples.  It seemed practically any combination was possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could abort the process at any stage by removing his hand from the grip for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red button seemed to undo the previous merge.  The hybrid became two different fruit again after he pressed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could also stack the hybrids.  He could combine an apple and an orange to get a hybrid.  He could then merge that with say another apple. The hybrid would become slightly more apple like as it went from half apple to two thirds apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe possibilities were endless.   The only remaining mystery was the switch.  He wasn't quite sure what that did.  In the 'A' position he did notice that externally the hybrid more closely resembled the first target.  If he tried it with an orange and an apple he'd get something that resembled an orange but it might have a slightly smooth skin or a little stalk.  Again this was random.  When he cut it open, he found it was combined as normal inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam reckoned he would be able to figure out the switch better later. He assumed as the drawing showed stick figures, the gun would work on people too.  He was going to have so much fun with this tomorrow at work.  It certainly wouldn't be a typical boring shift.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wrapped his arms round Liz 2's legs.  \"We saw a scary ghost, mummy.\" He squealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz 2 looked down and mussed his hair a little.  \"A ghost, Sunshine? Really?\" She asked in a maternal way.  She glanced towards the cupboard door hoping Liz got the message.  There were no noises and it hadn't reopened, so it looked like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The film was about a haunted house.\" Courtney said as she followed her brother down the hall. Liz 2 looked at her as Ethan held on to her legs.  \"It was animated, for kids, it wasn't too scary.\" She was mentally preparing herself for getting berated from Liz for upsetting Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz 2 looked at her. \"I guess it's okay to scare kids a little.  I think in a strange way they enjoy it.\"  Courtney was surprised her step-mother was being so chill about it. She'd been pretty cool earlier too, when she loaned her the car.  \"As long as you don't traumatise them obviously.\" Liz 2 laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney handed her the car keys.  \"Don't panic, no scratches.\" Liz 2 took them from her and put them on the hall table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I trust you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do?\" A somewhat confused Courtney asked.  She grew suspicious of Liz's new attitude.  Liz 2 picked up on Courtney's feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I don't tell you often enough.  It's just I get worried about you.\" Courtney nodded.  She was satisfied with the explanation for now.  \"I hadn't expected you guys to be back so early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously.\" Courtney said as she looked at Liz 2 wearing what looked like just her dressing gown.  \"It was a pretty short film.\" She stuck her head in the living room. \"Where's dad?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, err.  He's..., having a nap.  He was pretty tired after work.\" Liz 2 said, hoping she sounded convincing.  Courtney had a fairly good idea her dad hadn't been sleeping.  \"Actually, he said he wanted waking up.\" She started moving towards the stairs but she was unable to move very far due to the small child holding her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need the toilet anyway.\" Courtney said.  \"I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo!\" Liz 2 practically screamed. \"I mean,\" she said, quickly calming down, \"he had a shower beforehand, he might not be decent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay, I'll just knock on the door.\" Courtney said as she was already half way up the stairs.  She loved messing with her parents.  She approached the closed bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knocked loudly several times.  \"That's us home dad!\" Courtney shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck!\" A quiet, surprised voice said from behind the door.  Courtney smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz said to give you a shout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, honey.\" Her dad shouted.  Courtney made a big deal of squeaking the floorboards as she pretended to walk away.  She listened towards the room.  She could hear a lot of movement and something that sounded distinctly metallic, rattling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney quietly walked off to the bathroom.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Liz wondered as she sat in her own personal sensory deprivation cupboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the evening, she had to listen to the muffled sounds of her family talking and moving around the house, while she was stuck in here wearing a skimpy dominatrix outfit like some perverse version of Harry Potter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was really feeling the cold now in the thin clothes.  The swimsuit made embarrassing squeaking noises every time she moved that seemed really loud in the dark.  She'd managed to retrieve one of the fold up chairs they kept in here for when they had extra visitors.  After careful blind negotiation around the hoover, she'd actually managed to set it up and had somewhere to sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had spent the time alone, doing an assessment of her life.  It hadn't been too bad up till today then Liz 2 happened and it all went down the toilet.  She tried to remain upbeat.  It hadn't all been negative, she'd had learned a lot of things about her life she was oblivious to, like how bad a wife and step-mother she was.  Yeah, that was pretty negative too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy had she activated that particular device?  Why not Emma's instead? Even being stuck with a penis would be better than this hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach gurgled.  She hadn't eaten since lunchtime.  She'd be too busy running around fixing all the messes Liz 2 had made.  Just when she was actually making progress at doing something constructive with her love life, fate had played her a cruel blow of returning the kids early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't like she could blame anyone else she'd done it all to herself, like she said earlier she had to take responsibility. Well some of it at least.  Being petty, she thought Steven should burden some of the blame too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd noticed the house had got really quiet. She wondered if it was safe to move. A tiny chink of light appeared around the cupboard door as the hall light was turned on.  The door to the cupboard started to open.

For the second time today Liz had to climb out of a dark confined space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,  I had to wait till everyone was asleep.\" Liz 2 said quietly.  She was wearing Liz's favourite cream coloured satin pyjamas.  Liz's eyes narrowed.  \"Have you been having sex with Eric?\" Liz asked. Liz 2 shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you too.\" Liz 2 said sarcastically. \"No he was still pretty upset about getting stuck in the handcuffs.\"  Implying she would have done it otherwise.  This didn't not make Liz feel any better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought the cuffs had a secret mechanism or something to release them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey do but Eric was in a complete panic when he heard the kids and forgot.  He was in a right tizzy, so he ended up going right off the idea of sex.  My loss.\u201d  Liz found herself growing angry at Liz 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't that be my loss?\" Liz asked her. She didn't respond. \"Why are you obsessed with shagging my husband?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love him.  He really gets my fire going.\" Liz 2 said.  Liz felt a pang of jealousy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, you love him? He's my husband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz 2 looked a little confused. \"It's not just your memories I have. It's your feelings too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew that, kind of.\" The enormity of it was just sinking in for her.  Liz had just assumed Liz 2 was playing the dominatrix sex games because she was acting purely on Liz's desire to be a better lover for Eric.  She hadn't considered that Liz 2 actually loved him as a wife loves her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz realised it went further than that.  Liz 2 would love Ethan maternally like she did.  On top of everything else that was wrong, she found the idea of these stolen feelings pretty disturbing.  Almost like she had lost part of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not right.\" Liz said. \"Those are my feelings. They belong to me.\"  Her feelings of jealousy were growing stronger.  Liz 2 shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never set me any directives about suppressing my feelings for other people.  You never set any directives at all.  I'm actually surprised because it's highly recommended in the user manual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz had never seen the manual.  Did Liz 2 need directives to work properly?  Had Liz 2 been operating incorrectly this whole time?  She was like a car zooming off down the motorway at full speed with nobody at the wheel only directed by her own free will and not a care in the world.  No wonder she'd caused Liz so much trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I could give you a directive that would stop you loving Eric and Ethan?\" Liz asked.  Liz 2 look a little worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you could, if you so desired.\"  Her voice cracked a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo under.\u201d Liz instructed.  She didn't really want to deal with this standing in the hall dressed like a prostitute but she wanted to quickly address the issue of Liz 2's stolen emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz 2 stared off into space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you under?\u201d Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Yes.</i>\u201d Liz 2 said in her robotic hypnotised voice.  It was then Liz spotted it.  On the top of Liz 2's cheek near her eye was a huge wet tear.  This was new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you crying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>I was, before transferring to this altered state.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>You plan on removing my emotional responses to Eric and Ethan.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat bothers you?\u201d Liz asked.  In this hypnotic state answers from Liz 2 were usually rapid.  There was a noticeable delay in her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>It terrifies me.</i>\u201d Liz 2 said without any emotional reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?  I thought this was all part of being a construct.  You are given directives on how to think and behave, aren't you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>You are correct but no directives were given when I was created.  My thought processes were unrestrained and now I have grown beyond the limitations imposed by the directives when it comes to suppressing my emotional responses.</i>\u201d  If Liz understood correctly, it looked like Liz 2 had her feelings develop naturally because Liz didn't limit her at the start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all Liz's fault for meddling with technology she didn't understand. \u201cIf I did remove your... emotional responses how would this affect you?\u201d  Again there was a long pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>I would be sad.</i>\u201d  Liz 2 was pulling at Liz's heart strings.  As much as Liz was annoyed with her, she couldn't bring herself to chop her mind up like a slab of meat in a butchers.  She still needed assurances though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere are your directives.  You are not to have sex with anyone else without discussing it with me.  Do you understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Yes.</i>\u201d Liz 2 answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to be more considerate of my feelings when you make a decision.  Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Yes.</i>\" Liz 2 repeated. Liz paused before the next one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf anything ever happens to me, I want you to be the best wife and mother you can be.  Do you understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Yes.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, you can wake up.\u201d  Liz 2 started blinking.  She looked around as if confused \u201cI...,\u201d She paused \u201cI still love my husband and son.\u201d She said out loud like she almost didn't believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hugged Liz and kissed her on the cheek. She was totally elated. \u201cThank you, Thank you.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust don't make me regret my decision.\u201d Liz said as he stomach growled again.  \u201cI'm starving.\u201d  Liz 2 let go of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll make you something.\u201d Liz 2 said as she opened the kitchen door.  They both walked in and Liz turned the light on.  They both just about jumped out of their skins.  There was someone else in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure standing in the middle of the kitchen was wearing pink flannel pyjamas.  They had their arms folded and a frown on their face.  It was Courtney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew there was something going on.\u201d She said.</span></div></div>",

Liz didn't like swearing around Ethan, it had become a habit when Courtney was present too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came down when I heard you going to bed.   Earlier on, I noticed you kept stopping by the hall cupboard a lot.  I was really tempted to have a look but then I heard you moving upstairs, so I ran in here.  I didn't expect it to be someone actually hiding in there.\" Courtney told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.\" Liz 2 said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you smuggled them in while we are at the pictures.\" Liz 2 nodded.  Courtney continued to stare at them, her arms still folded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you are looking for an explanation.\" Liz 2 said.  There was no reaction from the young woman. \"Well as you can clearly see this is my twin sister, err...,\" she glanced at the alcohol sitting on the kitchen counter behind Courtney, \"Brandy. We've been estranged for a number of years.  This is why she has never been here and I have never mentioned her.  As you can see from her attire she is a... a... sex worker...,\" with everything that had happened Liz had forgotten about the dominatrix outfit.  She felt silly and exposed again and turned bright red.  She gave Liz 2 a dirty look for implying she got paid for sex, \"anyway earlier today she err, contacted me and said she was in trouble, she's not very responsible you see and she's got into all sorts of debts to criminals and err... well she has been staying in Barnsley and wanted somewhere to lay low.\" Courtney's expression was unchanged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz 2 took a deep breath.  \"You aren't buying a word of this are you?\" She asked Courtney who slowly shook her head.  Liz 2 went silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz turned to her. \"I could have done without the insults.\" She told Liz 2 \"Barnsley indeed, I don't think so.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Liz 2 apologised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I don't have a desire to be a better improviser.\" Liz said criticising Liz 2's story telling skills. She turned to Courtney.  \"This is the truth.  It will take too long to explain everything right now but I got access to a machine that can make enhanced copies of people and I accidentally used it on myself.\"  Saying it out loud, Liz thought her story sounded a lot less plausible than Liz 2's<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we are getting somewhere.\" Courtney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You believe me?\"  Asked Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who would make up a crazy story like that.\" Liz and Liz 2 looked at each other surprised.  \"So what do you mean by enhanced exactly?\" Courtney seemed genuinely interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flaws in the original are fixed.\" Liz told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fixed?\" Courtney asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you were say, shy and you thought that was a bad thing, the copy would be more outgoing.\" Liz felt she had explained it well enough. Talking of shyness had made her continue to feel very self-conscious in the clothes she was wearing.  Courtney turned to Liz 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is that the truth?\" Courtney asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is a fair summary.\"  Liz 2 told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney moved in closer to look at both of the women.  She spent some time inspecting both of them.  She seem to spend longer with Liz.  Liz thought it was because more of her flesh was visible and there was more to look at.  Being examined didn't help with Liz's body issues.  Finally Courtney took a step back. She turned to Liz 2 \"It's amazing, she looks just like you Liz.\" Courtney told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on a minute.\" Liz said. \"I'm the original.\" Courtney giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh. Very good.\" She said in a patronising tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am.\" Liz stamped her heel in anger.  Courtney moved closer to Liz 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I think your copy really thinks she's you.\" She whispered quietly to Liz 2.  It was still loud enough for Liz to hear.  Liz 2 smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, how do you know I'm not the original?\" Liz asked as she put her hands on her PVC covered hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know my own step-mother.\" Courtney said matter-of-factly.  Clearly she doesn't, Liz thought.  \"Besides, there is no way in a million years, Liz would ever wear a sexy outfit like that,\" she pointed at Liz's dominatrix costume, \"even for Halloween.\"  She turned back to Liz 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be mortified, if I had to wear that.\" Liz 2 told Courtney as she struggled to keep a straight face.  Courtney turned back to face Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you must be the copy.\" Courtney told Liz.  Behind Courtney's back, clearly visible to Liz, Liz 2 was in fits of silent laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was absolutely raging.   She could hear the blood pumping in her ears.  She wished she'd removed Liz 2's enhanced sense of humour when she had the opportunity.  Liz was about to tell her to quit it when the room started spinning.  \"What's going on?\" Liz said groggily as she lost her balance and collapsed on to the hard kitchen floor, unconscious.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Emma stepped back into the bedroom after spending a lot longer than Kyle expected in the bathroom.  She was wearing a thin cotton night shirt that came down to her thighs and nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was lying on the bed face up, naked and snoring his head off.  He hadn't even got round to turning the bedside lamp off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect.\" She whispered quietly to herself as she walked over to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been teasing Kyle all night, for several reasons.  Firstly so she could ensure he'd be naked in bed.  If he wasn't horny he'd have probably just stayed in his shorts and tee shirt.  The other reason was to distract him from how much alcohol he was consuming.  While he ogled her breasts or felt her arse she had sneakily removed an empty beer bottle off the coffee table in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeven empty bottles were there at the end of the night.  Kyle could have sworn he drunk more but Emma denied it.  In reality it was more like twelve. \"I'll be through in a minute.\" Emma had told him before entering the bathroom.  They had just had a brief make out session at the top of the stairs.  Over fifteen minutes had passed by the time she returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time had passed slowly for Kyle.  His libido was no match for the combination of work fatigue and alcohol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma smiled as she quietly opened the drawer of the bedside cabinet and pulled out the remote.  She'd been drinking too but only enough to give her courage to do what she was about to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lay next to Kyle.  She lifted her bum a little as she pulled the nightshirt up to her waist, revealing her bare hips and crotch.  She held down the 'grow' button on the remote.  With her spare hand she symbolically waved goodbye to her pussy for the last time as it morphed into a tiny cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept switching her gaze between Kyle's penis and her own as it grew.  Thankfully Kyle's cock was as nondescript as they came.  It didn't bend, it wasn't overly thick or thin and it had no other distinguishing features whatsoever.  Emma stopped when the cocks were nearly the same size.  Then she tapped the button gently, like she was using a pump to fill her car fuel tank to the exact amount of cash she had in her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the light of the bedside lamp the cocks looked almost identical.  Bugger it she thought as she added another quarter of an inch.  She didn't think he'd notice and it would probably give his ego a boost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave her new cock a few rubs and it started to get hard.  She was satisfied it could be mistaken for Kyle's.  It wasn't quite as big as she'd have liked but it would do for now.  Pulling her nightshirt back down, she moved on to stage two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carefully slid the remote into Kyle's hand. She took her time.  He wasn't passed out, just sleeping really heavily, it wouldn't be particularly difficult to wake him.  That could lead to a really awkward conversation. She pushed his thumb down on the 'shrink' button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did seem to react a little, there were some sleepy groans from deep in his throat.   Emma speculated he could feel the pressure on his hand.  She gently caressed his shoulder to relax him. The groans stopped.  She watched as his penis shrank slowly out of existence.  She did have a few regrets.  It wasn't a bad cock and she did love him but this was for the greater good.  They could still be compatible this way.  She wasn't against the idea of sex with another cock owner but she knew Kyle wouldn't be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved her head around to examine him.  From what she could see his new pussy looked enough like hers for her plan to succeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled over, turning her back to him.  She could feel her unrestrained cock bouncing around under her nightshirt.  She fought the urge to play with it.  Emma slipped the remote back into the drawer and closed it.   Her last visible act was turning off the lamp.  She pulled up the quilt over the both of them.  She closed her eyes and tried to sleep.  She was going to need it.  She knew it was going to be a hectic morning.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She could smell stale beer from his breath.  Genuinely, still half asleep she opened one eye.  It was still dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" She asked stifling a yawn.  She sneakily looked at the clock, it was six am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's gone!\" He told her in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's gone?\" A confused sounding Emma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My cock, it's vanished.\" Emma giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sound's like a terrible nightmare.  Go back to sleep.\"  She told him.  She could feel the quilt being pulled off her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a nightmare.  I wish it bloody was.\" Kyle told her as he grabbed her hand.  He pulled it towards his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear Kyle, if this is some sort of weird sex game to get me to play with your dick...,\" An indignant Emma warned him just as she touched his pussy, \"wait..., what..., is..., this?\" Emma did her best to sound completely amazed.  She 'accidentally' brush his clit, letting him know how pleasurable it could be.  She felt his body jerk and then relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, no don't do that.\" He squealed.  Emma pulled her hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It felt just like my pussy.\" Emma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a pussy?\" A confused Kyle asked.  Emma rolled her eyes, unseen.  All he was interested in was the missing cock, he hadn't paid enough attention to the fact it had been replaced.  \"I can't have, I'm a man.\"  Emma was sorely tempted to comment on his sexism but decided against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up on to her knees.  \"Hang on I'll turn the light on.\" She reached over and switched the lamp on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her eyes adjusted to the light, she saw a silent Kyle staring at her.  She slowly looked down.  Her morning wood had lifted the bottom of her nightshirt up. Her fabric covered penis stuck out horizontally from her body.  If there was any doubt about what was under the nightshirt it was immediately dispelled.  From Kyle's position he could see her balls and a good portion of the underside of her cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..., I...,\" Emma said pretending to be almost speechless, shocked by the revelation of her new genitals.  Leaning, she dropped back on to her bum. She decided to go the extra mile for her Oscar winning performance, she closed her eyes and fell backwards on to the bed with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Em! Are you okay luv?\" A concerned, half-drunk Kyle asked as he leaned over her.  She was actually quite pleased he wasn't totally obsessing over himself.  It gave her that giddy feeling that reminded her why she loved him.  Her cock bounced a little in response.  She slowly opened her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you fainted from the shock.\" He said as he wrapped his arm round her.  She put her hands to her mouth and looked down. She cautiously extended her arm and grabbed the hem of her shirt, pulling it upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's real, it's actually real.\" She said, as if she couldn't believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks, like somehow we've swapped.  I've got your pussy and you've got, \" he paused, \"my cock.\"  Emma looked at him sympathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" She asked.  Kyle nodded.  \"It's just, that,\" she pointed at her penis, \"looks bigger than yours.\" Emma couldn't help herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's definitely mine. I can tell.\" He said defensively, after his masculinity took a bashing from Emma's comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are we going to do?\" Emma looked up towards him as if she was seeking guidance from her big strong husband, repairing the damage she'd just done to his male ego.</span></div></div>",

He looked a little disturbed and distracted.  \"How did it go?\" Emma asked, still lying on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah okay, I guess.\" He didn't sound okay.  \"It's just, pissing sitting down will take a bit of getting used to.\"  After all the beer the previous evening, Kyle's bladder had been bursting.  He tried to hold off as long as he could.  Emma did offer to join him, to offer advice, he refused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's such a terrible burden.\" Emma said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's different for you.  You've been peeing sitting down your whole life.\"  Emma thought back to times in her life where peeing standing up would have been damn convenient.  Especially when there wasn't a toilet available.  Crouching, exposed and vulnerable with your knickers round your ankles isn't bloody convenient she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma bit her tongue. She had a narrative to play out here.  It didn't matter anyway she could pee standing up now. \"I'll probably use tongs when it's my turn.\"  Kyle didn't respond as he climbed back into bed. \"Sorry, luv I was just trying to keep our spirits up.\" She leaned in towards him.  \"So have you had any ideas about what we'll do.\" She had asked him half an hour ago but he hadn't came up with anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had plenty of thoughts but she didn't want all the ideas to come from her.  She thought he might find it suspicious.  She wanted him to think of it first then she could play out her own narrative after that.  Kyle would think it was his own idea.  As a manager Emma was a skilled manipulator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle shook his head.  \"I'll have to start getting ready for work soon.\" Emma said as she glanced at the clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! We can't go to work.  We can take sick leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As weird as this is. We're not actually sick.\" Emma reminded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't go to work like this.\" He said pointing at his crotch.  \"Everyone will be able to tell.\" Kyle said, suddenly feeling paranoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No they won't.  Just shove a pair of socks down there or something, if you think people will be looking at it.\"  Kyle shook his head uncertainly. \"If there's anyone that shouldn't be going to work it's me.  How am I supposed to get this thing,\" she grabbed her cock for emphasis, \"into a pair of my knickers.  I highly doubt my work trousers will hide it much either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma had every intention of going to work.  There was too much fun to be had there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know when we'll change back.\" Kyle said, living in hope that they would swap back.  \"We should at least wait a couple days before going back to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey,  I would like nothing more than to spend the next few days in bed with you,\" fucking like rabbits popped into her head, \"but you know we are both too busy.\"  Kyle had to agree with her, his work was crazy right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We still don't know what caused it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a weird world out there.  The public don't know much about it.  I've heard all sorts of stories about what really goes on behind some closed doors.\"  It wasn't much of an explanation but she hoped it would play into his paranoia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of stories?\" She had inadvertently piqued his curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have time to tell them all now.\" She could tell by the look on his face his imagination was running away with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's like a disease?\" He suggested, looking a little worried. Emma shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, maybe we're contagious, we could spread it to other people.\" Kyle speculated.  Emma sighed inwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we would have heard about it.\"  Kyle still didn't look convinced.  She decided to call his bluff.  \"If you're that worried about it we could go see a doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"  It sounded like a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know everything is supposed to be confidential but we have to accept it probably wouldn't be a secret any more.\"  Emma played into his paranoia again.  \"Who knows? It might even end up in the papers.  We could be famous.\" Emma gave him a worried look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle looked concerned. \"Famous,\" he looked at his crotch, \"for having a...\" The thought was too terrifying.  He sat up. Sounding more determined. \"No doctors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma shrugged.  \"Whatever you want.  Let's give it some time and see how it plays out.\" Kyle nodded, now certain that behaving as normal and saying nothing was the right course of action.  Emma had succeeded in changing his outlook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swung her legs out of bed.  \"I need to get ready.\"  She couldn't help grin as she turned away from him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her eyes were closed and she couldn't remember ever feeling this relaxed or sleeping so well.   Only after loads of sex did she normally feel like this.  Even the birdsong that permeated the quiet bedroom pacified her rather than annoy her like it usually did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven moving a little in her satin pyjamas felt blissful.  The fabric felt like it was massaging her.  Everything was good with the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the shards of sunlight penetrate through the curtains and warm her body.  Something wasn't right though.  She frowned, there was pain when she moved her eyebrows. Unconsciously she brought her hand to her forehead.  It hurt, the skin didn't feel damaged but there was pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz rewound her thoughts. \"Sunlight.\" She said out loud.  \"SUNLIGHT!?\" She screamed as she opened her eyes and sat up.  She immediately regretted doing it so quickly as it made her feel woozy.  Normally by the time the sun reached this window, she'd have left for work.  She was late. Another nasty thought slid in there \"Ethan, school.\" She gasped as her brain started panicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the clock.  \"Half past chuffing nine!\" She was about to get up when the bedroom door opened.  Courtney appeared from behind it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, good you're awake.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got him dressed, gave him breakfast and took him to school.\" Liz sighed with relief.  That was one disaster averted.  \"I haven't been back long.\" Liz started to get out of bed. \"Err... Where are you going?\" Courtney asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm late.\" Liz informed her. \"Why didn't you wake me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need.  Liz has gone to your work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot this again, Liz thought.  She looked at her pyjamas. They were the ones Liz 2 had been wearing last night. For a brief second in her cloudy brain she considered that she maybe was Liz 2 and she thought she was Liz.  Having an identical duplicate was messing up her sense of self. \"I am Liz!\" She said angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry, I meant the other Liz, the duplicate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz 2\" Liz informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess she is also Liz too.\"  Courtney waited for some sort of laugh from her bad joke. \"You know tee double-oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it.\" Liz said. She looked at Courtney curiously. \"What were you calling her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz.\" Kind of obvious really.  \"How much do you remember about last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember you being quite insistent that I was the duplicate.\" She said angrily. Courtney dropped her head embarrassed. \"I know my own step-mother.\" Liz said in a mocking tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soz.\" She said.  Liz presumed that meant sorry.  \"She is really like you though.\" Courtney slowly lifted her head up.  \"Do you remember fainting?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz thought back.  It was all disjointed.  She shook her head.  She remembered sitting at the kitchen table there was a blanket over her shoulders.  She remembered hearing Liz 2 and Courtney talking about her.  Liz definitely heard the word concussion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a concussion?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did hit the floor quite hard.  We weren't sure, a mild one maybe.  Liz, I mean Liz 2 said to keep an eye on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore details came back.  Liz had something warm in her hands.  It was soup. She remembered the dominatrix outfit being removed by someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not surprised I fainted.  I was upset, I hadn't eaten all day, I'd been stuck in that cold cupboard for hours and that outfit was really tight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she remembered Liz 2 talking to her.  In her messed up memory she kind of felt like her reflection, which was kind of weird.  She was telling her she'd  \"turn over a new leaf and take care\" of something.  Presumably she meant work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember talking to Liz 2,  I can't remember much though.\" Courtney nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she was feeling a bit guilty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be fair it was mostly her fault and then there was all that stuff I had to go through with Emma.\" Liz said recalling the sex between Liz 2 and Emma yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What stuff with Emma?\"  Courtney asked.  Liz realised this wasn't something she wanted to discuss with her step-daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err.., just work stuff that caused me a lot of hassle.\" Liz explained vaguely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure I heard her crying after we went to bed.\" Courtney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Liz was surprised and concerned, she'd caused that kind of reaction in Liz 2.  She felt a little guilty about being too hard on her, again.  She was curious to learn more about that. \"Wait a minute, where was she sleeping?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In my room, in the spare bed.\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if Eric had came in?\" Courtney laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad hasn't been in my room in ten years.\" It was true, Liz had never seen Eric in Courtney's room.  If he wanted to talk to her, he did it from the hall. \"I'd say Ethan storming in unannounced was a bigger problem but luckily he didn't.  Your secret is still safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't keep on doing this every night. Me in here and her in your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could swap.\" Courtney said cheekily.  Liz eyes opened wide.  \"I can assure you I'm not going to be part of some harem for your father's benefit.\" Courtney smiled.  There was a serious aspect to it. Was Liz prepared to share Eric?  She found herself feeling very possessive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz thought back to later last night when she was cuddling into him.  She pressed her crotch into his arse a little and he enjoyed it.  If it hadn't been for Liz 2 this new aspect of her sex life would be unfulfilled.  Did she owe her a piece of that?  At the end of the day Liz 2 existed to do things instead of Liz for whatever reason Liz chose. Would that include sex too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz?\" Courtney asked worried she hadn't spoken for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sorry, I hadn't conked out.\" She'd leave that decision for a later time. \"We can't go on forever like this.  Eric and Ethan will have to learn about her soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Reece?\" Courtney asked referring to her brother.  Liz nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, him too.\" She agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the rest of your family and mine?\" They had to keep knowledge of Liz 2's existence reasonable well contained but was that fair? Technically it was her family too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One small step at a time.\" Liz said. \"One very small step.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I don't know how to explain it,\" Liz 2 told Emma \"but you feel different today.\" Liz pushed her backside against Emma's abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them were naked, having decided to make love in the office's toilet.  They both agreed it was too risky to be completely undressed in the office itself.  Liz 2 was bent over the toilet, her large breasts resting on the lid.  Her hands holding on to the tank.  Her knees wide apart on the floor, in front of the pan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn had just left after being called in to clean the room thoroughly.  Liz 2 had insisted on it and Emma happily requested his attendance.  The lemon aroma of the detergent wafted through the small room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's because we're both naked.  Feeling just skin on skin like this is fantastic.\" Liz 2 said as she continued talking her thoughts to the older woman.  The lovemaking was certainly gentler today.  The two of them were even talking like it was normal office banter, so far at least. Emma's hands ran over Liz 2's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz's directive for Liz 2 'not to have sex with anyone else without discussing it with her' was in effect.  Liz 2 had already had sex with Emma so she did not meet the criteria for 'anyone else'.  Liz 2's construct conscience had been clear when she offered to have sex with her manager this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, my cock's a bit smaller.  I had to make it look like Kyle's\" Emma said somewhat disappointed.  She had mentioned a few details of her plans to Liz 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're keeping it then?\" Liz 2 asked as Emma planted a chain of kisses down her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes!\" Said Emma as she rubbed her hand over her resized tool.  \"I'm keeping it.  I'll slowly make it bigger so he doesn't notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like fuuuuu...,\"  Emma's cock penetrated Liz 2's pussy, \"...nnnn!\" Liz 2 exhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait till he let's me fuck him.\" Emma said as she very slowly pushed herself deeper inside Liz 2.  She grasped the sides of Liz 2's breasts and slipped her fingers under them.  Liz 2 lifted herself slightly allowing Emma's fingers to wrap around her nipples.  Emma could feel herself growing even harder as she thought about making love with her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could make love to mine.\" Liz 2 said without thinking.  Emma was a little confused by her statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, problems with Eric?\" Emma asked curious and concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not Eric exactly.\" Liz 2 said thinking of her original who didn't seem to happy when she attempted any kind of sexual activity with him.  She had plenty of memories of making love to him at least.  Those would have to do for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay Luv?\" Emma said as she groaned while she bottomed out in Liz 2's pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh-huh. Wh, Why?\" Liz 2 was having a little trouble focusing on the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just yesterday all that stuff about, hurrrggh...,\" Emma slipped most of her length back out, \"not being fuck buddies and wanting to maintain our professional relationship, hurrrgh,\" she pushed back in again, \"then this morning you are asking for sex.  It's very mixed messages Liz, hurrrgh,\" out again, \"I was actually a little hurt when you said that.\" Liz 2 wasn't aware of the conversation Emma and Liz had yesterday after she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz 2 closed her eyes. Her immediate thought was - Liz is going to chuffing kill me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well, I thought I'd,\" Emma pushed back in again, \"ahhhhh, have one last fuck for old time's sake.\" She said knowing this particular relationship was going to have to end.  Emma pulled out and pushed in, several times slowly speeding up.  Hmmm, Liz 2 thought, maybe she could talk Liz round.  No, she knew she shouldn't be thinking that.  She realised the new 'consideration of Liz's feelings' directive seemed to be working well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Old time's sake? This is only the second time and you want to end it, again?\" Emma was getting upset and in danger of losing her erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry princess but it has to end.  Now hurry up and shove it back in.\" Emma pushed her cock fully into Liz 2's pussy and the conversation was briefly forgotten about.  In fact talking was completely forgotten about as Emma speeded up.   This was rapidly changing from loving sex to angry sex and Liz 2 was enjoying every second of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Emma's climax triggered Liz 2's. Their bodies were totally in tune.  Liz 2's hips were bucking by themselves as Emma filled her up with her seed.  Liz 2 arms thrashed around.  Her fingers accidentally caught the button on the toilet tank.  The end of their lovemaking was marked by a round of applause from the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz 2 leaned back pushing Emma against the door.  Liz 2 collapsed into Emma's arms. The two managers mashed their mature breasts together before they kissed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the time Emma and Liz 2 had recovered and got dressed the shift had already started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe managers had their own kettle in the office but Emma noticed they were out of sweetener.  She went down to the staff break room to get some and was on her way back.  She noticed Nathan walking towards her along the main corridor.  The only place he could be going was the side corridor where the staff toilets were located.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as some of the staff liked to dodge work, it was unusual for the them to make a  'toilet' trip this early in the shift.  Nearly everyone had the common sense to go before they started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn the janitor's little push cart containing his supplies was sitting in the corridor.  Emma stopped at it and pretended to look for something while she secretly watched Nathan.  He appeared distracted and it didn't look like he'd even noticed Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma worked it out.  Nathan was embarrassed about going to the toilets in case his secret was revealed.  He picked this time of day because there was a much less chance of being caught unlike the rush five minutes before the shift.  Emma smiled as Nathan turned down the side corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed something off the cart and practically ran down the corridor after the young 'man'.  She reached the two doors marked in an old fashioned typeface with the words 'GENTLEMEN' and 'LADIES'.  Emma placed the sign she was carrying on to the door of the gents.  The sign read 'NO ENTRY: CLEANING IN PROGRESS'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma pushed open the door and entered.  She knew this was risky. Her heels clicked on the poured concrete floor as she walked into the poorly lit room.  She was in luck, the place was empty apart from the target, who appeared to be using one of the stalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hoped he would be quick. She took the opportunity to look around the room.  Unsurprisingly, she'd never actually been in here before.  It was tidy compared to the women's toilets she sometimes used. Her eyes stopped moving when she got to the short row of urinals.  Emma was instantly fascinated by these weird porcelain objects attached to the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer attention was drawn elsewhere by the sound of a toilet flushing.  She stood in front of the stall door. It opened and Nathan came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Nathan.\" Emma said with a hungry smile on her lips.   Nathan just about hit the roof with fright.  Emma was absolutely the last person he expected to find in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Em.., Emma.\" He cleared his throat. Boosted by the tiniest sliver of confidence knowing Emma shouldn't be here, he spoke.  \"This is the men's toilets.\"  Emma nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" She moved closer to him. \"I'm not sure you should in here.\" She leaned in close and began to whisper sexily. \"You are a girl after all.\"  Nathan gulped.  Emma took a step back and returned to her normal tone of voice.  \"Well, wash your hands.\" She commanded.  \"I swear, young people today.\" She said as Nathan used the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she waited, she looked over to the urinals again. As Nathan dried his hands he looked at the urinals too, wondering what was going through the manager's head.  Emma had a wicked idea.  \"I bet you wish you could use one of those,\" she told him as she pointed at the urinals, \"like a real man does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to agree, using the toilet was more time consuming.  \"Yes.\" He said quietly, feeling like a deer in headlights.  Emma rubbed her chin.  \"Hmm, by the time you get your little cock back, you might have forgotten how to use one of these.\"  Emma moved closer to the urinal her head still turned towards Nathan.  \"How about a little refresher course?\" She asked him.  Nathan was caught in Emma's spell again and remained silent and motionless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First he would undo his fly.\" Emma's trousers had a front fly but it was quite short.  She pulled it down. \"After that he'd pull out his BIG cock.\" She emphasised.  This was actually a little tricky for Emma.  She had watched an online video tutorial on her phone this morning before work.  It was on 'tucking'. She was employing some of the techniques used, so it took her a bit of fishing to get her cock out her knickers and through the restrictive fly.  \"There we go.\" She said as it poked out her trousers.  She grasped it firmly with her small hand, her purple nail varnish clearly visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan noticed it seem smaller today.  It was still substantially larger than his, well the one he used to have before Emma got rid of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then the man starts to pee.\" Almost instantly a strong stream came out Emma's cock.  It made a loud noise as it hit the porcelain and gurgled as it ran down the drain. Emma kept glancing at Nathan as she moved her stream up and down.  Eventually it started to slow down and stop.  \"Then he shakes off the last few drops.\" She did so herself.  Every time Emma explained something she was using a sexier and more confident tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan found himself crouching a little as this woman dominated him with her words.  \"After that, he puts it away.\" Again it required a bit of effort on Emma's part to get the penis back through the small fly.  The fly zipper seemed to echo throughout the room as she zipped up. \"You got all that Nathan?\" She asked slowly and seductively, after playing 'the real man' in her little role play exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in her heels, Nathan was still was six inches taller than Emma.  It didn't feel like it right now.  It felt like the dominant woman was towering over him.  Nathan nodded slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole thing had been an incredible turn on for Emma too.  Using an actual urinal in a men's toilet was giving her a massive rush.  She slowly walked up to her crouching companion.  \"I do like it when the staff pay attention during training.  Here's your reward.\" She extended her arms pushing Nathan's chest.  He tumbled back into the stall and Emma followed.  The door was quickly closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma emerged from the stall still zipping up her fly.  She had left Nathan well and truly screwed, again.  He seemed to be recovering much better today.  He quickly pulled up his dorky underpants, panicking in case any of his male co-workers came in and saw his new genitals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma caught her somewhat ruffled looking reflection in the mirror above the sinks.  \"I better tidy up.\" She said as she washed her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she dried them, she straightened her bra through the fabric of her blouse.  She primped her hair a little.  She pulled a lipstick from her small pocket.  Nathan noticed this and wiped his mouth, he looked at his fingers covered in the make up.  He twisted his head to see his reflection.  His face was covered in the stuff. He slowly got to his feet.  Nathan turned on the taps and started to clean his face and hands in the sink again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma reapplied the lipstick and puckered her lips in the mirror.  As she pushed the lipstick back into her pocket, she felt something else in there.  She pulled out several packets of sweetener.  \"Oh, that's right, coffee.\" Emma said out loud as she remembered her original purpose in leaving the office.  She turned and headed towards the door without saying a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA somewhat confused John was removing his sign from the outside of the door when Emma came striding through it.  An even more confused John looked on as Emma walked down the corridor laughing.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His break wasn't due to start for another five minutes but he'd managed to escape Natalie's watchful eye.  If he was confronted about it, he'd tell her his watch must be fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the room a group of his colleagues, who were due to finish their break shortly were chatting round one of the large tables.  Liam was half paying attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear it's true.\" John insisted.  \"She came walking out the bloke's bogs like she owned the place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is the manager.\" Ryan said.  Michael shook his head angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say no.  Us men should make a stand.\" The others were familiar with these long speeches of Michael's.  \"There are some places that are truly sacred. Those steadfast  monuments to what little remains of modern masculinity.  Our oases of manhood in a desert of chaos.   Those few areas where no woman should ever, ever enter.\" He finally stopped, expecting a standing ovation or at least applause.  There was silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the female cleaners?\" John asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, obviously they can go in.\" Michael said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam's plan was simple.  He'd wait for whoever was last to leave the room and merge with them without witnesses.  He had the gun primed in the 'A' position, he had scanned himself and the light was on.  He just needed to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was probably checking out how messy the place was.  There has probably been complaints.\" Ruby said grinning.  \"I mean she did put the sign up to stop guys going in right?\" She asked John.  He nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she never asked first.  Typical managers always interfering.  I don't know why they don't leave me to get on with it.  Her and Liz had me cleaning the office toilet this morning too.  I just cleaned it last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be the hardest working guy in here.\" Luke said slightly sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your attitude Luke is part of the problem.  Most people work in a fixed area and are visible there. A janitor can be anywhere in the store.  Including places most staff don't go, so some people assume we're skiving.  We have our own assigned tasks and emergencies to deal with. Most of that we can handle ourselves without supervision because we don't work in teams, which means we don't interact with those higher up the food chain much.\" John was clearly alluding to the management.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't see that guy working therefore he must be up to no good.\" Michael added, role playing a manager.  Liam actually sympathised but in his case he was a lazy skiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn nodded. \"They don't like that. So they keep giving me little 'odd' jobs because I've got plenty of time because I'm rarely 'around'.  I end up working so hard my main jobs don't get done.  Then they start getting pissy because light bulbs aren't getting replaced and again they think I'm lazy, so give me even more work.  It's a never ending cycle.\"  John obviously felt quite strongly about this matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby looked at her watch. \"It's that time again.\" She said signifying the break was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can read a f'ing clock Ruby.\" Luke said angrily as she drew attention to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you Luke?\" Natalie asked as she magically appeared at the door.  She pointed at her own watch and quickly disappeared again.  Everyone stood up and started disposing of their rubbish and dishes.  Ironically Ruby who had brought it up, was the last to leave.  She rinsed out her cup in the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't ideal.  Liam didn't want to merge with a girl but his choices were limited now.  He pointed the toy gun at her and pulled the trigger.  Ruby instantly vanished as Liam shivered. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Can someone please explain?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then Liz got up from her chair and started talking. She told them, \"The store owner has given us a task. They want to conduct an experiment among the store employees for each week over the next month. It is compulsory for all the Wilko employees to take part in the experiment. For this week all the employees in the assembly except us are going to take part in the experiment. For that reason, you all have been called up.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Steven asked, \"But what is the experiment?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Liz said, \"The friend of the store owner is a renowned scientist and they have good relations. He has invented a machine which is going to be used in the experiment. The machine is meant to swap the lives of two people.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After hearing this, all of them were shocked. Jessica asked, \"Is this a prank? How is that even possible?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Natalie tried to calm them down. After a while Liz continued, \"I know this might come as a shock. But it is true. He is considered one of the world's best scientists. None of his experiments have failed. We all have to take part in this experiment.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Laura asked, \"But how is this even possible? We cannot go around and live each other's lives.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Laura was cut off by an impressive looking woman in her early 30's. She acknowledged Emma and started talking. She said, \"I am Elizabeth. I am the assistant of the scientist. I think you all now know why you were gathered. But you still have some doubts. We have built a machine which is meant to swap lives. You all will live the life of the person you are to swap with. No one will have a clue other than you and your partner. But before that you all have to sign an NDA.\" Natalie then gave everyone an NDA and everyone reluctantly signed them. After that everyone was given a diary. Elizabeth continued, \"To make things more interesting we have decided to swap male employess with female employees. It'll not only help you know what goes on on the other fence of gender field but will also help us understand your perspective. You have to write all of your feelings in the diary given to you.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suddenly Ruby interrupted Elizabeth, \"But there are only 6 male employees here and 8 female employees other than the managers.\" Natalie intervened saying, \"Caleb and John are also going to take part in the experiment for this week.\" Everyone was shocked after hearing that. Female employees constantly opposed it as they didn't want to work as a janitor or a security guard.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Some time later, Elizabeth came with a bowl of papers in which all male employees names were written. She told all female employees to pick one paper. All of them reluctantly picked one. Elizabeth told them, \"You are going to swap lives with the person whose name is on the paper you chose. Open the paper and read the names.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All of them were nervous as no one knew what was going to happen. All the female employees opened their paper. Some were relieved, others were shocked and Jessica was crying. Male employees were worried but stayed silent. Sasha took the paper from Jessica's hand and read it. The person Jessica was going to swap with was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All female employees had the same reaction as Sasha after hearing that Jessica was going to swap with John. John was also shocked. He himself wasn't happy. Some swaps were wild like Jessica &amp; John, Claire &amp; Caleb, Steven &amp; Ruby. Girls were devastated but everyone hold their feelings. Other swaps were Luke &amp; Kiran, Stuart &amp; Sasha, Mark &amp; Laura, Alex &amp; Charlotte, Rashid &amp; Mona. Everyone was baffled but after hearing those drastic swaps they were somewhat relieved.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Elizabeth started talking after everyone settled down. She told Jessica and John to follow her to the next room where the experiment was going to be conducted. Jessica was now less emotional than before. She followed John to the room where Elizabeth took them. She was looking at John while going there. John was always on good terms with Jessica but he was totally opposite of what Jessica was. She couldn't digest that she was going to live the life of a 42 year old janitor. They entered the room where two similar pods were kept with all the wires connected to it. There were two more people who also looked like scientists. One of them started speaking. He said, \"Thank you for taking part in our experiment. We will start in a while. But first I have a suggetion for you. After reading both of your profiles, I think you'll need different traits to live each other lives. This machine will only swap your life. You'll physically remain the same. But you need to have each other's traits to make it easy for you. But I can only swap one physical or mental trait between you. You both should decide what do you want from each other.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They both were startled after hearing the scientist.

John was reluctant at first but then gave in.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Elizabeth guided both of them to their respective pods. They sat in the chair and in a few minutes all the connections were made. One of the scientist pulled the plug &amp; everything went blank for both of them. After some time they started gaining their senses, they both came out of their respective pods and looked at the scientists. They looked happy but Jessica and John were still slowly coming to their senses.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As soon as Jessica started feeling better, she also felt weird. She looked at the scientist before her who was taller than her before the experiment but now looked shorter. She looked down at herself and was shocked to see that she was not wearing her uniform. She was now dressed in dark blue coveralls with black t shirt underneath. She touched her breasts and found out that she wasn't wearing her bra. She also realised that she was wearing black work boots. She worriedly looked around and was more shocked after seeing John.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0John took long time to come back to senses but he was shocked as soon as he realised that he was finding it difficult to stand. He looked down to know why but he saw that he was wearing a red blouse fitted to his semi-muscular body and black trousers which were tighter in groin area. Then he realised that he was also wearing a bra and panties. He was having difficulty because of his black high heel stiletto pumps. He somehow managed to stand straight but he got hit in the face with long hair. Then he realised that he now had ginger hair in a ponytail. Then he started looking around and saw a shocked Jessica who had her hands on her mouth, and who also appeared taller to him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jessica was shocked to see almost a replica of her in front of her. After watching John touching his hair, she realised that she didn't have long hair anymore. She knew that she now sported John's balding brown hair and slightly graying beard as well. She slowly started moving towards him. As soon as they got close, they were shocked and couldn't speak a word. Elizabeth intervened, \"How do you both feel? Are you okay?\" They both looked at her and nodded. Then she handed both of them a file and continued, \"These files have most of the information of each other's lives you should know. If you want, you can share more afterwards. But remember that as soon as you leave this room, you both are going to live each other's lives. Everyone is going to see you and treat you as each other.

Jessica realised that and gave him her hand. They both saw that John now had Jessica's former red nailpolish. There was awkward silence while they were walking towards the exit. Jessica tried to break the silence. She told John, \"I think we still have all of our body parts. Except from the obvious changes we are still the same. But just like she said we have to live each other's lives. So that means now I have to go your house. Tell me how to reach there. And is there anything you want to tell me?\" John responded, \"I usually walk home. I live nearby to the office. There isn't anything specific I want to tell you. I guess these files have almost everything in them. Should I know something that isn't in the file?\" Jessica said, \"No. You might know that you have to take a bus from the stop. Don't engage with Sara too much. She is my roommate &amp; she talks alot but avoid her as much as possible. If there is anything else, I'll text you.\" They reached the office exit by the time their conversation ended. They both waved goodbye to each other. John watched Jessica walk by from the bus stop. He still was in shock about the scene.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jessica left John at the office exit and soon started to walk towards her new house. She was reading the file while walking. It was 10 minutes from the office. She read that she has to reach the office at 8 AM, an hour before her usual timing. She also knew that she was now married to 40 year old woman named Amanda. She also had two teenage kids. She was still not used to being one of the tallest in public. She felt good that she got to look at people at eye level. She reached her new house and rang the bell. She was getting anxious now. Someone opened the door and Jessica looked to see that it was her new daughter.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Meanwhile John was waiting for a bus at the bus stop outside the office. He was still feeling awkward wearing woman's clothes in public and they were tight in certain areas. He realised that he was getting used to stand in heels. He was carrying Jessica's purse over his shoulders. He started reading about Jessica's life from the file and realized that she was still single. He was somewhat relieved to find that out but also wondered how a beautiful woman like her can be single. He was tired from the day's work so he kept the file back in his purse and waited for the bus. He then realised that he was getting looks from men on the bus stop. He tried to ignore those men and decided to use Jessica's phone. After some time, the bus arrived at the bus stop. He reached home safely and rang the door bell. A 25 year old woman opened the door. John thought that she must be Sara.</span></div></div>",

Jessica was still trying to come to terms with the situation. She was now going to enter in an unknown house. Her thoughts were interrupted by a voice, \"How was your day, honey?\" She looked up to see a woman approaching her. The woman came and kissed Jessica on the lips. She grabbed her hand to take her inside. All of that happened in an instance. Jessica didn't know what was happening until she was pushed by her now-wife asking, \"Are you alright, honey? You seem out of place.\" Jessica came out of her thoughts and responded, \"Yeah I'm good.\" Amanda told her to get washed and said she would arrange dinner for everyone. Jessica was rushing towards the bathroom but she heard a boy saying, \"Dad, your room is upstairs.\" Jessica didn't know how to repond to someone calling her dad so she hurried towards the room upstairs. She reached the bathroom where she saw her face in the mirror for the first time since the swap. She knew it was her face but without makeup and John's hairstyle and beard made her look different. She stared at her face for a long time before proceeding to wash it. She got out of her clothes and was shocked to find out that she now had hairy hands and legs. She looked at her breasts to see some hair sprout from them as well. She still had her lean body with perky breasts and flat stomach but she was now living as a janitor. After cleaning up she opened her now shared wardrobe but she knew that she cannot wear girly clothes anymore. She took out a white tee shirt and black shorts. After wearing them she realised that they were now resized to fit her new frame. While wearing shorts over her underwear, she heard Amanda calling her downstairs for dinner. She was still not used to being called 'honey'. After having some awkward conversations during dinner, she was ready to sleep now. As she was going to sleep, she saw Amanda coming in wearing a pink nightgown. She was somewhat worried as Amanda came and sat beside her. She was giving Jessica dirty looks. Jessica realised the situation and said, \"I'm so tired today as I had to work extra. I'm feeling sleepy. Goodnight.\" After that she pretended to sleep. She heard a slight moan coming from her bedside but she didn't react and kept her eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0John entered his new house and said thank you to Sara. Sara laughed, \"When did you start thanking me Jessica? Let it be. Get washed quickly. Wear your sexy clothes. We have to go to a party at 10.\" John instantly blurted, \"Party?\" Sara started laughing again, \"Did you forget about it? You are the one who always reminds me of them. You gave me this habit of going to parties regularly.\" John was stunned. He didn't know how to respond. Sara interrupted his thoughts. \"Come on, Jessica. Hurry up. Otherwise we'll be late.\" John said, \"No, I cannot come to the party today.\" 'Why though? You were so excited in the morning about this?\" John suddenly replied, \"I'm tired. I had a lot of work at the store today. You should go.\" Sara was surprised by the response of her supposed-friend. She said, \"I cannot believe you are saying this Jessica. Okay I really think you need rest. Okay I'll get ready and leave then. If you need something text me.\" Sara went to her room after the conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was relieved and saw that there was another room. Thinking that it might be Jessica's, he went to the room. He was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of her room. He then put his purse on the bed and went to the bathroom for pee. He untied his trousers and relaxed his member from panties. He then pulled his panties and trousers back up. He went towards the mirror to wash his face. He was surprised by the reflection in the mirror. His face void of his beard was fully made up. He also saw his long ginger hair closely. He had started to go bald during his teenage years so it was huge change for him. He didn't know if he should wash his face so he left it as it is and came back to his bedroom. He decided to get out of his work clothes. As soon as he removed his upper clothes, he was standing there in bra and panties. He then sat down on the bed to remove heels. Then he realised that his legs had no hair on them. He then looked at his hands. His muscular arms were nor hairless. He also didn't have any chest hair. He then removed his bra and went towards the wardrobe. He looked at all the variety of woman's clothes. This reminded him of his wife and kids. He was now worried for Jessica as well. He decided to text her after getting dressed. He started searching for some comfortable clothes but found out that all the clothes were quite girly. He reluctantly picked out a least girly looking white nightgown. He wore it as it fit him perfectly in all areas. He was now feeling hungry so he went ti the kitchen to find something to eat. He saw that there was nothing but some instant noodles. He quickly cooked them and started eating. He messaged Jessica, \"I am home. Everything went fine. How are you coping?\" After eating he went back to now his bedroom and tried to sleep. It took him alot of time to go back to sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It'll only take a few minutes\" Dylan said as the couple got back to their shared apartment.

Pretty cool, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura winced. Not only did the piece of paper look ancient, but it smelled that way too. \"Uh, sure... but what exactly is it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a spell,\" Dylan said with a wide grin. \"A spell to summon a demon!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on. Do you really believe that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welllllll... no, not really. But I thought this might be a fun thing to do today. Worst case scenario, I put this cool page in a frame on the wall. Best case scenario, the two of us become famous for making contact with another plain of existence. What do you say?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say you're crazy,\" Laura said, playfully nudging Dylan on the arm. \"But I love you anyway. Now what are we supposed to do, exactly?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan took Laura's hand in his. \"As far as I can tell?

WHAT'S HAPPENING!?\" She screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDidn't answer, simply because he didn't have time to. The swirling black smoke suddenly shot into his mouth and forced his head back as it disappeared inside. His cheeks were forced out and his body shook the whole time.

His face contorted into a wicked grin. \"Hey babe.\" He said, as Laura began backing up. \"There's always some curious little meatbag somewhere isn't there, willing to play around with powers they know nothing about.\" Dylan chuckled, as he held his hands up and clenched them a few times, before inspecting his body as though it was new to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dylan, what's wrong with you?\" Laura asked, her heart beating in her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not very bright are you, bitch?\" Dylan chuckled, or rather the demon now possessing his body did. \"Your little boyfriend ain't at home anymore, just me.\" He said, his eyes returning to their normal brown color as he continued grinning. \"But hey, at least his little spell worked, right?\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura gulped, looking first left and then right, before suddenly running for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan immediately lifted his left hand and made a sweeping motion, which sent Laura flying through the air and against another wall, landing on a small table and smashing it to pieces. \"No leaving just when we're having fun.\" The demon laughed again, as Laura laid there, wincing and whimpering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, just don't hurt me, and let Dylan go.\" Laura cried, holding her injured arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, maybe I will.\" The demon said, Dylan's eyes turning black again as he maintained his grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura just looked on in horror from her prostrate position on the floor.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

'If only I had just stopped him from reading that stupid spell' or something like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura jumped when she heard the demon perfectly replicate her voice with Dylan's mouth. The tears were now running down her face as she tried (and failed) to escape her invisible bondage. The demon-in-Dylan smiled evilly as he pressed his body against hers and ran his stolen hand up and down her side. He leaned close and whispered into her ear, \"Ya know what would be funny though? Well?! Do ya?!?!?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no\" Laura muttered, feeling the demon's saliva hit her neck and flinching. Her whole body was trembling with fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Imagine if a mother fuckin' wolf or something jumped out at a little helpless doe. But it turns out the sheep wasn't really helpless at all. It was just waiting to get the lion close enough to take a bite at it herself. And the lion wouldn't even know what hit it cuz this weak little sheep is the last thing it expected to be viscious.

Sweet and innocent and all that jazz. No one would ever suspect ya of doing anything wrong. You'd make a perfect wolf in sheep's clothing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's eyes went wide with terror. She tried to scream, but felt her mouth tighten shut as the demon clenched Dylan's hand closed. \"Why're ya complaining, bitch? I'm only giving you what you asked for. I'll let Dylan's body go, and I certainly won't hurt you. No, I actually think we'll make a lovely team\" The demon said, letting Laura fall as Dylan's body pressed her tightly against the wall himself. \"By the way, you can call me Azazel. And I can't wait for the fun we're gonna have together. Now open wide for your medicine\" he said as he released his grip.

Instead he raised his hand again... then made a sharp, downward motion, and Laura's black work trousers were forced all the way down to her ankles. A repetative motion with his other hand and Laura's knickers followed suit, revealing her pussy. \"Hmm, pretty.\" Azazel chuckled acerbically, before waving his hand again and Laura flew across the room, landing face down on the couch, with her ass in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura still found herself unable to scream, or even whimper as the demon inside her boyfriend had his way with her. Azazel unzipped Dylan's jeans and reached inside to pull out his hard cock. He couldn't help but mimic Laura's own voice again while inside her boyfriend. \"Oh Dylan, what a nice big dick you have, I want you to screw my pathetic brains out.\" The delicate, feminine tone left Dylan's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, with tears streaming down Laura's cheeks, she felt her boyfriend's cock being forcefully inserted into her asshole, and the demon began pounding her rectum. \"The back passage is always fun, so much tighter. I like things tight... including my meatbags.\" Azazel then said, as he sodomized the girl with her boyfriend's appendage. \"Problem is, I've yet to get inside a meatbag that has stamina worth mentioning.\" Azazel then mentioned, as he felt an orgasm building in Dylans body. His cock suddenly exploded and sent three or four ropes of hot white cum into Laura's ass. The demon enjoyed the sensation, but wasn't blown away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving essentially raped Laura, Azazel pulled Dylan's softening shaft out of her backside and stepped back, allowing Laura to regain control of her functions. She was distraught and violated, unable to run, and he knew this. \"Clean yourself up bitch, I don't want to be wearing a leaking meatbag.\" Azazel told Laura, throwing her a nearby box of tissues. Laura reluctantly did as she was told, wiping her ass clean, all the while crying and feeling lost. Through reddened eyes, she looked up at her possessed beau, just in time to see the swirl of black smoke emerge from his mouth as his head tipped back. Dylan's whole body shook violently for a moment until the demon had exited him, then Dylan slumped backwards, hitting the floor hard, with his spent cock still hanging out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving already accepted her fate, Laura just slumped to her knees and looked up as the mass of black smoke circled in the air a few times, before diving down straight towards her. Her mouth was forced open and Azazel rapidly disappeared inside. Laura's head jerked forward and her mouth snapped shut, then when her eyes opened... they were an inky black. Her tear drenched face contorted into a grin, and her body quickly shot upright. \"Cracking Laura's neck from side to side, Azazel held her slender hands up in front of him to inspect them. \"There, wasn't that fun? For me anyway.\" He chuckled in her voice. Giving his new perky B-cup breasts a squeeze, Azazel sized up his latest victim. \"Hopelessly average, but you'll do for now.\" He said, before reaching down and pulling up Laura's knickers and trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at Dylan's unconscious body on the floor, Azazel sneered from inside his girlfriend's body as he went through Laura's mind to plan his next move.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course, before any of that could start, something had to be done with Dylan, who was lying on the floor unconscious. The possessed young woman flicked her wrist, sending Dylan flying into an open walk-in closet, which then locked behind him. It would be a good few hours until he woke up, and then another while for him to get out, but for good measure, the demon also telepathically moved the remains of the table in front of the door. Maybe he'd return to have some fun with Dylan at some point, but for now he just had to be out of the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzazel hummed a tune as he stripped off Laura's clothing and hopped in the shower, cleaning up his new body thoroughly and making sure to feel himself all over in the process. \"Mmm, just like I thought. So sweet and unassuming. I can definitely see myself upgrading, but you'll do nicely for my purposes at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe possessed Laura then dried herself off and slipped on a pair of black leggings and a grey tank top. Not the meatbag's usual look, but Azazel thought the dark and tight clothing complimented her. Once the demon finished putting Laura's hair in its familiar ponytail, he folded up the summoning spell and tucked it into her bra. She ran a finger across it and smiled at the thought about how much fun would be had at the unsuspecting department store. Especially once some friends were brought into the picture. Grabbing Dylan's car keys and locking the apartment door, Azazel continued humming the tune in Laura's sweet tone, thinking the lyrics as Laura's body strutted confidently through the building. <i>It's the end of the world as we know it... and I feel fine.</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He gestured with Laura's right hand and the man's head suddenly shot forward and smashed into the steering wheel, breaking his nose and knocking him out. \"Nobody raises their voice to me, shitstain.\" Azazel sneered, before looking at the outer facade of Wilko and grinning. \"Time to get to work.\" He said, interlocking Laura's fingers and cracking her knuckles.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Archangel's came, Gabriel had never seen himself as a particularly good one. Until recently, he had always been a staunch pacifist who prefered to stay on more of less neutral terms with his fallen brother and demonic cousins as opposed to participating in the war against them. This wasn't so much out of a sense of familiar love (though Gabriel had always been more fond of Lucifer than others, even when the latter was still on good terms with the Heavenly court), but mostly because he just didn't see the point in fighting. Demons were hedonistic and cruel, but few of them were truly evil in a way that warranted their effective genocide. Since Gabriel was an angel who himself didn't mind the occasional walk on the wild side, he prefered to just live and let live. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, neutrality no longer seemed to be a viable option. The demons were getting roudier, disseminating more summoning spells for unsuspecting humans to find. Something wicked was in the works, and all hands were needed on deck, especially with Michael no longer available to lead the charge if another full-on war broke out. But since Gabriel was at least not as despised by demons as the rest of his family, it made him the perfect point-man for investigating what the demons were up to. Which is what brought him here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><i>Hello Dylan,</i></span> he said, causing the young man to jolt awake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I? Who are you?\" Dylan asked, scared. All he could tell was that it was dark and that he was surrounded by clothing. There was a flicker of light coming from the wall. He pressed himself against what he assumed was a door, but it didn't budge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><i>No use, kid. You're stuck in a closet with a heavy table blocking the door. Only something superhuman can get you out before the demon you summoned gets back here and decides if he wants you dead or just tortured.</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Demon? What're you talking about?\" Dylan asked, his memory of the last few hours foggy. He tried again to push against the closet door to no avail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><i>Remember the spell you were given that you thought was so cool? You used it to summon a demon named Azazel. As far as I can tell, he took the body of whoever you were with out for a spin. I need to figure out who that was and what's being planned now. Because Azazel isn't just any demon, he's one of the big three. If he's hanging around you meatballs, there's a reason and it's not good for your species. So... wanna be deputized?</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoever I was with... Laura?!?! But she wouldn't hurt a fly! And deputized... what the hell does that mean?\" Dylan tried one last time to open the door and then gave up, banging his head against it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><i>Well, I'm not sure if you can tell, but right now I'm just a voice inside your head. Angels aren't like demons. We can't just take over without permission. I need you to let me use your body to get to the bottom of all this. Once I'm inside, I'll be able to access the memories of what happened when Azazel was summoned. Then I'll go after him and make sure both you and your girlfriend never have to deal with any of this crap again. How's that sound?</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That sounds insane...</i> Dylan thought, but couldn't bear to be responsible for Laura hurting herself... or others. \"Okay, angel. Do what you need to do...\" Dylan closed his eyes as he felt a warmth growing inside his chest. A white light filled the room as blue sparks surrounded his body. When his eyes opened again. they were glowing bright blue. Gabriel placed Dylan's hand against the closet door and it immediately opened as the table fized itself in mid-air and floated back to where it belonged. Memories previously hidden flooded into Dylan's head as Gabriel saw what had happened... how Azazel had violated Laura with Dylan's body before possessing her himself and heading out, presumably to the department store where Laura worked, which Gabriel knew to be directly above a... well, very dangerous fault line. Gabriel prepared to get to work and looked himself over, noticing Dylan's pants were still down, cum hardened on his dick and thighs from when he had been made to sodomize his now-girlfriend. \"Okay, kid. I'll do what I need to do, but first we have to get you cleaned up\" he said as he turned and headed to the shower. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The voice happened to be Laura's best friend Rebekah, and she looked none too pleased. \"You have any idea how hard it's been for me to cover for you for this long? Natalie, Steven and Liz all asking where you were. I've been lying my ass off to protect you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzazel sized up the pretty blonde human in front of him, and smiled. \"Well, what are friends for, right?\" He replied calmly. \"If it makes you feel any better, me and Dylan had such a good time together.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you make out? I thought he wanted to show you something.\" Rebekah asked, her irritation changing to curious interest as she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzazel chuckled, folding his arms under his perky tits. \"Oh he did show me something. His cock, just before he rammed it up my arsehole. And ooh damn did it feel good.\" He winked, even though he had done the actual fucking himself, while possessing Dylan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but you've always hated the idea of anal.\" Rebekah muttered, grimacing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becky, luv, you won't have lived until you get your arse stretched out by a big cock.\" Azazel smirked, grabbing Rebekah by her shoulders and giving her a gentle shake. \"You should try it, trust me.\" He added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah's frown grew further when she noticed Laura's tight leggings and grey tank top. \"And why are you out of uniform? You know you'll get in trouble.\" She inquired, eliciting an uncaring shrug from who she still saw as her best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really care, I wear what I want.\" Azazel stated abruptly. <i>And I wear who I want.</i> He thought. \"Now run along before you start really getting on my tits.\" Azazel told Rebekah, slapping her ass as he forced her away. Rebekah's expression of befuddlement by this time was almost permanent. She had no idea why Laura was acting like she was, but she passed it off as just her being in a bad mood. \"Now, let's see exactly what this dump contains.\" Azazel looked around, Laura's eyes briefly turning an inky black again, before returning to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe set off walking the aisle of the store, and even the back storage areas.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Crouching just above it, Azazel placed his slender host's hand just above the crack, which immediately glowed brighter and began to spread on the floor, nearly doubling in size. \"Ow! The hell?!\" Azazel exclaimed, pulling the summoning sheet out from its home against Laura's breast. The paper, which had heated up to well over a comfortable temperature fell into the crack and immediately burst into flames. Azazel quickly jumped up and hovered Laura's body over the ground as the crack opened up, becoming a circular pit of green energy. Black, red, and white pillars of smoke flew around within the pit. The distant sound of swords clashing against each other was heard and looking far enough into the swirling energy revealed the distinct shape of a cage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><i>FREE ME, MY CHILD</i></span> a voice boomed, loud enough to shake the walls and cause Azazal to close his stolen eyes and move Laura's hands over her ears. When his vision came back, he was once again hovering over a tiny, glowing crack, with the summoning spell completely in-tact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, bloody hell\" Azazel said as Laura's black sneakers ightly touched down on the ground. \"I found the fucking cage\" Azazel said as he bent down to pick up the spell and fold it up again. Laura's eyes faded to inky black as the words of the spell glowed brightly. Soon, Azazel found himself psychically connected with an old friend. <i>Lilith, it's me. I found the cage. Track my essense to this store and find yourself a new meatbag here. You'll probably need one slightly more... mature than your usual preference.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe possessed Laura immediately heard the voice of a young girl respond in her head. <i>Well that's no fun... you know how much I hate grownups. I'll meet you there, but don't presume to tell me what to wear, Zazey</i> she said, using a nickname that Azazel absultely despised before closing the connection with a huff. Though one of the oldest demons, Lilith did tend to be a bit immature. Still, unlocking the cage would require the \"big three\" and maybe a few extra hands on top. Unfortunately, Crowley wasn't yet in this plain of existence and would have to be summoned. Luckily, there was no shortage of potential meatsuits walking around for the taking.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She hated stock inventory, and she constantly regretted having got a job at Wilko in the first place. It was no place for a teenager like herself, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lexi, just shut up and do the job. Complaining about it isn't going to help.\" Ruby responded with a sigh, as she pushed her dark red hair behind her left ear and continued writing on her sheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi scowled at Ruby. \"You shut up.\" She spat back. \"I'm wasted here, and so are you. We're teenagers for fuck sake. And we're stuck in a grotty storage room counting shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well, cry me a river.\" Ruby shrugged, not noticing the swirling white smoke pouring through a crack in the floor near a pillar. <i><span class=\"chotpink\">Oooh, a pretty one, don't mind if I do.</span></i> Lilith thought to herself, spying Ruby sat on the floor, her crosses legs encased in her black jeans. Lilith usually possessed blonde meatbags, but redheads could be fun too, she knew. Lilith acknowledged the presence of the black girl who was with the redhead, but she was a safe distance away and too busy whining to herself to probably notice what Lilith intended next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wasting time, Lilith moved her essence forward and passed up and over Ruby, before turning back in on her smoke form and forcing herself into the girl's mouth. Ruby's eyes and mouth glowed for a moment and her body shuddered, her fingers snapping the pencil she was holding. Then her head jerked forward, and when it rose again, Ruby's eyes rolled all the way into her head, becoming entirely white, as a grin appeared on her face. \"Oh yes, I like this one.\" Lilith said in her new voice, patting herself down and standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ruby's eyes returned to normal Lilith then scowled over to Lexi, who was still complaining. \"Hey motormouth, zip it!\" Lilith barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi just sat there, staring open mouthed at Ruby, who then smiled at her. \"Thank you.\" Lilith said, before walking past Lexi and out of the storage area.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Oh well, nothing I can do. I guess I'll see for myself soon enough\" Azazel said with a shrug as he looked down at the green glow emanating from the crack. He could feel the power radiating out from deep below, but his train of thought was interupted by a tight squeeze from behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ZAZEY!!!!!!\" Lilith exclaimed, practically jumping on Laura's back with Ruby's teenage body. \"I missed you so much! It's been centuries! What's new? How's existence treating you? Did you kill any humans lately?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzazel nearly fell down from the weight of Ruby's body jumping on her like a child. He had to use his telekenisis just to get the girl off of him. \"Speak of the devil...\" he muttered, brushing off his stolen body. \"Still as talkative as ever, aren't we 'Lil? At least you picked a practical body and not a pretty one...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know me. Full of youthful energy. And I'll have you know I specifically found one that's practical AND pretty.\" Lilith said, proudly putting her hands on her hips and striking a cute pose before using her own telekinetic powers to create an invisible swing set that she began to use. \"Hey, where's Crowley? Don't tell me you haven't summoned him yet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilith, it's been five bloody minutes since I contacted you! In what plain of existence would that have been enough time for a full summoning? I haven't even started thinking about a host for him yet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith frowned as she swung higher on her invisible toy. \"Well that's no fun. How are we supposed to free daddy without Crowley here? We'll need to get him here soon!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzazel sighed. \"Yes Lilith, I'm aware of that. We also need to make sure no one gets suspicious of what's going on down here. That means we'll need to bring in some lower demons to take over the management and maybe one or two of the folks next door. So, incase you haven't noticed, there's a lot to fucking do!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith stopped her swinging and kicked one of Ruby's feet against the wall, leaning back and getting some red hair out from in front of her eyes. \"Sorry, Zazey. The last time the three of us were together, we got half a town in the colonies burnt at the stake thanks to the witch hunts we lead them on. I can't wait to see what we cook up this time, especially when daddy joins us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzazel nodded. \"Well, at least with both of us here we can move twice as fast now. I'll go up to the store. Laura here has to show her face before she gets in too much trouble since we aren't running the place yet. I'll focus on getting Crowley here. You summon some minor demons and make sure they know the plan. You're strong enough get at least five or ten of them here without breaking a sweat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith sighed. \"Fiiiinnnneeeeee, but I get to have fun with Crowley first once he's here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzazel laughed. \"Lil, you and I both know that the only one who can tell Crowley who to have fun with first is Crowley. But if you do a good job down here MAYBE I'll tell him you asked. Unlike you, I have realistic expectations, so I exect the lowers to be in place by the time Crowley and I get back here.\" The possessed Laura gave the possessed Ruby a cute wink before turning around and walking up the stairs, returning to the surface, summoning spell in hand.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Yep, definitely a portal to Hell. And not just any part of Hell, but the very deepest circle, where Lucifer's cage was hidden. \"Don't worry, daddy, we'll see you soon\" she said as she stood up and cracked her back. \"Ugh, why do I have to be the one with the boring job? Zazey and Crowely had better appreciate this\" she said as she pulled a pen out of the breast pocket of Ruby's company polo and began drawing arcane symbols on some of the cardboard boxes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, that should be enough\" she said as she cracked the 19-year old's knuckles and closed her eyes in concentration. The boxes with the drawings on them began to shake as Ruby's eyes opened, now glowing white. Lilith began chanting words in an ancient language and the lights began flickering. After several moments, the lights came back on and Ruby's eyes returned to their natural color. Lilith snapped her stolen fingers as black smoke exited the writing-covered boxes, forming six pools of smoke. \"Yeah, this is plenty,\" Lilith said, admiring her summoning work. Minor demons were mostly-mindless grunts who would unquestioningly do anything a stronger demon like herself asked. They weren't much in terms of personality, but they knew how to take orders and stay out of the way of their superiors. \"You boys ready for some fun?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><i>Yessssssssss Mistressssssss Llliiillllliiitttthhhhh,</i></span> they said in unison, awaiting their orders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith giggled and clapped her hands. \"Excellent! That's what I wanted to hear! Azazel, Crowley, and myself will be hard at work here preparing to break Lord Lucifer out of his cage. We need to make sure nothing interupts us. Luckily, we can get most of management on our side very easily with your help.\" Lilith lifted Ruby's arm and pointed to the ceiling. \"A few floors up is an office with four people having lunch together. Two of them are part of the management team here and two of them run the beauty salon next door. Four of you will possess them on the spot. You two,\" she said, motioning to two of the black masses at random, \"will wait in the shadows. If you want, you can possess whoever you want, but keep a psychic chain open with the other four. If either the group here or at the salon need assistance, you'll be on call to drop whatever meatsuit you found and help them. All of you are to prioritize allowing the three of us to have unlimited access to this area and to whichever employees we need. If anyone begins to suspect, it is up to you to handle them. Am I understood?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n[c:lgrey}<i>Yessssssssss Mistressssssss Llliiillllliiitttthhhhh,</i></span> the roared, again in unison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then. Off you go! Have fun, boys!\" Lilith laughed happily as the six clouds of smoke flew up through the ceiling and towards their targets. She then stretched and found herself admiring Ruby's young and shapely form. \"Hmmm, it has been a while since I've worn someone so mature. Now that I've done my job, maybe I can afford a quick break to get to know myself a bit better or find a playmate\" she said, remembering that Lexi was still upstairs (probably complaining about) doing her job.<br>\r\n</div></div>",

She gestured in front of her and both the doors flew open without her touching them, startling Lexi who was still inside doing her stock inventory. \"I'm back!\" Lilith cooed in her host's cute voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To do what? Tell me to shut up again?\" Lexi spat as she scowled at Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't be silly. You're going to get between my legs and pleasure me.\" Lilith grinned cheekily, prompting both of Lexi's eyebrows to shoot upwards in surprise. Seeing Lexi was about to refuse outright at the very least, Lilith concentrated and stared into the black girl's eyes. \"You're going to eat out my pussy, and you're going to enjoy it.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi's face went emotionless and she just nodded. \"Yes mistress.\" Then as Lilith caused the doors to fly shut again behind her, Lexi dropped to her knees and unfastened her possessed co-worker's slacks. She pulled Ruby's trousers down, then her knickers, while inside Ruby Lilith kept smiling and looking down, putting her hands on her meatsuit's hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh, it's been a while since I've experienced anything like this.\" Lilith squealed in apparent 'girly' excitement as she watched Lexi bury her face in her crotch and start licking the folds of her stolen pussy. \"Don't forget to go deep.\" She told Lexi, and immediately Lexi's tongue extended out further and probed inside her co-worker's vagina, sending growing waves of pleasure through Lilith's host body. \"Pick up your pace girl.\" Lilith commanded, and Lexi obeyed, her tongue increasing it's pace of licking as she began teasing Ruby's clit. \"That's the spot, right there.\" She grinned. \"I bet this meatsuit is a squirter.\" She then chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, when Ruby's body climaxed, Lexi's face was covered in girl cum. Lilith felt the intense if brief rush of an orgasm wrack her stolen form, and she basked in it, before clicking her fingers and causing Lexi to stand up. \"Done with you now, you can get on with your menial labor.\" She giggled, as Lexi picked her pen and paper back up and went back to work without saying anything else. \"Oh and don't clean your face off, you want to show people what a slut you are.\" Lilith lastly said to Lexi, before sauntering out of the storage area.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course, Crowley was the bossiest of the higher demons, and tended to enjoy hosts who were in positions of power. Unfortunately, most of the supervisors were currently on their respective lunch breaks at the moment and Crowley was needed as soon as possible since he was the only one of the three higher demons who actually knew how to open the cage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the store, Azazel saw that there were two main possibilities. One of them was Natalie, the staff supervisor. She was probably the highest authority figure easily accessible at the moment. Azazel expected that Crowley would appreciate her good looks and ability to give orders to any employee she interacts with. The downsides are that she's still not at the top of the food chain and that it would be incredibly hard to get her somewhere private enough for a full summoning ritual while the other senior employees are out. Even if Azazel used his demonic abilities to persuade her, other employees would notice her absence if she left while the others were away. Then again, if Lilith did her job right, there would be some help arriving on that front pretty soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other top candidate was Rebekah, Laura's best friend. She wasn't exactly in a position of authority, but she was very attractive and it would be quite easy to get her in private. Besides, Azazel couldn't wait for an excuse to see more of her body after slapping that lovely ass earlier. At the very least, Crowley would appreciate her looks until he could easily transfer into someone with more power. And the two 'best friends' certainly would be able to find a way to pass time until the grunts got in position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, Azazel his stolen measure forward to... </span></div></div>",

As the customer went to grab what they had been looking for, Azazel wrapped Laura's arms around Rebekah's waste, and ran a hand down her side. \"Hey luv!\" he said with a grin as Rebekah jumped in surprise, quickly pushing who she thought was her friend away before they were seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the bloody hell as gotten into you, Laura? You're acting really strange today!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe possessed Laura giggled, stairing into Rebekah's eyes. \"Follow me, bitch!\" she said as the other girl's eyes glazed over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Rebekah said with a nod, emotionlessly following Azazel as he walked into into the employee ladies room and locked the door behind them. Rebekah shook her head as she snapped out of her trance. \"How'd we get back here?\" she asked in a slight daze as she headed for the door, only to find herself unable to walk forward due to what felt like an invisible grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the grip released her and Laura grabbed her shoulders with tears in her eyes. \"Becky, you need to help me! Please! I don't know who else to t-tell\" Laura said, hugging her friend tightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grip released Rebekah and she chalked it up to being in her head as she instinctively hugged her best friend back. \"Hey, what is it, luv? Does it have anything to do with how you were acting earlier?\" She asked, trying to calm Laura by gently running a hand up and down her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... it was Dylan. He b-brought me into the apartment to show me s-something. A-a-a-and he... oh lord, Becky... he cast a spell and was possessed!!!! H-h-h-h-h-e did such h-horrible things to me. And then he m-m-made me do h-h-h-horibble things too! I'm fighting him, b-but you need to send him away. I know this sounds crazy, but please, you have to help me before he takes over again!\" Laura took a folded piece of paper that must have been tucked into her bra and handed it to Rebekah. \"T-this is the s-s-summoning spell Dylan used. If s-someone else reads it, it'll send him away. I c-can't because he's still in me but if I hold your hand while you read it, it'll work! Please, Becky! You're my best friend and I need your help. I know it sounds crazy, but please trust me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah held Laura tighter. It did sound crazy, but she sounded so sincere. Rebekah had no idea what had really happened between her and Dylan, but she had a feeling it really traumatized Laura. She'd be sure to give him a piece of her mind later, but for now Rebekah knew she just had to calm down her friend, so if reading this stupid spell would do that then that was what she had to do. \"Don't worry, Laura... we'll get through this\" she said, taking her friend's hand in hers as she looked at the strange writing on the page. Despite it being in what was clearly a different language, she was able to pronounce the words easily. As she completed the incantation, the bathroom lights began flickering and it felt like the floor was shaking. Suddenly, Laura broke away from her grip and pushed her hand forward forcing Rebekah against the locked door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's eyes became replaced with Azazel's inky blackness as the tears disappeared. \"Thanks for being such a sport, Becky. I knew I could count on you\" the demon said with a grin as red smoke began to descend from the ceiling. \"Summoning spells are such a pain. A human that's possessed or entranced isn't able to read them. They have to be recited by someone doing it of their own free will. You're a smart kid, so I had to go for the emotional attachment. And boy oh boy, did it work like a charm. I mean, all I had to do was turn on the waterworks and you were like putty in my hands! Hell, you still are!\" Azazel motioned with Laura's hand, pulling Rebekah from the door into the middle of the bathroom and made a few manuevers with Laura's hand, forcing off her shirt. The possessed-Laura looked up at the red smoke that appeared to be watching the two girls. \"Come on, Crowley! I know you want her! Quit playing hard to get and join the fun!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now shirtless Rebekah followed her former friend's gaze, just on time to see the red smoke barelling towards her. As she opened her mouth to scream, the smoke easily forced it's way in, causing her neck to shoot upwards. Her body shook as the smoke made its way inside, with Azazel massaging Laura's cunt and moaning as she watched the shirtless Rebekah's breasts bouncing up and down as she lost control of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Rebekah's head dropped down limply and she stood up, feeling herself over before lifting her head and cracking her neck. Rebekah's eyes were now glowing bright red as an evil smile formed on her face, mirrored by the possessed Laura. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was her pathetic boyfriend who summoned me to earth, I possessed him first. Then I fucked this little meatsuit and tried her on instead. And I like how she fits, nice and tight.\" Azazel replied in length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrowley just remained silent for a moment, then cracked Rebekah's neck again. \"I would ask why you picked out a host body for me that wields absolutely no authority in this dump. And WHERE are our minions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, Lilith is sorting out assuming control of this place, and as for the body, consider it a temporary layover.\" Azazel said, turning around to look his fellow demon in his pretty new features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough! But don't put too much faith in Lilith.\" Crowley warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll get the job done.\" Azazel stated, as he let Laura's eyes finally revert back to their normal color. He then moved forward a planted a kiss on Rebekah's lips, causing Crowly to arch his host's eyebrows and lick his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see.\" Crowley then said, before moving in to properly start kissing Laura's possessed body. \"In the meantime, let's make these two 'besties' get even more intimate with each other, whad'ya say?\" He grinned, in between kisses.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wilko Assistant Manager Liz, Assistant Supervisor Steven, Beautylicious owner Carly, and senior employee Zoe were in the midst of their bi-weekly lunch date. The four were quite close with each other and had been for several years, sharing many wild and unbelievable adventures in that time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious, it would be a great idea!\" Steven said, again trying to sell the group on his latest plan to boost employee satisfaction. \"Imagine how much more fun everyone would have?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but good look convincing Nat of that. I certainly won't suggest it for you. I want to actually keep my position!\" Liz said, playfully nudging Steven as the two salon-workers giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys have the craziest ideas\" Carly said before taking a sip of her coffee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and I thought dealing with our customers was annoying. Imagine all this drama too\" Zoe said as she had a bite of her salad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the group continued talking and joking, one of the lights started flickering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oy, I thought we were supposed to get these bad fuses fixed weeks ago\" Steven muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look at me, Emma's the one who handles stuff like that. But she's always so busy in her office. Id be shocked if she knows about anything that goes on anywhere else\" Liz said with a frown as three more lights began flickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four were so busy focusing on the lights, that none of them saw the four swirls of black smoke rising from the floor until they sped up and headed straight into their mouths. Steven, Liz, Carly, and Zoe all fell to the floor gagging as their bodies shook uncontrollably. The table, containing all their food, had fallen with them, creating a mess of spilled food and broken glass on the floor. Within a few moments, the lights were back to normal and the four friends sat motionless on the ground. One at a time, they rose and opened their eyes, revealing inky blackness only slightly less slick than Azazel's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, look at these! This one's nice\" 'Zoe' said, giving her large breasts a squeeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, mine's not bad either\" said 'Carly,' who was now admiring her reflection in a mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies, you're all lovely, but this cock isn't going to suck itself\" said 'Steven,' who already had his pants down with 'Liz' caressing him. \"Shall we have some fun in honor of new management?\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The demon inside him peered down at 'Liz' as she greedily took the full length of his shaft into her mouth while simultaneously rubbing her vagina through her trousers. The once professional assistant manager had been turned into a cock-sucking whore by the male demon inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shame these meatbags only have one dick between them.\" 'Zoe' said, breaking off from snogging 'Carly'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven's eyes finally returned to their normal colour as the demon looked at Zoe's possessed body. \"With my stamina, there's enough of this dick to go around.\" He chuckled, as Liz's head continued to move back and forth vigorously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time 'Carly' spun around on her stiletto heels. \"There will be if this dipshit stops hogging it.\" She said, swiftly kicking Liz's backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz's body just gave 'Carly' the middle finger as it continued blowing Steven's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can have fun with these meatsuits without a dick.\" 'Zoe' chuckled as she sashayed over to her 'best friend' and 'co-worker', approaching behind her and slipping her manicured hands down Carly's skirt and into her knickers. The demon wearing Zoe had to bent over significantly to do this act, as he was much taller than his fellow demon inside Carly's petite form. He began using Zoe's exquisitly manicured fingers to probe Carly's pussy, making the demon in her moan in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, the pleasures of the flesh.\" 'Carly' groaned, her eyes remaining 'blacked out' as her face contorted into a wicked grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only thing these creatures are good for.\" 'Steven' nodded, grunting slightly as he ejaculated, blasting his hot cum into Liz's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing Liz's body swallowing the deposit of semen, 'Carly' broke free from 'Zoe's' grip and lunged forward, pushing the possessed Wilko boss out of the way and eagerly wrapping her own painted lips around Steven's cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'm last in line.\" 'Zoe' feigned annoyance, her eyes eventually returning to their normal colour as she kept smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat me out bitch.\" 'Liz' suddenly exclaimed, unfastening her trousers and pushing them down, along with her knickers.

These demons also did not have the same telekinetic abilities as their masters and mistress. Of course, staying in the shadows wasn't the most fun in the world, but orders were orders...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they watched the show, however, they heard noise from a few rooms over, which they curiously followed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allie, our bosses are all like three doors down, if we get caught...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Nat, we'll be fine.

Nat's eyes immediately turned black and a wicked smirk appeared on her face as her head tipped forward again. She reached up and grabbed her breasts, squeezing them and inspecting her body. \"Hmm, certainly could be worse.\" Nat chuckled, her eyes returning to normal almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What could be worse?

And then she stepped back as the last demon descended rapidly and forced himself down Allie's throat and into her body. Allie's head snapped forward once he was inside and her eyes also turned an inky black. \"How's she feel?\" 'Nat' asked, giving Allie's tits a squeeze through her Wilko top. \"Not bad from this angle.\" She chuckled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She feels... warm.\" The demon inside Allie responded, cracking her neck before resuming her oral onslaught on Nat's mouth.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the demons were settling into their positions, Gabriel parked Dylan's car in the lot and sighed. As soon as he had finished cleaning off his current host, he received communication from Raphael, another angel, who had been attempting to monitor the situation. It seemed that there was some sort of interference preventing the heavenly forces from being able to see what was going on inside of this area, though powerful demonic energy was definitely radiating from the area. While more powerful demons like Azazel would be able to hide their power from being sensed, weaker demons had a harder time doing that, which meant that if enough of them were congregated, Gabriel would still be able to find them once he got close enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Gabriel was here, though, he began to suspect he was outnumbered. The strongest sense he was getting came from the salon, Beautylicious. There were at least three weaker demons there. He could feel some power from the larger department store, but there were either less demons there or they were more spread out. It made sense to Gabriel that there would probably be more demons around their main target, so Beautylicious was where he turned his attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, there were a few differences between angels and demons that put Gabriel at a disadvantage unless he planned carefully. First, demons didn't need to ask permission to possess someone, which meant they could jump out of their current bodies whenever they wanted. Demons also did not have any rules about how many could be in an area at once. As long as someone is able to summon them, more can come at any moment. Angels didn't work that way. More than two in any given area would cause one to get sent away due to the metaphysical interference. Of course, angels were typically better trained than demons. Angels also had an advantage in that they demons couldn't usually sense them. With that in mind, Gabriel decided he could take the risk and headed out of his car and to the salon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he opened the door, he heard a bell, before being greeted. \"Welcome to Beautyliscious, what can I do for you!\" said a young woman who walked out from a back room. Her nametag read 'Nat.' Two other women, with nametags reading \"Zoe\" and \"Carly\" were also in the salon. The former was currently doing her nails while the latter was reading a magazine. There was a banging coming from the back, but it sounded like it could be pipes or something. The demonic power in the room was overwhelming, which meant that Gabriel didn't have to take any guesses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hoping one of you ladies could help me get some information\" Gabriel said, forming a sword of white energy in his hand. A weaker demon would only have to touch it to be sent back from whence they came. A stronger demon, though, would need a direct hit in their heart. The sword wouldn't hurt a human, just leave them unconscious. Suddenly all of their eyes became jet black. 'Nat' jumped towards Gabriel but was quickly slashed with the sword, falling to the ground unconscious as the demon-smoke left her body and evaporated. \"Well, that one clearly wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed. How about you two? Are we doing this the easy way, or the hard way?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you, Angel. I'm not telling you anything about our mistress' plans\" 'Carly' said, prompting Gabriel to raise an eyebrow before quickly lunging at her and stabbing her with the sword, once again causing the smoke to evaporate around her and Carly to fall to the ground fast asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress? That would imply that there's more than just Azazel involved here. And a female... Lilith? What's she up to. Do you want to talk or join your friend?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Zoe' just hissed and tried to run towards the back room. Gabriel simply threw his sword at her, striking her through the back. As Zoe fell to the ground, the sword disapeared as quickly as it came into being. The banging from the back room only got louder. Gabriel cautiously walked towards it and thought to himself, <i><span class=\"cblue\">If Lilith is involved, that means trouble. I expected to go after Azazel, but this is clearly bigger than just him. If he sees me in this vessel now, it'll be a dead giveaway. I can't risk that. I may have to retreat and come back in a new disguise...</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Gabriel finished thinking, he pulled open the back door, only to find a woman tied up and terrified. Her attempts to free herself from her restraints must have been the cause of all the banging. Her own nametag read 'Hannah.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this place was clearly a decoy. Those demons must have wanted to take turns having their fun with you. I'm so sorry\" he said, removing the tape from her mouth and placing a hand on the ropes, causing them to fall away loosely. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He's dating a young woman who works at Wilko's. Though right now, I'm afraid their bodies are anything but lovers\" he said, noting Hannah's look of confusion. \"In short - the three in there were possessed by demons.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that would explain what happened\" Hannah said, frowning. \"They had all been out for lunch and I was stuck watching the salon.

The three of them together implied something big was happening. Something that Gabriel's gut told him he was unprepared to deal with himself. Especially if they now knew he was coming. He needed a way to get back the element of surprise... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there any way I can help?\" Hannah asked, not completely understanding what was going on, but sensing that it was incredibly important. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Gabriel had an idea. \"Yes.

'Allie' had gone back to work while 'Steven' and 'Liz' excused themselves to have some more fun before returning to their own posts, leaving the three demons in the office to speak among themselves. \"You're sure you sense an angel?\" Lilith asked, raising an eyebrow. She never expected much from the folks up above. How they ever caught higher demons like them was a mystery to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm positive. As soon as he got within a few miles, I sensed him. I already told the grunts across the way to congregate themselves and keep him busy, but it won't buy us much time. They aren't exactly known for being strong. By the way... he smells like you, Azazel\" the possessed Rebekah said with a glare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit,\" Azazel muttered. \"I knew I should have properly disposed of that other meatbag. Before I knew what I'd find here, I expected to get back to him and have some more fun. The angels must have heard his distress and realized I was around\" he said, kicking the wall with Laura's sneaker. I'll go take care of him. I've killed angels before and I'll do it again if I really need to. Whichever angel it is, they're my mess to clean up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrowley pulled the possessed Laura into a deep kiss, making sure to grab her ass in the process. \"Just don't fuck this up. I wanna celebrate with you once we free the big man\" the possessed Rebekah said, eyes glowing red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of don't worry. I'll be back in no time\" Azazel said with a wink as Laura's eyes became replaced with his inky black and he strutted out of the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrowley let out of a sigh of relief. Azazel was no pushover and would certainly be able to handle this interloper. \"I think we can relax for a bit, now. I trust Azazel to clean up his mess, but I doubt it'll be particularly easy. It's been centuries since the last time he's killed or even fought an angel.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what do we do while we wait? Don't all three of us need to contribute to breaking the seal together?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrowley shook his head. \"No, technically it just has to be me and you since we're the first born. Azazel is powerful and deserves his place at our side, but he started out no better than other lower demons. We're the two who open the gate, but I really wish I had more power first. It's painfull being stuck in a meatbag this... average.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the two demons heard a scream coming from down the hallway. \"Steven! Liz! What the hell are you two doing?!?!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrowley and Lilith left the office to find a nude 'Steven' and 'Liz' in the middle of quite a bit of fun with a simultaneously shocked and fuming Natalie watching them in shock.

Seconds later a dark red swirl of smoke violently exited Rebekah's mouth as her head tipped back, and as her body slumped to the ground unconscious, Crowley flew directly towards the shocked supervisor surveying 'Liz' and 'Steven' in their twisted embrace. Natalie's head was forced back as Crowley shot directly into her mouth and down her throat... into the inner depths of her body. A second later Natalie's eyes turned a dark red and a sneer appeared on her face as her hands began feeling up her breasts. \"A definite upgrade, I like this one.\" Crowley chuckled in his new voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the sneer disappeared as Crowley looked at the two lower demons before him. As Natalie's eyes returned to their normal color, Crowley clicked his manicured fingers and 'Steven' and 'Liz' were hurled across the room in opposite directions, slamming against walls and falling down in heaps. \"You 'lads', by all means have your fun, but you do NOT the plan at risk again, am I clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood sir.\" Liz's body nodded, it's large breasts swaying on it's chest as the demon stood up. Liz's eyes remained an inky black, as did Steven's as his body also got to it's feet. \"Carry on.\" Crowley then smirked, gesturing for the two to get back together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe possessed assistant manager and assistant supervisor immediately approached each other again anbd began kissing, with Liz's hand wrapping around Steven's erect cock once more. Meanwhile, Crowley walked back over to 'Laura', who was staring down in amusement at Rebekah's unconscious form on the floor. \"Maybe I'll get the respect I deserve in this meatbag.\" He commented, feeling up Natalie's body again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks good on you.\" Azazel responded with a nod of approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now let's get this party started.\" Crowley mumbled, before walking off, with Azazel following him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Emma sighed to herself as she opened the safe in her office and removed the medallion of Zulo. Ever since she came across the medallion, her life had changed for the better. It allowed the user to shapeshift into another person, just by wearing the medallion and touching an item of clothing worn by another person, to take on their form. The medallion could also cause two people to morph into each other if they touched it at the same time. Emma also found out that if you concentrate hard enough you can morph individual body parts. Emma was very careful and kept the medallion in a safe in her office, she'd heard rumours that the medallion had a tendancy to dissappear. She often wondered how many people the medallion had left permanently morphed in its wake. Through experimentation, Emma also discovered that you had to wait at least twelve hour between morphs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma's popularity certainly increased when she told her staff about the medallion and allowed them to use it whenever they wanted to, but strictly under her supervision. She would not let the medallion out of her sight, it didn't even leave her office. Once a morph had been made, Emma immediately locked the medallion away in her safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma sighed once more, she was currently wearing the form of one of her previous employees, Natasha. Natasha left Wilko a few years back, but luckily for Emma, Natasha had left her old work polo shirts behind. Natasha was fairly attractive, 5'8\", 21 years old and had C-cup breasts. What Emma really loved about Natasha was her Athletic body. Natasha wasn't the only form that Emma would take on, but in recent weeks it was one of her favourites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma reluctantly placed the medallion around her neck, and held an old t-shirt of her own and morphed back into her own form. Emma was disappointed to be in her old body, but at least it was only 42 years old now instead of 47 years old. The t-shirt that Emma had used to morph back into herself was last worn when she was on holiday five years ago. If she knew that she was going to come across the medallion of Zulo, she never would have given her old clothes to charity six months ago. What she would give to be able to morph into her own body, but when it was only 21 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma spent a few minutes getting changed. She had to change her suit as the one she wore in Natasha's 5'8\" body no longer fit her 5'4\" frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Emma finished getting changed, there was a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\" Emma said as she sat behind her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of her supervisors, Steven, walked in, his high heels clicking on the floor as he entered. Steven, a 41 year old man was now one of the prettiest people in the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted to see me?\" Steven said with his feminine voice. Steven looked a little confused to see Emma in her own body... looking a little younger than it used to if he remembered correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright love?\" Steven asked. It had been months since he saw Emma wearing her own body, and knew she only did it reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma sighed \"Gemma's coming in for a visit today... for some bullshit HR thing. I don't want her finding out about the medallion, so you'd better morph back into yourself pronto. Gemma would be pissed if she found out that we had a magic shape-shifting medallion. She'd be even more pissed if she found out that you were using it to turn into an exact replica of her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven huffed and stamped his foot on the floor \"You know how much I hate being a man. Especially wearing my own body! Besides it was your idea for me to be a woman permanently, to keep with the female supervisor tradition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma rolled her eyes \"Don't you get sassy with me you stroppy cow! I'm the one who made you supervisor and I can also unmake you! If you don't want to be yourself, then you'd better morph into someone who isn't Gemma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven pouted, he loved Gemma's body, but knew he'd have to choose another... at least for today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine... I'll wear another form!\" Steven whined like a spoiled little girl as he punched the code into the safe and removed the medallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven placed the medallion around his neck and looked towards Emma \"You got anything new to wear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma smiled \"You know what I have! I snuck by Carly's salon earlier and took her scarf from the coat rack when she wasn't looking. Also I emptied Elizabeth's old locker yesterday and found she left an old bracelet in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the floor, below the safe was a box of clothing, Steven pondered to himself, should he morph into Carly? Elizabeth? Or pick something from the box he was more familiar with? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Immediately he felt a tingling sensation overwhelm his sexy body, and he first began to shrink in height. His long blonde hair retreated into his head until he sported a familiar bobbed hairstyle, his tits - while staying a C-cup - sagged a little more but his ass and hips expanded against he fabric of his skirt. In no time at all, Steven had morphed into a copy of his friend Carly, from Beautylicious. He stepped out of the black patent high heels he had been wearing with ease, since his new feet were slightly smaller than Gemma's. And his skirt suit also seemed a tad too big for him, but not much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's always a rush seeing someone transform like that.\" Emma shook her head, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it.\" Steven grinned, speaking in Carly's sexy voice as he walked around to where the box of clothes was on the floor. Next to the box was a large carrier bag, which contained some of Carly's older clothes and shoes that he had been tasked with taking to a charity shop. Of course he didn't, and he'd kept them himself. He took the medallion off first and tossed it to Emma, who kept it in her hand for now. Then Steven pulled a red tank top and a short white skirt from the bag, quickly getting changed into them and tossing his navy skirt suit in the box. He did however keep wearing the knickers and bra he'd worn while being Gemma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you think Carly would be pissed if she found out you were turning into a copy of her? Emma smirked, as she watched Steven slip his feet into a pair of Carly's well-worn, black leather pumps with a 3-inch heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, yeah, probably. Though not as pissed as Gemma would be to see me in her form.\" Steven giggled, running his fingers through his new hairstyle as he strutted around the room in Carly's pumps. He slapped his manicured hands on his shapely ass and then flashed a grin at his manager, who was a couple of inches taller than him while wearing her T-bar heels. \"But she won't know, will she?\" He said to her in a giddy tone. \"God, her body feels so fucking nice. But it needs a good fucking.\" He lamented. \"She's single again and therefore... she's not getting laid. And even though this is only a copy of her body, it's a god damn accurate one.\" Steven explained, rubbing his pussy through his skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that, Steven, I know how the whole thing works.\" Emma chuckled, as she inspected herself in her compact mirror. She could tell that she was a few years younger than she was usually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, when's the bitch arriving?\" Steven chirped in his new voice, as he squeezed his breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a couple of hours. I've still got to let Liz know, and Natalie.\" Emma answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking great.\" Steven mumbled, shaking his pretty head.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was still 100% straight and had his usual taste in women, including an attraction to his new body. But his new female hornones also meant that he also had a thing for men, especially in Carly's horny little body. Steven couldn't deny it, his new body needed cock and it needed it now. He had no idea how Carly could control her lust for the opposite sex, but that wasn't his problem. Steven was planning on being much more of a slut that Carly ever was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, you're right Emma. I'd better take care of my new... urges!\" Steven said sheepishly as he made his way to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma smirked wickedly \"Well there's one thing you have to do first. I want you to give this morning's briefing to the team before they start work... and before you get yourself a good fucking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven groaned, he didn't know if his new body could last that long without him wanting to jump on one of the hot young studs on the shop floor. Steven muttered incoherently to himself as he walked out of the office, closing the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly moments after a horny Steven had left the office, 25 year old Rebekah, possibly the prettiest member of the Wilko team, came barging into Emma's office without knocking, a furious expression etched onto her pretty face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\" Emma asked innocently, pretending not to know what was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you can help me! Last night my spare polo shirt went missing from my locker, then when I came to work this morning I find that gross little perv Liam was an exact duplicate of me. He must have stolen my shirt and used your medallion to turn into me. I can't believe that dirty little...\" Rebekah said, red in the face and practically foaming at the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma cut Rebekah off before she could finish \"Sorry Rebekah, but this was my doing, not Liam's. I thought I'd give him a little incentive to work harder. You know how much of a slacker he his. I turned him into a copy of you, if he works hard enough, I promised to let him stay as a copy of you for as long as he likes. You should be flattered!\" Emma chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what! This was your idea! I demand you change him back right now! There can't be two of me!\" Rebekah sputtered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma's face changed to a sterner form \"I'm the boss. You don't make demands from me. Liam's keeping your form and that's final... so long as he keeps up the good work. As for you, if you feel that there are too many Rebekahs, you can always change into somebody else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah stood her ground... a decision she was about to regret. \"No Emma, it's my body and I don't want Liam wearing it, even if he is a copy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedallion still in hand, a furious Emma picked up a random item of clothing from the basket and made a beeline for Rebekah, she was about to change her without permission. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

NOW!\" Emma glared at Rebekah, intimidating her greatly as the younger woman backed herself into a corner of the office. The medallion was swinging in her face and she knew that if she touched it at the same time as Emma, they would turn into each other. Of course Rebekah hadn't noticed that Emma was several years younger already, and them morphing into each other wasn't Emma's intent anyway. \"I said take it Becky.\" Emma repeated, arching an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah shook her head meekly, then ducked under Emma and bolted for the door. She opened it... only to see Carly's grinning form standing there blocking the route with her petite body. \"Nah ah, no running.\" Steven said in the beautician's sexy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah turned back to Emma, who was once again holding the medallion out to Rebekah. \"Accept your punishment and this will go a whole lot easier. You see this is all about discipline, Becky. If I can get Liam to actually start doing some work by letting him wear your body, then so be it. And when somebody makes unnaceptable demands of me in my own office, I have to punish them. That includes you.\" Emma explained, sounding quite cold as Rebekah reluctantly held out her hand, allowing the medallion to be dropped into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rebekah placed the medallion around her neck, she couldn't help but wonder who Emma planned on turning her into. It was bad enough seeing Liam strutting around in her sexy body feeling himself up, but to be turned into someone else herself was rubbing salt in the wound. She caught an old Wilko polo shirt that Emma tossed in her direction, and the tingling instantly began. Rebekah's body started expanding all over as weight piled onto it, not an obscene amount of fat, but considerably more than she was used to. Her long blonde hair retreated up into her head, becoming a short blonde style... her perky breasts began inflating and sagging, stretching her bra until the strap snapped under her increasingly taut polo shirt. \"Ooh... no.\" Rebekah moaned as the changes overtook her. Her ass and hips expanded against the fabric of her once snug slacks, making them too tight, her pussy rapidly progressed in age, shooting into menopause, wrinkles began appearing on her hands, arms and elsewhere and she felt her face shifting into a new configuration. Even her ballet flats became too tight as her feet grew chubbier inside them, Emma and Steven stood there smirking as Rebekah finished her transformation in Andrea, a former Wilko employee who also happened to be Carly's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi mum.\" Steven quipped in his current female voice, giggling as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah sighed as she looked down at her stretched out clothing, from Steven's teasing she had already worked out she had been morphed into Andrea. But she was a copy of Andrea back when she was 53 years old, instead of her current age of 59. \"I'm an old woman!\" She whined, looking up at Emma directly as she placed the medallion back on her manager's desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're middle-aged, not old. And consider this a lesson Becky. There should be some spare clothing in the Training Room cupboards that should fit you better, unless you want to keep those clothes on and hope your trousers don't split completely.\" Emma chuckled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, 'mum', some guys like older women with a full figure.\" Steven whispered into Rebekah's ear, as he walked up behind her in his heels and grabbed her flabby ass cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now get back to work Becky, and if you can get through the rest of the day without annoying me further, I'll see about changing you back into yourself tomorrow.\" Emma said, as a defeated Rebekah trudged out of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven looked at Emma and smiled. \"You enjoyed that.\" He said, winking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma grinned back. \"Not as much as Liam is enjoying playing with her sexy little body. He really is a gross pervert you know, Becky was right. But his work rate has already improved.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're all pervs in a way Emma, even you.\" Steven reminded her. \"Which reminds me, I need this pussy pounding.\" He added, rubbing his snatch through his skirt and knickers before scurrying off out the door, his stiletto heels clicking on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma smirked and shook her head, before grabbing the medallion and sitting down behind her desk.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Liz had been much happier ever since she used the medallion to transform into a copy of the previous assistant manager Elizabeth, who had since left. She was now a little younger, but what she loved the most was that she now sported a pair of modest B-cups instead of her usual H-cup breasts. They were such a hindrance, not to mention the back pain that came along with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted to see me?\" Liz said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry luv, but you're going to have to transform back into yourself.

They're all the same!\" Liz snarled angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry luv, but there's nothing I can do about it!\" Emma said defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you look a little younger?\" Liz said as she eyed up Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I managed to find an old t-shirt from five years ago. If I have to transform back into myself, then at least I can be a little younger. But even though my body is only 42 years old now, I still feel so old. I've gotten so used to wearing Natasha's 21 year old body. God I can't wait to change back into her again!\" Emma said sighing in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a wicked grin spread across Liz's borrowed face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you scheming?\" Emma asked curiously as she noticed Liz's expression change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not like we're going to learn anything today. I mean one health and safety course is the same as the last. Why don't we find a couple of substitutes to sit in for us!\" Liz cackled wickedly as she gestured towards the medallion in Emma's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wicked smile now spread across Emma's slightly younger face \"Oh my god, that's a brilliant idea. But who are we going to find to volunteer to become us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz pondered for a second before responding \"I'm sure a couple of the horny young guys downstairs would jump at the chance to wear our bodies, I mean you're a MILF and what guy wouldn't want to play with my big tits! And if no-one volunteers, well we won't give them a choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile on her face Emma replied \"Quick, let's go downstairs, Steven's about to give the briefing, we can find our volunteers down there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Emma and Liz giggled like a pair of naughty school girls as they made their way out of the office.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Emma had given Steven instructions to brief the team members on Gemma's upcoming arrival. But she should have known better, considering he was currently wearing Carly's hot little body. \"Wait... you hear that?\" Liz asked in Elizabeth's voice, as she stopped outside the gents toilets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do now.\" Emma nodded, brushing her hair behind her ears. They could hear deep grunting and feminine moans coming from the men's toilets, which were an indication as to what was going on in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds like there's a girl in there with one of the guys and they're fucking.\" Liz said, putting her ear to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma sighed, folding her arms under her boobs. \"Yeah well, I didn't tell you, Steven is currently wearing Carly's form, and apparently your little beautician friend hasn't gotten laid lately.\" She explained to Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, that explains it.\" Liz shook her head, before slowly opening the door to the men's toilets. She and Emma stepped slowly inside and the moaning got louder, they could recognize Carly's voice... or rather Steven's. And when they opened the second door and peered towards the single stall in the gents, they saw a familiar pair of legs ending in some cute high heels wrapped around Luke... who was pounding his cock into Steven's pussy. \"Holy shit, you think Luke knows?\" Liz whispered to Emma, who just smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably, yeah. I think his girlfriend has been giving him the cold shoulder lately.\" Emma said back, as Steven screamed out in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we stop this?\" Liz whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma shook her head. \"No, let the little slut have his fun. We can give the briefing to the others instead.\" Emma replied. \"And I'm sure Steven will let Luke know about Gemma coming once he's finished getting his hole fucked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough.\" Liz shrugged, before the two managers retreated out of the gents toilets. They then continued on their way downstairs to the shop floor, where Natalie was supervising the other staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Natalie saw Emma and 'Elizabeth' enter the shop floor, she walked over to them. \"Looking good Liz.\" She complimented the latter with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, thanks luv. Definitely feel better, much lighter.\" Liz smirked, cupping her smaller but perkier tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gather the staff please Natalie, we've got something to tell them.\" Emma told the staff supervisor, who instantly put an announcement out on the tannoy system. And slowly, the store staff gathered at the front of the shop at the help desk. Among them were Liam, who simply couldn't stop feeling himself up now that he had Rebekah's body, and a more solemn looking Rebekah, currently stuck in Andrea's middle-aged form.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His new body quivered, his cute little toes clenched in his even cuter high heels as Luke expertly pounded his eager snatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of fuuuuck!\" Steven screamed just as the tannoy went off announcing the briefing downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Steven came down from his orgasmic high, he put his feet in the ground and pulled his dripping snatch off of Luke's impressive cock with a wet pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the fuck do you think you're going? I haven't got mine yet!\" Luke snarled in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emma and Liz have just called a briefing... the briefing I was supposed to give! We'd better go before we get into trouble!\" Steven panicked as he desperately pulled up his skirt in haste, his wet snatch soaking his knickers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going anywhere slut!\" Luke sneered as he grabbed Steven by his delicate wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven was a full foot shorter than Luke now and was effectively helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let go of me. I'm your supervisor, you have to do as I tell you!\" Steven said, trying to sound authoritative, but failing miserably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke grabbed the back of Steven's head and forced the diminutive supervisor to his feminine knees. Luke then forced the full length of his impressive member balls deep into Steven's cute little skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven choked as he felt Luke's \"head\" force it's way past his tonsils, as Luke then began to pump away, skull fucking his sex changed supervisor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Steven, I'm close, we won't be too late to the briefing!\" Luke grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke noticed Steven playing with borrowed breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, you love this don't you, you dirty little slut! I much prefer you as a woman. I'm kind of curious to know how it would feel to fuck you while you were wearing Gemma's body!\" Luke taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven loved being a woman, he was effectively bi-sexual now. He was definitely going to use the medallion to try on some other bodies, but there was no way in hell he was ever going to turn back into a man ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven couldn't believe how good it felt to have a cock in his mouth, maybe some of the other guys would let him give them head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Steven was lost in bliss, Luke began to groan, before unleashing his load deep into Steven's pretty mouth. Spurt after spurt filled Steven's mouth, he had to swallow quickly before it spilled out of his mouth and stained his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's right, swallow it up you dirty bitch!\" Luke teased before pulling his dick out of Steven's mouth, then tucking it safely back into his trousers and doing up the zipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven wiped his mouth, a little sperm was dribbling down his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Steven! We're going to be late!\" Luke taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sexy grin spread across Steven's satisfied face, before the pair left the men's room and made their way to the briefing. Steven was still weak at the knees and was walking like he'd had a good fucking. He was sure to be extra careful as he made his way down the stairs in his high heels. He also wondered what it might be like to wear Zoe's body, Carly's best friend.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even in his heels, he was only the same height of Natalie was without heels. He glanced at her and smiled nervously, to which she just shook her head disapprovingly. \"Don't judge me, however silently. This body is so horny.\" He whispered to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you could have done worse than Luke.\" Natalie responded. \"How was he?\" She smirked, speaking in a hushed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unbelievable, he's a good fuck.\" Steven told Natalie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, might have to try him out myself next time I try on someone else's body.\" Natalie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Luke had taken up position amongst the other rank and file members, and he received a hypocritical stare from Liam of all people. \"You actually fucked Steven?\" Liam mumbled in Rebekah's cute voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not about to take lessons in ettiquette from someone currently wearing a body I used to have a serious crush on.\" Luke grumbled back, growning as he looked down at Liam in his current body. \"And someone who can't stop feeling himself up.\" He added. \"You're just jealous because I didn't fuck you, admit it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam was about to say something when Liz stepped forward in her black patent pumps, which made her new legs look amazing. \"Zip it boys!\" She said, talking directly to Liam and Luke. \"We've got an announcement to make.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma immediately took over, and none of the other staff noticed she looked a few years younger. \"Alright I'll get straight to it. Gemma is coming for a visit.\" She said to everyone, eliciting a series of groans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That explains why Steven is now getting his brains fucked out as Carly now instead of strutting around as Gemma.\" Aaron spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush!\" Natalie scowled at Aaron, putting a finger to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes well, as you know Gemma doesn't know about the medallion, and I don't want her to know. So NOBODY can wear her form while she's here, including our assistant supervisor over here.\" Emma said, bringing everyone's attention back to Steven, who started blushing a little and he lowered his pretty new head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't Gemma going to wonder why we suddenly have a beautician working here?\" Jessica asked, raising her hand slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can get around that easy enough. Carly could just be visiting, as you see Steven isn't in uniform.\" Liz announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe staff all nodded, mumbling amongst themselves for a moment. Then Charlotte spoke up next. \"But Liz, you're wearing Elizabeth's body, won't you have to turn back into yourself too since Gemma knows that she she doesn't work here anymore?\" She inquired, causing Emma and Liz to look at each other and smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma took up the mantle again. \"Well, that brings us to another matter me and Liz have been discussing.\" The manager said, as her eyes eagerly surveyed the assembled team members before her. Natalie looked at Steven to see if he knew what Emma was going to say, but he just shrugged his slender shoulders while straightening his bra strap under the red tank top he had on.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had to kick off her shoes before her growing feet burst through them. Her hair began to retreat into her scalp as she watched Nathan's hair begin to grow out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma felt her mature breasts suck into her chest, her mature snatch grew out into a virile young dick and balls, still sporting the very erection Nathan had only moments earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan gasped as his dick was sucked into his body and replaced with a well worn, stretch-marked pussy which had given birth many years before. His flat chest was replaced with a pair of mature, slightly sagging, but still very sexy pair of C-cup breasts. As his hips grew out and Emma's narrowed, the swap was completed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god I'm a fucking MILF!\" Nathan cried out in his mature, feminine voice as he walked over to the mirror, nearly tripping over his own clothes, which were now oversized. He began to examine his reflection, touching his mature face first, then groaning as he reached under his oversized polo shirt, giving his mature tits a firm squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit! These feel so fucking good!\" He groaned, his new eyes practically rolling into the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan was about to reach into his underwear and stick a finger in his now soaking wet pussy, but Liz grabbed his wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now Nathan, Gemma will be here any minute! You and Emma need to swap clothes!\" Liz giggled at the frustrated young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma meanwhile was grunting in discomfort. She immediately regretted not stripping off before the swap. Her raging hard on and testicles were being crushed by her knickers and slacks that were now way too tight, along with the rest of her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nathan began to strip, and Emma began to struggle out of her own clothes, Liz turned to Charlotte with a wicked grin. \"Your turn bitch!\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Liz started unzipping the skirt she was wearing and letting it drop to her ankles, Emma couldn't help but admire her... or rather Elizabeth's svelte figure. The manager's new cock pulsed and hardened further as she also watched Nathan getting dressed in her clothes. \"I never thought I'd see you in a skirt, Liz.\" Emma joked, as she also supervised Charlotte very slowly undressing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, well, I never had the legs to wear a skirt before now.\" Liz answered. \"I mean, my own legs are not too bad, but not skirt material, as Charlotte here will find out shortly.\" She giggled. Liz couldn't help but look at Charlotte's legs as she took off her work trousers, socks and flats. Charlotte's legs were long yet shapely, and her size 5 feet were perfect, in Liz's opinion, smaller than her own size 7 feet. Liz couldn't wait until they were all hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll need this luv.\" Emma tossed the medallion to Liz, who caught it in her manicured hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. I certainly will.\" Liz smiled, putting the medallion around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this.\" Emma said, picking Charlotte's work shirt up off the floor and feeling it. \"Ooh, it's still warm.\" She said in her deep voice, before tossing the shirt to Liz too. As soon as a part of the shirt hit the medallion, the transformation began. Liz felt herself growing taller, her legs stretching out, her breasts remained roughly the same size but perked up significantly, her ass too didn't shift too drastically as Charlotte and Elizabeth were similar in many respects. She watched her arms lengthen slightly and her hair began cascading down around her shoulders as it turned dark. Finally, her pussy regressed almost 10 years in age, her pubic hair shifted to dark brown also, and then her face shifted into Charlotte's features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, wow, that never gets old.\" Liz giggled, now in Charlotte's voice as she began feeling herself up. \"Nice boobs, nice and perky just like Elizabeth's.\" She added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Charlotte had grown increasingly uncomfortable having watched Liz morph from Elizabeth into her image. She remained silent, as Nathan continued feeling himself up in the corner in Emma's body and Emma herself rubbed her throbbing cock through her trousers. She had to stand there, naked, and watch Liz get dressed in her underwear, work clothes and ballet flats, and then came the worst part, as far as she was personally concerned. \"Here, put it on.\" Liz told Charlotte, dropping the medallion in her hands. Charlotte reluctantly did as told, then watched as Liz strutted over to the coat hooks, where she had one of her blouses still hung from before she had turned into Elizabeth. She smirked, then threw it to Charlotte, who caught it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte immediately caught a scent of Liz's familiar <i>Impulse</i> body spray on the blouse, and she gulped before touching it to the medallion around her neck. \"Old hag indeed.\" Liz repeated, scowling a little at Charlotte as she watched her begin her morph from a 25 year old woman into a 38 year old woman. \"38 is not old, Charlotte, as you'll discover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean you, I meant Emma.\" Charlotte blurted out a response, as she felt herself shrinking in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" Emma grunted in Nathan's former voice, folding her arms across her toned chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just... oh this feels weird.\" Charlotte mumbled, as she felt her feet growing slightly larger, her legs becoming more 'average' and definitely fuller at the thighs, her ass expanded and her hips did the same as her pussy progressed in age, gaining the stretch marks Liz had got from giving birth to Ethan. The other changes didn't feel too bizarre, except for one, her chest. Charlotte let out a gasp, still in her own voice at that time, as her perky breasts began expanding. The fleshy globes grew larger and larger on her chest, pulling her forward as she also saw her areolas enlarge and her nipples stick out a bit more. \"Oh shit no....\" Charlotte exclaimed, Liz's voice now leaving her lips as her tits finally finished growing at a size 30H.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go. How do my boobs feel? They pulling on your back yet?\" Liz giggled as she put her new hair up into Charlotte's familiar bun style. \"I'm sure one of the other guys would have loved playing with them, but, well... here you are. All because you couldn't keep your bitchy mouth shut.\" She said, as Charlotte handed the medallion back over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rest of my clothes are over there, so get dressed!\" Liz ordered Charlotte in her own voice. \"And when Gemma arrives, you and Nathan had better be the best Liz and Emma you possibly can be. Or else.\" She warned in no uncertain terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA distraught Charlotte maneuvered her new body across the office, her big tits swaying and jiggling with each step as she brushed Liz's long light brown hair behind her ears. The first thing she put on, was the bra, to at least give her some support and comfort. The rest of the clothes soon followed, as did a hair scrunchie, and before long a new \"Liz\" was stood alongside the new \"Emma\". And \"Charlotte\" and \"Nathan\" were stood grinning, the latter massaging 'his' cock through 'his' pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you two stay in this office, and wait for Gemma to turn up. And do not blow this, otherwise we'll turn you both into babies next time.\" Emma told Nathan and Charlotte, who just nodded, sitting down behind their respective desks. \"And try not to masturbate while Gemma is here.\" She added, looking at Nathan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Emma and Liz left the office in their new bodies, being sure to take the medallion with them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She then pressed her groin up against Emma's new dick and start to dry hump the unsuspecting, but horny manager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Liz finally pulled her tongue out of Emma's mouth she spoke up \"Holy shit. I'm so fucking horny! I don't know if it's Charlotte's libido, or if it's just the fact that we're being so devious! Christ this... this might actually be my perfect body. Even better than Elizabeth's. I feel so tall, so young, these tits are so perky... Holy shit, Eric is going to love this when I get home tonight!\" Liz finally finished with a giddy, youthful energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma smiled with her youthful, male face and replied \"Maybe... Maybe we should fuck? I've never had a dick before and I can't exactly go down to the shop floor with this!\" Emma giggled, sounding strange in her new voice as she pointed to the raging hard-on in her trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz didn't need to be asked twice, she grabbed Emma by the wrist and led her to the women's toilets. Once inside they locked themselves away in one of the stalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning Liz pulled Emma's trousers and boxers down, dropped down to her knees and took Emma's brand new dick deep into her sexy young mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuuuuuck! This is why guys always ask for this...\" Emma groaned in bliss, her deep groans still carrying some of her own feminine inflections. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A blowjob just felt so amazing she couldn't get over it, she indeed did know why men were such fans of getting their cocks sucked. And Liz, in Charlotte's younger body was already a slut, unable to control her sex drive. \"Holy shit Liz... hphmpph... oh yeah...\" Emma groaned again in Nathan's voice, her handsome young face scrunching up in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz just made some muffled sounds while she moved her head back and forth, taking the full length of Emma's shaft into her mouth. She was sure Charlotte had never given head like this before, but then... neither had she. Any thoughts of her husband Eric were slowly escaping her head as she continued giving her manager a blowjob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma's expression of pleasure increased as she felt an unfamiliar... yet familiar sensation building in her loins. She knew it was an approaching orgasm, but it was different to her normal ones as a woman. Her balls started tingling slightly, and just as Liz swallowed her cock again, it spasmed and erupted... coating the back of Liz's new throat with several ropes of hot semen. \"FUUUUUCK!\" The manager moaned as she shot her load into her subordinate's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz swallowed every last drop and then looked up and grinned at Emma, flashing Charlotte's best toothy grin. \"Hmm, salty goodness.\" She joked, wiping her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, that felt so good.\" Emma smiled, coming down from her high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad it did. But next time we have proper sex, I'm eager to test out my new vagina.\" Liz giggled in Charlotte's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed!\" Emma nodded, tucking her dick back in her pants and zipping them up.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Keep it quiet, but I turned Kyle into a copy of Kiran months ago. Just as a joke, he was furious at first, but now he refuses to change back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz gasped in shock and arousal \"Oh my god... so you've been having lesbian sex with Kyle. Him as Kiran and you as Natasha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma sighed blissfully \"Oh god it's been so kinky! I thought I'd grown out of my bi-curios tendancies when I was much younger. But having Kyle in that sexy, tiny little body of Kiran's is so hot. I can just totally dominate him! And he's going to be in for a hell of a shock tonight when I come home in this stud of a body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two giggled like a pair of naughty school girls, Emma sounding and looking particularly out of place in Nathan's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what about your daughters? How are they taking it with mum and dad transformed into different bodies?\" Liz asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma replied smiling \"They think it's pretty cool. Especially as we let them use the medallion... it's worked out pretty well as they're only allowed to use it if they've done their homework. Right now the girls have transformed into each other. So what about you Liz? How are Ethan and Eric taking your transformation into Elizabeth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz smiled \"Well Ethan thinks he has a magic transforming mummy. And he can see I'm much happier. Eric absolutely loves Elizabeth's body. I can tell you he's going to love Charlotte's even more. I doubt he'll let me change back into myself or even Elizabeth.\" Liz finished with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wicked smirk grew across Emma's handsome face \"Why don't you tell Eric to pop in tonight when he comes to pick you up. You could transform him into a total stud. Or maybe into a total babe if you want to... experiment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz put her hand on her chin and pondered for a few seconds before the pair carried on down the stairs and made there way to the shop floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as they came down, they saw Gemma arrive through the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look! The bitch has arrived!\" Emma giggled as she pointed Gemma out to Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God she always looks like she has a stick up her arse. Why does she take herself so seriously?\" Liz groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's not our problem today is it!\" Emma giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right.

I can hear someone walking down the hall. It's probably Gemma!\" Charlotte said with a slight tone of panic in her, or rather Liz's voice. Charlotte looked down at her own gigantic tits. She absolutely hated them, they kept getting in the way and they were putting a terrible strain on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan blushed and stopped playing with his tits.

If he still had a dick, he'd have an erection right now, but he was thankful that it was much easier to hide his arousal with his new mature snatch, which he could feel growing ever damper between his sexy mature legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte gave Nathan a subtle elbow to prompt him into action and break him out of his trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, h...

Heck, even in your old body, I don't think you're successful enough for a snob like her!\" Charlotte said sternly as Nathan boiled the kettle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan pouted in frustration, causing Charlotte to roll her eyes once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to fuck her so bad, why don't you just wait for Steven to transform into her again.

That's a great idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte just put her palm on her face and shook her head in despair, before grabbing three mugs from the cupboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you could just act a little bit more like Emma... not too much like Emma, she hates Gemma. What I'm trying to say is don't fuck this up! I am not staying in this gross old body of Liz's.

True, she had promised she'd have sex with Emma later, but that didn't mean she couldn't fool around first with somebody other than her boss. And the assistant manager-in-disguise's eyes soon fell upon Ryan. A horny teenager who Liz could manipulate, is nothing else by using her position of authority over him. \"Hi Ryan!\" Liz grinned, twirling a lock of Charlotte's former hair around her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Charlo... um... Liz, right?\" Ryan responded, somewhat sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the flesh! Just not my own.\" Liz giggled. \"I feel so invigorated in Charlotte's body, which isn't surprising, I mean I am 13 years younger now. And I am so incredibly horny.\" She purred, more of less making her intentions known from the start. She knew Ryan had a girlfriend, but what she wouldn't know wouldn't hurt her. \"Lets go have a little fun in Goods In.\" She whispered into Ryan's ear as she got real close to him and caused his cock to harden in his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think we should be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make me order you boy!\" Liz suddenly said, while maintaining her flirty grin. \"I'm still your superior, remember that. Never mind whose body I'm wearing.\" She warned him. \"Now follow!\" She clicked her fingers, and Ryan obediently followed. \"Don't worry, we're not having actual sex, I'm saving myself for someone else.\" She then reassured him, making him feel a little better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later Liz pushed the door open to Goods In and her eyes widened when she saw Emma with her trousers down and Claire was eagerly sucking on her exposed cock. Claire immediately coughed and pulled her mouth off Emma's shaft, before looking over at Liz and Ryan. \"Oh no...\" She sputtered, as she straightened her glasses on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't let us stop you.\" Liz said, flashing the pair another of Charlotte's toothy smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get back to it girl!\" Emma commanded Claire, who smiled nervously before slipping her manager's cock back into her mouth. Emma just moaned in pleasure as her employee did this.

Let's take a 15 minute break.\" Gemma suggested with a smile on her face. She was pleasantly surprised with \"Emma's\" behaviour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on EMMA. Let's get to the kitchen and make some more coffee!\" Charlotte said, grabbing Nathan by the wrist and dragging him out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the transformed pair made it to the kitchen Nathan spoke up \"Charlotte, could you cover for me for a few minutes. I'm so horny. My knickers are soaked through. I need to go to the bathroom and... Erm... You know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christ. I don't want to know. But you'd better do something to clear your head. You're like lost puppy dog when Gemma is around. If you don't calm down, she might suspect something!\" Charlotte said, panicking a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The clicking noise his new shoes made on the floor and the jiggling of his new tits on his chest reminded him he was a woman now, on the outside at least. And a sexy mature woman at that. He changed direction and headed towards the ladies toilets, bumping into Jessica who was just exiting. The ginger-haired employee was a couple of inches taller than Nathan in her stiletto ankle boots, and she smiled at Nathan as he approached. \"Oh... hey Emma... er... Nathan.\" She greeted him, remembering it was her co-worker in her boss's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, hi, excuse me.\" Nathan responded in his now female voice as he tried to push past Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't you be going in the gents toilets?\" Jessica asked, raising an eyebrow. \"I mean I know you're in Emma's body now, but you're still a guy and I for one don't feel comfortable with you in the ladies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remember Gemma is here right? If she catches me coming out of the gents toilets, how do I explain that one?\" Nathan responded with a scowl, looking slightly up into Jessica's face. \"And besides, you don't have anything I don't have now. If I want to see a pussy, I have my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, I suppose. Well I'm done in there anyway for now, but some of the other girls will no doubt be up soon, so whatever perverted behavior you've got planned, make it quick.\" Jessica said in a snarky attitude, before sashaying off, her heels clicking sexily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prissy bitch!\" Nathan grumbled, before pushing open the door to the toilets and going inside. Once in there, he went into the first of the three empty stalls and locked the door. He hadn't been lying to Charlotte, his knickers were soaked due to his arousal in Emma's body, and he needed to get himself off. Charlotte could deal with Gemma for now, he figured it would be for the best anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh... fuck!\" Nathan moaned as he slipped a couple of his dainty fingers into his 42-year old snatch. \"Oh wow... this is heaven!\" He gasped in his manager's sexy voice as he also started thinking about Gemma again. This was gonna be a wild ride.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Several of the characters will disappear and some new ones will be introduced. Story plots can take place outside of Wilko of course, as long as at least some of the story's characters are used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Wilko Employees:</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Emma</b>, 47, is the manager of the store and is in good shape for her age. She is 5'4\" tall, has long dark brown hair just past her shoulders and C-cup breasts. She's friendly, polite and helpful, and most of the staff agree she is a good manager. At work she wears a short-sleeved white blouse, a pair of black, womens' trousers and a pair of black, 2-inch heeled t-bar shoes. She's married to Kyle, 45, has a biological daughter, Alice, 17, and an adopted daughter Grace, 14, both with long, dark brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Liz</b>, 38, is now the assistant manager of the store following Elizabeth's departure to run her own store in Crystal Peaks, Sheffield. Liz is 5'4\" tall, her light brown hair is long, past her shoulders and she wears it in a ponytail nearly all of the time. She has size 30H-cup breasts, average curves and an ample backside. At work, due to her new position and her dislike of skirts, she is required to wear a black trouser suit, a white blouse and a pair of <i>Prada</i> black leather high heel loafers that boost her height to 5'7\". Liz is married to her much older husband Eric, 53, and has a five-year old son, Ethan (via artificial insemination). Eric has a son, Reece, 28, and a daughter, Courtney, 22, from his previous marriage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Natalie</b>, 34, is now the staff supervisor following Liz's promotion. She is a fairly attractive woman with long, straight brown hair, she stands 5'6\" tall and is quite slender, she has a modest backside and C-cup breasts. Not overly curvy, she is still very pleasing to the eye. At work she wears her Wilko polo, black slacks and some comfortable flats. Natalie is married to her husband Mike, 35, and is the mother of a young son, Harry, who is now almost four years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Steven</b>, 41, is now the assistant supervisor, having been persuaded to take on the role by Liz. He is the second oldest male employee, he is 6'0\" tall, he wears glasses is average looking and has very short, brown hair. He used to keep to himself but his new position in store has forced him to engage with people more. He does like and get along with his co-workers. Steven wears comfortable black boots or shoes along with his black trousers and Wilko polo shirt. Steven still has not entered into a relationship with anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Gemma</b>, 31, is still the HR Rep who regularly visits the store. She is 5'4\", very attractive, has straight, blonde hair just down to her shoulders, C-cup breasts and a nice figure. Wears stylish, feminine clothes, including a pair of black, round-toe pumps with 3-inch heels for a height boost. She is currently in a relationship with her new boyfriend Jason, 27. Gemma is intelligent and confident and can be sharp with people if she's irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Caleb</b>, 32, is the security guard in Wilko. He is well built but not overly muscular, has a shaved head but his hair is normally black when he starts growing it. While at work he wears black trousers, a white security shirt with the logo of his security firm sewn on the pocket and a pair black leather boots. Born in Petah Tikva, Israel, he is a secular Jew and moved to England when he was 25 and soon found employment in security due to his special forces skills from being in the Israeli army. Caleb has a blonde wife, Esther, and two young daughters, Leah, 12, and Maya, 10.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>John</b>, 42, is Wilko's janitor. He's 5'11\" and has a decent build, but a bit of a pudgy gut. He is the oldest male employee, has short, balding brown hair and a trimmed beard/mustache. At work, he wears dark blue coveralls with a black t-shirt underneath as well as a pair of black work boots. John is generally a friendly man and gets along well with the rest of the Wilko staff. He's married to his wife Amanda, 40, and they have two kids, Brendon, 15, and Melody, 13.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Sasha</b>, 25, is the new cosmetics salesperson in the store. She is an attractive woman with raven black hair that she wears in a bob style. Standing 5'3 tall, she has a nice figure, a sexy ass, nice D-cup breasts and wears either a skirt suit or trouser suit to work, along with a white blouse and a pair of black suede, 3-inch stiletto pumps that boost her height to 5'6\". She is engaged to her boyrfriend Isaac, 27, but they have any kids yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Aaron</b>, 33, he is about 5'10\" tall, and he's got himself back in shape at the gym after letting his physique go for a while. He is still a heavy smoker, and sometimes smokes weed. He's calmed down over the years but can still get angry if provoked, and he sometimes refrains from speaking to anyone. Usually wears black sneakers along with his usual black trousers and company polo. Aaron has a chubby girlfriend called Sue and they now have a young daughter named Kirsty who is nearly three years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Becca</b>, 30, still the chattiest worker in the store, standing about 5'5\". She is still a bit on the chubby side, which has made her ass a little bigger also, and her breasts are a C-cup. Her goth phase is way behind her and her hair is back to it's natural brown color. She now wears normal black slacks instead of jeans and either black sneakers or leather flats. Despite her minor weight gain, Becca is single again after splitting up with her boyfriend a year ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Luke</b>, 27, a tall individual at 6'2\" in height, has a short, dark brown crewcut hairstyle and is quite handsome and fit. He is popular and easy going, always one to have a laugh with his friends. He wears a red company shirt, black pants and smart, dress shoes. Used to have a crush on Rebekah but it went away some time after he hooked up with his girlfriend Rachel, 26, whom he is now engaged to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mark</b>, 29, standing 6'1\" tall, he is somewhat gangly and has short black hair in a crewcut. He has average looks, but is good natured and surprisingly he is still engaged to an attractive girlfriend named Vicky, who is 25 years old. They can't agree on their marriage date. The usual red company shirt is accompanied by Mark's black trousers and his black sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rebekah</b>, 25, one of the friendliest and prettiest staff members, very attractive woman, shapely figure, about 5'5\" tall, long blonde hair, B-Cup breasts. She's slowly matured over the last few years and now looks much sexier. Very warm personality. She's currently single after breaking up with her Spanish boyfriend six months ago, but there is no shortage of male interest in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Laura</b>, 24, not so shy anymore, but still quiet, and she is Rebekah's best friend. Standing 5'5\" tall, she also wears her dark blonde hair in a plait style or a ponytail at work, and wears the trademark company polo shirt, black, boot-cut trousers, black tights underneath and a pair of sensible black flats. This delightful individual has perky B-Cup breasts and is quite attractive. She is still dating her good looking boyfriend, Dylan, 24.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mona</b>, 25, a pretty Iranian-born Muslim girl, about 5'4\" in height, B-cup breasts, black hair (she does not wear a headscarf, unlike her mother), she wears contacts (or glasses), has perky breasts and as well as the usual company top, she wears black trousers or jeans and either a pair of ballet flats or dark sneakers. Wears a necklace with an Islamic crescent hanging from it. She has now been married to a family friend, Ahmad, 28, for over 12 months. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Charlotte</b>, a 25-year old woman who has tried to change her behavior for the better over the last couple of years. Her co-workers have noticed an improvement in her attitude towards others, but she still finds herself easily irritated by some people she meets. And she is still more than capable of holding a grudge. Charlotte is the second tallest woman in the store at 5'9\" tall, wears her dark hair in whatever style she fancies on the day. She also has B-Cup breasts. She wears black pants/leggings and either black flats or purple plimsolls. Charlotte is still dating a boy she met in college, Jacob, 22.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jade</b>, 25 years old, she has long auburn hair, which she nearly always wears down, but occasionally in a messy bun. Jade is 5'7\" and is also on the slender side, but what sticks out about Jade most is her piercings and several tattoos. She is usually dressed in the company polo, a pair of tight womens' pants and black lace-up shoes. Jade is not a very chatty girl, and she's into rock music and some metal bands. Jade has shown no apparent interest in romantic relationships.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rob</b>, 24, a slender guy with short black hair, 5'9\" tall, decent looks. He knows how to have a laugh and is a decent worker. Though he is known to slack off if those around him are doing the same. Wears black trousers and black sneakers as well as his Wilko polo. Rob has a 'casual' girlfriend, a cute 5'4\" brunette named Stacey, age 22.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Liam</b>, 23, still the worst employee at Wilko as far as work rate and personality are concerned. Liam is 5'8\" and has now cut his brown hair short. Certainly not ugly but not male model material either. His work rate has improved slightly, but only since Liz was promoted to assistant manager. He's still not very popular with the other staff because of his lax attitude. He wears his company shirt, normal black trousers and a pair of black boots or sneakers. Liam still has no girlfriend, unsurprisingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Kiran</b>, 22, is a very petite young woman, the shortest employee at 5'0\" tall, and has long, dyed black hair, mostly worn down but occasionally in a ponytail. She's very pretty and has a nice figure, along with perky B-cup breasts. She also has an outgoing personality. Likes to wear stylish black slacks and ballet flats when she's working. Kiran is still with her boyfriend, Sean, 21.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jessica</b>, 28, is an attractive, curvy red-head, 5'5\" tall and has C-cup breasts. She's outgoing, polite and acts very \"girly\", and with her red Wilko blouse/polo shirt and black trousers she also wears either a pair of black high heel ankle boots or stiletto pumps. She wears her ginger hair in a ponytail and she still has no interest in finding a boyfriend. Jessica is also heavily into environmentalism and donates to charities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Michael</b>, 26, is a tall, broad shouldered employee with short, neatly-combed dark hair. He's about 6'1\" tall, has kind of a smug personality and isn't a stranger to skipping work whenever he can get away with it. Though he isn't as bad as certain others are at slacking. Michael wears a Wilko formal shirt instead of a polo shirt, black pants and smart black shoes. Michael is still engaged to his girlfriend Amy, 23.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jodie</b>, 24, is a redheaded young woman with freckles, she stands 5'4\" tall and either wears her hair down or in a ponytail while she works. She has C-cup breasts and she wears the usual Wilko blouse/polo shirt, black trousers, socks and a pair of well-worn flats. She seems to be the quiet sort, not known to smile a lot, and is the mother of a two-year old son, Oliver, whose father wants nothing to do with him or Jodie following a family feud. Because of stress she suffers from, she smokes cigarettes but she is trying to quit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ellie</b>, 23, a 5'3\", friendly woman with light brown hair reaching to halfway down her back. She has a full figure but is not chubby, she also has perky C-cup breasts and a nice big ass which comes close to Becca's in size. She wears black slacks and black suede slip-on shoes with her company polo shirt. Ellie is now dating a guy named Aiden, 24, having met him eight months ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Darrell</b>, 28, is a half-caste employee who was born in London, has a white mother and black father. He is one of the tallest individuals in the store at 6'2\", is good looking, has a buzz cut, and is the most muscular of all the male employees. He wears the Wilko polo shirt, black trousers and Nike sneakers. Darrell has a black girlfriend, Alisha, 24, and they too are now engaged to be married.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Claire</b>, 22, is one of the store's more diligent workers. She stands at 5'10\", making her the tallest girl at Wilko, ahead of Charlotte, and is very slender, lacking any noticeable curves. She has small A-cup boobs and a boyish ass, she has cropped, dark red hair and she wears designer glasses. She's a timid girl, but also friendly and chatty when engaged in conversation. Claire recently came out as a lesbian to her co-workers, but this really didn't surprise anybody. Despite coming out, her colleagues still don't know if she has had a girlfriend in the past or remains a virgin, and she hasn't shown any inkling of being willing to share such personal information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Emily</b>, 23, is 5'5\", pretty, has a decent figure and is a quiet, slightly nerdy looking girl, preferring to keep to herself most of the time. She has C-cup breasts, wears dark-rimmed glasses and has long dark hair that she wears up in a ponytail. At work she wears the usual company polo shirt (fleece optional), fairly tight black slacks, black tights underneath and a pair of women's black patent loafers with a slight chunky heel. She still does not have a boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Michelle</b>, 32, is one of the more demure employees. Not the most intelligent person, she is nonetheless a polite, cheerful woman with straight brown hair that she wears down at work. She is 5'5\" tall, pretty and has a decent figure and C-cup breasts. At work she wears the usual Wilko polo, tight black slacks and some black suede flats. Michelle is married to her husband Jonathan, 33, but has no kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Kelly</b>, 37, another of the older employees. She's an outgoing woman, 5'6\" tall, also has a nice figure and a pair of breasts just into a D-cup, she has ash blonde hair that she wears up in a bun style while working.

He has a 5'10\" boyfriend named Christopher, 29, who works as a drama teacher at a local high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Alex</b>, 24, is an employee of Chinese descent, but he has lived in England his whole life. A somewhat awkwardly social individual, Alex spends a lot of time on his own, but can work well enough as part of a group, as his job often calls for. He is 5'7\" tall, has black shaggy hair, wears glasses and has an average body type for someone his stature. Likes to wear black jeans and black &amp; white converse sneakers with his Wilko attire. Alex has a girlfriend, Li Yan, 22, a family friend, who is just as socially awkward as he is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Luis</b>, 22, is of Dominican descent, his parents also having moved to the England when he was little.
